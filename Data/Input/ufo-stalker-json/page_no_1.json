was awoken in the middle of the night at about 3 or 4am. the room was still dark but there was a slight glow to the room. i was half conscious and gradually regained more awareness with my eyes fully opened. my body was completely paralyzed but i was fighting and screaming at the entities in the room. i used every strength i had to fight them reaching my hands out and screaming what i thought was aloud but was telepathic. my body lost all functioning and i couldn't even open my mouth to scream but i did mentally as loud as i possibly could. i knew they heard every word i screamed at them. i fought them with all the energy i could. i told them they have no authority to touch me or take anything from me. that i had my free will and they were not permitted to do anything to me.\r\ni felt them put more energetic force on me and i began to get more and more tired unable to stop them and felt i couldn't fight them any longer and to just give up. i heard in my mind to just give up that i could not fight them. i felt like they were taking my baby from me. i had not had my period in 2 and a half months and i felt i was pregnant but was not completely sure because of my age 47 i felt it could be premenopausal symptoms aswell. i had an appointment with my dr 2 days after this incident to check whether i was pregnant. my tests showed negative 2 days later. i eventually tired and felt myself sinking deeper into unconsciousness. i saw more than one being in the room. i heard in my mind that they are greys. there was one very tall figure about 6 or 7 feet tall not completely sure as i was lying down. he was wearing a robe like dressing and he had 2 distinct protrusions on his large skull and forehead. he seems to have authority over the matter. there were more beings in the room smaller than the larger one. not sure how many but i feel there were at least 2 more. i remember i really hated the taller one as he seemed to have no care for what he was doing to me and what could have possibly been a small embryo of mine. i don't know if they impregnated me or if i was pregnant with my partner and they took the small fetus from us? i don't know if i was even pregnant for sure it was just a feeling and what i was screaming out to them in the middle of the night. i very quickly fell deep asleep and the next day i felt it was a horrible nightmare that my eyes where fully opened to see what i saw. but i knew very well this was a familiar feeling to me as in 1996 i had another similar experience with 2 small greys in the middle of the night when they temporarily paralyzed me and shoved something up my nose. at that time i thought it might have been a terrifying nightmare but over the years i was shown footage of abduction accounts and realized they were very similar to my own experience and began to realize that those experiences were as real as they felt.\r\n\r\na couple days after this incident took place i had the intuition to check my body to see if there was any visible evidence from my experience. so just before i had a shower i had a look around my body and then i noticed an indentation on my mid back right side just along my spine. it felt like a hole in my back with a layer of skin on top. it was something very unusual and an unlikely thing to find on your back. i feel some discomfort from it and it feels like a wound as though it is in the process of healing. it's like a piece of tissue beside my spine has been taken. i feel a metallic feel around it and it's slightly sensitive when i move or twist my back.\r\ni asked my mother to take a picture of it as it is such an unusual thing to have on my body never seen before and it has a slight triangular red shape over the surface.\r\n\r\ni felt a lot of anger from this experience. that i did not agree or give my permission to do what ever it is they are doing. i had to learn to just let it go and to not allow fear or anger to over take me. i do feel some fear going to bed now and have noticed i am going to bed a lot later staying up until 2am. my partner is away a lot so i am sleeping alone most nights. i wonder if he had been there sleeping beside me if these beings would have come?\r\n\r\ni'm trying to have positive thoughts that maybe whatever these beings are doing to experiment with our dna or embryos is for some greater good. i really hope so anyways!!\r\ni have asked for a lot of protection around me. i have been fortunate to have had positive encounters with other ets and have seen dozens of ufo sightings. i've had other encounters and have picture's of markings from an encounter in march 17, 2011 of which i took a sample of and is in my freezer. \r\n\r\nthis last experience was not at all good and i wonder if they truly were ets or government posing as ets? i'd love to go under hypnosis to know the truth.\r\nand for a doctor or specialists who is familiar with these type of extractions from the body to have a look at the indentation on my back.\r\nthanks for listening. i hope one day we will get more answers to what all these experiences mean.

north west at the clear, not quite dusk, evening sky. it was still light enough to read. a fireball appeared brightest right away like a light turning on. it had a mini tail like a newly hatched tadpole, it burned clean and pure whitish with a trace of yellow, like plasma as opposed to littered with debris of varying colors. the brightness diminished in a continuously lessening, linear fashion, then brightened at the end with one piece 10% the size of the whole, breaking off and, from my perspective, accelerating ahead of, and lower than, the main body…then click, turn the light off. it lasted 4 seconds.\r\nagain from my perspective in the village of oak creek, az, it first appeared about 35 degrees above the horizon on a heading of 292. it ended about 15 degrees above the horizon at 338 degrees. it traveled in a straight line with no arc so i believe it was close yet i didn't hear a sound. thinking back, there may have been a slight arc as i got a sense that it was moving slightly away from my location. since it went from west to east and didn’t trail a debris field, i’m guessing it was space junk. i watched the area for 1 minute and no other debris appeared in my field of view.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

was walking to school in the fall of 2005, the same route i took everyday for years. i left my house on foot and turned onto a street facing west. it was between 7:00-7:10am and the pink in the eastern sky had just dissipated. it was a still, silent morning, there were no clouds and the sky was a dull light-blue. the street i turned onto was a long one with no obstructions or buildings blocking the sky. as soon as i turned the corner to head west, i noticed a bright white star in the sky. it immediately caught my attention, and my first thought was it must be venus, or some planet that is occasionally visible like jupiter or mercury. it was as bright as any normal bright star you'd see in a night sky, and was plainly visible against the palish blue sky of that day. i would not describe it as having any glow or aura, it was only a white dot. i had no astronomical knowledge and had never spotted a planet in the sky before, so i was very pleased to keep looking at it as i walked forward as it was very novel. about 5 more steps, just a few seconds after i first noticed it, it moved to the right and i immediately stopped walking. i felt like as soon as it moved i froze. i watched it move slowly to the right just 3-4 widths of itself, then back to the left 3-4 widths, then do what i would call a small clockwise circle, then move to the right 3-4 more widths and keep this trajectory until it faded out fairly quickly. the movement was very deliberate and smooth and it absolutely changed directions, though it kept to a small radius. after it faded out there were zero traces of the object. i kept staring at the sky for a couple more minutes stunned without moving. noticing the object and then watching it move took no longer than 1 minute from start to finish. i started walking toward the school again keeping my eyes fixed on the sky but it never returned. the appearance of the object was mundane and i wouldn't have given it a second thought if it stayed still, but the movement of it i will never forget.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path

since the flightline for philly airport we are in has almost everything going east-west.\r\nit was low, much lower than a plane and less than a mile from me. i pointed it out to my wife and we watched as it moved slowly from north to just southeast of us and then it went from very bright white to a dull orange and disappeared. we watched it for about 4 or 5 minutes and then it was just gone in a pitch bl;ack sky with no cloud cover. at that altitude, it was really moving so slowly that a plane might have stalled, but then i have never seen a plane glow so brightly unless the landing lights were pointing straight at you. this was moving perpendicular to us. it had no flashing lights, made no sound whatsoever and just disappeared completely. moments later, there was about 5 planes that headed right to where it was, though they were at about 2-3000 feet and the object could not have been more than 1000 feet. that was also weird, since that is not the normal flightline at all, and then a helicopter came down the same line as the object. the activity looked like they were searching, since there is never activity like this at all from the planes either. i stand outside at night quite a bit having a cigar, looking at the night sky since there is very little light pollution and if you watch closely enough you can see a satellite once in a while.\r\n\r\nabout 4 months ago we saw something like this nearby. it was 5 object, exactly as bright traveling in a v. it was about 2 miles from our house on the other side of a hill due north of us. those also flew along and one by one turned orange and disappeared. both times the objects stood out since there isn't anything like them that i have ever seen before. \r\nthankfully, my wife saw both events with me so i don't sound like a lunatic in my own home.\r\n\r\nat this rate it should happen again, and i'll spend time getting video on my phone instead of looking for flashing lights.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

approximately 8:20 pm on saturday, 17 march. it was dark as there was a low cloud cover (due to a rain shower). it was a mild evening (approximately 25° celsius 0r 77° fahrenheit) at the time i had the sighting. i went outside as i had noticed that there was a light rain shower which was unusual as it’s been a very hot day and a long period of dry weather. i called for my father to come out side and check out the rain. we were outside for a couple of minutes and as we turned to go back inside my father noticed a light the sky.  he asked, what is that? at first i thought it was a plane or an aircraft of some kind but i quickly realized it was stationary in the sky. it was located in a south west direction. from my position, it was 240° on my compass. it was at height of between 10° and 15° from the horizon in the sky.  it's hard to estimate the altitude of the object but it was definitely below the low cloud cover. no other celestial object were visible in the sky. the width of the object was not quite as wide as what the moon would be but there was three lights in a straight line formation. each light flashed individually from the left to the right but you could still see the glowing of the other lights when the lights were flashing. it was hard to make out any shape but the flashing lights were very bright (white like magnesium burning). it stayed for approximately five minutes in the same spot with no noise. it then gradually it moved to the left (or to the south) but away from where we were. it was approximately 210° on the compass where it’s stopped again and it was stationary for another five minutes before it moved away from us (the same original direction) and eventually out of sight. it was very unusual. i estimate the object that we were witnessing was approximately 3 to 4 kilometers from our location. we were perplexed at what we had witnessed. i was not able to capture a photo of the object at the time but i took a picture of the direction we viewed the object from the location we viewed the object the next morning (i drew dots where the object we observed was) - i hope that makes sense? please let me know if you have any questions.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

sudden a very bright light (so bright that it blinded me to look at) that i thought was a big rig with lights on bright. it was coming fast so i pulled on to the shoulder as far as i could. it seemed to stay right behind me..I noticed a strange light all over that seemed to penetrate everything. i could see dust lit in the air in my car etc...With what i would now say was like a blue neon led. then another very bright light came at me from the front and i thought 2 18 wheelers were going to crush me. i began to get very scared my car had died and i was right next to a telephone pole which (began to sink from too much irrigation on the corn field to my right) that is what i thought. as i now was about to get hit from the back and front i grabbed the steering wheel with my left arm and i could see every hair on my arm, the light was so strange i could see right thru my arm hair. then it immediately stood straight up and i began to sweat as i thought i was going to die in the crash. instantly my sweat froze on my arm. period...That was it.\r\nuntil i awoke in nampa about 9 miles away on my bed about 9am. i did not leave the house for 3 or 4 days and did a lot of investigation to find out why i was alive and why i did not get hit...Whom was shining the lights and how i got home with no! as in none! memory of any second from the sweat freezing to waking up. none of what happened to me, where my car was, or how i got home makes any sense!\r\nthe telephone pole was still there the next week...Of course. \r\ni had medical issues afterwards. and still have an unexplained
