marine layer. as it turned i saw the exact same thing trailing behind the lead orb a few miles behind it. then i saw another equally spaced red orb following the second orb and then a forth orb following the third one equally spaced and all at the same speed gradually increasing speed the whole time as they all went into the marine layer. this is the 5th time on 4 years i've seen this exact same red orb on nearly exact same altitude and compass heading from my front yard but never saw 4 of them together before and never this late at night. the marine layer was to the north and east of me so i could not track them visually. the sighting lasted about a minute. they were close enough to see the plasma being affected by the objects speed though. that's when i knew what i was looking at because i've seen it up close many times before tonight. a commercial airliner was flying due west at a slightly higher altitude just reaching the ocean, west of marina del rey and was about a mile south of the objects. the 4 objects remained under the oncoming aircraft's altitude the entire time flying on a flat trajectory heading due east before turning to the north. i tried to record on my

Rue","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Edited ufo video. flashes in the sky pointed out. see description on raw video also on my page. i've seen this thing in multiple states since around 2012 at least. it makes no sound. (the first 4 seconds of the video are stars.) i have an extensive aviation and aerospace background enough to know the differences in airborne craft and their flight peculiarities, if any. this thing follows no linear path and has only one light that shines at irregular intervals at varying intensities. often, the light flashes bright-enough to rival venus or sirius, or perhaps even brighter. i know all about wright-patterson as per roswell, and my gramps used to work there in the 1950's-1980's. if it were a small, kit aircraft, it would have to be low enough to be able to hear, like around 5000' agl. if a small kit aircraft managed to get up to 14000' or higher, air would run thin. maybe the pilot is on oxygen. but at those altitudes the angular separation between each flash is far enough apart, that speed required to be in the following flash position would greatly exceed that of a single-engine prop. there is no reason why some pilot would be up above this backass town in rural ohio with no wingtip navigation (green/red) lights (against faa regulations) flashing a single light in a strange manner. i thought it may be an experimental military craft, or some kind of exercise going on, as often when i see this thing, there is a commercial airliner nearby at cruising altitude (above 18000'). but i have seen these flashes with witnesses who also have seen them multiple times from coast to coast for about the last seven or eight years. i will edit a video of this, also. i suspect that i will be able to film them again soon. like i said, i will try to do this more in the future. this is the first time i have filmed it on hi-def or at all for that matter, and the first time i have ever had a camera good enough to even film anything at night, and i hope to improve my filming skills in the coming nights. i have seen it so many times over the years and made it flash by asking, that i am pretty sure i can get the same result again. my guess is maybe a drone(s), or perhaps it is above the atmosphere (over 100km), which would make it huge. i'm not sure of the altitude. if i had to bet my life on it, i would guess between 20000'-50000' agl, maybe? lastly, there are a few remaining fireflies/lightning bugs in the area. i've been tricked before by perspective regarding ufos, so i am careful to discern this. fireflies do not flash as brightly as the planet venus, or the star, sirius. and i have seen these flashes in the winter months and in parts of the country which do not harbor fireflies. submitted is one edited video and one raw video. while making the edited video, i missed many things, as windows movie maker does not have high def when editing as far as i know. you can see a lot more in the raw video. pay particular attention to the flash at :34, the object appears more than just a single point of light. i did not move the camera at all and the area filmed is roughly the size of a fist at arm's length. several flashes occur simultaneously in different locations. i am hoping mufon will be able to improve the video quality some, as i cannot.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

when i was looking up at the stars and i noticed that these stars looked very different. they looked larger and brighter and flickering very unusually but i thought it was because of the clarity of the sky compared to the smog in la where a person can not see the sky like they can see it in calaveras.  as time has gone by these light have increased in number and slowly have gotten more comfortable with me that now they get very close to me.  these guys come in many different sizes.  some are the size of a pea and others are the size of a baseball and others mush larger.  its strange because as i am looking at one ball or light, at a long distance, as it get closer to me it gets smaller instead of larger, also i notice that they form shapes in the sky.  one minute they form a diamond and the next a triangle and the next minute seems like they are playing races and dumping each other out of the way.   i have been able to wave my hand and call them close to me as well.  they have no sound at all and they flicker with may different colors and they float or glide around me.  its really cool.  recently they formed like a chain or what resembles a pearl necklace and formed this necklace around a large object  that was hovering over some trees.  this event was at a distance but this looked like a ufo to me.  it was very large but i couldn't tell what what shape it was.  then it moved away very quickly. also these lights seem to be able to camouflage themselves. \r\n\r\nin addition to these things i see on a regular bases.  i also so black objects on my property in the bushes looking at me they are short and stocky and scary looking. they have never gotten close to me but they  move in my direction. \r\n\r\nthere are many different experiences i have with the light and the creatures on my property.  people have come over and have seen the lights but say that they could be stars. these light are reluctant to get too close when i have company.  i have taken many pictures but they scatter before i can take a picture but i have gotten a few pics of the light, that i can send you. they are not very good because its so dark out here.  i need a better camera.   i feel like there is a community of these things and they are working on something in the ground around here everyday.  also i have brought this up to people in the area and people urge me not to talk about it, either that or they think im missing a few marbles.  i consider myself to be pretty normal and i don't do drugs and im pretty sure i'm not hallucinating.  so i thought i should share some of my experiences.  if when you look at the photos and you can identify what these lights are please let me know.  \r\nplease contact me anytime.  \r\nthank you.","distance":"20 Feet or
