noticed was in the back ground of a picture i took with my wife my first thought was i got a plane in the picture but when i zoomed in it had the shape of a top and was a light green color. i then began to look at all the pictures i had taken. i have a few more pictures with these green objects that have shape not just a blur. then i looked at some of the first pictures and i found a sequence of three pictures where there is a green object that is in a different position in each picture. the real kicker came when noticed that in one of those pictures there was another object. this object is flat dark grey in color and three white points of light and two red points of light.  it's not a plane!!! i am not a big believer in ufos and i really didn't see any of this with my eyes but what my camera caught i can not just write off and assume i know what it is. i took all of my pictures in raw format and are completely untouched, but i do not wish to openly display any of these pictures until they are seen by someone who can give me an explanation or tell me that they are indeed what i think they are. i am eager to hear back from mufon thanks for

  i was sitting with my back to the building so i’m looking up rte. 13 north towards bristol.  i notice a plane flying towards us from the bristol area and it catches my eye because the light was orange.  i start watching it a little more closely and i realize that yeah, the light really is orange and i don’t see the blinking lights that planes need to have due to faa regulations.  i figure it’s a helicopter.  \r\n\r\nas it’s coming closer i notice another light orange light following behind it, spaced out a good bit, but coming from the same direction and flying on the same flight path.  okay, i figure they’re military planes or something.  so i’m watching these two lights fly our way and they seem to be going up in altitude as they get closer.  they kind of hook a slight right and keep going up…and i notice a third light coming along from the same place on the horizon, on the same flight path, spaced out the same as the first two.  now i’m intrigued so i point it out to the my friends.  as we’re watching, the first light seems to keep going higher…and it disappears kind of over cvs.  now there’s no cloud cover at all in the sky – nothing but stars, but this thing disappears.  and now, another light appears on the horizon – light #4.\r\n\r\nat this point i grab my camera and start taking video.  i have four minutes of video of these lights coming from the same direction, spaced exactly apart, flying on the same path, and disappearing at the same spot.  two of the lights did come from a slightly different direction, seeming to come from behind croydon station apartments, but they disappeared at the same place as the rest.  we counted 11 of these lights by the time all was said and done.\r\n\r\ni can honestly say i’ve never seen anything like it before.  you know i love planes and watch flight patterns and such but i’ve never seen orange lights or so many craft flying in the same flight pattern.  it reminded me of planes taking off from philly international on a busy day…plane up, count to 60, plane up, count to 60, plane up….  the lights disappeared all at the same spot and in the same exact way.  they didn’t go down to a pinpoint, they just kind of were there and then not there.   they made no sound at all.\r\n\r\nso, i don’t know what they were but they weren’t standard planes.  we saw planes in the sky immediately after the event and they all had white headlights and the blue and red blinkers on the wings, they looked nothing like this.  \r\n\r\ni’m *really* glad i had two other people witness this with me to confirm that what i was seeing was unusual.  \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

2013, 2 over the city of val-d'or, where i live, and one over my parents lakeside cottage in the woods in the preissac area which is a 45 minutes drive west from val-d'or.\r\n\r\nmy girlfriend (child/adult alien contactee) who's from the uk arrived in val-d'or from the uk on the 8th of august 2013.\r\n\r\nit was a nice cloudless summer night. we decided to do  ce-5 protocols while doing some star watching as the stars were quite visible around 10pm that night. we were lying on my front lawn, watching satellites moving about in different directions.\r\n\r\nfirst observation:\r\n\r\none small moving white star-like object caught our eye that seemed to be moving over the city of val-d'or,québec. it was moving in a south to north direction.\r\nwe had the habit of speaking to all stellar moving objects. \r\nnext thing that happens is that small light starts to do huge light power ups as it was moving north. it powered up then became small...Powered up and became small..The intensity of the light was quite impressive. it did approx. 5 power ups before becoming small again and continued its course.\r\n\r\nsecond observation:\r\n\r\nwe continued the ce-5 protocols and a few minutes after seeing the poweruping orb, a huge bright orange orb passes over my house from an approx. nw to sw direction. the orb looked as big as the sun from my perspective. it did a non-stop flyby directly over us, gliding silently. it was not moving fast. it was easily a few feat in length. i would say that the elevation was approx. the height of 2-3 telephone poles...So it was very close to us. so the whole thing lasted a few minutes before we could not see it anymore as it was too far away.\r\n\r\nthird observation:\r\n\r\nroughly a week later after seeing my first two orb ships. i decided to go and visit my parents in preissac, québec.\r\nmy parents have a lake-side cottage in the woods. i was alone this time as my girlfriend was out visiting elsewhere. it was around 10pm. i decided to do some ce-5 protocols alone. there were no clouds. so i sat on a patio chair outside in the dark or sometimes walked around the house and sending my voice and thoughts out to space. approx. an hour after doing so i decide to take a quick break and chat with my parents inside the house. as soon as i come back outside, for some reason i decide to raise my head to look at the stars.. at that exact moment i see the same fly-by silent huge orange-lollipop orb gliding ever so silently over me at approx the same elevation as the one in val-d'or. higher than the tree line but not so far up as it as big as the sun again from my perspective.. not small like the orbs you see on youtube. \r\nas soon as i realized what i saw i run back into my parents house and tell my parents to come out quickly. my parents see the orb when it was a bit farther away. please understand that i was in the woods in the middle of nowhere when this happened.\r\n\r\ni just want to say that we are used to seeing the iss space station as we can track it as it moves over val-d'or and we are used to seeing satellites. what i saw was out of the ordinary and new to me.. unlike my girlfriend as she is used to this sort of thing being a contactee and all.\r\nsince then we have been doing more ce-5's and seem to be getting powerups from small lights in orbit moving over us when we speak to them.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

my uncle and aunt. we were sitting in our campsite (m26) at meewasin area, makwa lake provincial park around a fire, it was a clear sky and there were only a few stars just starting to come out. my dad was sitting facing the northern sky when he noticed an orange light, unknown distance away (but appeared to be quite high given it's movement and going behind trees). it was about 40-45 degrees from the horizon, moving in a slight southern arc from north-northwest to north-northeast, total time around 1min. during this time and after there weren't any helicopters, planes or other aircraft noticed. it slowed down at least once during it's movement, and disappeared without warning. there was no noise during it's movement. i first thought it might be a jet far away but the complete lack of noise made me doubt that. i tried in vain to get a picture but my phone's camera couldn't capture it well enough. no one else around the campsite had any other good ideas about what it could have been. when i was trying to get a picture i had to walk out of the campsite into the forest about 40ft, there were a lot of tall pine trees that partially obscured my view.\r\n\r\nabout half hour later, another light appeared, same colour, apparent shape and distance away, following roughly the same path.\r\n\r\nthe following night (sunday, august 10th), around the same time we saw two lights, same colour, apparent shape and distance away, following the same paths as the lights the night before. they were about 5-10 degrees from the horizon away from each other, and still about 40-45 degrees from the horizon altogether. no noise this evening, at least one speed change was observed during each sighting (it appeared to slow down slightly, then speed back up before disappearing from sight).","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

believe they implanted something in my face./ i watch the skies and mufon. i am not a psyche patient. i have seen an alien before but have not told the public just my family. they believe me.  last night a terrific lightening storm came through houston.. my husband saw the show and as an air man remarkexd on its intensity. i was scared. i touched my face and worried about my kids..I coulnt sleep lastnight . i heard something at my backdoor and it juggled the security door. this is the last place i saw an alien. a few months before. i was terrified. i slept when morning came. i got up 2 hours later looked at my phone to discover ufo had been seen very close to my house. 3 different photos of it have been taken and are on the net under cypress perez houston. cyp the hype. he is a long time friend. he reposted what his friends saw and i am here telling you now because i feel an impending doom. \r\n\r\n[names removed/cms/tg] on facebook have pics of this event\r\n\r\n\r\nas a child what happened to me is i went to bed at 3-4  years old woke up outside my house saying i got to go i got to go.. from that point on i was afraid of the star in the sky following me and little blue people. my face hurt really bad and the thing has never gone away. i am feeling the ball in my cheek now. recently when i turned 30 a few years ago i started remembering things.. like being yanked through the sky and aliens working on my shoulder or maybe my heart..Left side behind my shoulder.I have no health problems to speak of and the last time i saw an alien was in april, i think. it was wearing a pink bow like i had been the week before and it dawned on my it was my child. it was a grey type person small body and hairless huge eyes and pale blue or grey with a pink bow. why does this make me want to cry?I want to know what i can do to make these encounters stop effecting me in a negative way. i have a ton of stress because i feel very alone.
