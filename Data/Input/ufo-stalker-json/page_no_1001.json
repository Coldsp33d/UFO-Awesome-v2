lake, arkansas.  i happen to look up and was shocked to see what seemed to me like something right out of a science fiction movie:  right above us there was a slow-moving, gigantic, triangular black mass just slowly passing approx. sw towards hot springs, which is perhaps a mile from the home.  it wasn't too late in the evening, maybe 23:00, 24:00, and it was approx in early november.  there was no noise at all--not even from nature or local noise, save the television.  there was no electrical disruption.  none of us recall there having been lights, which is the first thing i tried to find on the object.  i expected to see tell-tale signs of more human origin, but it was surreal--no lights.  i remember wanting it to be fake deep down inside, but the thing is, it wasn't scary at all.  just surreal.  we all felt like something wasn't right, like reality stopped existing for a moment, but we were still very real.\r\n\r\ni've subsequently, in the last several years, seen movies that have mimicked the precise, matter-of-fact nature of seeing what we saw--movies that just showed in a \"verite-home video-style\" a \"craft\" that just appeared on screen.  what i saw that night felt like that:  the spaceship just coming into the scene, and then going out of frame--that blunt.\r\n\r\nprior to this, i had seen a very distant, smaller version of the same thing, not but a very few days before.  that felt peculiar affect-wise, but this larger, up-close experience was both profound and unsettling.  since then i have never seen anything else.  subsequently, i also have developed a deep fear of \"alien\" phenomenon.  i hardly will ever watch anything about \"realistic\" gray-type aliens.  i can handle thor on stargate sg-1, but when hollywood tries to get super real, i have to turn the movie off!\r\n\r\ni've never seen the silly lights in the sky thing.  this was far more real and profound.  i argue with anybody that stuff like this isn't real--somehow, some way.","distance":"101-500

outside to our front yard to have a cigarette while speaking on the phone with my friend. i was looking up at the sky when i thought i saw the lights of a plane going overhead towards sept-îles. i then caught sight of multiple plane lights and thought it was strange that they were so close to each other and so many. that was when i realized they were all connected to each other and that it was one big craft that was blocking out all the stars when it passed. it looked like an impossibly enormous triangle. it was blacker than black. it made no sound. at that point i blurted out,\"a huge ufo!\" to my friend on the phone and dashed towards the house. i opened the door and screamed for my husband to come. when i returned to the drive way i continued to watch it pass and go towards sept-îles silently until i could no longer see the lights. my husband came out too late to see it. my friend will have the exact time and date of that phone call to discern the exact time and date of this incident. for the next two days, following that night, there was an unusual amount of helicopters flying in circles over our block. it's normal to see one or two in a day but there was more than five and they came all together and stayed around our block for over 30 minutes. my husband works in emergency services and thought the presence of so many helicopters meant there was some kind of

\"flaming\" orange color on the outer edges all around. what was particularly strange about this ufo is that it was gliding, made no sound, and would change speeds. the ufo was slow from the beginning, but started to gain burst of speeds every second. it wasn't a constant speed which was strange.\r\n\r\nthere were plenty of planes flying around with big flashy lights and going at the same

flash of light in the sky to the east if me and thought i had seen a shooting star, however as i caught the tail end of the flash a bright white star like object seemed to be at the end and still in the sky.  it was clearly very far away but it was sitting just above the line of my neighbours tree.  i thought this was odd so i kept watching it.  visibility was clear, no clouds that could be making it pulsating or flashing the way it was.  it appeared to be moving slightly as i was measuring its movement in regards to the tree.  every so often it would dart quickly and move position so it would either be to the left or the right of the tree.  when it darted into a new position there was a very quick streak of light that would be left behind that quickly disappeared.  whilst i was noticing this particular object another to the right of it was moving in a similar way, sometimes closer to the other object and sometimes further away, or sometimes higher than the other object and sometimes lower, this one too had the same light streak whenever it moved very quickly into a new position.  the light on the right then began to ascend and move further east whereas the other light was staying put although every son often still moving position, but getting higher in the sky.  i then to the south of me caught glimpse of an airplane heading eastwards because the night is so clear dye to the enlarged full moon and no clouds i could easily make out it was an airplane.  it was flying much lower than the two bright white lights, it was moving at a steady but slow pace and there was an orange emergency light flashing.  i watched these two white lights for 30 mins but they hadn't gone away by the time i came in here to report it.  it is worth mentioning that the light on the right appeared to be heading further east as the light was getting dimmer, but then came back come down lower again and becoming brighter in line with the other bright white light.  i am sorry if this seems a bit garbled.  never done or seen anything like thus before but felt it was worth reporting.","distance":"Over One

sliding glass door to allow our dogs out before bedtime. i looked north to the skyline above the wooded area behind our home and observed a red tinged circular object that appeared to be moving and interacting with a white circular star-like object that did not move. the reason they stuck out was because there were high clouds that night and a very bright super moon from the sse and i couldn't make out any other stars in the sky.\r\n\r\nwhen i noticed the objects moving i didn't take my eyes off of it the red tinged object was moving to and fro towards the star-like object and at this point the star-like object disappeared. i walked backwards and knocked on the door to have my wife witness this. she came out and confirmed what i was seeing. not being the type of person to typically care about such things, i was surprised to see her also struck by what was occurring in the sky. she suggested i run and get my astronomical binoculars and she would keep her eyes on the object. upon returning i could see that the red object had risen significantly into the sky and appeared large enough to discern white in addition to the red light.\r\n\r\nupon viewing the object with the binoculars i could see red and white lights in a row. i stabilized the binoculars on the top of a chair and i could clearly see red and white lights in a row around the middle of the object, perhaps 5 or 6, one after the other. at this point the object was moving quite rapidly left to right and then up and down and in just a few seconds it moved rapidly rising the right and became smaller indicating it was moving away until we couldn't make it out with our eyes, but i could still see it with the binoculars.\r\n\r\nwhen it appeared to be gone, we stood for for just moments for it to appear again to the left, just above the treeline of where it had faded just seconds before. it appeared to me to be larger and was moving more erratically almost trying to stay hidden in the treeline. at this point we could no longer see the object and continued to watch the sky for the next 10 minutes without seeing it again. i consciously thought during this time to take video or pictures with my camera phone, but did not and my only explanation is that i didn't want to interrupt what was occurring and i knew at our vantage point they would only look like muddled lights of little value.\r\n\r\nmy wife had stated that i was out of breath during most of the event as i traversed the backyard looking for the best view. i remember repeatedly reciting expletives in the excitement. my wife seemed quite taken with what she had seen which shocked me as unexplainable events rarely interest her. i proceeded to look out the blinds of our bedroom for the next hour to see if anything would come back. i had dream about the event that night and as i report this at work today it is heavy on my mind. truly a interesting event that we will not forget.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

likely 20,000 fee - up. at first it was difficult to keep the image framed (anyone familiar with optics knows that a small move in the viewing device makes a much larger change at the focal point).  the plane had passed, but i kept my eyes on the object, which hovered for a good 3 minutes or more.  as it did, it seemed to be rotating slowly, one side seemed to make it look like a black pyramid, but then it looked like a mylar balloon; then, as if the setting sun caught it, it glowed bright pink - copperish color (mostly maintaining a pyramid or diamond shape). then, as if turning another face towards me, it looked like a surface of silver mylar or tin foil. \r\n\r\ni wondered if it might be trash, or debris from an airliner, kept aloft by the thermals and the wind.  but it hovered at a fixed point in space, and after about 3 minutes, it started to move slowly laterally. i followed it for another minute or so, then a gnat flew into my eye, so i had to put my binocs down to wipe my eyes. when i looked up, it was impossible to see with the naked eye. i looked through the binocs for another 10 minutes to no avail - the object had either gone, or was so small and difficult to locate that i had to give up.\r\n\r\nhaving witnessed a daytime orb previously, and having seen a lot of video of orb sightings, i would bet that's what i saw today.  since i have followed robert bingham \"the ufo summoner\", i have been trying to get sighting results using his summoning technique. to date, i have only had two successes: this april, 2014, and today (august 2014) - if indeed this was one of those 'morphing orbs'.  i mention this because it might be useful for other \"skywatchers\", to realize that it takes many, many hours of skywatching, and you can't always rely on the naked eye. try using a spyglass, telescope, or other ocular device, and give it 10 minutes in one area, then try another. and another.  you never know what you'll see!
