but slowly ascending in the southern sky almost parallel to the moon. i tried aiming my ipad at it a few times to see if it was an object of interest in the virtual sky app but nothing was showing up. the iss was now heading well into the south east and after approximately 10 seconds the lights began to fade out all the while steadily ascending and maintaining their perfect triangular formation.

bag in my truck so i could make sure it was charged before we head out today. also wanted to check on weather. caught a lightning strike out of the corner of me eye so i started staring a the clouds to make sure i'd seen lightning. all of a sudden a large bright white light appeared from nowhere dropping down and then changed direction by what looked like 90 deg away from me. it headed towards the grey clouds and faded out.\r\n\r\ni had to rub my eyes and assure myself i just saw that. the whole thing took about 5 seconds. the way the light went off was weird as if it shrunk into a fine point. spent the next 20 minutes just looking and hoping to see something more. pretty cool whatever it was...\r\n\r\nat 1st i thought it may be a satellite of the iss but the controlled drop down flight path and subsequent direction change and fade out had me thinking otherwise. suddenly i knew i'd seen something that wasn't normal or natural. it had intelligent control.  the fade out and shrink down to nothing keeps playing over an over in my mind. about 5 minutes later i heard and aircraft but couldn't spot it. probably just normal traffic to las vegas.\r\n\r\ni am part of a ufo

bothering me for years and i’ve only told my brother about it. i was born in the small abitibi town of iroquois falls, ontario and at the age of four, my father got a job in falconbridge, ontario just outside of sudbury. it might be interesting to know that cfb falconbridge, a norad scramble air base was operating near by. the jets used to fly over often.\r\n\r\ni was 6 years old at the time and used to get up at around 5:00 am and out to play shortly after. our town’s main street had a gas station, restaurant and department/grocery store. the other side of the street was empty as it was the lip of what we called the pot hole. it was where the first mine was. it was strip mining.\r\n\r\ni was playing by the gas station by myself when i saw an object that flying very fast into the pot hole and i was sure it was one of the jets crashing. it didn’t make any noise (i don’t really remember) but there was no crashing noise, i had run up to the pot hole (less than a minute) and there was nothing there so i ran to the fence on the east end and at that location you could see for miles and miles around. there was no sign of a plane anywhere.\r\n\r\ni wandered around for a short time very puzzle about the whole thing. i was also very hungry and went home to have some breakfast. my mother asked me where i had been all day. it was late afternoon. if seeing that object was puzzling, not knowing where i had been all day surly took the cake.\r\n\r\ni tried to tell my mom about it but she thought i was making up a story. i never discussed this with anyone until years later when i told my brother. he believed me and said i should report it. i never told anyone else and never knew where i could report it to until i saw your show “hanger 1” and checked you out on the net. i’ve waited for a while but finally decided to write you. probably nothing will come of it but i thought i might let you know my story.\r\n","distance":"101-500
