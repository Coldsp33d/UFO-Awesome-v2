yellow-orange orbs.  they appeared like huge falling stars or meteors that were going to crash on top of us.(i thought it was armagedon)  the whole lake lit up bright. then they just stopped and hovered a couple hundred feet over the lake for 5-10 minutes.\r\n\r\ninitially they hovered about 500-1000 yards from our campsite.  after a couple minutes one of the orbs flew adjacent to our site, over the provincial park about tree top height and 100=300 feet from our trailer.  it was much less luminent than when coming out of the sky but still of average brightness.  it looked to be about 10 feet in diameter with a filament of light looking shape inside the orb like a incandecent light bulb. the orb stopped across from us,hovered for 30 seconds and dimmed down like you would dim lights in your dining room. as it started to move away to the ne it got bright again.  it then slowly moved away in the direction of kimberly.  a minute later, the second orb did exactly the same as the first, stopping, dimming and slowly moved off to catch the first one.  then two came together following then same procedure as the first two.  the final orb hovered over the lake while the others moved in single file away about 5 miles.   the final orb finally passed by our site but for a very short time.  he dimmed up and down quickly and then as fast as you can snap your fingers it was gone and quickly in line with the others.  i'd guess it traveled about 5 miles in around one second.\r\n\r\nduring the whole time watching this event none of us felt scared.  we talked about it after and it was more a feeling of aweness.  we initally were startled when they came out of the sky but as the orbs passed by our site we all felt calm.  this was the most extraordinary experience of my

different event than the one i am reporting now.I will explain both first the one i am reporting now.This happened by china lake naval base.The night before the crash i was driving down the road when i notice a moving star.I pulled over to get a better look at this object.It made no sound and looked like burning magnesium.I watched the object fly from eastern sky to the western mountain range at about a thousand ft and after it passed above me it started to drop material like molten lava.Whatever it was made of was coming apart.Not just a little bit of it but a lot of it.This was shocking to me and my bother at the time.After telling my uncle he said he saw the same thing on the other side of town and he was looking at it through his telescope.Now it gets better i worked in bakersfield at the time and took hwy 178 everyday.The next morning on my way to work i notice on the hillside a half mile crash site that still exist today and i got plenty of pictures of it but never set foot on the site far of radiation poison.I never seen the crash itself but i know that what i saw the night before is what caused the markings on the hillside.Note i travel that road everyday for years.Now the following day after i noticed the crash site.I passing by it again i notice the burn site has gotten bigger and the same thing for the day after that and it only changed at night cause it was the same when i would come home each day but the next morning is when it was changed.The only answer i would have to this is china lake naval base was covering up this.They are the only that would and could perform this kind of cover up or i could be wrong and its radiation that's caused the hillside to burn more.Its for sure a crash site and why would someone try to cover it up secretly at night for four days this happened i would love to show people this crash site to answers.Now about two weeks later 10 miles away down the road there was another crash this time a whole mountain top of solid rock was on fire and it was in the same path line as the object that i seen two weeks prior. this time the fire department was there in full force.This fire was burning on a rock half mile long and wide. i did see anything happen there but it does not take a genius to figure out what happened there to make rock burn.Please contact me i would love to show someone these crash sites hopefully there is some evidence to gather.I will make my other report at a different time i not very good at typing as you can tell so i will wait for someone to type it for me thank you.

nile for three days on fellucas. we had two groups sailing on 2 large, flat-topped sail boats, each having two large sails. on the 23rd  (my birthday), the group decided to go ashore to a camel market onshore in the support boat - which is where we ate our meals, showered, etc. and followed our fellucas. we were anchored (approximately) across from an island called, \"elephantine island\", if you need to find it on a map.\r\ni decided to stay behind on the felluca, so i could be by myself on the boat and relax in history and enjoy the trees and shrubs along the nile.\r\ni was so relaxed, gazing off to the land south of me and suddenly i saw three fellucas, all horizontal beside the land, one in front of the other. (i wish i could draw a picture). usually , the boats are landed with the front of the boat on the land. these ones were side by side, horizontally, in front of the land, in a configuration like this:\r\n                 \r\n           ********************land***************************\r\n                          boat\r\n                            boat\r\n                              boat\r\ninstead of being:\r\n\r\n          ********************* land *************************\r\n                      b          b             b\r\n                      o          o             o\r\n                      a          a             a\r\n                      t          t             t\r\n\r\ni remember thinking how unusual it was for the boats to be arranged like that. as i was watching (i wasn't thinking anything about ufos at the time), the masts suddenly turned into like a silver celluloid - it was light and reflected light at the same time. it seems like it knew that it had gotten my attention, but i was still just in observation mode. then, the sails seemed to melt from the top down, all at the same time until they were level with the boat. once they were all in order, they all merged into a cigar shape. it stayed in that shape for awhile, then it blinked out of existence. then it blinked back into existence. and it went in and out of existence about 4 or 5 times. then it just blinked out of existence. i remember thinking, \"wow, that was wierd!\", and i just kept gazing at the same spot where they had disappeared from. i didn't think anything about it, i just thought it was very strange. i realized about a couple of  hours later, that i had just seen a ufo shape-shifter and was trying to wrap my mind around that. \r\ni never told anyone on my tour about what i had seen - i was also just trying to digest what i had seen and just kept going over it and over it in my mind, so i would remember.\r\nabout 2 years after i had come home, i told one of my sisters who was nasty about it and didn't believe me and told me i was nuts. i haven't told very many people about it. but it was real and it was exciting, once i figured out what i had witnessed.\r\nby the way, i don't drink or do drugs, so it wasn't some type of hallucination i was having. if you would like to speak with me about it, you have my permission. i have tried to post this story to your site many times, but my computer would just do weird things when i tried. hopefully, today, it will work.\r\nthank you for all the awesome work that you do. i would like to join your organization as well.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

and other 12) were driving down to las vegas from our home up in british columbia and we stopped in jerome idaho and spent the night at the comfort inn & suites. just before getting to the hotel we stopped at a fireworks stand as we decided we would light some off later that night to celebrate the beginning of our summer vacation. we went outside at around 9:30 that night and walked around to the back of the hotel so i believe we would have been facing west and there is a big open field which was a perfect spot to light off the fireworks, the skies were mostly clear with the odd cloud. it was not totally dark yet so started by lighting off some of the smaller fireworks, about 5 minutes into this three orange orbs appeared up in the sky in front of us behind a thin cloud, all 3 were the same size and all at the same elevation and they hovered for about 20 seconds before disappearing, my youngest son grabbed my iphone and tried to get the orbs on video but he was to late. if you watch the first video i have attached called \"ufo 1\" you will see the conditions that night as well as hear my families reaction to what we had just seen, we knew it something strange and we were all stunned. we continued to light off the rest of the fireworks which were much larger and about a minute after we had finished the 3 orbs reappeared this time further to the south and this time not behind a cloud, my son grabbed my iphone again and started recording, again they were there for about 20 seconds and then they disappeared. he thought he had all of it on video this time but when went back and looked we were disappointed as only one of the orbs showed up in the video and only for about 2 seconds before disappearing. in the second video i attached called \"ufo 2\" you can briefly see the orb in the first two seconds of the video before vanishing, kind of tough to see but we put the video on our 52\" tv and you can see in plain as day, also you can once again here my family's reaction. i also attached a 3rd video called \"ufo 3\", not much to see but you can still here us reacting to what we had just witnessed. people have mentioned flares or chinese lanterns but i don't believe for a second it was either one, i really believe me and my family witnessed something from out of this

suspect the weather forecast is wrong, i like to look and observe and make my own judgement.\r\ni was outside for around 10 minutes and then i noticed a small white light in the north direction of the sky, it seemed to just be hovering which i thought, \"thats a little odd\", i thought it maybe a plane or helicopter flying towards my direction so that is why it looked as if it was hovering.  but i then listened for any sound and at that time there was none apart from a light wind.  it seemed to just hover for around 5 minutes and as there was no sound i continued to observe yet my mind was starting to tell me, \"am i actually witnessing something from the x-files\"  my mind could not really comprihend it yet i continued to observe, fascinated but did not go to get a camera, one i did not think to as i did not want to miss this unique to my experiences phenomenom. \r\nthe light orb which was glowing white then seemd to get bigger and move closer to my direction and it moved with a smoothness and control that i have never seen before but was awed by it.  it stopped midway between the clouds so i could not make out any outline only a round shimmering white light.  \r\nthen i noticed a red light come on but i was not blinking (like that of an airplane light)  it was also above the white light which was unusual and as i had never ever witnessed anything like this before it was hard for my mind to come to terms with it but it did as i am a very open-minded individual.\r\nthe object/orb then moved side to side rapidly as if it was monitoring something, then i observed it stoped and i could tell it was preparing something, i just felt an energy in the air, almost like static energy.  the orb then switched off the red light light and its white light started growing to around 4x its size and it suddenly shot up into the ne direction towards space, it shot off so fast after discharged the bright white light, it was a light explosion, a bright flash and it moved like nothing i have ever seen before.  i thought i hard a booming sound as it left my sight but as there was a thunder storm on the way i cannot be completely satisfied the sound came from the unknown flying object.  i never truly believed in ufo report or sightings as i have to have a persoanl experience to truly believe anything, \"seeing is believing\" as 'they say'.  i stayed outside for another 20 minutes but there was nothing apart from increasing stormy weather so i came back inside my own and the rest of the evening was trying to make sense of what i had witnessed.  after a couple of days it became very clear on what i had witnessed and now i must say i am some what a believer in this phenomenom, i never ever thought i would say that or even feel it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

test soil as we are curious.  in the late 70's my mother awoke to visit the restroom in the middle of the night in the top level of our home, she happened to look out the window to see a ufo in our backyard, on ben franklin road north in indiana, pa about 1.75 acres away near the woods line. it was a saucer type ship with lights around the rim and she saw small beings walking at the base of the ship in front of the lights. she was frighten and ran back to bed. she had the senses they may have sensed she was up so she bundled in her covers and faced away from the bedroom window and tried to empty her mind and feign sleep. she feared what 'they' would do if they sensed they knew she seen them. she heard loud clanging sounds and the ship passed slowly by her bedroom window, it paused at the window as if checking to see if she was up then sped off. she said it was as loud as a coal truck clanging down the road. it was so surreal she questioned if it really happened and felt strange saying anything to anyone. my bedroom was on the ground level. at about the same time period, i heard a cluster of footsteps run past my window from the backyard to the front. it sounded like there were maybe 7 of them spaced a few feet from one another and would be the size of kids 11 years old. we were the only kids on the street with the exception of another boy down the street. i wondered if my brothers were sleeping out in a tent in the backyard with friends but they did not so it was unexplained. the landing cite afterward had 3 circles where nothing would grow, today there are still 2 distinct areas with no growth. previous to that there was vegetation,  it was more sparse than the rest of the yard, but ground cover existed. i'm not sure if soil composition can change but there is a patch of red clay where we never recalled seeing before. i was home a few days ago and took a soil sample from the landing area and an area maybe 20 feet away and the earth is very different. the top of the rocks in the landing area, looks different than the bottom of the rocks. i'm wondering how i can check the magnetism or radiation of the area, if anything still resides or if i can find any trace left from so long ago. \r\n    i saw you have another report on your website from down he road during he same time period and yet another from nearby. \r\n    you are welcome to investigate the site. we talk freely about it and it would be nice to have validation.\r\n     thank you for your time and consideration of our case.\r\nsincerely,\r\n[item moved/cms/nd] \r\n","distance":"101-500
