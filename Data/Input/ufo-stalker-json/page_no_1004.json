both going s to n at roughly 6am then about half an hour later as the sun had risen more i seen another 'plane' i thought flying e to w but there was no sound or flashing lights as you get with planes, it was going alot slower then the other 'ufos' ive seen over the last 2 months and it seemed to be towing another ufo behind it as the one behind had very dim lights compartd to.The one in frount and was also comping the movments ofthe one in frount, nothing realing exsiting happened with this sigting apart from the fact it was derectly above me and closer than the others ive been seeing. i watched the 'ufo' fligh off untill i couldnt se. it any more.\r\n\r\n\r\nas for the others over the past 2 months..The first time i seen the first ufo it was flighing along the horizen straight at a plane.I called my partner and a friend who was staying over to see this 'plane crash' as i thought it was.. i first though i was going to see a head on plane crash, just before they would of crashed the light to the right just takes of straight up and at least 3 times the speed of the flashing plane to the right., the plane just kept on its path the same speed abd the other light the 'ufo' flew up high and just sat tgere for an hour or so with no movment at all. the lights it gave off are brighter than any star but roughly the same colour as a star but sometimes had a pulsing orange light before gping back to all white pulseing light..That night the 'ufo' would move slowly around with a blue 'beam' type thing for a few seconds comeing down..Over the next month it was there every night (a few nights i coudnt see it as there was heavy clouds and storms) but it was always there after the clouds had gorn...Over the next few weeks another 'ufo' was in the sky...The two seemed to 'shoot' red beams at each other and also have heaps of tiny light leave the big ones at time to time....Up untill now (aug 9) ive been trying to come up with a logical explnation for what i had been seeing but nothing i know of can fly at them speeds, create coulourd beams, or have lots of smaller lights come off it....But after i seen the one this morning there really isnt anything human that i know.Of that can fligh below clouds and not make a sound at all.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

7 personal sightings since i have started looking up during my daily walks. this is the first time i was able to catch anything on video. i am walking around with a canon pc1586 12.1 mega pixel camera. i see these \"black dot\" ufo's almost every day. this is the first time the camera i use has caught what i saw on video. it was only visible for a few seconds, but i caught it! it is very small and in the upper, left side of the frame flying under the white cloud. i am not saying it is et, but i do believe it is a real unidentified flying object. i have shot video of planes and birds for comparison and i know that this was no plane or bird, as it made no sound, and would have been easily identified if it was a plane or bird. i am only giving you the video of the ufo because my video of planes and birds was shot separately from the ufo and i don't want to confuse any viewers or waste your site's memory space on an obvious object that can be identified. i see these types of ufo's on many other videos, so i do not think anyone out there knows what they are or who made them. who ever does won't tell us what it is anyway or people would not be sharing them as ufo sightings because they would be identified at that point. sorry if i talk too much. this is my first documented sighting, and my first public posting regarding ufo's. i am skeptical, but i have always believed we are not alone, and that we have been visited by life from other planets. for what it is worth, there ya go!

(they use a blue camera filter to record night scenes in the daytime i believe.)\r\nthen i was looking at my body struggling against paralysis, shaking left and right like a fish trying to get-up from the bed and not being able to. my eyes appeared to be open but i could not scream or get-up.\r\ni was clearly moving away from my struggling body with the feeling of a slight 'concern' for the body. i was aware that i'm being led away from my body.\r\nthen i perceived that i had been abducted somehow and i woke up lying down in what looked like a soft black enclosure that felt like a coffin. there was a black cloth i was covered-in. i seemed to be lying down on what felt like a 'shelf.'\r\ni noticed that there was just a tiny streak of light visible in 'a crack' in the cloth and i heard a not-so-subtle rumble of an engine that i had never heard before which i knew to be a spaceship i was being transported in.\r\ni moved the cloth away from my face (but i don't recall if i used my hands) and looked to realize that i was being transported in a classic flying saucer craft. it was circular on the inside and smoothly lit by a not-so-bright white light everywhere though i saw no bulbs anywhere. the craft appeared to be joint-less and made out of a single mold. i thought i saw the faint outline of a door to my diagonal right where it was darker. it was also darker where i was on the 'shelf.' the color of the whole structure inside was predominantly gray-brown but also a subtler purplish-greenish with a smooth but textured finish. to my left was the wall of the shelf i was laying on so i couldn't see the other third of the craft's interior. and straight beyond it, i saw the same type of gray being looking straight (and away from me) with one hand horizontal and probably placed on something out of my view. i realized the creature was the pilot and was flying the craft.\r\ni thought to myself.. i better pretend to be asleep. i also thought \"hah! dreams can continue from one night to another.\"\r\nthen, there was no sign of aliens or spaceships but i was woken-up somehow. i had the sense that i had just landed and was walking away from the craft which, i had the sense, was behind me. i didn't look backwards and i found myself walking into a nice, sunny place with (i think) had green grass benath me and i met a bunch of 'cool humans' who were moving quickly and excitedly toward me to receive my arrival. in particular, there was a guy in his 30s who came right-up to me, had his arms high-up ready to hug me (i don't recall the actual hug.) in the dream, it seemed that i knew these people and they knew me well. but in reality i have no idea who they were and i had no idea where i had landed. then a few mins later, the scene changed, and the guy who hugged me was sitting next to me and showing/teaching me something very technical on a circular (i think) panel laid-out like a table in front of us that i recall looked very complicated. it was some kind of equipment/desk. we both looked human and i looked just as i did in 2012 with regard to hair, skin and clothing. i dare to say that the panel was the interior of another spaceship. i'm not sure what the equipment was but i remember struggling to absorb what technical stuff this friend was eagerly teaching me.\r\nhe seemed like a buddy i knew. i have no recall of any detail regarding what he was showing me, what i was learning or what was spoken by either he or i. i don't recall speaking either but just looking down pleasantly at the panel as his hands pointed to different things on it and teaching me about how it worked apparently.\r\n\r\ni don't recall getting back on a spaceship/travelling or getting back to my body or any such thing. \r\n\r\nwhen i woke up the next morning, the near-shock of the vividness of that dream became apparent. and the face of that gray alien was etched in my memory. all i had to do was close my eyes and it's face was crystal clear. this disturbed me greatly. it took me about 6-7 months to get it out of my head.\r\n\r\nthere were no 'dreams' of this type i had prior to this one nor since then.\r\n\r\nthen around april 2012, i had a powerful and corrective spiritual awakening in which i saw my own soul and realized that i was not a human either. i was an invisible awareness that was connected to the mind of a human being. i was not the human being itself. i realized that almost all of humanity has forgotten what they are and the freedom i felt was absolutely priceless and unmatched by any other human experience i had ever had. a tremendous clarity overcame me and the scriptures of all the saints, gurus and \"enlightened\" masters suddenly made sense. i never before understood their message because i was missing this one experience. i understood that this experience is what is called enlightenment and self-realization. there was no separation between science and spirituality anymore and the crux of the source of all major religions became clear to me. i remembered that i had always been separate from the human and connected to the human mind. but somehow, i had forgotten this for decades and believed that i was a human. this turned out to be 100% false.\r\nthere became no fear of living nor dying anymore and there was a clear understanding that an alien being too is an awareness connected to the shape of a humanoid body.\r\ni am of the opinion that the alien visitation had something to do my \"waking up from the zombie sleep.\"  i certainly was never harmed during the abduction. \r\nbut my memory is

when i was 17 in 2007 after midnight i watched stars direction ne above the trees which were 50 meters from home, 10 degrees right and 15 up from sirius. i was thinking myself, what a beautiful star, but after a minute i realized it shoudn't be there. i grab my telescope, which at that time was only plastic toy when i was young and tried to focus on it. i saw only it look like a star, but after trying to guess, why it is there, it started after 10 minutes from the start of the observation, moving from ne to the east slowly. it was white, blurry and pretty big. it was not burning, so it was no falling star - which i personally love to watch and cross fingers - neither it was some falling and burning satellite etc. after one length between algenib - scheat from pegasus constellation, it was split in 3 same pieces, going still slowly to the east and they didnt stopped at all for the time of splitting ... the whole event took about 10-15 minutes, in which there was a descent, minimal but it was.\r\n\r\nsince then i am afraid of going alone to the forest which i really love the nature and dark, and i feel being observed there. it means i feel not alone. sometimes i cry inside, why i am not there but on earth.\r\n\r\nmany times i go to the forest, even when i feel its scary for me and something is pulling me inside the forest, just like the forest is some kind of aphrodisiac and i dont mean the dark of it. it mesmerizes me whole time.\r\n\r\nwhen i look at the sky i see alot of moving white light without blinking. i was thinking they are satellites, moving on the night sky, but wait, i shouldn't see them with bared, naked eyes.\r\n\r\nmost probably it were 2 objects attached to one bigger somehow or one big made of 3 pieces, probably triangles. it was beautiful, so natural and flawless. i waited so many ears to be sure.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

had just left saskatoon at 1:17am, i know because i text my husband to let him know, and continued my drive to alberta. at 1:23am the sky lit up like i've never seen it do before, the entire sky turned white so i looked out over the wheel up to the sky to see if i could see anything..... well i did, and it have never been more terrified, there was what appeared to me to be an extremely bright white missile shooting towards the ground, i thought that i was done, i woke up my passenger and he was able to witness it just before it hit the fog in the farmers field next to us (the fog only being about 10feet in height) this object was about the same size as a school bus.  by this time i had pulled over as well and saw that as it went into the fog, still full speed, it turned bright green and disappeared . once i realized that there was no blast, no, boom, no explosion, i immediately text my husband again asking him to please call me, he didn't right away so i tried him, and was told by my phone that  my service was temporarily unavailable. in my panic i text him again with a plain now, to which he replied that he couldn't call me, as when he tried he was told i was unavailable.  it was about 2 hours later that i could finally make calls again. well i started driving again and had my passenger text my husband for me, to which we were informed that my husband saw this light 6hrs away. i started to feel numb within 15 mins of the sighting, to the point where i had to pull over and let my friend take over for awhile, within 25minutes i was feeling extremely nauseous, and within 40mins we had to pull over so i could vomit. after that i felt better so i contributed it to my nerves, so i got back behind the wheel and continued on my way home. i instantly noticed that something was not right  in my left side peripheral vision, and still cannot tell you what was there because everything in me told me to not look in that direction. about 1hr 30mins after the sighting i couldn't do it anymore, i was struggling to no look left  in which there seemed to be a pull for me to do so, but i refused to so i wouldn't . i pulled over in a roadside turnout ( place to throw out garbage along the highway, or take a quick rest) and was very surprised at how full it was, and i had a hard time finding a spot to park. but as soon as we stopped moving i was hit with an overwhelming tiredness so i  made sure that we were locked in ( false security i know) and fell asleep for about 10min when i was suddenly awake, i still felt a bit woozy and tried to get back to sleep, i noticed it was 3:01am at that time, i layed there for a long time with my eyes closed and rested until i felt ok to hit the road again. well my husband being inquisitive instantly looked at the news, weather network, and online for an explanation, none being found until after i had been home for hours when a friend posted an article from a newspaper saying that the uofcalgary had released a photo to the of  a \"fireball\" that had happened at the same time of my sighting. i know what i saw wasn't a fireball, so i called the university's astronomy section and was informed that a fireball did not happen, that i must have misread something somewhere. i then called the newspaper and spoke to the author of the article, he had said that he originally contacted the uofc after many reports of this blinding bright white light in the sky coming in,he was then sent a picture of a photo that they had take of said object. i told him that the school denied reporting anything at all to them he let me go to call them back , where it was denied to him as well.

my heart started to beat a little faster. but when the object veered, and then changed directions by 180 degrees, i yelled out to my son, pointing. i then followed the object with my binoculars, until it disappeared a minute later.  i was very excited, and wished i had had a night vision video recorder with zoom lens.  i'll have to explore crowd-sourcing that...","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":58732,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.38173001870584,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08072014-0025","longitude":-73.49210294597916,"occurred":1407472500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Connecticut","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1407480729000,"summary":"Satellite-like object observed, brightened suddenly, then changed direction","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"06810","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Danbury, Connecticut","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:121422"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Kitimat","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"After a day of fishing we went to dock in a bay for the night we went to sleep at around 10:30 pm there were about 5 boats on the dock, this area is around 70 km from the nearest town there is no power or houses in this area. we have a 21 ft boat with a cuddy when you lay down you looking true a escape window a foot above you at around 3 am sound was waking me up (i'm a very light sleeper) when i turned myself over i was looking up and saw an object above us that made a strange beeping sound in different tones and in the middle of this object it look lick glass tubes with differed colored lights if they were scanning the area. \r\nfor a long time i didn't want to know about this and sad nothing to my wife and kids but i keep seeing this image and hear this sound in my head. when i told them they were saying that i was koekoek and i know for sure what i saw because i'm not a dreamer.
