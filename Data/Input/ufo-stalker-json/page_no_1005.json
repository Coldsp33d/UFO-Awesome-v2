i asked it ( mentally) that how do i believe if its of et origin ... it simply made maneuvers which were impossible by human craft ... like going in reverse instantly and changing direction of flight. it would sometime hide itself and then reappear in a different place. i was very excited to see it. as if it was my family i had been separated from since birth that was visiting me. then the ufo simply vanished . this has made me profoundly more spiritual and esoteric in my interactions with people and myself. i also witnessed a second sighting after i had requested them to show me once more their craft ... but, this time they appeared after a week on a morning. i dont know whether the 'talks' i have with these beings are real or not but the ufo was definitely real ... both of them. since then i have been seeing numbers like 1221, 1111, 2222, 2332, 4444, and the likes all the time when i glance at the watch or license plates. at least more than 5-6 times a day , so it cannot be a coincidence. i seriously belive that we will witness a mass landing event before 2022. i don't know how, but i have been told this in my meditations and it feels right. anyway , the truth is pouring out from all directions.

near my back porch i observed out of my top peripheral vision a large bright white sphere that suddenly appeared at an elevation estimated to be 75 degrees. this object was in the nw sky about 15 degrees to the left of 90 degrees straight overhead when first seen. it was about the size of 1/4\" to 5/16\" inch in diameter at arms length. it had a downward slope to it slightly toward the n of about 10 degrees. this sphere, perfectly round, was a very, very bright white object in color. the size, shape, and color did not vary throughout my observation. there was no trail, no tail, no burning of the material leaving any combustion or debris field behind it. the object was observed in the open sky for 1 second, then it was partially obscured by a tall tree in my yard for the remainder of the event.  what stands out in my mind is how the object flew beyond the branches and leaves of the 50 foot tall tree covering about 60 degrees of the observable field of view to the nw and was so easily seen within the tree due to the magnitude of the light it immitted. there was a second tree behind mine that was farther away and the object did not go below the canopy of the later. there was still another 5 degrees of sky to observe below the tree line if the object continued downward to the ground along the same flight path. i lost view of it mid way in my tree. i estimate that to be approx. 40 degrees elevation. at first my thought was it was a meteor. i have seen hundreds of meteors and many comets in my lifetime. i tried to play this off and forget about it. there were no other observable aircraft or stars in the sky at the time. this object moved slower than a meteor and shared no heating up characteristics like a body moving into the atmospehere. there were no stars visible. i though about this one for some time because it didn't make rational sense. i researched the weather data for the date and time i made this observation at wunderground.Com. on that evening there was overcast around 2,600 k. this object appeared at a relatively low altitude below the cloud cover.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

that she was scared.  i got a piece of paper and had her tell me how to draw it.  she described something a little unexpected to me.  while i drew the head like most alien head you see on tv with the big black eyes,  she told me no,  that the were big and dark but more round and had lines on them.  when i asked her if she meant like a flies eyes or an insect,  she said no.  she said they were like crossed lines.  like the eyes had some sort of criss-crosses or x's or something of that nature. she described it as black and yellow.  she also knows her colors pretty well and i was confident when she turned away the orange and red and picked the yellow. she made it sound as if the eyes had some sort of covering on them. she said it also had pointy teeth but i couldn't get a good understanding of what she meant.  i was very surprised at what she described because i have never exposed her to any alien shows or anything that could have given her that visual. i didn't think it fit with what i've always seen or heard about what these little grey men supposedly look like.   unless she was dreaming about one of the teletubbies, my husband and i are at a loss. she also oddly enough told me

as a joke i took a cheap laser i use with my cats (ones specified in the forums have to be a lot more powerful) and pulsed the laser on and off in the sky just right of the moon. i did this for maybe 5 seconds. as i was looking out the window, i noticed a long white craft moving across the sky from right to left. thinking it was an airplane i immediately put the laser down, as i don't want to be that guy who gets arrested for shining a laser at an airplane. it first appeared to the far right of where i flashed the laser in the sky. it was bright white, and depending on exactly how far it was from me when i saw it, it appeared to be around 100 feet long. \r\n    my immediate first assumption was that it was a plane and that i just didn't see it coming into view, but i could not see any wings or details (including the tail) that i can typically see as planes fly by around here. it flew at speeds similar to that of a commercial airliner, and drifted across the sky. as it continued to head further east, a large electric-blue ball of light formed right behind it and then it was completely gone. not a cloud in the sky, and at the speed it was travelling it should have been easy to see for at least another 3 minutes given its current path and my position. i was shocked, i don't believe that kind of stuff when i come across it on the internet, i never imagined it would lead to me

1975 i served as a security policeman at kirtland afb and was stationed on manzano mtn., a nuclear weapons storage dump. the nukes were stored on the outside of the mtn., a secret clearance being required to work there. on the inside of the mtn. was a concrete and steel roadway tunnel large enough for an 18 wheeler. one night on graveyard shift at about 3am i went for a walk up the roadway and at about 1/4 of a mile i came to an intersection where i could see forever in all directions. i continued on straight for another 1/4 mile then came to what seemed like the end. to the left of me was a narrow hallway about 20 yards long and at the end was an 8ftx8ft blast door with a series of locks on it. covering the door were signs of keep-out,radioactive material, top-secret clearance only, etc. at this point a feeling of dread overcame me and i pulled my weapon and backed out slowly. i made my way back to the entrance of the roadway as quick as possible, never mentioned it again and never got caught. i only thought of recently when i saw a ufo story on the history channel about dulce,nm and a contractor who fell into a tunnel and saw a bunch of \"greys\" and special ops guys. the story mentioned kirtland afb and i got to wondering what was behind that blast door i saw 39 years ago and maybe it linked up to dulce. in any event i suddenly realized it may have been an elevator. do what you want with the info but i never mentioned it before because i was in a restricted area with only a secret clearance. i'm 61 now and don't really give a s**t about it anymore.    thanx
