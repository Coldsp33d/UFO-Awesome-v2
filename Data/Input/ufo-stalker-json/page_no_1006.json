riding the train which was traveling next to some dry fields at the time i saw the air craft, it was about 11am. i was just looking out of the train window.\r\n\r\n2. what made you first notice the object?\r\ni saw the air craft because it was low over the trees tops and started to move. so my attention was drawn by its movement.\r\n\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\r\ni thought that i was looking at a small or midsized airplane or jet. \r\n\r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions in detail.\r\nthe air craft looked dull gray and like a normal airplane, it reminded me of a classic type military airplane but without wings. so the body of the craft was airplane shaped with a tail, body and front end.  when i first saw the craft it was traveling or facing in the opposite direction as the train i was riding in, so the craft and train were parallel to each other at first. i think that the craft was moving, but then it turned towards the train like an airplane would with its top side facing me. however, what was odd was that the craft was very low, over the tree tops, and its ‘wings’, at this time it seem to have them, were very reflective. the wings were reflective like sunlight off of chrome, but the rest of the body was a dull gray. so the craft made a rather sharp turn low to the ground and started to fly in the same direction that the train was traveling in. the craft was flying about the same speed as the train for a minute than it went a bit faster and i lost sight of it. \r\n\r\nhowever, after a few minutes i saw the craft again but this time it was closer to the train, facing the opposite direction and hovering or stationary in the air about 200 feet off of the ground. i did not see any wobble or movement from the craft, it was just sitting there in the air. i did not see wings on the craft but there was a missing section like half of a square missing from the top of the craft where the wings might have been, had i saw them. i don’t think that this craft was a different craft because i saw it only just after a minute of losing sight of it the first time. i don’t think that this craft was a helicopter because it did not have the tail blades and it did not have the top blades and it did not kick up any dust when it was hovering over the ground. i did not see the craft propped up by anything either. also, the craft was over a dry farm field so i don’t think that it was a sculptor of any kind.  \r\n\r\nas i was on the train, i did not hear any sound from the craft. i did not hear any sound when it was flying may be 1,000 feet from the train, certainly not a jet engine sound. and i did not hear any sound when it was hovering.\r\n       \r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object.\r\ni noticed the craft because it looked out of place and was flying around oddly, not like any airplane i’ve ever seen. i saw an airplane at the same time as the craft but the airplane was a jet flying high up in the sky not over the tree tops as this craft was doing. so this craft just looked out of place, but that’s all i ‘felt’ from or about the craft. this may have been a normal airplane, but i don’t think that it was and i saw this craft in clear day light.\r\n\r\n6. how did you lose sight of the object?\r\nthe first time i lost sight of the craft was when it traveled faster than the train and passed my window and field of view. the second time i lost sight was after the train passed the craft, and the craft being stationary left my sight.\r\nthanks!\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings, Other","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

(10-20 bigger than normal). and that is northwest (nearly north).. not west. the sun should set way over here, and i pointed to where the sun would set.\r\n\r\ni was driving (forgive me)and i grabbed my camera phone to take a picture when we were a vantage point. about a quarter mile up, the highway goes up in the air to transition to hwy 121 headed west. i figured it would only like a minute to get there and take the pic. since the (sun) was so unusual i wanted to try to get a great pic of it. but when we arrived at that point a couple minutes later, it was completely gone. in my estimation the sun would not have set that quickly based on where it was a couple minutes prior.\r\n\r\nmy sister and wife were in another car, and later my sister said she had seen the sun set also and it was oddly large and orange.

am always in mind of where the sun sets. and it does not set there.\r\n\r\nthe bottomline is.. it was slightly larger than what the sun appears, at the distance i saw it. if i were to estimate the distance from me at i35/121 interchange, it would have been a mile to 3 miles. it was an usually bright glowing orange orb hovering. i did not see it appear, we just saw it when it was there. we did not see it leave, it just wasnt there when i was higher on the highway to see it. and while it could have been the setting sun.. i havent ever seen the sun set in the north northwest area.. and it was larger.. and it didnt have the feel the sun creates as it sets.  \r\n\r\ni have been curious about this, and posted it on yahoo answers.. but really just wondered if someone knew a real reason for

assumed they were tail lights, they bounced in unison then they bounced up and out of sight. while i thought it unusual, i wrote it off as a unique reflection. i've spent a lot of time on mauna kea by myself and volunteering to run the telescopes at the visitor center. i've counted a dozen satellites in one evening. i've seen illumination, signal and other types of flares from the military base. i've watched the iss cruise over the mountain, i 've seen teardrop meteors, moonbows and a sprite. i 'be seen just about everything that would make someone scream ufo. only twice i 've seen objects far up in the sky that i couldn't explain due to it's unique movements. after i saw the two red lights, roughly 10 to 15 seconds later i saw something i'll never forget. it was roughly 50 to 75 yards away. it was bell shaped and lit up with the four aforementioned colors. i didn't see it land or take off and it made no sound. my dog was completely unaware of it. when i called my dogs name it sounded as if i was in a vacuum. as if my voice was extremely loud and originated in front of me. it was roughly 15 ft. tall and 10 ft. across at the base. there were two strips of lights spinning in opposite directions. i could make out the shape but couldn't make out any features because of the lights. the lights were very plasmatic in nature but the colors were very apparent and didn't blend. i've been interested in ufo's since i was a child. aside from a handful of crafts i've seen that were bell shaped, i've always pictured them as saucers so anything my brain would dream up would more than likely would be saucer shaped. the more i researched bell shaped ufo's, the more it bothered me. i was watching a program that showed how many civilizations and cultures held these objects in such high regard. i need to speak to someone who knows about crafts like these or has seen one. i was playing with my 350 lumen flashlight in s.O.S. mode and my high powered green laser pointer. i'm willing to take a polygraph test or interrogated by an expert in the field. you hope to see something like this your whole life. when you finally see something like this, you start to wonder whether or not you really did in the first place. i need answers, i went as far as to have a cat scan to make sure my brain was functioning properly.. i need to know whether or not anything like this has been seen by other people. mahalo for your opinion in advance. i need to know that something identical has been seen by others. aloha , jman","distance":"101-500

southwest portland into the parking lot to have a cigarette about 9:30pm. as per usual, we began stargazing and enjoying the sights. almost immediately, we noticed a hovering light not unlike a star lingering in the sky. comparing it to the other stars (and planets) in the sky, we realized the object was moving.\r\n\r\nit was ever so slight at first, moving in a very small circle, but after about ten minutes, the radius seemed to widen. using my outstretched arm for scale, the craft began moving half of an inch at a time: first up, then down. it then began moving left and right as well with no visible pattern.\r\n\r\nthis continued for the better part of twenty minutes before starting to change colors. the first color change we noticed in the object happened when an airplane (the first of six) passed through the same area of the sky, above where the object was hovering. it went from a hovering white light to a reddish, spinning light. during this time, two more planes passed above the object with plenty of room in between both crafts. with the planes in comparison for distance, the hovering object seemed closer to us than the planes. \r\n\r\na couple more planes passed below the object, but there was one in particular that was very odd to us. coming from the north, another plane was making a direct path for the ufo, and it looked like a collision could be possible. however, the plane traveled behind the craft hovering in the air. \r\n\r\nanother ten or fifteen minutes later, the hovering object began moving in a jagged, circular pattern almost like a curly-cue. to maintain sight of it, we had to keep changing our positions where we stood in the parking lot.\r\n\r\nit became increasingly difficult to maintain focus on the object because of powerline obstructions and treelines. right before we lost sight of the object descending behind a large tree, it seemed to shrink down to about half of the size it started as. it was then that the color changed from a pulsating white light to a bright orange pinpoint. it shifted colors back to its original appearance of spinning white lights with the intermittent reds just before we lost sight of it completely.\r\n\r\nto debunk my fiance and i's propensity for science fiction, we had a couple of our neighbors (who are also two of our best friends) to come out and view the phenomenon with us. they witnessed noticeable movement and color change as well and kept the object in view as long as we did. their report should be on the way as well.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

my name is [name removed/cms/tg]. i live in the small town of south alton just outside kentville nova scotia. at approximately 10:30pmtuesday augest 5th 2014. i was outside having a smoke when i had looked up and noticed two bright stars. but immediately realized that one of them was moving. it then began to pick up speed, slow down then pick up again and did not fly in a straight line. it seemingly... to describe its flight path the best i can... it looked like a marble rolling through the sky with (parden me) a ever so slightly, humping like motion to it. it flew directly towards a commercial airline. it flew to be about two finger widths from it. the commercial aircraft kept its speed and flight path, blinkin in normal sequence as if it had no clue this ball of light was that close to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen the light got to within an inch of it. it nearly stopped as the plane passed then it picked up speed and flew off to where i could not see it anymore over the horizon through the tree's. i at this time i had become mesmerized, grabbed a jacket and came back out to observe the sky more thoroughly.  i had in about a 15 minute span seen two more bright looking \"stars\" fly across the sky like rolling (humping) marbles. these three \"star\" like objects moved through the sky with finesse and never blinked a light. they each stayed one consistent ball of light the entire time visable to me. the first two started at different spots in the sky, but flew to the same direction before losing sight of them. the third had flew in a completely different direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nthis was just the beginning. as i walked further into my pitch black back yard to view a different section of the sky. i was looking up at a (no kidding) fairly high in the sky, a triangular formation. three stars. but the front \"star\" (i called it) was twice as bright and had a pale blue tinge to it. as i stared at this formation. i clearly was noticing the brighter one was legit dancing and changing the shape of the triangle. if you were to hold a sharpie marker up into the sky. that brighter front \"star\" was moving the width of that sharpie. upto a centimeter at times.  i stared at it for almost a half hour. then realized that when the front \"star\" shifted left.. the bottom right \"star\" or light would slightly tuck up. and then vise versa. im not sure if you can make much sense of that. but it seemingly appeared as one full triangular object that kept the rear more stationary and the front more mobile.  even stranger that what we call \"shooting stars.\" i seen two of them streak for about 3 inches through the sky within a hand with of the triangle.\r\n\r\nat first it just looked like the brighter \"star\" was just hovering and trying to stay in a triangle formation with two parallel stars. i'll agree to a polygraph examination and clearly pass with flying colors. i find it incredible what i had seen. this is not the first \"ufo\" sighting i have seen, they started when i was about 27. never seen a craft. just lights move in peculiar ways at night. i do not abuse drugs and would agree to a blood test even. i was completely sober tuesday augest 3rd 2014. there was something strange going on in the skies over nova scotia that has no scientific or natural explanation. if there is... i need it... asap. thank you for your time. i hope to hear back from mufon someone soon.    \r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n[name, email, and phone number

drove not more than a few miles from an i-15 exit to take photos/shoot video on the day we left north san diego, the day of the \"big moon\" in mid-july 2014 (july 12th i think, camera date was unintentionally shifted to 2015 at some point prior to or during encounter). we pulled off the interstate at an exit when we noticed a train that would make potential material to accompany the moon.Around 8:30pm - approx. sighting time-= put us just north of san bernardino and south of barstow on the backside of  i-15 north as the sun set and the moon came into view (gps off on camera). i actually didn't notice the object at the time, in fact i don't recall shooting anything more than a few stills around this time, which i will try to find and include here because they tell a bigger, bizarre story. the train had completely passed within 30 seconds of pulling the car over and the stills were shot nearby around the same time as video. if not some sort of optical illusion or lens flare, it appears that a green/greenish blue orb looking like a man-in-the-moon comes from the background on a path pretty directly at me - but swooping and changing direction quickly - then hovering for a minute and quickly turning around and returning to what some photo enhancements of stills taken later seems to be a large opening of a distant mountain side. i couldn't hear anything over the sound of the freight train and don't even recall seeing the orb when i took stills after the train had passed. not sure this counts as a sighting since it was after the fact, didn't notice anything until reviewing what i thought was throwaway digital video and stills shot blindly toward the moon/horizon. didn't think i'd gotten any good shots off so didn't get around to seeing this until a week or so ago. the video clip, albeit brief, seems to show this orb on the other side of the top of the fence, so despite shaky footage i don't think it was lens light refracting oddly. i'll attach a still but hold back on the ones that seem to show the orb being chased to the ground by a giant cat-shaped cloud where it transforms into what appears in other brightened stills to be a green humanoid creature riding a giant lizard into a giant cave as about 5 people scattered about on the ground kneel pointing pistols up at the cloud. no, really. but i won't throw those up here lest this video and photo turn out to be nothing unusual or a freak natural phenomena, in which case the latter photo interpretation will make me appear certifiably nuts. which i am, apparently!","distance":"101-500

it move toward me from the west and i watched at first i thought it was a air plane but the closer it come the bigger it got and flew right over me and the reason i never took my eyes off of it was because it was'nt moving as fast as i thought a plane should be moving for as big as it was. it move in a straght line from west to east and as it past over me i did'nt hear any noise untill after it past over me and i was expecting to hear a jet noise but hurd only a buzzing as from an elc. motor it move slow and stedy and i couldnt beleave how something as big as that could fly that slow and still stay in the air. i have been to many air shows and seen lots of planes none as big as this and fly as slow. i watched as long as i could untill it went out of sight to the east never speeding up

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Early one evening, while standing on my porch and talking to my next door neighbor, who was on her porch, we saw what can only be described as a flying saucer slowly approach in the sky, hover for perhaps 10 to 15 seconds, then slowly fly away until we could no longer see it. the object made absolutely no noise whatsoever, and was very low in the sky. in fact, it was only a matter of 15 to 20 feet above the rooftops of the houses on our street. this is a neighborhood in the city of baltimore that consists of row houses. i was 15 years old at the time and kind of remember the news media brushing off the many reported sightings by trying to explain it as an \"advertising hoax\". i absolutely knew better. advertising stunt, with no advertising, writing, or claims of responsibility by any company; yeah, right! this object was close enough to the ground that i could have thrown a baseball at it and hit it. the vehicle had flashing and rotating lights on the outside perimeter of the bottom section and a dome on top of it and, astonishingly to me, made absolutely no sound of any kind. even at that young age i found myself wondering what kind of propulsion it had to be silent like it was. there was no doubt in my mind then nor is there now that my neighbor and i had just viewed a flying saucer. unfortunately, i was the only member of my family on the porch at the time and despite my next door neighbor being a witness, i've always felt that my family never believed me when i told them what i had seen or talked about it anytime afterwards. as it turns out, my sister, who is two years older than me, married my next door neighbor's son. over the years, i was even greeted with skepticism from my wife when i told her of the incident or ever spoke of it. then, many years later, while at a surprise 50th birthday party for my sister's husband, his mother, out of the clear blue, asked me if i remembered the time we saw a flying saucer together way back when we lived on brendan avenue. well, my wife's mouth dropped open and i exclaimed, \"thank you, celie!\", and i turned to my wife and asked her if she believed me now. celie and i then proceeded to talk at length about what we had seen so many years ago and everyone in my family suddenly seemed quite interested at last. it really seemed like yesterday. you just don't forget things like that. this wasn't just a light in the sky. this thing was just so close to us. close enough that we could make out and remember every detail about the craft. my wife is much more computer literate than i am and one evening years after that birthday party she was on her laptop and said, \"hey, bill. does this look anything like what you and celie saw that evening way back when?\". i don't know what she had found or where she found it but the picture i saw on her computer looked eerily similar to what celie and i had seen. i'd like to add here and now that i, and my wife, are very devout born again christians and believe with all our hearts about creationism, god, and jesus being our personal lord and savior. i do not lie or make up stories. i have no explanation for what i saw that evening, and i don't know if god has created life on other planets. i believe in the bible and have yet to see any reference of extraterrestrials in it. fallen angels, yes; even ones that in the old testament came and had relations with human women, but no flying saucers or extraterrestrials. i do know this, though. i saw a flying saucer when i was 15 years old and would have no problem taking a polygraph test to prove my honesty. believe it or not, i did have a polaroid camera in my house that evening. they were very new technology back then, and i just wish i had ran into my house to try to grab a picture of it. but when something like that happens, i don't know, i never gave that a thought. it was almost like i was in shock. maybe one day jesus will tell me what it was i saw that night and where it came from. it's not really all that important to me now, though. yes, i'm curious, but all i really care about is jesus and my family.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

pictures (with my cell phone) of the beautiful scenery (i was the front passenger). when the traffic slowed down, i reviewed the pictures and noticed a very bright yellow orb with small dots of light inside. sometimes the lights were vertical, sometimes horizontal (as if it were spinning). when i saw these images, i lowered the window (to make sure it wasn't the glass causing a reflection) and started taking more pictures. i was able to capture several other images of the orb. i was not able to capture it in all images, but i got it about 20 times. sometimes the orb appeared behind leaves or in front of bushes, sometimes in the clear skies above the water and in different positions; so we concluded that it could not be a reflection of the sun; nor could it be a projection of my cell phone (it it were, the dots on the orb would always appear in the same spots and it would always appear in front of objects, not in between leaves). i felt exited about it because it was really beautiful and did not feel any negative psychological effect from it; but one person in the car got scared when it kept appearing in the pictures; she thought it could be \"following us\" (but she is afraid of these things anyways). at some point it stopped appearing in the pictures. i continued to take pictures of the landscape (and the sun, in case it was its reflection), but we did not see it anymore. \r\n\r\nit is hard to assess the size of the object, perhaps in between a golfball and a basketball (but there was no option for a size in between above). i was able to see the orb through the camera, but not with the naked eye (but we were driving down the highway, so the car was moving too fast for me to catch it). \r\n\r\nthe weird thing was the bright yellow color and the lights that kept changing positions in the orbs. i've seen other white, fuzzy orbs that i always discard as dust particles or some light reflection, but i've never seen one like this/these so i would like to know if you've had reports of any similar items. \r\n\r\ni made a document with several expanded views of the orb and i'm also including some of the pictures in the original file size for your review (i have several images, but there is a limit of how many i can upload here). i also took a video with the cell phone and i can send it to you if you think the images were not caused by some sort of optical illusion. \r\n\r\nwe are confused because if it is a reflection of the sun, we can't explain how it sometimes appears in between leaves and in various different positions in relation to the sun and how the little lights/dots inside of it appear differently in most pictures.\r\n\r\nlooking forward to hearing your opinion about this.\r\n\r\nthank you,\r\n\r\n[name

very bright yellow light and it moved out of the street light and to the left and became multiple colors and just hovered there i walked over i wasn't afraid of it, and i stood right above this blob of light or aura for about 5 minutes then it went back into the street lamp.  i couldn't make out what it was doing at first and i said to it ill be back i have to put my contacts in,lol i came back out and it was still there. i was trying to talk to it. i said i cant see you and it put its face right up against the lamp and it looked young like a child, its what they call a star child , i had looked it up a couple days later. but this being was trying to show me something but the lamp was to small but it looked like a film or video of someone, like a son and father. while this was going on it also was showing different colors of pink and blue it was very confusing while i stood there what appeared in front of me was a dark shadow, i felt it didn't belong there in a way i took my right hand and pushed it away like you would to a person and it disappeared. the street lamp event lasted about 10-15 minutes, but after it was over the tree next me start moving and for some reason i was telling the limbs to move and what to do and it wood do it. i told it to move like a snake and it started slivering around another piece of the tree. i know this sounds crazy but it was happening. what i thought it was doing was communicating with me in a part of the brain that we normally don't use and i was able to do this for about the next 10 hrs. all the street light were pink and blue for a long time i started walking up the street and i saw someone and i ask them what color are the light and he said white and i just told him i had drops put in my eyes that's why i was asking because it was i thought an odd question to ask that late at night. after this happen i slept for 2 days. i was woke up to eat about 4pm and my face was swollen and also my eyes and my skin was very dry. that day before all this happen i was seeing yellow spots all day long and when i was reading there were some words that looked darker than others, i don't know if that had anything to do with what happen but it seemed to fit. this is not the first experience ive had. i have tried to talk to the father at my church about other experiences i had which seemed more spiritual and he didn't want to hear about it. i saw one of your episode today about someone you put under hypnosis and the being told him they were his guardians and he had been sad. it reminded me a lot of myself prayer a lot and being very sad and these experiences seemed comforting to me. for about 2 years i have notice this light in the sky that has been with me wherever i go it stand out among the rest of the stars, it almost looks like a chevron its there every night and ive talked to it and aked it questions and it moves up and down for yes and across for no ive had witnesses that have seen it. i was questioning my sanity there for awhile but i know these events are very much true.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"12:15:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,
