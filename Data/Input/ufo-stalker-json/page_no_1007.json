9:30-10:00 pm around our fire pit. the isolation and elevation makes the stars stand out and the big dipper look 10 times larger than usual, so the sky was perfect for gazing. we noticed some shooting stars and some planes. i noticed a star-like object that looked to be at the height that a passenger jet might fly, usually so far up that it looks to be going super slow. but this object was spanning across the sky at a very fast pace in regards to my guessed height and per my vision. i pointed it out to my girlfriend jokingly as a ufo, because we actually enjoy alien/ufo stories. i personally have always found it really interesting, especially of late, but never thought i'd ever actually see one. half way across the sky the object met a similar one, a little dimmer. they came together spun around each other quickly. the second one then passed the other slightly and stayed put in place, the other continued the direction it was going but looked a little dimmer until it disappeared from sight. the hovering one remained until i just couldn't look anymore and lost track of it after a few blinks and gazes into my fire pit. the stories of other ufo encounters seem pretty similar to what my girlfriend and i saw. also i am familiar that yosemite has a history of strange events. i was excited and a little freaked out because i have always had a total fear of the \"grey\" aliens, just the way they look has always got to me since watching close encounters as a kid. anyways, i am glad that i was able to see some and it really topped off our mini vacation. also we both had no service up there so we did not have our phones to take pictures on us immediately, it was so far up i don't know if it would of captured it well

deck. the house is on a lagoon off barnegat bay. as my husband and i watched, we saw three distinct gray discs in a triangular formation. they were kind of translucent but could be clearly seen. they hovered, and seemed to be three separate objects, and not the \"feet\" or \"pads\" of a single triangle-shaped craft. off in the distance, a star-like object was moving up and down, seemingly very far away. the three discs seemed much closer. both the star-iike object and the three gray discs remained in place for several hours. it was almost as if they were watching the fireworks display. all of a sudden, the star-like object dipped below the horizon, then shot up at an amazing speed, too off and disappeared as it took off. the three discs remained for a while, then seemed to disappear. i did not notice them leaving, but all of a sudden they were gone. lots of people had to have seen them, and as a matter of fact, several months later we saw a report on the 6 o'clock news (one of the nyc stations) that showed a videotape of exactly what we had seen. it must have been visible all up the nj coast, because someone in another beach town had taped it and sent it in to the news. \r\ni am certain about the july 4th date, but i am uncertain of the year. it had to be during my daughter's high school years - 1990-1993. i believe it was 1992. \r\ni have had several sightings over the years- the first when i was about 15. i was about 38-40 years old when i had this sighting. i am never afraid. i am always exhilarated when i have a sighting. it's almost like i am excited to see them back again. \r\n\r\nsomewhere, a videotape of this must still exit.","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with

saturday night. it was the summer of 1964. on a perfectly clear cloudless night, we stopped to gaze at the millions of stars visible near the beach at night. suddenly our attention went to a single \"star\" that was moving straight up. then, it suddenly changed direction and moved straight down. it repeated this a few times. we knew it wasn't a plane because panes don't move like that, and as it was a small as a star, too far away to be a plane anyway. suddenly a vapor trail began to come out of it- we stood as if glued in place. my friend thought it might be a skywriting plane, but i knew it wasn't because it wasn't writing anything, skywriters don't write at night, and it was too far away to be a small plane. eventually the vapor trail began to descend. forming a large cloud-like shape. this \"cloud\" was easily as big as a house- oddly, although we could see the dark night sky through it, we could not see any stars- and we should have been able to see the stars. the rest of the night sky was filled with them. it was as if inside the cloud the stars became invisible. as it got larger, we realized it was getting closer and at that point we heard a strange noise that i can only describe as sounding like hundreds of wheels and gears turning at the same time. the sound jolted us out of our lethargy and we began to run towards home. as we ran, we looked over our shoulders to see the \"cloud\" following us at about the level of the treetops. there were no cars on the street- at that time, ocean grove did not allow cars in or on its streets from midnight saturday to midnight sunday. they actually had village gates that were locked, and no cars were allowed to be parked on the streets either. no lights seemed to be on in any houses, and at that time ocean grove had no shops or stores that would be open at night. no gas stations. no 7-11 or wawa. there wasn't a soul around. we heard the noise as the cloud followed us- we were laughing and crying at the same time. we were only about 2 blocks from the house we were staying at, so we reached the porch before the cloud reached us. we climbed up the stairs, bursting through the front door, waking my friend's mother and grandmother. of course, she was upset that we were crying- we told her we had gotten frightened walking home, we went to the room we shared, pulled open the shade and the cloud was right outside the window. hysterical by this time, we pulled the shade down and stayed up all night. we vowed never to tell anyone in authority (like police, etc) because no one would believe it wasn't just two teenage girls who got scared walking home in the dark. to this day we remember it s clearly as the night it happened. we have lost touch over the years, but every once in a while we reconnect and remind each other about that night.

light but at another location to where my mother had seen it move to. this glowing object/orb remained within that area slowly moving to one side almost unnoticeably if not stared at constantly. it motioned this way for a few more minutes before it vanished from my line of sight. it was almost star like in appearance yet brighter than the surrounding stars. while having my gaze set on this object i decided to quickly look into the sky where my mother had said it previously was in case there anything else and i noticed another pale (off white) elliptically shaped orb dart across the sky horizontally a little faster that a jet plane. this pale orb wasn't very high in the sky and it was like a cloud in an elliptical shape slightly smaller than a light cessna aircraft. it was much lower than the glowing star shaped orb which appeared like a hovering craft resembling a drone. however, i would dispute the notion of it's drone like appearance due to its spectacular manoeuvre in changing locations in the sky as witnessed by my mother before sharing her account with me. viewing both these objects ran a fizzy rush of energy up my spine like a chill both in a starling and pleasant way. i lost the reddish-orange object/orb to my limited line of sight as there was a brick wall in the way to the side outside my mother's bedroom window. i was unable to take a picture with my phone as this glowing orb/object was far away to be captured in a picture on my phone. the night sky was clear and the stars clearly visible. the location of this object was in the south-westerly direction from

turned to go back up the driveway i noticed 2 red lights approaching from the southeast. i thought they were helicopters, but they made no sound. i watched them pass over towards the northwest and then vanish.I thought to myself how lucky i was to be outside at just the right time. at that moment i notice 3 more red lights in the distance, approaching from the same direction as the first two. the 3 crossed the sky above me and vanished at about the place that the first 2 did. the objects never changed course or speed. i could not see any structure to the objects. in fact it was as though i could almost see thru the red lights. i then telephoned some friends in the area, but they were all inside their homes during the event. once i realized the objects were not helicopters, i tried to remain calm and observe and remember everything i saw. i hope this short report is of some value to mufon.
