major ufo sighting in lausanne, switzerland in 1997, and it still mystifies me to this date.  what is most surprising is that i am unable to find any reference to it on the internet and so am writing to you in the hope that you would be able to investigate.\r\n\r\nthe year was 1997 and i was doing my post-graduate studies in an internationally acclaimed institution in lausanne that year.  i am from asia ans have since gone back to live in asia, it was only that year that i was spending in lausanne.  it was in the later half of the year probably in  aug or sep. it was a saturday night, and had gone out in one part of lausanne with some friends.  i then left that part of lausanne and was walking to another part of lausanne where i was meeting some other friends.\r\n\r\nsuddenly, i saw hundreds of people who had stepped out of their restaurants and looking in the sky.  this was near the lake geneva shore and the area was an upmarket one with classy restaurants. the people witnessing this were all urban, well educated and well-off people.  i looked up in the sky and saw somewhere between 15 - 20 lights hovering in the sky. they were fairly low in the sky and hence could be seen clearly, ie no room for doubt on maybe eyes playing game on us etc. the closest one could think of the lights was a formation of military aircrafts, but they couldn't be aircrafts because they were just stationary and making no sound.  as i mentioned, it was so unique that people eating in many restaurants there had all come out of their restaurants half way through their meal to witness this.  after a few mins, the lights moved up into the sky very quickly and disappeared in the same formation, perfectly synchronised. i myself am a well educated person in senior management, and not one prone to believing in unexplained phenomena.  this was a very clear incident of unidentified flying object with no room for doubt.\r\n\r\nunfortunately, none of my friends were there. i expected this to be reported in the newspapers next day.  but the newspapers were all in french and i don't know french at all. i asked some of my friends who knew french whether anything was mentioned in the newspapers, and they said no.  those days of course, the internet was just in its infancy.\r\n\r\nfor years now, every now and then, i search the internet to see if this has been highlghted anywhere, especially in specialist ufo sites like yours, but surprise not to find anything.  i am hoping you have associates in lausanne, switzerland who are able to talk to the locals there and find out. this took place in an area called ouchy, that is just by the lakeside. there are a clutch of restaurants on avenue willaim fraise very close to the movenpick hotel. \r\n\r\nthanks","distance":"Over One

evening we had a bbq in the garden and in the clear, bright and warm night we sat outside enjoying a beer and suddenly one of them said that he saw a ufo we all said yea yea its good with you and laughed about it. my friend who first noticed it continued untill we all noticed it cause it flew around on the sky. we tryed to explain it and made conclusions about it was a satalite or other known objects until it became clear that it was nothing any of us had ever seen before. we just sat there in awe over the way it acted and flew around. it was not something i know or have ever seen before or after for that matter. it was not a satalite cause it would move extremely fast in what seemed random directions. like from east to west on the nightsky in a split of a second. it would then maybe go north appear, blink away (disapear) then you could see it appear in the west. it would litterly just play around on the night sky like you sometimes see pilots do. but this was not a normal plane. it became very clar after it kept appearing/disapearing and flying around on the sky from one end of the night sky to the other end with a speed that seemed so fast that it just went with a blink of the eyes. it fly very slowly emitting a light then suddenly it would blink and be gone to only appear very far away from the place it disapeared from. it would also zig zag around making turns that no planes i have heard of or seen before make. it flew around almost like it was communicating or playing around in the night sky kinda like it was desperate for attention or saying hey look at me up here! we kept seeing the object play around on the sky for over an hour more like two hours. it was a clear bright night so it was easily to see that it was not a plane, satalite, lantern, drone or any other object i have ever seen on the sky or heard of. i was stunned and amased i couldnt get my eyes of the object i didnt even think about filming it not that my cell phone camera would have done much good. but i just sat there and was stunned and somewhat chocked but also intriqued i have never belived in things like this before and here it was before my eyes and with four other people that saw the exact same. it gave me a feeling i havent had i guess. it was not like i felt scared or anything like that. i know what i saw and it was real. it was an intelligent controlled craft of some sort that i havent seen before and my mom was in the airforce and i was very interested in planes when i was younger and this one i saw didnt fly like any other plane i have seen before. it defied normal g force and gravity. it didnt even make a sound at all. it emitted some kind of light once in awaile and just before it dispeared or speeded up it would emit a little more bright light before it disapeared to appear another place but no sound at all really that i remember. we didnt really loose sight of the object we kinda just stopped watching it after something over an hour. it sort of just triggered all sorts of speculations about humans, earth, space and such things and we just began talking instead and debating so we kinda stopped sitting and watching it but it could have flewn around there more i guess we just stopped watching it. now i havent given it much thought until another friend of mine i told this to said me to report it here so thats what i am doing.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Path with directional

the first reported sighting i had was still visible. i noticed nasa altered the first orb, making it resemble a slow moving object like an asteroid. i witnessed the second object moving at very high speed from east to west above the first object i reported to you nearly a week ago. i immediately recognized the second object resembling the first, before nasa had originally altered it. the object was nearly identical to the first one before its alteration. it moved from east to west at incredibly high speeds moving directly over the changed image of the first. upon viewing it, i saw that this new one had a large wing like structure, just like the first. the new object pulsated across its entire surface at high even intervals, just like the first one had. whatever it was, its size was slightly larger than the first object. i was shocked to have witnessed the first one, and lucky enough to have recorded it, before and after its alteration. but to see a second one and larger than the first, and moving across and above the first? i couldn't believe it! but it was there! i spoke to a co-worker of mine who is a retired special forces soldier, and he told me he didn't want to get in trouble for saying what it could be, but he did say that the first object appeared to be of truly immense size! whatever the case, i did get the new one on video as well. i honestly think you need to see the video clips i recorded of these things. whatever they are, they appear to be controlled. if possible, contact me please. i honestly think the video recordings should be viewed. i lost sight of the object when the monitor counting the date and time reset itself to 3 days prior. once again i am faced with the issue of my phone not being able to download the video footage, but as i said i am more than willing to show it to someone in person if this is possible.

things in the sky at nite that i cant explain but this is on the moon and to me that is very weird and unsettleing. i just wish i had a more powerful telescope so i could see more closer look at it. it is now 9:55 and they are still there. the one in the lit portion of the moon appears to have moved positions a small degree of location. if you need more you have all my info and i will keep watching. please take a look and see if you can see and maybe you will know what they are.  thanks guys.","distance":"Over One

in the night sky. since the sky was clear that evening after being overcast for a few days, i decided to glance up before going to bed. i located the stationary object and, within 30 seconds, it started to move. i ran inside to get my green laser and quickly acquired the object as it was moving north at a slow, steady pace. it dimmed down to a bright pinpoint prior to once again regaining its original intensity. this sequence was observed 6 times before the object was out of sight. when it was stationary for 3 years i had noticed a reddish glow near the top and a blue-green color at the 5 o'clock position intermittently. about 1/2 way through its journey it drew parallel to a small, dim star-like object ( about 2 inches to the right ). as if on cue, this small, stationary unknown began moving, quickly accelerating to the speed of the primary object. the smaller unknown never brightened. both continued north until they were out of sight. it became obvious that there was a form of intelligence behind this harmonious performance. a large amount of energy would be required to light up the motionless primary \"craft\" to mimic the star-like image. additionally, i think this
