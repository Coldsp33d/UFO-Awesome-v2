(i was still recovering from this experience) i decided to go with them.\r\n side note: as we walked out of the apartment i noticed there was two rabbits sitting 5 feet away from each other, perfectly, yet they were facing two different directions. \r\n\r\nwe rode with our friend down the highway and saw the blood moon for the first time in our lives. that night i had a spiritual awakening that i was with the energy of life. time did not exist and i felt the unity of all being. i knew what the answer to my problems were. i sat completely still in a meditative position for 5-6 hours. i have never felt so much at peace. we were dropped off at our apartment the next morning, and the rabbits were in the same position that they were when we left, expect they were both facing the same direction. i felt at peace when i saw these rabbits. \r\n\r\na few days later i was at the rose garden in raleigh and a man with long hair was doing a standing meditation in the middle of the outdoor amphitheatre. my brother and i asked our friend if we should meditate with him and she said \"no, he probably doesn't want you too\" we walked up to a friend we were meeting and asked again \"should we meditate with \r\nhim?\" and she goes \"no.\" i said \"xena, if you were humble you would meditate with him\" her friend that we did not know sounded like a prophet and says \"if you were truly humble, you wouldn't have to ask him to meditate, you would just do it\" \r\n\r\nso we went to meditate with him. i immediately went deep into my meditation and a question came to mind. \"if i was messed with by extra-terrestrials, why would they leave behind evidence?\" and my mind gave me a direct answer \"the hostility of humans has become so severe, that it has begun to bleed into the balance of the universe. these beings would never intrude on our privacy, and mess with us in our sleep, they would ask for permission before doing so- and my mind told me \"the situation here on earth, regarding the interdependency of not only earth, but the universe, has become so severe that these beings are having to break their own rules, their own morals, to reach us in a way that we can affect other people\" they are having to play our game in order to communicate with us. i feel a strong sense of urgency when it comes to the path of the human race as a species. we have to be willing to communicate with these beings, before they help us. without full disclosure of this subject, we will never ascend to this god consciousness that they want us to connect with.\r\n\r\nin the midst of this i have learned that for the universe, and these beings, there is a very strict rule of life for everyone - non-interference. they are not allowed to interfere with our evolution directly, without our consent and understanding. \r\n\r\ni need to speak with someone soon. i am moving to new york city within the next week and i am willing to meet with a field investigator in the city if possible.\r\n\r\ni am a very reasonable and logical thinker when it comes to this- i had put this entire subject on the back-burner in my mind, since my friends have pushed themselves away from me due to what i tell them.\r\nthe only thing keeping me on this subject, is my dreams. i had a dream last week that i was on the brink of sleep paralysis and i decided i did not want to be paralyzed in my dream, and i was shot straight into space. i looked at the stars and it was a beautiful view. the same night i had a dream someone tried to hand me a child, the child had soft blonde hair and big blue eyes. (i have brown hair and hazel eyes) i knew the child wasn't mine, but i was pressured to hold the child as my own. i didn't want to hold this child, but i did and i wokeup. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafter my spiritual awakening i began having massive pulsing headaches for a few days after. lines on the side of my head appeared, and four prominent balls showed up on my forehead. it felt like growing pains. like i said, a lot of things happened in this week span of time.\r\n\r\nthe hand print is still on my wall- i would love for someone to come test the material that left the print on my wall!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":58595,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.79048758650127,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08022014-0010","longitude":-78.68233254298045,"occurred":1402393080000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North Carolina","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1407027541000,"summary":"Wokeup in the middle of the night","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files/58595_submitter_file1__image296.jpeg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files/58595_submitter_file2__image297.jpeg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files/58595_submitter_file3__image298.jpeg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files/58595_submitter_file4__image300.jpeg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files/58595_submitter_file5__image295.jpeg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files/58595_submitter_file6__image299.jpeg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"27607","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":53,"locationName":"Raleigh, North Carolina","triangle":false,"type":"Alien Encounter","$$hashKey":"object:124002"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Guwahati","country":"India","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":null,"distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":58594,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":26.1445169,"location":null,"logNumber":"IN-08022014-0009","longitude":91.7362365,"occurred":935378280000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Assam","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Blimp","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1407023077000,"summary":"","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":5458,"locationName":"Guwahati, Assam","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:124003"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Milwaukie","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Witness contacted oregon mufon asst. sd regarding an apparent implant removed from right adenoid or other glandular passage in his throat.  object has been secured by oregon sd and will be submitted for analysis.  additional sighting experiences related dating back to approximatedly 1946 or 1947.  these will be described in the complete report.

was a little smaller than the moon and my original thought was it was like a flickering candle flame. only it didn't flicker. i can see patterns but they didn't move. i was driving so i kept my eyes on the road while glancing at the thing in the sky. when we reached our driveway we got out and watched it recede -- still in a straight line -- while another plane taking off from stewart airport (in nearby newburgh) was flying the opposite direction at a slight angle. when the thing became small in the distance (still bigger than a point-like star) it just turned itself off. we waited a bit to see if it would come on again but it didn't.\r\n\r\nmy thought when i was looking at the ufo was it looked like a candle flame. i was focusing on the bottom part where it was brightest — yellow in color — and shaped somewhat like the crescent of a moon without the pointed ends, and i only occasionally glanced at the top which i remember had small yellow or gold dots or orbs against a mostly orange-red and black background. at the moment i am certain i would recognize what i was looking at if i knew it — say chinese lantern or candle flame or lightning balls as a friend suggested — my mind is clearest when challenged. but it was none of those. and the sight of it was very clear. there was no cloud, wind, or fog. it was a clear night. i saw no riggings of any sort. just a red orange ball floating in the air at a constant speed in a singular direction. the best i can come up with whatever was inside the ball (“ball” actually didn’t occur to me to describe it — i only adopted it after reading other witnesses’ descriptions and i thought, yeah the whole thing was localized and since it wasn’t a square or a hexagon etc. it could be a ball) was that it was out-of-focus. my eyes were trying to focus and home in on the shapes inside it but can’t. also, the shapes i later realized were not moving. my mind at the time was telling me it’s a flame while at the same time asking so why isn’t it flickering?\r\n\r\ni took a picture with my cellphone as it receded but it's just a white dot against a black sky. at least the exif data showed the date and time.\r\n\r\ni guess when one sees something that can't be put into words, the brain works at a rapid pace presenting familiar objects and one by one ruling them out. in my case candle flame, hot air balloon, and even boiling water because of the yellow/gold dots/orbs on the top behaving like bubbles. but in each case, if i try to force myself to accept the \"earthly\" explanations, there is something that is off, sometimes way off. for example, flame that is not flickering, and is more like light whose source is distorted. and this is where debunkers \"get\" eyewitnesses. they'd say if it looks like a flame then it's a flame. but to the witness there is always something off.\r\n\r\nit's probably like showing, say, a person in biblical times fluorescent light and showing it for only 2 minutes. the technology is so far ahead that the person cannot describe it to those who have not seen it.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

positions. around 5 lights were seen in all. i heard no noise. after about about two minutes the lights raised slightly and faded very quickly. \r\n\r\nthe lights were larger/brighter then an airplane and in my opinion were very far away and estimate that most people in the city looking in that direction could see these lights. my guess is they were visible by most in the sacramento valley. they were very similar to the new years eve midnight siting in california (seen on youtube) and when i first saw them thats what i associated them with. would be curious if anyone noticed

it was moving north to south anyway the more i looked at it the craft was flying east to west i was looking for lights and nothing was there so i started looking for a nose and a tail and nothing was there then i seen it up close it was awsome 170 feet in the air one quarter mile away bright gold color i examined it on each end was what i call fish lips it had 7 huge windows in front 4 on the left then a space and 3 on the right the fishlips seemed to devide top and bottom the windows full top and bottom it then deployed a vessel using a particle light on to the surface of the earth and flew away i then seen the tail it had 20 foot tail wings that were like a v shape the vessel was a round shape i could only see the bottom half it connected by a green gassie ring that connected it to the elevator light  it dropped a 4000 lb vessel at a rate of 10 feet per second very slow the vessel was  orange it had definition on the bottom black spots i believe it was put into water and i think its still here today gathering information it may have killed fish in said water after it dropped the vessels it turned and flew back east ","distance":"101-500
