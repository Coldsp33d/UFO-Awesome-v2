couldn’t get it off my mind, after a day or so i started to be able to let go of it enough that i could function lol... i was so consumed that all i could do at work for two days was recall what i remember and put it on paper. speaking of my head, i had a real dull headache all day the day this happened. i woke up at 2am, ( happens often, always 2am). i remember looking at the clock. i felt a presence in my room but was not alarmed at all....More like a feeling of secure. next thing i knew was walking out back on the porch because i was asked to. there was a figure standing next to me and whoever she was, she felt like i knew her, she did not speak a word, but i understood thoughts coming from her and she made me feel calm. when i looked her way i could feel her smiling at me. she turned my way and then looked up like she was saying, “look up”. she did this a few times so i looked up .....There were colors and objects in the sky, it felt good to look at them, then a disc what i thought (after going out back the next morning), was about 30 feet in diameter came towards me, no noise....Nothing, and i said to her \" here comes one now\" it lowered itself silently into the yard and came to a stop what i thought was approx. 10 feet from the ground, and i felt an........Energy, attach to my right side, when the energy connected it made my body vibrate, it felt like it was drawing to me like a magnet, there was this force and i remember feeling the draw… and when it attached, it had a hold on me that basically rendered me powerless, it had full control, and the vibrating i talked about was much more than slight, almost felt like electricity but it wasn’t, and it was short lived, zero pain, feeling very calm and secure and floating kind of at a 45 deg angle toward the ship....And this is when time/memory stopped.....No pain, no terror, actually no emotion that i can remember other than calm. the next thing i remember is floating over my bed for a few seconds then being placed back in it by 4 beings, but could not see who they were or recognize anything about them. i actually could not look at them only see them peripherally in the dark. i was not alarmed...Still felt safe, a good feeling. when i touched my bed i remember i was kind of sideways in it, one leg hanging off one side one arm and part of my head hanging off the other, and that bothered me, as soon as i thought this (as though they were reading my thoughts) they immediately re-floated me and straightened me out with the bed so my head was on the pillow, and i felt the covers being placed on me...... i couldn’t move....That’s it. next thing i realized was the alarm waking me up at 6:30 am.......All the figures, her, and the short people in my room, they all had the ability to be seen and not seen at the same time... , i’m positive the person out back was a female, don’t ask my how it’s just my feeling. i could not distinguish a face, a form, no hands, no smell…nothing, just a dark grey silhouette about as tall as me. now the interesting part...My right hip has itched in the same spot for ever, years, still does periodically. well it was itching real bad when i woke up, same place as it itched for years and after other.... visits. i went into the bathroom wondering why i was in a bit of a haze and itching my hip. it itched so bad it made me look at this area in the mirror and i found this on my hip. i had to take a picture of it, i’ve never seen anything like this. i did not hit anything with my hip. didn’t fall....Nothing. you can see a distinct “v” and brusing in the site. it was there for three days and overnight disappeared. this is my most vivid visit, and like the others, have all been good and very comforting, almost like feeling a connection.\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

highest point of the mountain you could drive to when the event occurred. the area at night was completely dark minus a few campers down the slope from us, but their lights didn't obscure the view at all. the entire milky way was completely visible and it was spectacular.After we had been there going on about 15 minutes i was looking in the direction of the bottom left star in the little dipper constellation, when i saw a very bright flash of white-blue light. i at first assumed it to be a plane since there were many planes in the sky when we came up earlier. then it began to rapidly flash all around the sky, i didn't notice any particular pattern of it, at that point my mother goes \"huh, i've never seen a plane jump around like that, it's odd.\" the thing was making insanely fast 90 degree turns and literally teleporting across incredible distances that nothing on this planet can do. i grew up next to an airport i've seen military planes and aircraft all my life this wasn't a human build. a human going that rate of speed would be killed by the insane g-force in those turns. plus i've never seen a conventional aircraft do a 90 degree turn in less than 1 second and then be in a completely different position just like that. it lasted for about 2 and half minutes then disappeared towards the upper part of my field-of-view.There were 3 witnesses to this event, none of us

outside to enjoy the stars. there is almost no cities around so the stars are intesnsely bri[ght. was enjoying the view when i noticed something out of the corner of my eye, a very bright orange light was traveling slowly and horizontally across to the sky towards the west. the orange light was brighter than any star or planet. coming off the light was an interesting trail of gas like material, it was coming off in a triangular or fan shape (possibly conical) there were 2 primarily bright trails coming off the top and bottom of the object that faded in both axis': between the two trails, and in the area behind the object that it left behind. it was traveling very slowly, and the trail behind it grew in size, the two brighter legs getting wider (or taller) and the entire trail extending farther behind the object, and lasting longer. the trail looked like a very fine gas, and was glowing a very similar color of orange to the object its self. it looked like plasma. i watched the object in amazement for about 20 seconds, until suddenly the light emitting the trail dissapeared, and from the place that the object vanished a shockwave propogated through the trail behind it, causing the trail to dissapear quickly, as the trail was pushed by the shockwave, it looked like a piece of cloth being blown by the wind. everything dissappeared, and then 2 seconds later the orange light re appeared infront of where it vanished, and starting from the light a trail of bright gas began to be emmmited from the light, it moved slowly across th3 sky for another 2 oe 3 seconds and then disappeared again with a second shockwave,\r\n\r\nthe object did not travel very far across the sky, maybe 30 degrees horizontally across the horizon over 20 to 30 seconds.","distance":"Over One

were driving down a highway in a small mountain/foothills region of az. my husband was driving, son was in back seat, and i was up front in the passenger seat. suddenly, over the top, and very near to the top of a \"foothill\"/ small mountain, to my right, coming from the west, appeared a massive, dull black jet type air craft. it was looming, and moving very slowly at a low altitude over the top of the foothill. my husband caught it in corner of his eye and slowed down. this thing flew right in front of us, flying over the highway and slowly disappeared over the mountain on the east side of the highway. we were stunned. \"whoaaaa....What was that\"? i asked my husband, who was a vietnam veteran. he couldn't see it as well as i , because he was driving. we considered the b1 stealth bomber, but dismissed that, because it was much larger than a b1, and did not have the long, slender nose. my husband thought it might be some kind of experimental military air craft. it was solid, had the shape of an aircraft but seemed like a one piece unit with very large wings, & possibly a tail section. the general shape was triangular. additionally, there were no  markings anywhere on the craft, it was flying very slowly, at low level and wasn't making a sound.\r\n it was eerie and unexplainable. we didn't like it. it seemed out of the ordinary and brazen, coming in so low, flying so slowly, in plain view, without seeming to care who caught sight of it. it was menacing, due to the sheer size.\r\ni remember wishing i had a camera to have captured it on film. thought no one would believe us if we tried to describe it. after a few minutes of pondering the thing, we didn't talk about it anymore.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

girl on the other side of the table with the view from the windows says oh a drone.\r\nbut it was def not a drone. i have a dji maric and it looks very different when you can see it. was not a bird either. birds where kind of following one of the 3 objects. it's was white light bulb moving around. time most likely 12:50\r\n2. so the girl and the other guy saw it i wade by seeing it so i got the manifest glasses 50x and was then able to see first all 3 and at the end just one of the moving up and down and horizontal.\r\n3. first we thought a drone. then a bird. but with the magnifying glasses i could see only light bulb..\r\n4. we are in a valley. we saw first the object hovering in the center maybe where the river is. and the 3 balls seem to be moving together and then each of them in a other direction so at the end i able only to follow one. when the flew to high into the white sky they where not visible any more until it reached a grey cloud at it was visible again. then it when down until the visible background was green pasture and trees which made it easy to follow.\r\nthey moved in all 4 directions. no clear path. \r\n5. after seeing them we kept looking a little and where still discussing what it could have been. again not a drone. not a bird. sadly my camera was not charged so impossible to capture a photo also it was most likely wvery difficult even with the 400mm to get a non shaky picture i tried later.\r\n6. well it happen really fast and the last one kind of disappears on the top right side and doesn't appear back :-(\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One
