the sun(there are not sun spots!!) on the left(north) on the first frame. they appear to follow each other as mosquitoes going through your lens. that what i thought it was first but the zoom would have blurred the mosquitoes so much that i wouldn't even see them!!\r\nthe next frame, well, only 1 dots left... and it had moved on the right of the sun(south).\r\n\r\ni am a graphics design, video

witnessed a series of reddish-orange lights flying over the treetops while camping in lebanon, maine.  \r\n\r\nwe were standing in the middle of a field in the campground while our children were participating in an activity when i noticed out of the corner of my eye a formation of lights become visible over the treetops.  at first glance i would gather there were about a dozen or more of these lights flying in formation, some in a straight line and others in a single file behind the other formation.  at first, i figured that it may be a formation of helicopters returning from a military exercise.  there was music playing so i was not able to hear any noise coming from them, hence the reason for believing it was just a helicopter formation.\r\n\r\nafter about 10 minutes of witnessing these lights, and as the event wrapped up, the music stopped, at which point i noticed for the amount of objects i was witnessing, there wasn't a single bit of noise coming from them at all.  at this time, there were well over 20-25 of them passing overhead in varied formations and the noise would have been rather loud for a helicopter formation.  my girlfriend, son and myself were looking at these objects and i said that there was no way that what we were seeing was a helicopter formation as they were completely silent.  i kept telling them that this was not normal to not hear a single sound for the amount of objects we were seeing.  all the time while watching these lights, as they became distantan as bright as they were, they suddenly dimmed out as if they weren't there.\r\n\r\nafter about 20-25 minutes, the activity had seemed to slow down as we were all walking back to our campsite, however looking up at the sky they were coming at roughly 15-20 second intervals in a single file formation once again still no noise.  at this point i started to get a little of that uneasy feeling because i could not explain what it was that i was seeing.  \r\n\r\nwe made it back to camp and lit our fire, meanwhile you could still see what i would describe as \"stragglers\" coming about every 2 minutes or so.  what finally made me realize that what was happening wasn't normal, the last light i saw through the trees was flying at a different direction more to the right of the original formations, then came to a stop and made an abrupt \"course correction\" to the left where the other objects were seen going.  \r\n\r\ni tried to film these objects when i got back to camp as i left my phone there charging in my vehicle, however the quality of the phone and the thick canopy of the trees would not allow me to capture these on video.  \r\n\r\n  ","distance":"101-500

lights moving around each other about a mile or so in the sky. it was hard to tell from that distance if i was seeing two objects moving around each other or one object with two lights on the side spinning. after about 5 minutes it only appeared as one object that hovered in place. i was starring so much that my partner tried to get a look but couldn't see that far away. she said i can't see what your looking at but i can see that. at that point i stopped focusing on what i was originally looking at and saw an object moving to my right and traveling west to east. it had the same speed as the airplanes that are constantly going  over head toward seattle. i pulled out my cell phone in a race to get a video but picked my camera option by mistake and got a photo. i quickly got the video camera going and started filming it. it moved at a consistent speed toward the original object i had observed. it finally stopped and hovered close to the original object. they sat in the sky for 3

next thing that he remember is falling from sky which usually taking around 15 seconds for him to see himself and coming back to his body and he had a very painful stomach pain that lasted around 3 hours and pain got despaired after that. \r\nagain mike called and told me this story which i told him that mike you are being abducted but when i don't know their style is different because grey's have to come and take you physically but in your case you are getting abducted while you are sleep. since that day i have not let him sleep at his place no more. the night after he had a dream that he is in the same room and the usual 4 are around his bed and this time there is a female on top of him and facing the other way having intercourse with him which he panicked and woke up and tried to keep himself up which around 6 am he fall sleep again and the same thing happened to him.    \r\nafter hearing this story he told me that even though they are hologram but their hand when its move its not hologram (at this moment that i thought he is going to say that their hands are light gray and very slim which in my surprise said their hands are light green and its like lizard. i was so shocked and amazed that he was getting abducted by reptilians and that's why their style is completely different than greys. my next move was finding a hypnotherapist that could hypnotize him that we have that as a prove and also know what happened to him which on same evening they talk to him again he was in the sky and usual 4 surrounded him and the one in the back of him have 2 fingers on top of his head and talking to him telepathically and said to him that mike we are watching you in a long time ( which in the recent abduction told him that we watched you on your first life and we abducted you on your second, third, and this is your 4th life ). they told him that why you think your mom is still alive( the doctors told her mom that she had only 3 months to live 6 years ago because of cancer) and she is very well now.\r\nthen they talk about me that in the begging they used to call me  (best friend) that have lots of knowledge regarding different kind of aliens.   they told him that we will bring you up tomorrow and we will have a surprise for you.\r\nthis ongoing events which will be 40 to 50 more pages which i cant even mention some of them due to public is not ready for that .................\r\ni just want to share just one of many amazing things that they could do is that their technology after one billion years is so amazing that i am watching him is deep sleep but when his breathing change he is gone and wherever he land he has a physical body also!

entered the nj turnpike on exit 4 and had been driving northbound for approximately 10-30 minutes when i saw a ball/oval shaped object traveling at a high rate of speed directly in front of me in the distance. it ascended very rapidly and made a slight turn which caught my attention, then it traveled directly towards me. as i traveled northbound it traveled southbound directly over the nj turnpike. off in the distance was a small airplane carrying one of those big beach advertisments. the object was between me and the plane in the distance ( i remember the plane being yellowish or light in color). i would think the plane would have been able to see the object too as it looks like the object originated very close to where the plane was. i did not see any wings on the object, when i saw it i was a bit surprised and didnt know what it was, i estimate it as about the size of a helicopter although it was a ball shape it had no tail like a helicopter would. i turned my radio down and opened my window as the object quickly approached but i heard no noise as i typically would if it were a helicopter. the whole event from the moment i saw the object until it passed over me was probably no more then 8 seconds, it was very quick.\r\n\r\ni am the son of a retired pilot. cars, motorcycle, helicopters, planes, hot-air balloons all interest me and i am familair with many

assigned aboard a u.S. navy ticonderoga class guided-missile cruiser in the persian gulf, i saw a black, equilateral triangle-shaped aircraft with three bright, white lights, one in each corner, flying directly over our ship. our ship was part of the uss independence carrier battle-group, and at the time of the sighting we were underway in the central or southern persian gulf. the sighting occurred sometime between midday and 3pm local gulf time, though i cannot recall the exact date or day of the week, and it occurred at the tail-end of an underway replenishment (unrep) exercise between our ship and the carrier. i���d learned a few minutes earlier while i was at my workstation inside that our ship was very shortly going to pull up alongside the aircraft carrier to carry out an unrep. having never seen one of these exercises, i���d made my way topside in order to get a better view of the activities, and i ended up well above decks at the upper-most and most forward location of the ship that i could reach. this put me somewhere atop the forward superstructure above the bridge and very near the ship���s main mast. \r\n\r\nour ship was moving at approximately 10-20 knots and pulled alongside the independence to begin the unrep drills involving both vessels being attached to one another by lines, cables, and fuel hoses. the two ships maintained a set distance between one another while matching each other���s course and speed. weather conditions at the time were good and typical for the region in june and july. it was mostly sunny with scattered clouds. as is typical of the region, the air was very thick with a haze caused by the high humidity. the air temperature was in the upper 90s to near 100 degrees and visibility seemed limited to just a few miles, i���m guessing three to four miles at most. there were several other sailors around me when the sighting occurred, some sightseeing and others working various assigned tasks. \r\n\r\nthe sighting started by my first hearing a deep, almost thunderous roar that was, at first, difficult to discern insofar as its point of origin. the next few seconds before actually sighting the aircraft were spent quickly glancing around to try and figure out where the sound was coming from. i spend a lot of time describing the sound below because it played such a prominent role in the sighting, at least initially. the roar sounded close but not too close. that is to say it was very similar to being near an airfield when jet fighters take off at full power and fly over you as they depart the area. in that case, for example, the viewer might be some distance away from the airbase, say, maybe a mile or two. there was a doppler-shift to the sound. approximately three to five seconds elapsed between first hearing the aircraft and when i realized that the sound was actually coming from overhead. this confusion was due to the fact that there was so much going on around me at the moment. the ambient environment was full of other loud noises of all types, including the high-pitched whine of the gas turbine exhaust from the ship���s main powerplant, the rushing or whishing sound from the filtered air intake feeding the powerplant (which is, i believe, a dc-10 engine down-geared to drive the main shaft), plus the sounds of men shouting, bullhorns or speakers blaring, and so forth. as loud as the environment already was, this new thunderous sound, which seemed like a pulsing sort of roar, seemed to overpower all the other sounds around me. it was very strong, and i felt it in my chest as much as i heard it, and it was as if it was pounding my body. \r\n\r\nmy first thought was that the sound was coming from aircraft launching from the carrier right beside us, though i knew this couldn���t be the case during an unrep. from my vantage point i could also see several parked aircraft on the starboard side of the carrier���s flight deck. i���d noticed that all of the aircraft were parked, many with wings folded and tie-down chains clearly attached, and it was clear that no fixed-wing flight operations were underway. i also quickly glanced back aft on the carrier to where the jet engine testing racks are located. it briefly occurred to me that squadron mechanics might be running an engine up in one of the test stands, which i���d personally seen a couple years before during desert shield while temporarily assigned to the independence. there were no indications there were any engines being tested for lack of hot vapor signature or smoke. my quick visual survey had lasted just three seconds or so before finally looked directly overhead.  \r\n\r\nthe aircraft i saw was black, triangle-shaped (like an equilateral triangle) with brilliantly white, round lights or spots inset within each of the three rounded corners. the aircraft appeared to be moving at around 250-500 mph on the same general heading as that of our two underway vessels, which i took to be roughly n/ne at the time based on the sun's position. the sun was above and behind me on my left. the aircraft appeared to be climbing out, though not on a steep ascent, but rather gradually climbing to a higher altitude after, perhaps, taking off from somewhere not too far away. it definitely wasn���t descending, and it didn't appear to be on an approach vector for landing. this aircraft was almost directly overhead our position and seemed to have flown right up our wake. \r\n\r\nthough mostly sunny, the high temperature and high humidity caused my view of the craft to be somewhat less that crystal clear in that it wasn���t a hard or crisp, deep black color. nonetheless, i could easily tell it was black and the view was certainly sharp enough to discern the distinct triangle shape and rounded corners. all three sides appeared equal in length. the shape and color was stunning enough to me, but the three extremely bright, circular spots on its underside were baffling. they were exceedingly bright to the point that they seemed to pierce through the high-heat haze in the sky. in fact, they were dazzling in their brilliance, though not as bright as a welding arc. there was no condensation or exhaust trail of any kind that i could tell, plus i got the immediate sense that the aircraft wasn���t at all high enough to produce a vapor trail. i could not make out any control surfaces, such as vertical tail/s, fins, canards, etc. as for size, the aircraft was as wide as my little finger with my arm fully extended (see attached powerpoint illustration, of which there are two slides, one depicting the sighting from my position and the other depicting a zoomed view). \r\n\r\ni immediately knew that i was seeing something radically different from anything i���d ever seen before. i was absolutely stunned by what i saw. i���d studied aircraft and aviation history since my early childhood, and i���d spent most of my time in the navy working in the aviation community, aboard a carrier, around airfields, etc. i stayed current with aviation developments for years by reading various publications, including jane���s defense weekly and aviation week & space technology. i immediately knew this was not a b-2 spirit or f-117 nighthawk. \r\n\r\nmy view of this aircraft lasted between 5-10 seconds, and about midway through the sighting i noticed that others standing near me were also looking at it with several guys yelling out as to what it could be. we were all just standing and looking in amazement (see note below). the deep rumbling sound had seemed to fade away a bit. although the initial roar or rumbling sound was the audible cue that had initially alerted me to the aircraft���s presence, the sound seemed to fade or change from the deep roar to something less distinctive. it was hard to hear due to the other noises i described earlier. in other words, the roar faded away and we were left with the ambient environmental sounds of the ships power plant, the activities going on around us, and the aircraft passing overhead and moving away. \r\n\r\nour view was suddenly and almost violently interrupted by an ear-shattering series of blasts from the ship's horn which, unbeknownst to me at the time, was located very close by. these sudden horn blasts were so loud that i physically cringed, bent over, and brought my hands up to cover my ears. i yelled out in pain along with several others, and we scattered to get away from the horn. i asked what the horn was all about and was told that it is used to signal the end of the unrep exercise itself, or in the case, to announce the maneuver we went into called emergency breakaway. this was all new to me, but the immediately the crew were set to action to \"break the lines���, real everything back aboard, and then each ship soon began a sharp turn away from the other in order to put as much space between themselves in the shortest time possible. i suppose a blast from a ships horn is no big deal to most folks, and it wouldn���t have made such an impact on me either if i hadn���t been standing so close to it and had it not interrupted the most incredible flying craft i���d ever seen. had it not been for that the i might've got a longer view of the aircraft. \r\n\r\ni have discussed this sighting with only a few folks over the years, but i've never formally reported it. i���ve often wondered whether the emergency break-away drill was coordinated to distract people from spotting the aircraft over our heads, though i know that is mere conjecture. the discussions about this sighting have been mostly at work in secure settings where i���d hoped someone might have offered some amplifying information. i���ve even drawn it on a whiteboard for folks, but to date no one that i���ve talked to has ever offered an explanation other than speculating that it was u.S.-developed. a few things are for certain - it was undoubtedly directly overhead a u.S. aircraft carrier battle group underway in the central or southern persian gulf. although the two vessels were engaged in an exercise between them, all the electronic apparatus on both vessels were radiating and rotating, to use a navy expression. the vessel i was on has the aegis combat system and the an/spy-1 radar system. having been personally been inside the combat spaces aboard ship during operations, and having worked closely with the radar guys in carrying out my own duties, i knew then and know now that the capabilities afforded by these system are exceptional, to say the least. i have believe that they were fully aware of this aircraft flying right up our wake and directly overhead the battle group. \r\n\r\nattached sketch: i've attempted to illustrate using powerpoint what the aircraft looked like as it passed directly overhead, including overlaying a light gray matting and using transparency to depict the haze caused by the heat and humidity that day. these sketches are based on my 'minds eye' recollection of the aircraft's position, the approximate time of day, estimated direction of travel, and the suns position relative to my own. \r\n\r\nnote: i only list myself, 1, as the total number of witnesses for this report because, although there were several other guys around me at the time of the sighting that i know also saw the aircraft, i was not part of the ship's crew, did not know them personally, and we all seemed to go our separate ways once the exercise activities were completed. i believe it is possible that many, many others that day witnessed the same thing.

my smart phone app), which was predicted to peak at 21:39:17 at elevation 63 degrees and azimuth 97 degrees at my home location at approximately 45 seconds before the flare was to peak (i had been alerted by a 1 min alarm on my app and walked outside).  at almost the same time that the iridium satellite became visible moving north to south, i observed another object, moving approximately from 300 degrees to 120 degrees, at an elevation similar to that of the iridium satellite.  this object was a single, large, white pinpoint, quite bright, moving at a constant speed.  it moved across the sky much faster than the satellite, but much slower than any meteor i have seen.  it covered approximately 60 degrees of sky before fading from view in the light pollution or passing into the earth���s shadow at an approximate angle of elevation of 40 degrees.  the elapsed time of observation was approximately 10 seconds, beginning approximately 10 degrees from zenith, crossing at or near zenith, and fading.  there was no sound, no appearance of a trail of any kind, and no indication of a debris trail.  \r\n\r\nsky condition was very slight haze, sufficient to obscure dim stars, but bright stars were visible.  light pollution to the east of my location fading at approximately 40 degrees elevation.  sunset at my location was at 20:51; eect 21:11, eent 21:43, eeat 22:10 (from a smart phone app).  moonset at my location was at 21:43 (according to gps).  moon phase was two days past new.\r\n\r\nthis object was unlike any meteor i have seen.  it covered the sky much too fast to have been any aircraft that i am familiar with.  it had disappeared just prior to the iridium satellite flare peak.  the iridium satellite was predicted to reach a magnitude of -8.5.  the unidentified object was of constant magnitude somewhat less than that, although still bright, i estimate it roughly at magnitude -4.0.\r\n\r\nat the time of the observation, the sun angle was still such that the iridium 84 satellite was illuminated by the sun; if the unidentified object was illuminated by the sun, it had to be at an altitude similar to that of iridium 84.  i could not tell if it was self-illuminated.\r\n \r\ni have never seen anything comparable to this unidentified object.  the speed with which it covered approximately 60 degrees of arc across the sky was incompatible with any object that i have previously observed; too fast to be a satellite or aircraft, too slow for a meteor or space junk. there was no variation in magnitude and no visible signs of trailing debris.  there was no sound of propulsion or sonic shock.  it was inconsistent with any of those phenomena from my prior observations. \r\n \r\ni have been observing the sky for over 50 years.  i regularly observe passes of the international space station and other visible satellites.  i regularly observe meteor showers.  i consider myself an extraordinarily qualified observer, having experience in civilian aviation, military operations, scientific data collection, and field surveying.

indoor/outdoor carpet in the apartment.  i had a cat.  i was laying in bed one night reading.  the cat was not in the room with me.  the cat made a certain sound when he walked along the carpet.  and, i heard a sound that was not my cat.  i could hear the footsteps and they were definitely not my cat.  i saw the clock and it was around 11 p.M.  my heart started racing, and i threw my head under the covers.  i was screaming in my head because nothing was coming out of my mouth that they should leave me alone of i would die.  my heart was pounding so hard in my chest that i thought it would explode.  \r\n\r\nthe next thing i know, it was as if the cat was dropped on my stomach.  i say this because as soon as he hit my belly he ran out of the room.  i found myself lying there in the bed.  my body was straight.  the blanket was pulled up to my armpits with my arms straight against my body. i looked at the clock and saw that it was around 3:00 a.M.  i would have thought that this is how someone wakes up in the hospital.\r\n\r\nnow i have to say that i am known to wreck a bed.  i do not sleep in one place and am a stomach sleeper.  my blankets and sheets every night are a total mess, so waking up as i did was unusual.\r\n\r\ni discovered a triangular mark on my shin.  it resembles a freckle but this was not there before.\r\n\r\ni would love to know what happened in my missing

building. i could tell that it it was moving because it would glint every so often in different areas of the object. at first i thought, silver birthday balloons that got away. but i kept watching it since it was slightly windy, and considering the altitude it was at, it wasn't floating away, it was staying in the same place. it hovered over a building much less than a quarter mile away and eventually hovered away until i lost sight of it behind a building. the entire sighting lasted nearly 5 minutes, and there were several witnesses. no one could really figure out what they were seeing, even myself. i ran inside my building, grabbed the office camera, and was able to take many images of the object. in reviewing the images, the most amazing thing about it is that the object seemingly takes on several radical shapes and splits into pieces. so many different shapes in fact, that in almost every picture, it takes on a different shape, radically different from the other. how could this be for an object that could still move around and hover? it eventually hovered in the opposite direction from where i was standing and i lost sight of it as it went behind the building closest to
