parallel to the plane, then began to overtake them and in the ends flies in front of the nose of the airplane at a greater distance, until it lost both skyline . at the time of the photographs, dozens of people around began to realize what was happening and looked up in the sky observing and commenting on the paradox of the case. \r\nanalyzing the incident harris, said the identity of shiny objects: \"there is no known conventional military aircraft to fly with such speed, to reflect sunlight and it not after exhaust! so we talk, or an alien flying saucer, or a secret human aircraft, there escort the plane after the incessant crashes occurring in the last days.\"\r\nin a further statement, harris, excluded also the case of a reflection of a plane in icy cloud crystals, not only because of july and the clear skies of that evening, but also because the strange glow was not after the sun but between him and the object.\r\nmore, for the strange passage through the next issue of

sound), flying northeast, then finally diagonally up out of the atmosphere until they were too high to observe (imagine an elongated check mark trajectory) it appeared that these objects changed course and then exited the atmosphere. these objects appeared to have no discernible surface, however showed an organic quality much like a distant flame hovering through the skies, instead of an

day (7/28/14)when i began reviewing and editing my pictures.\r\n\r\nwhile looking at my pictures, i kept noticing a star like object directly in the center of several of the pictures. initially, i believed this to be nothing more than a bright star, dust, or something on the lens of the camera. upon further examination of the pictures (zooming in), i discovered that the object in one of the pictures was star like, but in the other pictures, it is more disc shaped (looking from the side).\r\n\r\nbeing a reasonable individual, i kept looking at these pictures and perhaps, at first, the object could have been plane or helicopter...Or something from ft. campbell, but during the time the object was there (in all the pictures it is in) it stayed in the same location (position) and did not move. still being reasonable and looking for another explanation, perhaps the object was a satellite or the international space station. but the object seems to be below the clouds that appear in the pictures. but, after looking at some of my other pictures, the object no longer appears in any of them, only during a certain period of time. there very well could be some other reasonable explanation, but, i do not see what it could be at this time. upon zooming in on the object (shown in the pictures), the object is of no design i have ever seen before (but i am in no way part of

prominent reddish-orange object to the north.  i thought it was a plane on approach to the regional airport, but it was pulsating irregularly and didn't seem to be moving.  i stood so that a telephone pole was in the foreground, giving me a point of reference, and it indeed was not moving.  as i alerted my fiance to the sight, it started drifting slowly to the left (west), crossing behind the telephone pole (distance behind pole is unknown), then changed directions towards the north.  this was not a slow, wide change as a plane would make, but sudden, sharp (yet smooth) directional changes.  as it was drifting to the north, it abruptly disappeared, and we did not see it again.\r\n\r\ni am positive this object was not a plane, as, while it was not large, it was large enough that, if an incoming plane, it would have been low and therefore would be making noise, which this object did not.  also, as it charged directions, the amount of light emitted did not change, as it would with a banking plane; additionally, the light was pulsating irregularly and was a reddish-orange, uncommon for planes.  besides that, the object was hovering in place when we first spotted it, which was determined by the placement of the above mentioned telephone pole in my field of vision for a point of reference.  \r\n\r\nin an attempt to identify the object, it may have been a type of chinese lantern, as it seemed to hover and change directions in the way i've seen these lanterns behave; however, chinese lanterns usually have companions, and this light was solitary.  i am sure it wasn't a

the tree line in the direction of dallas g.A.\r\ni spotted an orange ,almost amber in color bright light, in the shape of a ball. it seemed to be scanning the air and ground. it emited a yellow light in the form of a beam/ray. i immediately ran into the house to get my binoculars. when i rushed back out, it had phased out behind the clouds.\r\ni waited a few moments and sure enough it phased back into sight. with excitement i watched as it scanned more of the air and ground. this occurred for nearly 45 min's. as it seemingly sat in the same general area.\r\nonce it finished what it was doing, it began to move north , northeast toward woodstock g.A. but in doing so it changed form and color. it became round and saucer shaped instead of ball shaped. the colors went away aswell. the object was tilted forward and had begun to pulse lights of white, blue and green down the side's. it was spinning while moving forward with these lights going in order all the way around it. it traveled very fast and was soon out of my view. i felt energized and full of excitement because i knew it hadn't been a plane, or helicopter. i see those regularly and can easily identify them day or night. i knew i had experienced something special. oddly enough my neighbor across from me had seen something similar in the night sky on a separate night and informed me after i told him what i had seen. leading me to believe that whatever this was, may just return some night in the near future. if it does, this time i will record it if at all possible. but i can definatly describe and sketch this object for i believe it has burned the image into my memory for the rest of my life.","distance":"Over One

limena. we spotted a couple of disc shaped objects hovering high in the clear night sky, a colored glowing one chasing a white one. the colored one's surface was glowing in different colors. the other one had a white color and a more rounded shape. then we saw a massive group of lights in front of them: we still cant say if it was a massive fleet of single objects or a one bug object made of hundreds of colored lights. we could nit see any shape, too dark in the sky, no moon or other known objects as a reference. a couple of other guys stopped their car behind us and witnessed the entire phenomenon with us. no picture taken, i took a video with my crappy blackberry but nothing visible. the sight lasted about 20 mins, the the fleet all together moved up slowly and we believe it disappeared over the clouds.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

the east .. went across the pleiades at 4:50 am exact time .. low brightness almost dull and that color did not change with 1. its position in the sky or 2. the sun being just below the eastern horizon. \r\n\r\nit must have had some sort of surface that filtered out most reflections.\r\nthe orbit was lower than most and the speed far greater than the original plodding space shots. i dubbed this one \"jack the ripper.\"\r\n\r\ncould this be a one orbit and \"land/blow up\" .. \"special drop able hardware package\" .. sneak info gathering space shot? if so was it ours .. across america in the dark .. taking pictures else where .. asia?\r\n\r\non the 24th i had a night time view of the milky way superior to anything in my life for clarity .. clouds of stars .. a trail .. and smaller clouds of stars .. etc. .. thin trails and masses.\r\n\r\nabout 15 minutes prior to the above .. 4:35 am .. i saw a regular old fashioned satellite .. s to n .. go over at my zenith .. directly
