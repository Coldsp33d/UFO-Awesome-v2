new bedford massachusetts to westport, massachusetts when something  in the sky over the southwest horizon caught my eye. it was an orange/ yellow and reddish  glowing ball that seemed to shoot straight up from the horizon in the southwest over the tree line, maybe about 500 feet. so i pulled over into the breakdown lane to watch it because i thought i was imagining this. wow a ufo i thought maybe? so i watched it do some fantastic maneuvers while i called some different people to tell them about what i was seeing!! this thing then hovered there for  a couple of minutes then it suddenly darted up about another 500 feet and then darted left or to the  south and hovered there. kind of at  90 degree angle. i could not believe my eyes. i was awestruck! then as  i was watching that one another one did the same thing it shot straight up from the tree line to about 500 feet  hovered then darted left or south just underneath the first one and hovered there  for about 2 minutes then it darted straight up maybe about  another 500 feet or so as if to be side by side with the first one and they both hovered there. then to my surprise  a treat! up came another one, a third one! came straight up from the horizon over the tree line to about 500 feet hovered for a few minutes then darted south just underneath the other two that were still hovering above. i thought this is amazing! i am seeing three ufo's i am so lucky. the third one did the same as the first two. they all then were hovering in a straight row the all of a sudden they all darted south then just disappeared!!!! i will never forget this! i am not very good with dates, times and distance but i will never forget this date!!! i have no photos wish i did but i was too busy on the phone telling people what i was seeing!!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional

on hole number four and was standing around looking at the sky which was still sunny for being well past 8pm but several darks clouds were moving across the sky as well. i noticed a solid gray disc-shaped object hovering about 100 feet above the tree tops across the street from the road aligning the left side of the fairway facing north east. at first glance i thought it was a big balloon of some sort.  as i got closer to it i noticed it wasn't moving at all and it was too low to be a plane or anything. it looked to be maybe 10-20 feet in diameter.  i kept staring at it and just couldn't figure out what heck it was.  i was totally mesmerized and didn't wanna stop looking at it but i had to move to the green because people were waiting to tee off behind me. unfortunately the tall pines surrounding it blocked my view of the object but i assumed it would still be sitting there when i finished putting and crossed the street to the next hole. i finished putting quickly and went out to the street and it was gone. i was really disappointed as i thought i'd be able to get my phone out of my bag and snap a few pictures. i never imagined i would see something like that

rumson nj 1971. as our family up from florida on vacation were headed home to stay with relatives we saw a light in the sky near the old rumson high school football field. what we saw was a craft almost as large as the field. i got out of the car and just stared at it. while staring noticed several other cars had pulled into parking lot. some crying. when i got back into the car everyone but our 5 family members were gone. i was the last of the family to get back into the car. looking out the window and noticing we were the ony ones in the parking lot pop just said they must have left. at that time and for a couple days the subject never came up. and it did not seem important to ant of us. i was the foster child of this family and they returned to florida and i stayed in nj at a new foster house. as i have gotten older now 58 i have very very memories about that night. i am out of touch with ex foster family so i don't know how they are dealing with it or even remember it,but the memories i have are not fictitious, but kind of like   you should tell someone about this. years ago i found an old apro ufo case that was submitted by my foster mother. it starts with mr. and mrs. a from florida with a drawing of the craft and a brief account of the evening. have tried to find file...Kids used floppy disc for music when first got computer and lost the info. well end of story...I was in craft...Sort of tortured for awhile. then one of them put his hand on my head and all pain subsided. we then spoke telepathically but after that only remember being shown parts of the universe through what seemed to be a huge window and the alien pointing and trying to describe things. i was only 16. i am reaching out for help. annoyed that i have tried to find more info about that night without a good response.\r\n\r\n  thanks steve","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"01:30:18","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),  Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Path

and we were saying our goodbyes on our driveway just before midnight.  i was showing my friend and his family how beautiful the stars are at our location and was pointing out the milky way galaxy and other constellations.  i was pointing out our house faces a north easterly position and used the point of reference for north and south with the \"handle\" of the big dipper, and then roughly by 20 degrees from my over head position directly west there was a very bright light that seemed to open and close as if a door had opened or closed on the object.  it had the intesity of about a 1/10 of a full moon.  i watched it and and as it dulled i noticed a dim light about the intensity of a satelite running across the night sky but i was struck by how slow it was moving.  after my eyes adjusted after a few seconds i noticed that  there were two smaller lights trailing the lead light that i had originally identified.  i pointed it out to my friends who had been watching along as well.  \"do you see that triangle?\"  everyone agreed and we watched in disbelief.  i initally thought it may have been 3 jet fighters flying together as there is a local military base that frequently flies maneuvers, but they rarely are at night and ther was no sound.  then there were these tiny spots of light even less intense theat started to dart off in random directions off the main triangle shapped object.  a couple of them briefly swarmed around the triangle object for a brief few seconds and disapeared.  when the object was just roughly 10 degrees past overhead to the east (roughly 3-5 minutes after initial sighting) it stopped in mid air and hovered silently for an additional 5 minuetes.  then it slowly just moved on at the same pace in an easterly direction until slowly out of site when it reached the  mountain range roughly 30 miles east of our home.  i felt disbelief.  it was observed by 6 of us.  i feel we were all a little shaken up about the experience and we hastily said our goodbyes and they drove off and i ran back in the house to check on my children who were still sound asleep in their beds.
