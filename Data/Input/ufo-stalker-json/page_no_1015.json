mufon,\r\n\r\nthe report i���m about to present is of utter importance and attention.\r\nfirst of all i was not a believer in ufos and stuff since i only believe what i see until this ufo sighting. i was so very distressed after this sighting that i planned to report it to isro, india. but then i contacted a friend of mine and he suggested that it'll be of no use. he told me that i should watch hangar 1 that was being telecasted on history tv 18 at that time. mufon case files changed my vision a lot and i pledged to report it to any concerned authority other than dying with this secret.\r\n\r\nbut before reporting the incident i would like to describe my place of residence i.E. babina. it is actually the biggest army base in india. i being the son of a retired army personnel, know the military might of this area but i cannot disclose anything further. just to give you an insight of what is it, i would tell you that every year the singapore \r\narmy visits only this place in india for military training. even the u.S. marines came here in 2010 for training.\r\n\r\nthe incident:-\r\nthose days the temperature was scorching like 48-49 degree celsius in our state with frequent electricity cutoffs for hours. it was on 18th june when we decided to spend some time on the roof stargazing and to experience some cool breeze that used to blow at night. so at about 10:15 pm we went there and lay down stargazing and chatting.\r\nat nearly 10:36 pm something caught my attention that flew past my peripheral vision and immediately i glanced at it, watching me act so rapidly my younger brother too saw at the same direction. both of us witnessed some ghostly balls flying very slowly and noiselessly. it lasted for about 10secs until i lost it amidst the far sky. it was a cloudy night, no stars and winds were blowing pretty fast so we couldn���t really figure out what those things were. really we couldn���t come to any conclusion, it could be anything. \r\nkeeping this in mind we planned to go once again, this time with equipment like binoculars, pen and paper. but the next day due to some important work none of us could go there for a single minute. \r\n\r\nthe very next day i.E. 20th june 2014 we reached on our roof, picked the same spot, lied down. but this time we were in deep confusion about whether we could be able see it this time. reason was that night the conditions were completely antagonistic to the previous night of sighting. no wind, no clouds, visible stars, all the locality was lit up since there was no electricity cutoff, loud music coming from nearby marriage house etc.\r\n \r\nat the same time like the previous night i.E. 10:40 pm we (me, my younger brother, my mother) witnessed 5 (this time clearly visible) orbs, dim yellow in color, randomly glowing, in a fixed formation, from south east, flying at a constant speed of about 20kmph, at above 20-25ft above head, noiselessly and went towards north west (towards the military base). \r\n\r\nin its course of flight, the time when it came just above our head, all three of us were just speechless. i remember the shiver that went through my body. i couldn���t��� even pick up the pen and write the details at the same time. we didn���t even required the binoculars as it was so clearly seen. yeah i was an ufo because i���ve never seen such a thing in my life. i was born and brought up in a military background so i can trust my senses and yes i���m damn sure it was an ufo.\r\nwe were so terribly in shock that we didn���t even move. we lost its sight when it went too far and diminished. in all it was visible for 15-20secs but it seemed that we saw it for an hour. \r\n\r\nafter that time i ran down and wrote the whole incident on paper and also made a sketch so that i do not forget what i saw. amazing sighting.\r\n\r\nthank you.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

light over the far end of the lake when i noticed what at first seemed to be a bright light sitting over the far end of our lake. i stepped out into the yard for a better look and noticed than it just looked different than a star in some way. as i watched closely i noticed it moving slowly to the left and then to the right. at times i could see the surrounding sky light up in a reddish / pinkish glow but only for a brief moment each time. i went in the house and took pics with my cell phone but only got somewhat jerky shots of a white dot. at this time i called my wife out to view it with me.......She agreed......It was moving...........Slowly but moving....Sometimes descending and sometimes ascending. i then went into my house to get a better camera on a tripod. i got a couple of shots and as the camera has crosshairs of sorts you could position the object in the center of the lens and could watch in the lens as it moved from the center and up the the upper right section of the lens. i tried to get a short video but could not even find it in the lens in this mode........Only in photo mode did it appear. i noted that we had watched it approximately 45 minutes and it was rather chilly out ( upper 40's to low 50s. also the sky was clear although there was some low hanging fog over the lake that in no way interfered with our viewing. i  felt very fortunate to have seen whatever it was. i have no idea what this could have been and would like to read another report that coincided with my report to see what they saw that night / early morning. was not afraid, overly excited or the like..............Just very curious.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:45:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

recounting our day to each other.  we keep our windows open on summer evenings.  i was sitting with my back to the west, facing my wife in the east, and to my right is the southern window.  i have a tendency to be observant of noises and movements... call it skiddishness or whatnot, but out of the peripheral to my right i saw a light to the south.  it was 35 to 45 degrees above the horizon, and traveling east.  we live near the airport, so air traffic is common.  my father is a pilot, and i have been around aircraft my entire life, so,  when i noticed that this light was very bright, and did not blink, i turned to my right to view it more observant ly.  at that time, i saw that the object, which was football-blimp shaped, was extremely bright, like an arc light from welding, emitting greens, blues and pinks at the corona of the light.  this piqued my interest, and i asked my wife to look at it.  she had noticed my reaction and was already leaning in to look at what i was reacting to.  for a moment, i thought it might be a firework, as we have seen/heard them every weekend since the fouth, but this object zig-zagged in a downward motion ain't then dropped suddenly.  my wife saw it as well, and we both went to the back yard to continue looking, our previous conversation forgotten.  there was a sound that accompanied the object, actually, it precluded it... like high-frequency, glass upon glass.  i heard it again after the sighting ended, but now the sound is gone.  the entire sighting lasted approximately two minutes.  this is the fifth sighting i have had in my lifetime, but by far the clearest.  i am certain that this was not a known craft to my knowledge, nor was it a firework.  the movement was smooth and intentional.

out of 30. kathleen marden  contacted me and she put me in touch with michele. after speaking to him about what seems to be a lifetime of possible abductions, he asked me to fill this form out.  the only memory i have of seeing a ufo was the night i was on my back deck with my husband. we observed a bright light grow and quickly maneuver in the sky. it mad directional changes that seemed impossible. as it appeared closer, the light grew larger and hovered just off our property line, but still high in the sky. i ran inside the house to lock the doors, feeling of fear came over me. my husband would not come in so i went back out so i wouldn't be alone. we watched the hovering light for a while.I have had strange paranormal occurrences for as long as i can remember. i thought it was normal and that the house was haunted. my mother had very strange thing happen as well. in 2010 after the light in the sky i started to have ���sleep paralysis��� after having it in 2010 i remembered that i use to have thing all the time as a child throughout my teens. i found it very odd that i would forget something like that. in 2013 i had another ���sleep paralysis��� episode, this time i was fully awake, fought off my attackers and was able to recall more of what happened the next day. i also had bruises and marks on my legs and body.  after the encounter i no longer thought i was dealing with ghost or sleep paralysis. \r\ni was the only one awake and i was watching shark week late night. i was sitting in my bed and the room light up. i walked to my window, where the light was coming from, and looked out. i couldn't see anything so i got back in bed and as i looked up at the t.V. i could see a dark figure standing at the foot of my bed. i stared at it, and it stared at me. i was trying to figure out what it was. i felt like it was trying to force me to sleep, like i was being sedated and paralyzed. over the years i had developed a strong intuition, and empathic abilities so i attempted to mentally fight back. i refused to sleep! a second shadow appeared and zapped me! my head felt like it was going to explode; i could hear a loud noise that vibrated from my ears and head down my body. it zapped me three times before rendering me unconscious.  i never thought about the possibility of aliens before this night. i always thought i was a demon or ghost that was tormenting me over the years but after that night i started to look into the possibility. this year i have seen these things 5 or 6 times in the last few months monday july 21st being the most recent. i can't remember much just bits but i see the evidence the next day. i have been taking pictures of the ���scoop marks���, scars and bruising on my body. my oldest son has seen them too on the same nights i have but has no marks.   \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

5:45 to 6:15 am.  i went outside expecting to see a bright ufo object because i have seen it before.\r\n\r\nthe unusual thing is that i played a game with the ufo.  i positioned my line of sight so that a tree was near.  i stared at the ufo for about 10 seconds and then i blocked my view ufo with the tree.  the ufo moved into my field of vision.  i played this game with the ufo 9 times and it moved up, left and right.  it is crazy to think that the ufo was observing me but that is my only conclusion.  why would a tiny ball of light pay attention to my field of vision.  i call this game \"peek a boo\" and i have played it hundreds of times with various light sources that seem to move.\r\n\r\nthese things have happened in the last 9 months.\r\n\r\nat night the stars in my area seem too bright.  i can view them even when my house light is on.  i can see them if i am standing under a street light.  one day i looked out of my kitchen window and i saw a \"star\" in front of the tall trees.  i rushed outside and i saw the light going upward like it was on a long piece of wire.  another time i was looking at an unusual light and i saw a star light descend.  the movement is very smooth.  \r\n\r\nnear the beginning, around 9 months ago, i was outside looking at the lights because they seemed unusual and a star light was descending right above me.  it was still in the sky but i could see it was coming down toward me.  i rushed inside, took a few breaths, and then went back outside.  i could see the star light descend, wait a few seconds, and then ascend.  \r\n\r\nnear the beginning i woke up unusually early, around 5:45am, and i could see three stars moving some out of my kitchen window.  i watched them for about 10 minutes and then i saw a light that was moving.  the light seemed to be going toward another light and when they collided there was an explosion.  it was about the size of the moon.  it was big and very surprising.  i have seen 3 explosives in total.\r\n\r\nthe next day after seeing the explosions i got up about 5:15 am.  i could see stars moving some and they formed a large triangle.  then i saw another light source, it appeared in the middle of the triangle and it blinked in threes, blink blink blink wait.  i did not see the object but only the blinking light.  i saw it descend in the distance and then i saw it was coming toward me.  i saw it blink in the front of the tall trees.  i was a little shaken up but i went back to bed.  it was very exciting to see.\r\n\r\nwhen i started seeing the odd stars across the road there seemed to be three odd lights in the back of my neighbors garage or building.  light a was always on but it would move some.  light b only came on for 15 seconds and if i was doing something interesting or abnormal.  light c will come on sometimes but it seems to move and flash at me.  lights b and c seem to only come on when i go outside.  \r\n\r\nthe most interesting light is the light behind my neighbors fence.  if i walk down the fence the light seems to follow me.  if i squat the light seems squat also.  it is about 30 feet away.  it is very bright and appears from 11pm to 2am.  i setup my computer and i ask the light a variety of questions.  i do not get any answers but sometimes the light will blink at me.  i usually play movies for the light.  a couple of weeks ago i played a dvd about people using explosives to blow up old buildings and the light appeared for 3 days in a row which was very unusual.  sometimes the light does not stay for the whole movie.  usually the light appears 2 or 3 days a week.\r\n\r\nthe light has turned off when i asked the question on my computer, \"do you implant metal in humans?\".  the next day the light appeared and i asked the same question and the light disappeared.  the third day the light appeared and i asked the same question but the light stayed.  \r\n\r\nanother time i wrote, \"your lights work like a video camera\" and the light disappeared.  the interesting part is that months earlier i wrote, \"your light work like a camera\" and the light did not turn off.  the light has turned off when i made faces at it, this was at the beginning.  the light also turned off when i heard a gun shot.  the light turned off when i held up a newspaper comic zits, apparently aliens don't have a sense of humor.\r\n\r\nlast week i typed the first two lines of the decoded binary message from the rendlesham forest incident and the light turned off.  i have not seen the light since.  below is what i typed.\r\n\r\nexploration of humanity 666 8100\r\n52.0942532n 13.131269w (hy, brasil)\r\n\r\none of the oddest thing is that me and \"them\" had a counting game.  one night around 2am i was intently looking at a vacant piece of land and wanting to see the aliens do something.  i saw an orange light blink a few times.  i laughed and then blinked back at the other odd lights (a, b, c).  a fist was \"off\" and an open hand, like the number 5, is \"on\".  we played this game about 3 times.  one time when i was pulling into the driveway i saw a blinking orange light in my yard, i laughed, and \"blinked\" back using my hand.  \r\n\r\nthe blinking game stopped one night.  i saw a blinking orange light and then i saw the backup lights for a car.  it scared me and i hurried inside.  i wrote on the computer that we could play more games but i never saw the blinking orange lights again.  now that i think about it the car was just backing up and not \"trying to get me\" but at 2am it is hard to think straight after seeing some odd stuff.\r\n\r\nand to top everything off i saw an ufo before all of this started.  i turned the main road and it curved some.  there are trees on both sides of the road and at the end of the road because it is a dead end.  the ufo was thin and close to the trees.  the ufo was spanned from the corridor of trees on the left to the ones on the right.  the oddest thing to me was that is had two large flood lights facing me. the flood lights were not next to each other. me and a passenger saw it for about 10 seconds as it slowly drifted to the left. \r\n\r\nthe additional pictures are of an ufo that i saw for several months.  i could see it as early as 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm where it appeared to be a very large bright star.  at 5:30 pm it was just a glint but it was in the same location.  i played the \"peek a boo\" game i mentioned with it everyday.  the pictures where the first day i got a smart phone.  some of the pictures were taken from a moving car.  the day that i took the pictures was the last day i saw the ufo.  it was a little disappointing, the pictures were very crummy, and that ufo never appeared again.  the pictures were taken on december 29 at 6:05 pm and 6:21 pm.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

northeast dallas, texas near hexter elementary school. i had walked to gold���s gym at northcliff & buckner at 9:30 pm and had left at 10:50 pm. the sky was clear, with a full moon and no wind, and there was not the usual city traffic noise. \r\nas i was walking roundabout back to my house, a lighted craft suddenly appeared high over me at northlake near peavy. this occurred within the usual flight path of airplanes originating from south texas and landing at love field; however, i believe that most scheduled southwest airline flights had finished for the night. at first, i thought it was an airplane, but the object actually stopped directly above as i was walking alone in the middle of the street. i instantly felt that it had seen me on the roadway in the full moonlight; otherwise, why would it have positioned itself there ��� coincidence? the craft was about one mile straight up, with the apparent size of a large corporate jet. (i have since studied airplanes flying overhead to confirm this perceived altitude and size.)  \r\nit had extremely bright lights of pure colors, the brightest i have ever seen and the most beautiful red and green. there were no federal aviation administration navigation lights apparent ��� specifically, green on the starboard, red on the port, flashing strobes on the wingtips, with fore and aft white lights as required below 10,000 feet altitude. its lights were arranged in a nonsensical pattern as in the attached diagram, with the red lights pulsing every two seconds ��� this appeared to be the front. the green lights were steady and appeared to be the sides. the body of the craft was not visible as a silhouette against the sky because of the bright lights. it had a clear-cut, garish carnival midway appearance ��� there was no vagueness at all. i immediately realized that this was not an airplane, so i quickly stepped under a front yard tree on northlake to hide from its view. \r\n\tthe object circled, did figure-8s, hovered and rocked as i watched from between the leaves. it emitted a very faint but perceptible whirring sound from high up, similar to an electric motor brush. (here, i had both eye and ear confirmation of a materially structured mechanical craft, and of its apparent vertical distance above.) then, i reasoned that if whatever was controlling this thing had infrared vision that i had better get behind the wooden tree limbs, which i promptly did. the object appeared to be methodically searching the ground, so i remained cowing against the tree trunk and became a certified tree-hugger. to add to my problems, the front yard���s motion detector light turned on. \r\nthis weirdness went on for the longest three minutes, and i began to wonder how it would play out. suddenly, without any warning, the object streaked at a downward angle, around 45-degrees, eastward toward the lochwood mall area. it went from directly overhead to behind the horizon tree line, traveling about a one-mile distance, at one constant and terrific speed. (seeing this ���side of the triangle��� reinforced my directly vertical optical and audio estimate as one mile.) there was no observable acceleration against inertia or deceleration against momentum. the entire process was reminiscent of the image of a flashlight beam shined against a wall, whereby the flashlight is steadily swept across and the spotlight moves swiftly in response. there was no sound at all during the dive ��� any whoosh, sonic boom, crash or explosion ��� anything! \r\ni have used two methods to determine and confirm the exit speed as about mach 1. first, my daughter and i have attended the fort worth alliance air show annually for about twenty years. there are always jet interceptor fly-bys at mach 1, whereby the sound shock wave is visible forming off the fuselage. the june 13 object simply appeared to be diving that fast and that is what i settled on. second, it took about 5 seconds for the craft to go from directly overhead, then down to the tree line, a dive distance of one mile. one mile times five seconds works out to 720 mph, or about mach 1. \r\nthe contrast between the three-minute hovering and the five-second dive was astounding! the circling and wobbling object appeared to be silly, jerky, and almost warner brothers cartoonish with the super bright garish lights ��� the reds pulsing on and off, and the greens glowing steady. if i had witnessed only the hovering phase, i would not be convinced that it was not some type of aircraft. by contrast, had i seen only the five-second dive, i would not be convinced that it was not some reentering satellite debris. this exit plunge was meteor-like and almost blurred. however, both of these phases, when put together said that this was not grandma���s biscuits. \r\nthere is a saying that we should look for ponies before we look for unicorns. in the tradition of looking for ponies, immediately following the sighting i attempted to eliminate any plausible possibilities. i considered a drone as an explanation, and several other folks, including my wife, have since offered the drone scenario. this would fit the hovering and whirring electric motor sound, since several drone models are electric powered hovering devices. however, the size, altitude, lights and exit speed would rule against a drone. drones are relatively small and slow, they fly at low altitudes, and they conserve power in order to stay on station for long periods. all of this goes against the corporate jet-size of the object, which was flying one mile up. drones are secretive and they would not waste electrical power on bright lighting. furthermore, no drone is streamlined or powerful; indeed, this attribute is antithetical to the stealthily purpose of a drone. \r\nconsider the mach 1 exit speed. all drones have propellers or rotors. no propeller driven airplane has ever achieved mach speed and survived ��� ever! this formidable velocity requires an aerodynamic, reinforced coke bottle shaped fuselage, sweptback razor thin wings, and a turbojet engine with a powerful afterburner. even the fabled f-86 saber jet and mig 15 of korean war vintage could not reach the speed of sound. moreover, no aircraft ��� prop or jet ��� would have pulled out of such a steep dive at that speed. \r\nfinally, yet importantly, all aircraft, civilian and military, cia or fbi, drone or whatever, flying high in united states commercial airspace are required by law to conform to faa lighting standards. this is to prevent mid-air collisions with other planes. my observed object was sitting in a main landing flight path over northeast dallas, which would have been filled with vulnerable commercial love field traffic an hour earlier. it was shining and blinking bright garish lights that were arranged in the bizarre pattern illustrated in the attachment, which made no sense and conformed to no codes or regulations. \r\ni have taken one-hour walks almost every night since we moved here in 1977 ��� 37 years ago ��� and have had an evening walking habit over a lifetime of 74 years. nights were convenient when i worked and i have logged many hours of dark sky viewing. except for a brief six-second glimpse of a silent dart-shaped silhouette four miles westward over the park cities at 8:00 pm on december 11, 2013, this was the only time that i have ever seen anything in the sky that i could not explain. the earlier december shadow traveled an estimated two miles, putting its speed at about 1,200-mph, before i lost it in the half moon���s glare. i did not think much about this first sighting because it was so distant and impersonal. conceivably, these two observations, only six-months apart, may have been of the same craft. \r\ntwo days after my june 13 observation, i wrote a short letter to the dallas morning news in hopes that other witness, perhaps near lochwood, had seen where the object went and what it did after plunging below the tree line. my letter was not published, which suggests that when these things are reported to the mainstream news media, they are laughed off. circuitously, since no one hears about them, there is nothing to them. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:03:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":58379,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.85089455204796,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07252014-0017","longitude":-96.71778215152524,"occurred":1402725420000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1406314656000,"summary":"A lighted craft hovered 1 mile above me as i was walking alone at 11 pm.

at the smoking area on a break smoking. you see i work midshift in communications at vandenberg air force base. often times when i go out to smoke i like to look at the stars if it is a clear night, so i feel like i have a pretty good grasp on what stars i usually see at various times at night and where they are positioned. anyhow on this particular night i notice what appeared to be a star but it was out of place meaning i don't recall seeing a star in the position it was in. so i watched it a bit closer and noticed it was changing colors. i could faintly see it go from white to green and then red and blue and orange and back to white. i really didn't keep track of any particular order however. so i said to my coworker \"check that out, that seems a bit out of place doesn't it\" and he said \"it looks like a star and i said no its changing colors look closely and i don't recall any stars there at that elevation\". so then i thought maybe it is just a plane (that would explain the lights) but it didn't move for 5 or maybe 8 minutes. so i said that cant be a plane it isn't moving. now the position of it, the best way i can describe is it was directly in line with the peak of a tree that is on the other side of the radomes in between the two of them sw in direction but above the tree and a fair bit above the tree. so i turned to talk to my coworker (not looking in the direction of the object) for about 20 or 25 seconds (or maybe less than that) and when i turned back the object was now suddenly below the peak of the tree in between that tree and another tree. i don't mean directly in between them, it was a long ways off but the view of it was now in between the trees. so i said to my coworker hey look at that it seems to have moved and fast. so him and i both watched the object now not taking are eyes off it. all of the sudden it looked like it was going out further (getting farther from us if you will but not going left or right just away) and pretty fast. then lights went white and then all of the sudden no light just black night sky as if it just disappeared. then within a second or 2 of it going black the light came back on real bright white then turned off again a few seconds later and it seemed to be moving back towards us. it then did the same thing as i just said, went further out light to no light then back on again. after this sequence it was gone i dint see it again.","distance":"Over One

were killed their bingo fuel, and had to rtb, return to base. \r\n\r\nthe pilots flying was capt. greeno, and lieut turner.  we recover the aircraft, and as mechanic's job is to download the video set a uhf cassette and put in a new one for the next flight. \r\n\r\nthe pilots came back that night and instantly started talking about the scramble with us.  both them indicated they thought they were chasing them up unauthorized helicopter trying to find it on the radar, because of the low level and low-speed. \r\n\r\nhowever, they did mention that two objects left ground level and proceeded at 35,000 feet within seconds.  they told us the actually told the tower, without somebody shot missiles up in the air they were tracking.  however the objects stopped at 35,000 hovering briefly and then took off at 70,000 feet, or until the radar cannot track them anymore. \r\n\r\nthe video(s) were downloaded by a crew chief friend of mine, on the recorder, which is standard protocol.  i observed two objects that appeared to be black in color, it was difficult due to the quality of the video, and the speed the fighter jets were moving towards the objects approximately 650 kn, \r\n\r\nthe video also records radar tracking, and the objects shows approximations according to all aircraft loaded in the memory system so the fire just can have a match or friend or foe, the computer designated no match for the items.  there was also no mode 4 or squawk, friend or foe that typical aircraft send out under faa regulations of that time. \r\n\r\nthe pilots reported the objects came back, a proximally 35 miles down range, and simply could not catch up with them even though they were stopping for skipping moving from 45,000 feet to 2000 feet.  \r\n\r\nthe one pilot, the capt.,  was a texan a good old boy,  and he indicated that he was not a believer in ufos he was that night.  there was no man in black, however there was some closed door meetings  days later, but they never asked the ground crew me us, about videos or the radar. \r\nwhat i saw on the video recorded from the f-15 hud, heads-up display by mcdonnell douglas, wasn't night but did indicate an object with no wings, triangular shape, and no faa regulation lighting but did have one maybe two lights, not sure where, the object was about 1 mile distance in front of the f-15. \r\n\r\nwe did notice, when the pilot(s) returned they had indicated their radar when off-line briefly as well as their ins, for both aircraft this extremely improbable if not impossible.  \r\n\r\nthe f-15 aircraft were turned around and put back on 15 min. alert status.  the next night i was not there but they did scramble again back to england.  i notice none of the reports from this airbase indicated col. halt, that any aircraft jets were scrambled. \r\n\r\nand i'm indicating they were, because i was there.  it was camp in amsterdam cna, the netherlands.  or camp soesterburg holland netherlands. \r\n \r\nthank you\r\ndouglas
