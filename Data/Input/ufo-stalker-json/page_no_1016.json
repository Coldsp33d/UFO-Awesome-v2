noticed a star-like object moving in the sky, moving in ways that no known airship would be able to do. i then noticed 3 more of the same kind doing the same kind of moves. we continually talked, confirming what we were seeing. the objects moved at a speed that seemed impossible, given how far away they appeared to be. after each move each one would hover for a time, then move again.  we felt sure they were some kind if craft. they were too far away to notice any details. they looked bright, like large stars. after about 15 minutes they all came together and flew away. the effect was a swoop, something i had never before witnessed.  the next day we heard reports of sightings in three states, which made sense, as that corner of maryland is close to pennsylvania and west virginia. we didn't report our sighting because we were on our honeymoon and felt that we would not have been taken seriously. we were both excited and a little frightened as a result of the sighting. we were never able to doubt the existence of ufos after that experience.

the sky using the rooftops and trees as reference. i photograph north,south,east and west for a few seconds in each direction and i'm only outside for about 5 to 10 minutes then i down load the pictures and check for anything unusual. i always find a lot of rods and orbs, sometimes together and a wide variety of unknown objects.\r\non the 23/7/14 i started at 3:00pm and took about 130 shots as usual there were rods appearing in some of the shots, i was half way through the 3rd session facing east at 16:22pm looking through the viewfinder and for a split second i felt as if something had moved towards me at the same time there was a flash on the viewfinder. i carried on taking photos in the same routine as normal then went in down loaded the pictures and found the photo of the rod that i had sensed 23-july-14 picture 92, and later taken at 16:24pm i found the one with the cylinder in the top right of photo 23-july-14 picture 133.\r\nthe reason i have been doing this is because since the age of 13 i have witnessed many strange objects in the area i live in, in 1996 i handed a video tape of an object that had appeared for the second night and had hung around for more than an hour to mufon it was analysed and classed as a ufo.\r\ni also reported and submitted photos of objects around my area after some children i was with were pointed out hundreds of silver balls in the sky to the east on a blustery cloudy day that i couldn't see, that happened on 15/2/2010. \r\na few days later my son gave me a 2 pixel camera and i have been taking pictures ever since i have hundreds if not thousands of pictures of these anomalies, 98 percent are taken during the day and i have discovered a lot about them, every year i notice a change in them some i can identify and they are not all random objects just passing by some have their own areas and are present daily. i am willing to share all of them with

happened to their pretty lights and they said the pole light was all they ever had. this is on a country road off a main highway by several feet. so i guess when i thought i saw the last light move

realize that i had a little more\r\nin the pictures than the blimp. to the left of the blimp in the pictures is \r\nsome kind of machine thats digging a hole in the ground. i've never seen any\r\nkind of industrial diqqing equipment that looks like this thing. they had been\r\ninstalling the stuff out there at the airport to upgrade the airport for \r\ninstrument only landings for heavy fog or at night. what's more interesting is\r\nthat there is something in one of the frames that's deflecting the dirt, like\r\nit's hitting some kind of large solid object, that is apparently invisible. \r\ni took the two blimp pictures with my 2 megapixel samsung cell phone camera at\r\nhighest resolution. the blimp was in town for a few days because it was dodging\r\na possible problem with hurricane irene, i think. it was supposed to be in martinsville,\r\ntn. to cover the nascar race that weekend but ended up here instead. the \r\nhurricane missed martinsville and the blimp left town the next day. gadsden\r\nhas a large goodyear plant where they used to hanger the blimps and do reasearch,\r\nso the blimps still end up visiting here from time to time. \r\ni thought about this for a while and tried to figure some connection to fyffe\r\nal. which is about 40 miles due north of here. the best thing i could come\r\nup with is that both towns are about on the 86 degree of longitude west. if we\r\nrun that all the way around the world to the south we find that the line runs\r\nthrough honduras and nicaragua, across the top of the vinson massif in \r\nantarctica, and straight into burma

is north east of are house. they had six windows above six windows on the bottom, the bottom six windows the lights stayed on all the time, the top six windows the light went back and forth from one end to the other, the whole four hours that we watched them. \r\nthey where approximately seven or eight hundred feet above the mountains. it is hard to judge ten to fifteen miles away, there where five or six small white blinking lights coming from each ufo, they where flittering around the mountains, i have no idea what they where doing, or looking for, we never did notice any of them land on the mountain.\r\nafter four hours all the white lights went to the mother ships, and then everything went black, about 5 or 6 seconds later we seen two lights appear straight across to the east and about 2000 high, they looked like two small moons side by side just setting there, then they went dark again and where gone.\r\n\r\nthey say they still see ufo���s in buena vista, and salida co, salida is 2 5 miles south of buena vista.\r\n\r\nabout the other three ufo���s we seen i would have to talk to some one in person or on the phone since i am 84 and not very good on the computer\r\n2","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":58343,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.8489649,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07242014-0020","longitude":-106.180385,"occurred":392972400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1406241947000,"summary":"Wife

sightings of large objects at 1000 too 3000 foot all with bright white lights. they were there most nights for around a month. the lights were acompanied by the sound of fighter aircraft in the aria. \r\n  in the early hours of morning i was called to a customers sight to do electronic repairs. at several miles out and just before the intersection of sr25 and sr16 one of the objects was having problems staying in the air. i drove to within 1000 foot of the object at an altitude around 600 to 700 foot. the object had proportions compared to pop can. \r\nit had a definite sound of a small 4 stroke engine and propeller and appeared to be made of tile.\r\n\r\nthis object was man made and appeared to be a blimp. it was having problems and my speculation was it had something to do with radar. i watched the object for some time and then went on to the job. returning several hour later i returned to see the object over several miles to the east, still just  a few hundred foot up. \r\n\r\n i did not investigate further as i did not want to explain myself to the military. i hope that this is not mistaken as someone just furthering a cover up but that is what it was. a blimp, military in origon, probably  radar related.\r\n \r\n\r\n this is not a question of ufo's but an explanation of sightings in the aria\r\nat the time.
