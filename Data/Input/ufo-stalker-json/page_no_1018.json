filed a report with video, a map, and a diagram with mufon. it is case # 58217. this case could be considered part of that one even though these events occurred days apart.\r\n\r\non monday, july 21, i was in my backyard observing the sky. i have been doing this regularly since april 16, 2014 when i captured a ufo flying over the northeaster part of the las vegas valley. that ufo and video was submitted to mufon and that case (55525 or 55529 ��� got two numbers from mufon) was proven to be an unknown or a uav after it was investigated by mufon.\r\n\r\nfor much of the past week i have been seeing flashing or blinking light in the northwestern part of the las vegas valley. specifically i believe they are in the area where highway 95 leaves town north towards reno. these lights are not new to me as i have seen them several times before but never knew they were possible ufo's. on my most recent report to mufon (case # 58217) i had no idea what the objects might be. i have a much better idea now because in my newest video i saw well defined orbs at least three different times. here are the times and duration of each in the video i am submitting.\r\n\r\n1. between the 1:28 mark and the 1:31 mark a well defined red orb appears. at the time i didn't know it was there.\r\n\r\n2. between the 3:19 mark and 3:57 mark. it was smaller this time but remained constant and didn't blink while i shot video of it.\r\n\r\n3. between the 8:12 mark and the 8:15 mark. a well defined yellow orb appears and moves off the screen.\r\n\r\n4. between the 8:39 mark and 9:08 mark. this orb appears to be more of a gray color and had brief instances where some red appear. this is also the orb that makes me thing that the rest of the blinkers are orbs because this one started to flash again at the very moment the orb fades out and in the exact same location.\r\n\r\nearlier in the evening i was watching numerous aircraft return to nellis air force base in long drawn out lines that are part of the 414th combat training squadron \"red flag\" exercises. this kept going all the way until about midnight. high above the aircraft returning to nellis i could see as many as 20 of these blinkers through my binoculars. they seemed to just be hovering. i attempted to shoot video but it didn't work because i couldn't see them with my eyes and my galaxy s4 camera was to weak to pick them up either. \r\n\r\nit wasn't until later on in the night that i came back outside and now noticed them much closer to me and were easy to see visually. that's when i began shooting video again. it was tough because they were all over the mountains that sit just west and northwest of my home. i did my best to capture what i could. this went on for about 17 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over

im standing on the front porch and i notice 2 sets of lights, one traveling north the other east. they were close, i honestly thought i was about to see  a mid-air collision.  the 1st object stayed its course while the 2nd passed by and started a turn towards the 1st obect. what i noticed about the 1st object was its lights, 3 whites  and 3 white lights below in a rectangle pattern. i watched it for a few seconds then i decided to get off the porch to get a better view. by this time the 2nd object had caught up to the 1st and unless it was military, was following the 1st object very close. with the jet noise and light pattern, the 2nd object was obviously a jet. so i go out in the yard as the 2 pass overhead and over my house, at this point a large pine tree obstructed my view. this is

(note: on the film, it looks like the movement could be due to shakiness. i held it as steadily as i could. if anything, any movement on my part cancelled out some of its. i did not zoom in. the camera also makes it appear further away than it was. the light was moving more noticeable distances in person.)\r\n\r\nat 12:48, i moved and noticed a smaller light that had been covered by a tree. it was also moving in a similar fashion, though it was smaller and not as bright. it was down and a bit to the north from the first light. i held out my arm and the distance between the two was about equal to that of my thumb, erring on the side of a little closer. (i���������m a woman.) \r\n\r\nat 12:55, i went inside to get my telescope. i noticed another smaller moving light a bit higher up in the sky and to the south. its movements were not as drastic as the first one, which along with its size made me believe it was further away. it looked a little more bluish.\r\n\r\nby 12:58, i was back outside setting up my telescope. all three lights were still present. i���������m an amateur and out of practice, so i had a hard time honing in on the light. it didn���������t help that it was moving. twice i had it move across my lens, but it wasn���������t focused. the light appeared to have a pinkish tint, though. i made my best guess at what settings would make it focused and looked in the same spot for a few minutes. it didn���������t show up through my lens again.\r\n\r\nat 1:26, i went back inside. at the time i left, two lights were still visible. the first light had migrated a little bit down and to the north. it was not a great distance, though. it had retained the same disorganized pattern of movement the whole time. the second light had moved along with the first and was no longer visible from my spot, but was likely just covered by the house next to mine. the third light was still to the south. i immediately commenced writing this report upon reentering the house.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":58284,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.3297601,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07232014-0006","longitude":-111.0903711,"occurred":1406098800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Utah","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1406115298000,"summary":"I saw an object looking like a bright star moving around like an insect for over an hour. there were also two smaller ones.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/58284_submitter_file1__CAM00085.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/58284_submitter_file2__CAM00087.mp4"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"84097","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Utah","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:129702"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Tonopah","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Me and my famialy have been seeing lights above the palo verde nuclaer genarating station for sevral nights","distance":"501 Feet -

 from my parents house at this time, one could clearly see loring afb and several structures on the base including the arch hanger, radar tower, water towers etc.  hearing b-52s take off and land was common for us but we would normally watch them taking off.  you could clearly see the black trail of smoke behind them.  on this particular day, we heard jets flying but we knew they weren't b-52s, they sounded more like fighters and we were excited by the sounds they were making like when a jet banks at high speed and makes that screeching sound as they turn.  so, we ran out from the woods to see the jets but we also saw what i can only compare to the red dot that a laser pointer creates, hovering over the base.  the jets were flying towards this bright red object at a high rate of speed and as they approached the object it almost instantly moved from a stand still to a point at the opposite end of the base, a distance of probably 2 to 4 miles, and it made this movement in an instant and then came to a complete stop.  the jets (now banking at the other end of the base) turned to go back towards the object again.  this happened probably 2 or 3 times.  this happened during the daylight hours but i'm not sure what time of day.  we were only 8 or 9 years old at the time.  eventually the object either disappeared or flew off so fast that it was gone in an instant.  the fact that this object started and stopped so suddenly was amazing.  the jets appeared to be moving in slow motion compared to this object.  that's it...We both remember this happening very clearly.  i just watched an episode of 'close encounters:examinde' on the scifi channel which depicted this event or another one very similar to what we say.  the only differences i could see were that on the tv show, the events all happened at night but it was definitely during the day when we saw it.  we also only saw this on one occasion, not several like on the tv episode.  thanks for reading.","distance":"Over
