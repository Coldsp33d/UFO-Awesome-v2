heard a slight noise like someone putting their finger to their mouth and telling you to ssshhhhhhh.  the width of the object was about the same size as a commercial plane.  if the object kept its

our roommate pulled into our driveway shortly after saying he saw a blue light as he was driving up the hill to our house. we stood outside, a little shaken up, to see if we would catch any other

television. during the movie my 23 year old son and the two friends suddenly saw a pulsating green object with a fuzzy white border falling straight down from the sky. they were facing south west and estimated they first saw object at about 50-55 degrees above horizon. my 28 year old son did not see object as his view was blocked by one of the bookcases.\r\nthe object was trailing same color green \"pulses\". the trail was similar to pictures we've seen of trail from ram jet type aircraft. the \"pulse\" closest to object was slightly smaller than object, then next one was slightly smaller and so on. they said there was a total of 5-6 of these in the tail. while the object was in sight the tail continued to be renewed. \r\nthe closest my son could come to describing the color was that it was similar to the green as seen through a night vision scope. my son was able to have the longest view of object because where he was sitting, the object fell through the space exactly between the t.V. and the bookcase. his total viewing time was about six seconds. the friends viewed about 3-4 seconds. to the south and southwest of our house is a range of hills/mountains (approx 1000 ft). the object disappeared behind this hill to the southwest. our house is approximately 7 miles from coast, due west. there was no way to estimate distance as we didn't know size of object. point mugu naval air station is on the coast due west of our house.\r\nmy son has spent much time in colorado and seen many \"shooting stars\" and meteorites. he stated this looked nothing like what he had seen before.\r\nafter the sighting, my son stated that everyone became quiet. they then looked at each other and asked if they all saw the object. none could explain what they saw and all had never seen

the year 1970. i was with a young woman at the time that was outside the store, while my parents were shopping in there. there was no sound from the disc at all. when we first noticed the object, it was just hovering there in the sky about six hundred feet away, and about one hundred feet off of the ground. it started to move in a slow and straight motion to my left. the sighting was an interest that invoked curiosity and wonder at what it was that we were witness to. i mentioned to her to go and tell everyone in the shoe store to come out and to see this. the disc shaped object exited the sky in a display of non ballistic motion before anyone else could arrive. my father was a prominent university theologian that was the author of several books that focus around psychic phenomenon, and classified government research. there was no mistaken idea as to what it was that the two of us were seeing on that day in broad daylight. it was a positive experience that was without fear or apprehension as to what it was that we were witnessing. a miracle with a divine providence was what it was that we had seen that day. i have watched the government of this country ensure the security of information and unusual phenomenon that is supported by a use of lethal force. the reciprocity from me was one of being perplexed, and i gathered that a mandate of very stringent conditions of containment in access to information was being implemented by the department of defense. i never saw the occupants of the ufo, since the age level precluded my ability to assimilate the 'who,what,when,and where' to a greater degree. i have watched other good men and women pay a high personal cost in order to become the victims of those that want to control the telepathic influence of these beings. this stands in contrast to being a part of the solution in society that is directed towards an understanding as to why these intelligent life forms that are from other planets are visiting the earth.

clear out that night and the stars and the moon were very bright. i turned to my husband to answer a question that he had asked me when i saw the unexplainable. there were two very bright, glowing orbs traveling eastward in the sky. they were a yellowish orange and had a strange glow to them. i said \"wow!\" and that is when my husband turned to see them too. they appeared to fly almost parallel to each other, with the orb closest to us just a little bit behind the other one. we could see that they had an oval-like shape. the ufo that was trailing behind a little then suddenly started moving over toward the other one and we thought that they might crash into each other. it did not crash, bit got extremely close to the other ufo then seemed to blink out. i could still see the shape of it though and it appeared to move down like it was landing. the other ufo continued on and disappeared behind the many trees that were around us. another strange thing that happened was, as they ufo's were flying overhead, they seemed to release what looked like mini shooting stars. we saw just two of these shoot around the ufo's as they were flying. they made absolutely no sound at all and were flying way too low to be a plane or helicopter. when i first saw the objects, i thought they were military jets, then quickly realized they weren't because i couldn't hear them and the entire body of the crafts were glowing that strange bright yellow-orange color. my husband and i were both stunned at what we saw that night and i have been very un-easy since then. if i hear a strange noise outside, i run back in the house and i shut and lock all of my doors and windows. i have seen ufo's a few times before and this is my first time reporting a sighting. this is the first

friends do, we had been swimming, listened to some records, cooked some food, and now we were out for a walk. it was night time, the moon was out and bright, and the three of us were laying on the ground and smoking a cigarette. \r\n\r\nout in the distance we saw what looked like it was an airplane initially. but it was flying really really low to the ground. it had 3 lights on it, two red ones on the outter parts of it and one blue one in the center. the plane looked like it was really close to the ground, and i got off the ground cause it seemed like it looked strange to me. the sound of the plane seemed like it was displaced, like the sound was moving slower than it was, if that makes any sense, as if it were displaced from the object...\r\n\r\nas i stepped off of the grass and onto the pavement of the parking lot, the object stopped looking like an airplane and looked like three triangles connected to one another. one was stacked on the other two...It looked something like a tri-force emblem from the \"legend of zelda\" game series. each individual triangle had individual lights in them, and they gave off a gold colored light. when the object stopped looking like a plane the sound of it disappeared as well. and it changed direction and started coming towards me. \r\n\r\nit got very close to the ground maybe fifty feet up or so, it looked like it was getting smaller as it got closer to the ground? i know that doesn't make much sense, but this is what i saw. it hovered above me for a bit, while i looked up at it. it was really strange, while i was looking at it, it seemed almost like it was close enough for me to touch it...It seemed like it was in my face even. but it still was about fifty feet up in the air. \r\n\r\nthen it flew in a circle above me a few times, and then ascended back and disappeared just as suddenly as it appeared. the thing about it, was like i followed it with my eyes when it appeared and when it left, but the moment it arrived and left were seemless. there was no sudden entrance or exit. like and olympic diving jumping into a pool and not causing a single ripple. that's kinda what i think about it when i replay it in my head.\r\n\r\ni was there with 2 other people and they saw this whole thing.\r\n\r\ni have to say i'm totally freaked out. i'm going to go back out again and see if i can see it again.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then

cumberland city power plant. it was a field next to a creek that i had been to many times. we had been there about 30 minutes and i got out of the car for a minute. when i got back in, a large black sphere with 3 very intense orange lights at the edges equally spaced was hovering silently above a large tree directly in front of us about 800 ft away. at first i thought it might be a balloon or something from the 101st airborne, located nearby, but it made no sound and just did not appear to be anything like i had ever seen before. i asked the person with me where it came from and she said that it appeared first as a distant light that almost immediately became the huge object in front of us and did not make a sound (i got out just to confirm this and there was total silence). it then slowly sit down behind this large tree and i will never forget the intensity of the three orange lights shining through the tree leaves was like the sun. it stayed there for a few minutes and then rose above the tree and not long after that emitted a bright orange ball of light towards the power plant. i say emitted but it was difficult to tell if the ball of energy was coming from the craft or coming from the power plant to the craft. after about thirty minutes another light on the ground some distance from the craft appeared in the woods - it was a bright white glowing light that would periodically emit a bright flash. in about another thirty minutes, another light appeared in another part of the woods but it was a spotlight like light that appeared to be searching the trees and area close to the craft. we sat there for some time and i thought about leaving the car and going to get as close as i could but i was concerned for the safety of my girlfriend. we thought about leaving and going to get someone to come see but we figured that it would be gone before we returned. craft was as large as the tree it sat behind and hovered over, with a black surface that did not reflect the very bright orange lights on it's edges. when it sat down it was like the sphere rotated but the lights stayed on the outside edges. it also appeared to have some sort of windows or something above the equator of the sphere but i could not make out if there was anyone. what is going to sound crazy is that both of us could feel that they did not want us to worry about their presence and we should just go ahead and act normal. we were never scared or frightened during the event and it was like they were communicating with us in some way to reassure us. it is hard to explain this and also the loss of time that we seemed to experience - i think that i took her home late but i was unsure of the time next day and i was and still am unsure how long the event lasted and have often wondered if hypnosis would reveal more about the event. i just remember that the next day i was very mad at myself for leaving without investigating further or staying longer - i was into photography and could have gotten a camera and come back but it was like we had lost free will and i am unsure when we left but all of the lights and the object was still there when we did finally leave and seemed to be in no hurry to leave. it was like we were just following directions to leave and go home and don't worry about it. we had plenty of time to leave and return with others but we did not and i still cannot explain why. it was an amazing experience that we learned very quickly not to tell anyone about as the ridicule from others was very cruel and no-one believed us until i was telling my sister in law about it and she about fainted and told me that her cousin, who lived near the tva new johnsonville power plant had seen this very same object just a couple of days after this. i also found out about a person who was driving on the same road next to the field that night who had almost wrecked his truck trying to avoid some kind of creature in the road.
