beach. i decided to take a picture and saw a bright light that wasn't visible to the naked eye, which i thought was a star. i took two photos of this \"light\" before opening the skyview app to see what star or planet this was. the app showed everything around the light, but the light was not registering as a star or anything on the app. i spent 7 minutes trying to figure out what it was until i finally decided to stop wasting time and start taking pictures of the sunset again. when i switched back to camera mode, the light had taken on a different shape and color. it looked like a dark rose colored saucer at the top, surrounded by a glowing lighter rose colored sphere that was flat at the bottom. it looked as though the saucer may have been solid and the sphere may have been light the saucer was emitting. i thought i was seeing things, so i asked my friend to come look and she confirmed i wasn't seeing things. so, for the next minute, i took several pictures of this object as it moved from one side of the sun to the other. it seemed to get further away and then just faded away. i know what i saw and am excited about it, but at the same time, afraid that people will think i'm crazy. my brother, who also believes, told me about your website and encouraged me to report my

to working late on a problem, and have to let my truck at the time, al ‘77 gmc sierra grande, warm up. i first noticed the vehicle after i noticed and oscillating glow in the treetops ahead. at first i thought it was just a bonfire as i did live in the country. as i got closer, my radio started fuzzing out, and my truck’s instruments started going haywire. as i got even closer, i notice my phone had shut itself off, and my truck died. i notice just before this happened that there was jet black vehicle on the side of the road with two men in black suits standing next to it staring at me. i felt this wasn’t something i was supposed to see. as i clear a patch of forest between me and this object, i noticed it was glowingfrom violet to blue to white to yellow to pink to red, and back to violet in a cycle. the surface of the object was a metalic silver/black with a window running down the middle. in these windows i could make out a few humanoid beings. in the top of the object, there were long prongs/antennae protruding from it, and rows of lights flashing different lights in a pattern. it emmited a low hum that made me feel somewhat sick, somewhat lulled. as i passed the men in the suits, i’m certain they were human, but i felt their stare was piercing through me. soon thereafter, my truck came back to life, and i booked it home. a day after the sighting, i heard what sounded like military choppers flying overhead, but, at the time, payed no mind to it seeing as how i lived 45 minutes from barksdale afb. they often did training flights over the area, and it wasn’t uncommon to see the, but these ones lingured around the school to the west, near where i sighted the object. the following 2 week i noticed black vehicles following around, and on one occasion, stopping and sitting in my driveway before turning around. they eventually left me alone, and i have yet to see them again, but i have seen a few craft in the sky since, but these were more triangular and often somewhat hidden in the night sky.

hikes at the joshua tree national park.  the picture/video that i have submitted was at \"hidden valley\".  \r\n\r\nduring the hike we all were hiking and taking pictures using both iphones as well as a proper camera.  hidden valley was our first hike of the day and later on in the day, say 3 hours after our first hike, we were looking through the photos we had taken and noticed a black spot in one of our pictures.  the picture was a \"live photo\" on the iphone, meaning it captures about 1.5 secs of motion in real-time.  after looking at this live photo hundreds of times trying to figure out what it can be, we collectively as a group are/were unable to identify this and therefore assumed it could be a ufo of sorts.  just the sheer speed in which this object was moving eliminated the chances that it could be a bird or bug.\r\n\r\nlater in the evening we took the live photo and converted it to a .Mov file (which is what i have submitted) and noticed that frame by frame, the object does not appear until the last 0.5 seconds of the video, so it was faster than originally thought.  the object, when zoomed in upon, looked disc-like, or maybe a triangle, solid black and it's trajectory was interesting, going into a straight line, ascending.  we lost sight of the object based on the fact that it went out of frame from the picture/video.\r\n\r\noverall feelings were pretty fascinated and curious.  a little excitement due to the sheer luck of capturing this inadvertently in a photo.  at this moment we are all in a bit of shock due to what we have seen and are very interested in hearing an experts opinion of what this can possibly be.","distance":"101-500 Feet, Unknown","duration":"00:00:01","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None, Wings,

i was 11 years old at the time, and i witness at least 3 sightings, but i remember at the time family members, friends and local news reporting more sightings everyday, for 3 or 4 months straight, first time that i witness i was playing football and all of a sudden everyone started to look at the sky and i saw a object hovering and with a weird directional change of path, i was in owe and i couldn't take my eyes of the object, it was beautiful and scary at same time, i remember older  people taking strange conclusions about it, calling the children to get out of the street, the second time was at night and were two objects and they had some lights on it, i have now 38 years old, and with time our memories change real events, but i believe that with some research mufon can find the truth of my report, there was some local interviews on local angola television with testimony of pilots and others, a curious and coincidental event was, when the sightings ended the violent civil war returned ending a 2 years peace resolution.

bored because i hadn't seen anything in the sky, so i decided to go back inside. i was almost on my porch to walk in the door and a dark slow-moving object caught the periphery of my eye. i looked straight up over me and about 40-50 feet above me was a very dark triangle-shaped aircraft with rounded edges, flat surface on the bottom and it was too close and too dark to see what the shape was on the top of the aircraft. it had 3 oblong-shaped structures going down both sides on of the aircraft. i don't know if the oblong-shaped structures were windows or just the design because nothing was shiny on it whatsoever. no lights at all. no sound to it at all. nothing emitting light on it or off of it. no weather changes. no wind from it going by. it was going very slow of 10-15 mph in the same straight path. i had my iphone and already had the camera open on it to take pictures because i like taking pictures of the sky all the time. i quickly lifted my phone straight up above me and only had time to take 2-3 pictures before it disappeared past my yard. this all happened within 5-7 seconds. i have a small 2-story barn-shaped building at the edge of my back yard and when it flew over that i couldn't see it any more (i have a pretty small yard of about 30-40 feet maybe) either because it was too dark, it disappeared, or i just couldn't see it because my barn-shaped building blocks the view from being able to see anything past it anyway. i looked through my pictures, as i had taken about 20 of them that night, but the only thing i saw that showed up was a few stars. it was very dark and clear that night. no clouds and about a quarter moon. my house is shaped like an l. where i was walking into the house is where the l of my house is, which is why i never saw it coming, and i didn't see it until it was almost right over me. the only colors i could see were black and could only tell what shape it was because it blocked out the stars as it flew over me. i could only see the oblong-shaped structures on both edges when it was straight over me. other than that, you could only see the out-lined shape of it when it blocked the stars. i went through all my pictures i took, as i had taken about 20, and i couldn't see anything in the photos, just black, but it was so close to me and i had set the camera to zoom in all the way in order to take closer pictures of the stars, so considering it was on zoom and the aircraft was so close to me, all that would showed up was black.","distance":"21-100
