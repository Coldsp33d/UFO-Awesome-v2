my head at clearing in tree canopy.I looked up really fast cause i got chills.I saw a large passenger jet on flight path to los angeles int.Airport at about 65 degrees above horizon.\r\n  above the jet were three lights in a triangular shape,which covered a huge area.I tried to call home and call dropped 3 times.Finally got hold of spouse and told her to grab camera and go out to our street and look in north direction.She couldnt find camera or lights.Cell phone photo was blank.\r\n  the jet was flying under the large triangle shape (formed by 3 lights) and appeared ok.The three lights which formed a triangle all moved in unison as if they were one transparent object, it was going from north to south,after jet passed they all changed direction as if they were one,but transparent,and moved going east.\r\n the speed was consistent and the lights kept same illumination the whole time. i was trying hard to quit looking at it and drive home asap to film it but it traveled t0o fast.It took about 10 minutes to travel across half of the sky.Now i am constantly looking skyward.\r\n see my drawing.The plane i drew was going south easterly ,maybe i should reverse plane in drawing to way i saw it.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

plaza hotel friday night july 18 around nine p.M. the three were so enthusiast that they all said that they never ever saw a ufo before until that night there at the crowne plaza hotel within the surrounding perimeter that we walked outside of that hotel. when we first sighted these alien star ships it was partial clearing at first and then it became mostly cloudy skies and i couldn't grab more witnesses to introduce them to my star ships. the very next saturday night july 19th it call for mostly cloudy skies and i could not be able to show anyone my star ships. the three witnesses from

wow, my first ufo. i told a couple or 3 friends of mine about it. i was really thinking about it for a few days.\r\n6. my window just blocked the view, and that is why i got to witness it for a mere

witness took. that case (55525 or 55529 ��� got two numbers from mufon) was proven to be an unknown or a uav after it was investigated by mufon. \r\n\r\ni have been spending extra time each night monitoring the skies over the las vegas valley since that incident. my home is in summerlin and my backyard has a wide open view of the las vegas valley and much of north las vegas as well. at around 10:47 pm on 7/17/2014 i began filming some flashing lights that were blinking brightly over the mountains in the north part of the valley. i had no idea what they were but i had seen them several times before but had never been able to shoot video of them. i also thought they were airplanes the first time i saw them because they were flying in a line or spaced formation. each time i have seen them they have always been north of my home and far enough away where i couldn���t tell exactly what they were or hear any noise. they always appeared to be in the north on every occasion and near the mountains. \r\n\r\non 7/17/2014 i saw them again but this time they were just remaining stationary. they seemed to be slowly drifting to the north. i filmed them for more than five minutes when i finally decided i couldn���t see them through the view finder any longer and stopped the video. the camera was the camera that comes with my galaxy s4 telephone. it was set on night mode and already zoomed in all the way before i ever shot video because the blinking lights seemed to be so far away. there didn���t seem to be anything fantastic about them until i went inside my home and previewed the video. the lights were baffling. i then came back outside about twenty five minutes later to see if they were still there. to my surprise they were although very faint. i used a good set of binoculars and sure enough they were still in the exact same area but farther away. to shoot the video i propped my arms up on our block wall and kept the camera still the whole time and never needed to change the direction i was pointing the camera. i was tempted to change the direction once or twice because the screen on the phone looked dark but i didn���t because i remembered the lessons i learned from my first video capture.\r\n\r\ni also made a map of where i believe the objects were located and finally i used photoshop to blowup consecutive screen captures i did of the objects. i believe i took about fifteen different screen captures and blew them up side by side so that they would be accurately displayed after being blow up. it appeared to me that there were a minimum of four objects and possibly five. i waited to file this report because i now run a facebook group that relates to ufo���s in the usa. many in the group felt they were not airplanes or anything else that could be explained and could be ufo���s. it���s because of the group members that i decided this was worth pursuing and investigating. i have no idea what they were but i���d be very interested to find out.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":58217,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.18598632229966,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07212014-0004","longitude":-115.34864839725847,"occurred":1405619220000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nevada","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1405935310000,"summary":"Bright

in the sky a little ways farther to the right from where i first noticed this object. and above the area of the pointy rocky hill.\r\n\r\nin the photo # dscf 3259. again a little farther to the right of the last position of the object. there's a white spot/circle with a black ring around it.\r\n\r\nin the photo # dscf 3265. again a little farther to the right of the last position of the object. there's a white spot/circle with a black ring around it near a tree.\r\n\r\nin the photo # dscf 3266. again a little farther to the right of the last position of the object. the object is now among the leaves. and it's the last photo with the object.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

getting in my way), but i could see bright white lights following directly to the left of our vehicle just behind the treetops (both sides of the road were lined with trees).\r\n\r\ni finally glimpsed the object, and had enough time to note that it looked like a hovering, dark pyramid before it shot off into the direction of the city. we watched it move away from us in the sky for several minutes (it took about 2 seconds for it to get so far away that it just looked like a bright light in the distance) before it was gone completely.\r\n\r\nthis sighting further peaked my interest in ufos and

not remember details about where the friend lived or even which friend it was, nor do i think that my mother would even remember if i asked. it was a very rural, wooded neighborhood not far from phenix city or crawford. \r\n\r\nshe went inside for a very short time, leaving my older brother (in the front seat) and myself (back seat, right side, next to the window) in the car.\r\n\r\nas we were waiting, i looked out of the window to the sky and saw a lead grey, slightly reflective disk hovering about 30-40 feet over and to the right of our car. it made absolutely no sound and made no action that would have given it away. if i hadn't looked out, i would not have noticed it at all.\r\n\r\nthe disk hovered, rotating slightly, while i watched it for about a 60 seconds. then, it shot off into the sky and out of sight, making a slight sound. the sound itself is hard to explain, a bit like the swishing displacement of air and a bit like a humming/pulsing sound.\r\n\r\nthe sight of the saucer terrified me, and i never asked my older brother if he saw it, too. so deeply routed was my fear that i kept it to myself for all of my adolescent life and refused to believe in the reality of the ufo phenomenon. however, my denial couldn't make me forget. but it was not until my second sighting 9 years later that i began to seriously start researching the subject and come to terms with my experience.\r\n\r\n**note: i discussed this with alabama state director richard hoffman at the 2014 mufon symposium. he asked that i report this case, despite it having happened so long

because it was an unusual deep dark blue, color, not too often seen. sitting in the sky were two dull gold colored lights, with red centers,  they were pulsating.  they were not amber or yellow in color, they were actually a dull gold color, something i have never seen.  they were not as high as the airplanes fly. they were low, but much higher than treetop level. i realized they were ufos because they were pulsating, and because of the dull gold color.  there was no place to pull off the road, find my cell phone, and get a picture.  when i did pull off the road into a parking lot, got my phone, and looked up to where they were, i was upset to see that they had vanished.  i immediately got the idea to take a pic of where they had been in the sky. sadly, i took more pictures of the beautiful night sky, in different directions, and went home. this is the picture of the area in the sky where i had seen them.  i had put my cell phone out the window, and snapped a shot of where they had been.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
