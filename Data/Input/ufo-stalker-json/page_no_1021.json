(here the freeway loops to the west and more or less parallels the ridge.)  as i traveled closer to the hills, i could see that the bright spot was definitely not the sun reflecting through the clouds. i kept my eyes on it as much as possible and began to see it more clearly.   \r\n\r\nwhat i saw was a bright and what seemed to be stationary spherical object in the sw sky. it was lower than the sun, which was shining from behind through light clouds.  the object was moon-like in appearance minus the shadows, and was now clearly in front of the thin layer of clouds.   it appeared to be a bright, glowing, light gold color with a smooth surface -luminescent rather than metallic.  light was not reflecting through it.  it appeared to remain stationery at about a 45 degree angle above the horizon.  as the direction i was traveling became more westerly, the object either rotated a bit revealing a somewhat faceted shape with what appeared to be two small triangular fins one above the other,  or my change of direction offered a different view. the fins appeared to be of the same material and color as the rest of the object. the edges were distinct as the sky behind was darker than object itself.  i also observed a very small, very black spot on lower right quadrant of the sphere, which at first seemed to appear and disappear so i wasn���t sure if i actually was seeing it.  the black spot then became quite visible and appeared to expand until it was very clearly a vertical rectangular shape that remained visible. the sides of the rectangle appeared to move inward at the center and it became an hour glass shape.\r\n\r\nit is impossible to determine the size of this object from memory and at the time i didn���t think to mentally note any comparisons. what i can say for certain is i would not have been able to detect any of the attributes i���ve described when i first saw it in the sky and then suddenly i could see it well enough to see details, though i did not detect any movement.\r\n\r\nat this point i left the freeway and drove two city blocks, parallel to the freeway, at 15-20 miles/hr.  i was stopped at stop lights twice and continued to observe the object, though my view was obstructed somewhat by vegetation and the descending sun made it more and more difficult to view.  at the second stoplight, i made a left turn to the south driving several more blocks and was able to continue viewing through the trees,  although it was now  slightly to my right.  at this point, the terrain obscured my view as i drove behind and up a small hill. at the top of the hill (about a minute later), i had full view of the sw sky and the object was gone.  \r\n\r\ndistance traveled from first sighting to last approximately three tenths of a mile.  \r\nspeed was 60-65 mph for first two tenths of mile, then not more than 15-20 for final tenth.  \r\ntotal time of sighting was 3-4 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t          \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t \t\r\n\t\r\n \r\n\r\n\t\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":58186,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":47.658693,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07202014-0001","longitude":-117.4225481,"occurred":1391641200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1405839656000,"summary":"Briight gold colored stationary sphere near spokane, wa","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":164,"locationName":"Spokane, Washington","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:131294"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Buda","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"The ufo was first hovering in one are, very bright green and apparent. it then dropped beyond tree line and shot back up in the air. it would change colors from green, then this fluorescent purple, then to blue. it was so noticeable to the naked eye. we watched this for at least 10 minutes if not longer, i have 3 different videos but the color is hard to make out. however, when it would change color you can see it light up and get very bright. it was glowing like a glow stick. not like lights on it, but the entire thing would take on whatever color and stay that color for some time before getting bright again and changing to another color. let's be honest, i was frightened.

under visible canopy of sky above.\r\n\r\nat approx 0300 i went into my back yard to soak in spa. my neck & back killing me from hours on end at table studding for bar exam. i typically am in my yard, pool, and/or spa a few times throughout the night, and regularly notice star-like objects overhead (probably satelllites) as the object would move at a regular rate and in apparently set path, always singular and rarely going in-and-out of view.\r\n\r\nlast night the same objects were viewed, usu. not more than 1 per 5-20 min, as typical. i also noticed the objects reported, in addition to the normal near earth objects. this was completely different.\r\n\r\nin the beginning objects were heading due south, and occasionally from s. at a mid-point in the sky overhead (location is 1/2  mi e. of 99 & at most n-e tip of stockton). sightings were ongoing, and increased in frequency until most concentrated just after 0420. b/w approx. 0500 on until sunrise washed away night sky all sightings were of objects moving in groupings of 2-3, always staggered both in order and flight path, with the lead being about the length from the next of 2 adult male hands at arms-length in- front of the face( i have no idea how far up from earth they could have been, so best way i could describe perspectively), the same was true of the 3rd trailing behind. however, on at least 1 sighting, there were first 2 heading back from the s-sw and at around the edge of town (8 mile rd & 99n) the lead object made steady change of course due e, the next followed, but then another (previously unseen) appeard from the nw (from lodi/elk grove direction) and interjected itself between these 2 others, thereafter all 3 took steady course e (slightly ne) towards direction of calaveras county/murphys (towards sierra nevadas), and maintained that direction until out of eye sight. apart from the suddenly appearing behavior, all others spotted until dawn took same eastern route.\r\n\r\njust before i began to see object heading e, and away, a much brighter sphere-like object (at night all i can see is light, so no way to distinguish size, shape, etc.=all would appear as round as any light in the dark) came directly overhead at slow steady pace, very bright, whitish w/ hues of orange-yellow, but not blinding like a headlight, more suttle, but very bright. it flew directly over my home and took that eastern course, only after did the other objects proceed to take the same course. this bright object appeared to be much closer (maybe 200-300  ft) and with absolute silence. neither this nor any others had any lights regularly seen in known aircraft. nor did any of them exhibit sound or other behavior typical of modern day aircraft. i was well-trained in all aspects of aeronautics and aircraft mechanics while in the navy. i have some knowledge at least of flight characteristics and demands of physics.\r\n\r\nthis was not something i can put in that class of modern technological capability.\r\n  \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"03:30:03","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

(unfortunately the night-time contrast on phone filming stinks so there is no differentiation of treeline and sky, and lights are blurred together). \r\nat this time i could make out the object pretty well: cylinder shaped with a triangle top, lights were now separated into four horizontal and parallel rows of bright dots/bulbs. all were a bright red, with the bottom two rows adding green and yellow irregularly. we were very quiet and i swore i could hear it. it sounded like a quiet wind machine, maybe a slight buzzing. not as loud as a helicopter. this lasted approx. 10-15 sec. \r\nthen it moved back so quickly, but smoothly, approx. 1 mile back, began hovering again and the lighting changed to a red x with a greenish irregular blinking light in the middle. occasionally more red lights in a thin line lit up on the right side of the x. i could not hear it anymore. this lasted approx. 10 sec.\r\nthen it moved further away and we were now only able to make out that it was a red light with a greenish light irregularly blinking. it moved right to left twice (maybe 5+ miles), up and down once, hovering short times in-between (all quickly, but so smooth). it was clear it was much further away at this point and as it was still moving right and down it went behind the tree-line.\r\nwe both could not believe what we just saw. we started talking and thinking about what it legitimately could have been... possibly the military base 30 miles away testing new aircraft, patrol over the highway nearby, the county fair 10 miles away providing interesting entertainment, or someone playing with a homemade drone to create hoaxes. \r\nthen about five minutes after the first sighting it came back. it was further away, so we could not define shape and lighting lines, only color and movement. it flew in a similar way as before, right to left then up and down... quickly and smoothly. then it was gone behind the trees less than a minute later.\r\nall we could say at this point was \"that was crazy\" and just kept staring at the sky waiting for it to reappear. we went inside after waiting about an hour for a re-sighting. it just didn't feel real, but we both confirmed exactly the same thing. i have really good eyes and my husband just got new glasses pretty much perfecting his vision. just crazy. \r\nplease debunk this sighting for me. tell me there is another reason for this unidentified flying object in the sky. we know what planes and helicopters look and sound like. there were plenty of them in the sky that night, but this was definitely not one of them (the lights were too bright, the shape was different, the movement was different... it was nothing we had ever seen before). was there anyone else in our area that claimed a similar sighting last night?
