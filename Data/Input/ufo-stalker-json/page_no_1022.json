did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\r\n\r\nmy first thought was a helicopter. but one was already flying around in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions in detail.\r\n\r\nthe objects i saw were star-like. they looked like they were glowing a bit. i think they were pretty high up since it was sort of faint how they glowed or their light... at first there was only 3 and they glowed more brighter. it looked as if they were hovering. sort of like they were waiting. because shortly after a few more came out nowhere! many. i know that it can't possibly be helicopters because they were flying too close to each other and steady. after more joined together they started to fly closer to where i was watching them. they formed a \"v\" shape. and when they were directly above me and those that were watching with me. they formed a straight line. almost like putting on a show for us! they stopped moving and they were just hovering above us. we kept our eyes on them the whole time. and slowly they disappeared. almost like as they were fading away? but so quick. \r\n\r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object.\r\n\r\nmy feelings? well i was pretty excited. my reactions were to get someone out there with me so that i can have someone be a witness to what i was seeing in the sky. after my brother and two others came out we kept our eyes on them. my brother took a few pictures but his camera didn't take any well... so nothing i can share really. just this report on them. \r\nwhen we couldn't see them anymore we stayed a few minutes out there looking for them but nothing. the other's were a bit scared and fascinated by them.\r\n\r\n6. how did you lose sight of

place of origin for that light, so i tried focusing and those lights started moving all around in circles. i called up everyone (4 people) and well even our dog accompanied them. and we observed the four lights in complete awe as we have never seen anything like this before.  the lights moved from right-left, north-south and vice versa. i called up my friends in a news channel to do a night/space watch to observe it but they couldn't find it. this went on for 15 minutes and then it changed position, it started going in circles. i tried photographing this event but since it was dark, i couldn't. it kept moving in increasing speed and one moment here, then when you see it again, it has like teleported. it just glowed and didn't land, we could just make out that it's circular and glows because it was just glowing. it didn't practically disappear, but it was moving way too fast for us to find it, so we went inside... but before we went inside, our all dog started puking around and well after a month, it died. well our dog was a bit old and had two surgeries but he suddenly fell ill :( but we never believed ,in aliens, until that day. it was an amazing experience but people

correctly,\r\n     what i saw is the light go up, come back down, the strange clouds had disapated, above and below the object, then as it made a slow descent i saw 2 separate lights above a lower disc shaped color of a dark royal blue or purple, almost a blacklight color but brighter. the 2 light above it which took up 70% of it were very large and bright, with a\r\ndefinate separation of the 2 in the middle. this can be seen on a large screen hi def tv.\r\n    as it decended it slowed, then as it got lower below the power lines and near roof tops\r\nit appeared to be miles away south west of town, i mention sara park in the video but\r\nmy direction is off it appears to be 5 to 7 miles south of town in a desert area. no houses or buildings there, as it got to the roof line the left side appeared to me to flash a very bright red light on one sideas it hovered above the roof line a few seconds then dipped below that and went out of site,\r\n     the other 3 witness's saw it ascend quickly lower, then rise again, that is when i caught this on video here: (1:36) \r\n\r\n\r\nlook up blazze2k8 on youtube\r\n\r\n     that was it! my roommate called the non emergency police line to

of the normal markings of a plane. no tail lights wing lights and the lights were too huge to be landing lights. we are on the south side of the city, the airport is far north of here and it only went up and down in direction. my roommate said it rose very quickly high at 1st then kept the same speed shown on video. \r\n\r\nthanks for your time.\r\n","distance":"Over One

ground. i was awakened by what felt like a dogs cold nose in my ear and herd what sounded like hoofs running away. i got up to take a leak and saw what looked like a falling star at first in distance. however it did not burn out, or hit the ground and headed right toward me. as it grew nearer it grew larger and larger. the brightest and whitest light i had ever seen. it was a sphere like the moon with no dark spots. it stopped right in front of me and right over my head. again it was huge and i was frozen stiff. it made a very low pitched noise like a rumble. i closed one eye as they trained me in the military for aerial flairs because the lite was sooo very bright. the sound stated to go away when i herd more loud sound and here came 3 fighter jets in formation they were so low and the jet in front banked right between myself and this object. i could see the silo wet of the pilot. and the ufo took off like a bullet, made the jets look like they were standing still. i think i was in shock and sat on a rock. my friends sleep through the who thing. i sat there never moving till they woke. i told them what happened and of course the laughed and asked what i was smoking. the next morning my friends came to me at work with a copy of the denver post and it was all over the front page. bright lite in sky seen from mexico to colorado where they said it made a left turn and went west threw nevada, california, and disappeared heading out to the pacific. it has haunted all these years but all info on my siting seems to have vanished. i have found only a few such descriptions from the past that are similar. in the bible and a  astrologer who was apparently famous in his day from europe i believe during the renaissance period. i now have a very bad cataract on my right eye only, broke myself up some and am disabled and also have advanced cancer and am desperate for come confirmation and or closure. i am awake allot nights and can't sleep and on clear night look to the stars for a return. i have always had a feeling it sought me out and the jets chased it away.I long to return to the site but am so poor i can barely pay attention let alone afford to go back. please

1964 = 28 which is the sum of the digits of my birthdate 11-04-1957 = 28 and the numeric sum of the word \"eden\".  if you take the numeric number of the month of may (5) and add to the digits of the year 1992 you get 26 which is the sum of the word \"god\";  if you add the digits of the date 5-7-1992 then you get 33 which is the sum of the word \"amen\".   it is interesting to note that my grandfather who once lived in frayser died at age 92 and maybe this little orb ufo was his spirit. i call this little orb ufo the \"frayser fireball\". the \"frayser fireball\" ufo seems to relate to the \"moon of memphis\" ufo enough to suggest that it was created by god or the larger \"moon of memphis\" ufo for me to witness and report on. the numerology related to it makes it a miracle given to me.  i sensed that i was meant to view this 1992 ufo like i was meant to view the 1964 ufo.\r\n\r\n���@\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet -
