look at them  after about 15 minutes i got tired of looking so i thought i would look for shooting stars and satellites, then around 23:30 i saw 3-4 white lights, they all looked like satellites but they were all moving together, really fast, too fast to be satellites, and they were all flying in a triangle or a rhombus shape, not as if they were flying in a formation, but as if they were connected to an object in the shape of a triangle or rhombus, and it made no sound. now i live right next to an air force base and i get how people would think i just saw a military aircraft, but i'm an airplane type guy and i stay on top of what's coming in and going out and the weirdest thing we have is the f-35 and even it would make sound and not move so fast, and airplanes have red, green, and white lights, not all white ones. i want to say i also saw the silhouette of the object but i can't be sure, it moved across the  sky so fast, by the time i saw it it had already made it's way 90 degrees above my head and i lost sight of it around 40-35 degrees i saw it for about 3-5 seconds, if it were flying at 4000 feet it would appear to be moving at 900 nm but like i said it was totally quiet so it had to be much higher than that, or some unknown technology that can break the sound barrier without making so much as a clap. later after i saw it i saw sort of a streak of light that may have been a meteor but it was a really bright orange and seemed to curve as it went down around 30-25 degrees above the horizon i saw that around 23:45. so yeah that is what i saw i'll stay up tonight

but the exact date and time of the event i am not sure of and are merely estimations on my part. \r\n\r\nit was roughly mid-day. the sun was high in the sky and it was a perfectly clear day. we were out in the front yard doing some yard work. my father noticed an object in the sky east of where we were and pointed it out. it was roughly 60 degrees in elevation. a perfect, metallic sphere. it looked similar to something like brushed stainless steel. metallic but not a mirror/chrome reflection. it was clearly visible and had no external features. it seemed quite high up but not as high as commercial jet aircraft usually are, maybe closer to the altitude and speed of a smaller private single engine aircraft. it's size and altitude were hard to estimate since there were no reference points in sky to use. i would say it was roughly over pubnico harbor at 1000 to 2000 feet in altitude. it was moving at a constant speed and direction, from south west to north east. the altitude remained visibly the same. there was no sound and no other aircraft in the area at that time.\r\n\r\nit traveled to the other side of the house. i walked around the house to see if i could see it again. i did, it was still traveling in the same path and eventually traveled far enough away that i couldn't see it any more.\r\n\r\nour first thought was that it may be a balloon. ether a large mylar party balloon or a weather balloon. however balloons of any type are rarely spherical in shape, usually have strings tied to them and in the case of weather balloons, usually have instruments hanging underneath. they also tend to spin and swirl in the wind which would make them appear to change shape from the ground. this did not and maintained a perfect round shape which leads me to believe it was a sphere or always facing the same direction towards us. it did not behave like any balloon i had observed before or to this day.\r\n\r\ni was more curious than anything when i saw it. if i would have been old enough to drive i would have attempted to follow it by road. i am fairly familiar with the various operations and types of aircraft and space craft. this was not a plane, helicopter or any other type of conventional aircraft and i have yet to see anything quite like it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

have seen other things this finally proved to be 100 percent true it was clear and the disc shape was classic ufo.\r\nthe building opposite me has security cameras but the angle of the camera that

relatively low flying red orb (described it as egg shaped) in the sky from the ne traveling slowly to about nne where it hovered for a minute then traveled n, hovered again then ascended above the low cloud cover. about 10 red orbs individually and sometimes in pairs arriving first from the ne then some from the west. this was going on for over 1 hour. the height of the object were much greater than the fireworks. these orbs moved from below a very low cloud cover slowly moving to stationary points of ne and nw where they stayed for minutes, then slowly traveled toward to north, similar to the first sighting, hovering again then ascended through cloud cover only to be replaced with others somewhere else. not fireworks, chinese lanterns or flares - aircraft were visible because of navigation lights on normal path to airport in other directions and paths and no helicopters in area. \r\n\r\nwe both admit to believing in ufo's although never before claiming to have seen anything

i can see clearly out of my window at a large portion of the sky. then, a light darted across the night sky at an amazing speed.\r\n\r\ni have been to many airshows and the like and am aware of the kind of speeds at which aircraft can travel, this was in a totally different league. it arched over the night sky at terrific speed emitting  bright pea green light. what struck me also was the proportion of light it cast over the ground and in my room was far greater than the light source. the word 'glow' does not do it justice, it was far brighter. comparable to modern led police car lights flashing through a window into ones house, but perhaps still brighter, and of course in this encounter a constant light, and one must say while incredibly bright all round, as it passed me and began to go into the distance the craft seemed to emit more light from its stern side.\r\n\r\nas it passed at a fairly low altitude it most certainly hummed, and i witnessed the doppler effect so i am certain it came from the craft. a fairly high pitched hum, very abnormal, as i say i am familiar with aircraft the world over and this was most certainly no conventional noise such as a jet or turboprop.\r\n\r\ni lost sight of it as the width of my window naturally did not give me scope enough to see it continue its flight. i rushed outside onto my garden to see it but it had disappeared, i expected as much because at the speed it was going it was probably about another 5 or more miles away in the approximately 15 seconds it took me to get outside.\r\n\r\n5 minutes later, what was definitely a human craft flew by, i know the flight paths in my county off the back of my hand including military flight paths and over my house they travel dead west, or dead east. this aircraft was not, it was flying in the same direction as the ufo. it was far to dark to see it clearly among the clouds, it was travelling at the bottom of the cloud layer, occasionally revealing itself. possibly an raf hercules, but due to their tactical role as a transporter i doubt one of those would have been deployed in pursuit of a ufo. i just can't say what aircraft it was but it was definitely a four engined propeller aircraft.\r\n\r\ni say 7 minutes in my report because that was the time with this suspicious identifiable aircraft included, but my time seeing the actual green orb blast through the sky was about 8 seconds.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:07:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

eye i noticed what looked to be a reddish copper colored object in sky to my left. i stood up straight and really focused on the object. it appeared to have lights and a surface that reflected light off as metal does. it was also black at times as well. it appeared to hover for awhile and very slowly travel on a path that changed slightly as it progressed through the sky. i have to stress one thing. the first time i noticed this thing, it was directly over the airport. my company is building condos and houses beside our cities airport and it is closed airspace. nothing public or private can fly with out authorization. which leads to why i was curious as to what this slow moving completely silent object was. at first i thought it to be a hot air ballon but i asked myself. why would it be and who allowed it to fly directly over the airport and the landing strips. that would create a chance of an airplane crashing into it or the ground. it took about 3 hours to get almost right over my head. as it was moving around and stopping during these hours i began to notice it looked more like a metal upside down bell rather then a air ballon made from fabric. i really don't claim to know what it is because i have never seen anything like it before. there was what looked like a bright light on it as well. it never got any dimmer or changed color but just stayed constant. it was completely silent as it traveled trough the sky. i stopped randomly between working and snapped a series of maybe 7 pictures. i tried the video recorder but detriment did the object simply dissapeared from sight. it would not show up on video but clear as day in pictures. the object turned slightly as it moved so the pics show different details and angles. but you guys tell me what this is. i couldn't find any records of arial pictures of city nor reports of anything happening at airport. when the object just simply disappeared and i could not see it anywhere in sky i thought this to be extremely wierd. seeing as it had taken so long to get to my location and i could see it anywhere in the horizon. it's like it never happened really. only proof is pictures. after object was gone 2 army jets made multiple passes over the area. returning then flying off again out of site only to return and do this again. i'm at a loss as to what i saw and am not discounting anything. as long as it's realistic and logical.

lever towards bury at 2am on tues 15th july 2014. i noticed a very bright white light high in the sky ahead of me. i didn't think too much of it at first just thought it was a low plane. i noticed when i had a side view of the light it had a very bright red light that was flickering almost strobing & due to the large size & brightness of the red light i found myself watching it as i drove. it was at this point i realised it could not have been a plane or helicopter because of the way it moved. it wasn't particularly fast but it alternated between hovering & changing direction, all directions. i pulled over to watch & after a couple of minutes i was convinced it was not anything i had seen before. the red strobe light was amazing to watch & i then noticed it was getting a bit bigger & that there was also a green light but not as big or as bright as the red. i got my camera phone & took a couple of pictures but very disappointingly they were very grainy and dark & the lights were moving between the gaps between the houses so i never caught it on camera. i drove up the street and parked again to get a better look through the gaps and then watched for another few minutes (probably watched for 5-8mins in total) before deciding i should just head home. as i drove away the red strobe light was getting bigger & brighter & i felt a little uneasy at this point so i decided to drive home on main roads rather than the quieter more rural roads i normally drive home. as i turned a corner onto bury bolton road i saw the light were a lot bigger i slowed down & watched from my drivers side window i was about to stop & get my phone out again when it seemed to be slowing lowering & then its shape slowly appeared as if through a light cloud but it was lower than the clouds. it was a very dark/black triangular shaped object & it appeared to be large. it was still slowly lowering & at this point i became very spooked & felt i couldn't even look at it anymore, it was a very disturbing experience & i just wanted to get away & get home, i continued to drive home again along the main roads rather than my usual route as i felt extremely uneasy. i did notice the object rose again & the red light was still visible up in the sky. this experience has disturbed me & i'm not quite sure what to do about it. i would love to hear from anyone who saw these lights or object on this day as i believe there is no way anyone out at that time in the area did not see it

it! my husband thought i was crackers and said so,then said \" you know, you're right, it's no aircraft light i've ever seen\" we watched it for a few more moments and it just blinked out. it didn't

to south, i thought it may be a satellite but friends told me they never travel north to south so, i don't know then. it was also blue white though whiter than the earlier sighting, but it was the speed of it that i remember most, i have never seen an aircraft cover that area in that time.\r\nlooking out of a first storey window from visible horizon to horizon around 4 seconds at about 10 o'clock high again, and also totally silent. i expected a sonic boom at that speed but nothing. it was just a light, no craft visible.\r\n","distance":"101-500

\r\n\r\ni usually spend sometime on the terrace in night to watch and track approaching and departing commercial flights in mumbai airspace. please note that the airspace specifically above mira road is very active with traffic due to its geographical location near mumbai airport. around 40% of the air traffic flies over the mira road region, including the flights which over-passes mumbai. i use flightradar24 application on my smartphone to track these flights just for fun, so i'm very well aware of how a airplane in a night sky looks like.\r\n\r\nso on 3/28/2014 at 4am i noticed a steady white light (approx 1-2 kms high) moving relatively faster (around 500+ knots) than other planes from sw to ne direction. i noticed that this particular flight was not showing up in flightradar24, which is not uncommon. i had noticed earlier that some flights do not show up on flightradar24 and the reasons behind this can be many.\r\n\r\nbut this particular 'flight' didn't have any blinking lights whatsoever, which is usually the case with commercial planes and even with fighter jets.\r\nit only had one steady white light and it was moving very fast and if it was some air force jet, with the speed it was moving it should have made some shock-wave like sound, but there was none.\r\n\r\nand in less then 30 seconds this ufo disappeared as if that steady light switched off. it didn't faze-out but disappeared just like that. the night had no cloud cover.\r\n\r\ni couldn't take a video or a photo of this sighting since the sky was very dark and the ufo was flying very high. but i have seen a youtube video of a similar sighting with 9+ ufos in night sky, and one of the white steady lights is what i saw, so i have taken a screenshot of that video to show you what i saw.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
