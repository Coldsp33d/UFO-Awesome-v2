travelling at the speed a conventional small aircraft would. if it weren't for the light source and shape, i would think it to be a private plane.

have some ham radio friends who sometimes like to talk late at night, so i grabbed my handheld radio, clipped it to my belt, and attached my earphones to it.  i went outside and noticing it was dark, i turned on the patio light in back.  i  first watered some potted plants and other plants in the flower beds (i chatted with a few people on the ham radio for the few minutes it took me to do this).  i then went to my side-yard, uncoiled the hose and attached the sprayer.  there was no activity on the ham radio by this time.  before i was going to water the garden, i was going to quickly spray an area of dry grass.  i started to do this, when my ham radio burst into static.  this sometimes occurs on the frequency i was tuned, but it is usually caused by weak signals from other hams, so i can usually hear a scratchy voice coming through under the static.  however, my radio was loud with nothing but static.  i turned off the sprayer and dropped it and the hose.  i unclipped the radio and checked to see if the squelch had somehow been turned off.  nope.  so i adjusted the squelch to the higher setting and my radio went silent.  i was about to clip the radio back to my belt, but my radio again became alive with white noise.  i checked the squelch again.  it was still at max.  i then moved to adjacent frequencies and the squelch wasn't working there either.  i then raised my radio high up into the air to see if the frequencies were more clear if the antenna was higher.  that's when i saw it.  a large triangular shaped object slightly to the east of me.   it couldn't have been more than a half mile away.   for the smallest fraction of a second, i thought it was a plane, but it didn't move, it just hovered.  the faint lights on it weren't flashing or blinking.  i was frozen.  i didn't know what it was.  could it be a drone? it floated, perfectly still for a moment longer, then it started to slowly glide away from me.  i don't recall hearing anything.  i noticed that some, perhaps all, of the lights on it were slowly and gently pulsating.  a second or two later, it very quickly moved in a northernly direction and was out of my line of sight in a matter of seconds.  i didn't move.  it couldn't have been a drone.  i tried to process what i saw, but couldn't.  a few moments later, voices emanating from my ham radio caught my attention.  i turned off the radio, put the hose away, went inside and sat on the edge of my bed.  i didn't know what i had seen and didn't know what to do about it.  i took a shower, brushed my teeth, and then sat at the dining table for several moments, trying to process what i had witnessed.  i didn't get much sleep that night, nor the night after.  this stupid thing has affected me, and i don't like it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

, so i was the only one on the golf course to see the object (to the best of my knowledge)... i was on a plateau where there were two tee-offs to two separate fairways , so i had a pretty good view of the surrounding area. as i was taking my practice swings , i happened to look northwards , across the valley, and noticed what appeared to be a hot air balloon,(but quite a bit larger than a typical hot air balloon), about half a mile away..Upon further inspection, i noticed that this object had no basket or undercarriage that a typical hot air balloon would have...It was silver , and was kind of shimmering , much like a metal ball bearing would if exposed to the sun... it didn't move or make any sound at all and just sat there, shimmering in the sun , about 250-300 feet above some houses in the subdivision across the valley...I had a very strange feeling as i was observing this object , kind of like someone was watching me....I watched this object for about 3-4 minutes , then decided to hit my ball... after i hit my ball , i looked up to the same area , where the houses were , and realized that the object had vanished, just disappeared without a trace...I just stood there in disbelief , with the realization that i certainly hadn't witnessed a hot air balloon ! unfortunately , i didn't have a camera or cell phone with me to take a photo , so was unable to have evidence to show, and i think this is why i've been reluctant to share this story publicly , although , over the years , it has made for some interesting story telling around the campfire !","distance":"501 Feet

vegas with a detour into death valley. driving at night, no other vehicles on the road. wife was asleep. radio started acting weird. i couldn't get a station in so i turned it off and rolled down the window. i slowed down looking out the side window and looked up at the stars. so much light pollution from where i'm from i was amazed at how much i could see. i continued glancing up at the sky from time to time and suddenly noticed there was no stars in a section of the sky. it was as i was pulling into a tunnel. so i slowed down and looked closer at the sky. \r\n\r\ni realized what i was looking at. possibly about 100 feet over the road and towards the shoulder was a pale black wing/wedge shape craft. i had slowed the car to near walking speed. there was no wind or clouds. the car i was driving was a hybrid and completely silent except for the tires slowly rotating. i could recognize the surface texture as well. \r\n\r\ni jumped up onto the window where my arm was and costed the car while trying to steer and not blink or make a noise. after a few minutes i realized how huge it was. i had costed for a few minutes underneath it and i was still less than half way down the side. \r\n\r\nthe skin changed into a generic star pattern. slightly light stars and black sky. i was able to still clearly make out its outline. it looked like an optical illusion that would have fooled me had i not been looking directly at it and it changed. \r\n\r\nit dawned on me as soon as i saw it, that this could possibly be bad. it could be a government thing or something people don't want told so i kept my mouth shut. this is why i didn't involve my wife. when it changed its camo/skin i then decided it was time to get out of there. no pictures, no one knew it happened to me so there was no foul. i hit the gas and got out of there. oddly enough 10 minutes later my brakes overheated and failed while driving down into the valley. i had to use the e-brake to slow the car down. almost skid off the sheer drop on the side of the road. not sure if the 2 are related. i didn't connect the 2 then. i don't have mountains where i'm from. \r\n\r\ni waited until on the plane home before i told my wife and years before i said anything to anyone else. after some recent research i feel this would be a wise item to report. i'm a sceptic. i felt as though most of these reports were crazy people, mistaken identity and secret military projects. there is nothing i've seen that suggest it was man made with that tech or size.","distance":"21-100

just above sawgrass expressway a fairly large red glowing ball headed sw. no noise. never seen such a bright red almost like an energy glow. it appeared round maybe a little oval. a bright white light appeared to be in center or maybe through the center not sure as the glow was so intense. my wife said \"is on fire\" i said no but kept staring at it trying to figure out what the hell it could be. as it went past building i run downstairs to apartments courtyard and observe it til it dissapeared in the distance. lasted maybe 5 minutes. walk back into apartment and start telling wife what the heck was that. she interrupts me saying hurry up and look and sure enough like deja vu exactly same thing again. i wish i took photo from balcony but it happened so fast and unexpected. i start to run out again except she yells take your phone and take pics. of course i'm trying to zoom in with my new phone but couldn't figure it out. i start taking pics. if you look at pic close the object appears doing mostly white maybe from camera flash but the outline shows red. i zoomed in on pics on computer. a couple pics show the bright courtyard lights glaring at ground level i thought ruined the shot so i didn't zoom in on those pics until a couple days later. it you zoom in you see the red object maybe because flash didn't go off due to courtyard lights. it blew my mind to see the deep red. then i notice something else in top right corner i didn't notice when i was observing red object so intently. a bluish purple object shadowing the red object. what the heck could it be. there was no noise.\r\ni'm ex usaf and seen all types of craft. never anything close to this. here's the kicker. i go back to apartment and of course right out on balcony to see if there are more. within 5 minutes an unmarked gray large helicopter races overhead directly west toward where the objects went. it was loud even after it was way beyond the area we first noticed the first one. we estimate the object was under clouds about 1000 ft above ground and 1000 ft away from us. since the sighting i've observed planes passing the area and the size was about the wingspan of a commercial plane so maybe 200'diameter. if this is govt its way beyond any technology we know or have been told of. i wish i videod it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
