san\r\nantonio, at approximately 75 mph.  somewhat past or\r\neast of san antonio raceway i noticed a white light to the\r\nsoutheast between 2:00 and 3:00 bearing.  it was low to \r\nthe horizon, 10 to 15 degrees above the far tree \r\nat first it did not seem unusual, as there is a small airfield\r\nin the area that side of the highway and it was about the altitude of a small plane \r\nas if it were on approach with a landing light on.  at this point\r\nit was a bright single point of light, no features seen, as it\r\nwas dusk, an almost dark sky.  initially seemed to be moving\r\nslowly north, then i took notice as it apparently accelerated and \r\nsped across the highway moving north at what i thought was\r\n\"military\" speed, as if it were a trainer from nearby randolph afb\r\ngoing all out.  i thought this unusual for the location and altitude.\r\nas it passed to between a 9:00 and 10:00 bearing to the north\r\nfrom my traveling position, from that angle it either revealed itself as 2 equal \r\nlights or split into 2, i could not tell, but in close formation.  then abruptly they faded out\r\nquickly, first the second, then the first.  there was \r\nno  clouds or haze, they just faded into the clear.\r\ni think if they were usaf trainer aircraft there was \r\nenough light for me to have seen the aircraft bodies.\r\nwhich i see fairly often across this road.  also, i\r\na little surprised when i could not make out any\r\naircraft attached to the lights when they crossed\r\nthe highway.\r\n\r\nthis struck me as unusual for several reasons.\r\ni did not think these were meteors as the flight path\r\nwas low on the horizon, perfectly horizontal to\r\nthe ground, and i appeared to be gaining on\r\ntheir path as i drove.  also, they were points of \r\nlight, there were no tails or smoke.\r\n\r\ni don't think it was a civilian light plane due to its\r\napparent speed.\r\n\r\ni don't think they were military, could not see the\r\ncraft, no strobes, red lights and light appeared constant\r\nboth coming and going.  the second light did not \r\nseem quite right for wingtip lights...This might still be a \r\npossibility, but they still seemed odd.\r\n\r\ndrones?  rate of speed seemed too much for someone\r\nhoaxing with small drones.\r\n\r\nthat's it.  i see the aircraft that frequent this area quite often\r\nand these don't seem to fit the bill  got a few goosebumps when these\r\nlights faded out and disappeared.  \r\n\r\ni would be interested to hear if there were any other sightings\r\nar this time or other explanations.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

time we visited. while waiting for the astrologer to set up, i looked up at the stars, but because of the hotel's light, i blocked it out with my hands to see them better. everything was still in the sky, as far as i can tell, although a few seconds later, i saw one of the stars moving father down the sky. reminding myself that they were only stars, i ignored it and thought that it was my eyes playing tricks on me because of how dark it was. the star stopped moving as soon as my eyes readjusted, but a few seconds later it, again, moved further down the sky. this time i payed closer attention to what was happening. it had stopped moving, but, like before, it started moving after a few seconds, but this time it did not stop. it made a left, but wide, turn really fast, but because i was ready for it i noticed that it wasn't turning, but was making straight lines at different angles, probably only three or four, impossibly fast. after it made a half circle in the sky, it paused for a second and took off extremely fast and kinda made a short light streak in the sky. i must've blinked because suddenly it was gone. because it was so high in the sky i could not tell if it had done any other flying manoeuvres. after seeing this event, i was not sure what to believe, i just thought that it was my imagination, but after watching 'hangar 1: the ufo files' and listening to what other people have encountered, it made me believe that what i saw did, in fact, happen. keep in mind though, that there is a military base somewhere close by because there are military airplanes that come and go on a regular basis, probably practicing their piloting techniques. it's hard to remember how many days past, but i'm pretty sure that it was only one or two, two            blackish-camouflage military helicopters flew over my hotel heading in the general direction of where the airplanes usually take-off and land. this event stands out because in my time there, i never saw any helicopters. these ones' though were definitely special-ops or something because they looked like they belonged in a war or a war scene in a movie. also, this was in the middle of the day and everyone saw them since we heard them coming. i did not see who was inside, although they obviously did not care about who saw them since they flew so low.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

began to look at the moon rising in the eastern night sky. weather conditions were clear, no clouds, visibility was unlimited. at about 9:20pm, the inbound american airlines flight from mia caught my attention. it was a s-80 in the standard approach path this flight would take for runway 31. i worked for aa over 16 years and a total of 24 years combined at bna with other fbo's and aa. being in the tca and landing pattern, the aircraft engines were throttled back producing the expected noise of a jet aircraft in landing configuration. as i looked at the flight move away from my vantage point, i caught the glint of an alternating red and white light to the right of the s-80 but in the same direction, just higher altitude. the light pattern did not mimic the characteristic red on left, green on right with white strobe underneath seen on all civil aircraft. the light appeared distinctive and very close together giving the impression a single object. the general speed of the object appeared faster than most aircraft types but not so dramatic as to be impossible. what i did observe was the light appeared to make abrupt turns to the north, appear to stop or hover, then turn back to the east, hover for a moment, then descend rapidly all the while the tight alternating red and white pattern was maintained. my perception of altitude changes were made using the power lines as a reference against the night sky. these abrupt changes in altitude and directions continued for more than a minute till the object was lost in the glare of a street lamp across from where i was standing. i moved my fist to block the light and quickly scanned the area before finally catching site of the object  now moving in a westerly direction. instead of the red and white pulsing light , the object appeared to have just two tightly spaced white lights and was making a rapid but controlled decent to lower altitude with no apparent sound. i watched until the object was out of my sight above the tree line and hill west of where i was standing. i opened my phone app to the flight watch radar and noted it had the aa flight and others in the tca marked with appropriate flight numbers and identification and flight path. there were also two tracks one to the east and near parallel to the earlier aa flight and another on a westerly descending track, both  unmarked indicating something may have registered on the radar but not identified by flight plan or transponder code. i scanned the sky for a few minutes just to rule out police or life flight helicopters and observed no other aircraft in the general area. time at end of observation was 9:58pm central

profoundly changed my opinion of what reality on earth may be. i never got around to reporting it, because at that time, hell, i was only 12. i was sitting in the driveway waiting for my mom to take me to hockey practice i'm the afternoon sometime.  suddenly out of my right eye i feel a flash of light(may have been reflecting the sun). i glance over and i see a solid black/gray football shaped craft emerging from the woods and rocking while banking towards the next group of wooded area. from where i was sitting the craft was less than 100 feet away from me in broad daylight and clear skies. \r\n\r\n it appeared like a football on its side with the top and bottom hemispheres slightly off center. it had what almost looked like black corrugated tubing stretching from front to back of the craft. another part about the instance that i have to express is the movement of the craft. as soon as the bright flash happened i'm not sure if the being controlling the craft was startled or lost control, but the way how it rocked while it was banking made me believe that whatever piloting it had an \"oh crap\" moment. if there was a person inside it, surely it would have vomited from the rocking. maybe it was autonomous. that's the only reason why i bring up the movement. it may have been some sort of drone. ours? maybe. it had no wings or visible engine and was absolutely silent. \r\n\r\n  maineville used to be pretty rural at that time, it headed towards what used to be a farm. i only saw it for about 30 seconds but the 30 seconds has been burned into my head for quite some time.  i wish i had accurate time and dates. maybe someone else saw this. i've never seen any other ufo report about anything like what i saw. trust me since i was 12 i've been obsessed with this. i've researched everywhere and watched countless videos trying to find a match of what i saw, which now leads me to reaching out to others. i know what i saw. i saw it close and in broad daylight. you can't tell me it was a blimp, it was less than 100 feet away from me. this was real. if a sketch is needed, i'll do my best.

was moving. what ever these crafts are they appeared to be starlike with the colors white,blue yellow red and green, only through the binoculars, but primarily white and blue. the family was quite astonished by this sighting. personaly i cant see them being of military or commercial projects because i have never seen anything move like this, very erratic with up and down, side to side movement sometimes casting an ora. the evening progressed into morning when we noticed the secong and the third craft,same exact coloring and movement. at times they appeared to be sinaling each other with red and green flashes. i don't know what i was looking at, and being over 50 yrs old, never in my live have iever seen anything like this.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":58050,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.0676738,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07142014-0035","longitude":-74.4017412,"occurred":1404543600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

ufo- round shape, colored moving lights around the edges. they were standing under a walnut tree when they saw it.  later in life, dad would return from camping trips in the area between mexicali, mex and tijuana/ensenada called la rumorosa.  he'd come back almost in a panic telling us w/urgency that he was seeing hundreds upon hundreds of ufos traveling northward--california(?). i too, am now quite concerned of what i have seen in the sky for years now.  i have no one to talk to, feel kind of alone, don't trust. my last event happened evening of june 25,this year, 2014 approx. 10 pm.  what i have seen has changed me, so my now life i am compelled to look upward - day & nights.  almost daily, i sit or stand on top of a solidly-build shed, appox 6.5 feet high.  there i scan the sky carefully. (dad taught me how: look 1st w/your eyes.  this world aircraft should fly on somewhat of a flat plane -right, i.E., not up & down unless severe weather.  should fly on a straight path, not sideways, etc, then when you spot something suspicious, then quick, grab your binoculars, telescope, etc!)  anyhow, this evening i was standing on the shed, looking to southwest direction.  all of the sudden from just left of a wood utility pole that was in my view, (behind next door neighbor's house) i saw a red orange basketball size ball moving ever so slowing acroos the sky, going eastward, like towards mexicali mexico. it was far away, maybe 5 - 10 miles away?  the color was burning hot sun, but no flames, nothing, just a sun-like round. this thing stopped in mid-air 2x for a few seconds, then continued its path.  poeple on interstate 8, going west must have seen it.  pleas report it!! there is so much ufo activity here imperial county. i live amongst law enforcement & legal

sw direction side of the airport. the first thing i noticed was the ball of bright lights; not being able to see well without glasses i didn't think much until i noticed the speed. i was like wow that's super fast. i would approximate the area from ground where i image it wouldve been on land to the area it wouldve arrived at in a straight direction as maybe 30 miles or so. it went that distance in about the 10 - 15 seconds we watched. then in the next second i said whoa as an airplane crossed the exact path leaving the airport from e - se(in an x type of crossing not a t). i said that was close. as we continued to watch the 8 shaped orb. it looked as if it were a figure 8 laying on it's side. two perfectly round bright shaped orbs. then i started wondering even without my glasses why i can't see the wings and tail in the early dusk hours as i usually can. we watched other planes further away and we could see the wings and tail. and i thought where are the wings and tail on this one. at that point it separated into two orbs. the back one disappeared and within a second the first one disappeared. as we all stood there in the middle of the road in shoke we didnt know what to say. i asked the boys to explain what the saw. they said exactly what i saw. my son checked the time and it was exactly 9:05 pm. after thinking for a moment i told the boys there was no way it would or could have been a plane. the airport would not put two airplanes in the same direct path of each other. only moments from missing each other had it not been for the speed of the ufo. then as we thought about it we believe that it was not on figure 8 shaped vessel but rather two orbs probably \"racing\" or \"chasing\" the other. from our view they looked connect but could have be semi side by side to appear to be one. we though wow this is amazing and had hoped to see more sightings. we definitely will be spenind more time out doors investigating but will be ready with a camera next time.
