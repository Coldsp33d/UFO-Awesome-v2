mother and i were driving across the mountain one night as we both started to feel strange. we knew that area very well, but all of a sudden we could not recognise where we were or any of the surroundings. a few minutes later, as we were making our way down the mountain, i saw a clear red and green light pulsating in the valley below. the strange sensation continued as we discussed why there would be roadwork in the valley at this late hour. mere minutes after reaching the valley itself, the lights suddenly appeared above the road as we came around a bend. the lights were situated side by side at least a car-length apart, one pulsating brightly as the other dimmed in a repeated cycle. the surrounding terrain was dark and undisturbed by the lights. it was so close at that point that we had no time to stop, but ended up driving directly underneath it. i bent forward and look up at it, but i have no memory of what i saw, i only remember feeling that it was a bad idea to look up at it while beeing this close. my mother was terrified, but i felt no fear as i begged her to stop the car and drive back. she refused to turn around, but agreed to stop so that i could take pictures. as i looked back at the lights i noticed how quiet everything was, and i realised that this thing couldnt possibly be a helicopter. i got back in the car and we left the area, but minutes later we noticed that the lights followed at a distance. we both got scared at this point. it followed for several minutes, then suddenly disappeared. we thought that was the end of it, but then my mother yelled that there was another light on her side of the car, across the river just above the treetops. this light was bright white and followed the car briefly through the twists and turns of the terrain. suddenly the white orblike light flashed brightly twice, illuminating the treetops below, then it was gone too. \r\n\r\nfor months after this incident we both felt very disoriented whenever we passed through the valley. the few scattered houses seemed to come in the wrong order, the landscape was strangely unfamiliar and i didnt even remember the large bridge crossing the river, and thats been there my whole life. i also experienced a severe headache with a following nosebleed after this event, which repeated itself the following year on the exact date of the first.

during this time of day in central florida, the clouds build and bloom up into the sky. it is a spectacle in itself. so as i flipped burgers i also kept an eye to the sky to watch the building cloud activity.  i noticed a group of black crows flying about as high as i have ever seen them (perhaps 5,000 feet) so i was just watching the black crows riding the updrafts and i caught sight of what i thought was a dark jet aircraft thousands of feet higher and a mile further away. the jet was not what i expected once i started to get a good look at it after it neared the top of the newly developing cumulus cloud. i was confused by the crafts  orientation during flight. i could not see any wings, just a round dull dark object moving like a jet aircraft, straight on a path, then it took an unexpected turn downward tracing the angle of the cloud. i looked again (i was wearing my polarized prescription sun glasses) and again i could not see any indications of wings. without wings for orientation of the \"jet\" i could not tell if it were a barrel roll of what maneuver could possibly make that sharp turn. there was no noise at all, not a whisper. since i had a nice photo taken of this sky (i occasionally practice with my  camera using airliners as subjects),  i sat down with photoshop and created this visual illustration to document what i had seen as accurate to scale as i could. i am a registered architect so i am quite used to creating visualizations. i am also a usaf veteran, quite familiar with most aircraft.\r\n\r\nwhen this craft took the downward turn it was diving at a faster speed, then it actually slowed down at the bottom of its dive and took a reverse angle turn into the cloud. approximate time of viewing the flight path was about 15 sec. i kept staring at the cloud for the eventual exit with the assumed normal flightpath of a normal aircraft, but it never made an exit from the cloud. i told the family about what i saw and after lunch drew up this illustration using a preexisting photo taken a previous afternoon. it was a good reference because it had a jet airliner (note: wings) in the scene and i could relate all drawing elements to that. i needed to photoshop a facsimile of the subject cloud in this report but other than cloud that the image is a straight shot of the sky type that i saw that afternoon. i didn't file this report immediately because i wanted to see if anyone else reported something first. a type of verification since i was alone. however no reports have been filed and i will need to be one of the first. note that kennedy space center is perhaps 35 miles away from this objects position.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path

country club. when following the flight of one of my balls, i noticed a white object in the sky...The range, of course, faces the same direction at which i saw the object. it stood out because of its dull, chalky white color in a clear, unobstructed sky. initially i thought it was one of our resident egrets. that initial interpretation lasted only a second or two, as the object was moving as though gliding, but on a level course and no other movement. since no bird wings flapped, my second thought was it might be a single engine plane. there is a small airfield in the approximate direction in which i was looking. as i continued to observe, i noticed that it was not in the traffic pattern for that field, and this object was closer to me than the airfield. i am a general aviation pilot so i am used to estimating altitudes. my estimate was that it was at 1000 to 1200ft. my perspective was, if 90 degrees is head on, i was at a point around 70 degrees moving right to left. \r\n\r\nit became clear to me that the object was rectangular. there were no rounded edges front or back. no wings. no propellor, no noise, which i would have been able to discern at the distance this object was from me. it was about 30-40ft long and its depth/height was, at my distance, a little less than a pencil held at arm's length. \r\n\r\nin the process of hitting balls, one looks down to position the next shot, which i did, as well as wipe the clubface clean of dirt. this takes maybe 5 seconds. i performed this small proceedure with the expectation that when i looked up again i would be able to follow the object some more. however, as i looked up, it had disappeared completely. i searched the sky thinking that the object may have turned its \"tail\" toward me. after many seconds doing this, i became disappointed that i had looked away, even for a few seconds. \r\n\r\ni was fascinated by the object because i couldn't come up with an explanation of what it might have been. when i left after my practice, i called my brother and two other friends and described the incident. \r\n\r\ni went to the course today for more practice and i asked one of our range managers, a retired teacher who happens also to be fairly well traveled, if he had seen anything. i let him tell me what he saw before i mentioned any particulars. he described almost exactly as i have here the very same features and actions of the object i witnessed. this is why i have stated there were two witnesses. i did not ask on the day of the event any of the others, maybe two or three

into house, retrieved binoculars to observe object.  object moved in straight flight path estimated at 15000 ft, moving at an extremely fast pace.  this object easily traveled 10-15 miles in less than 30 seconds.  because of the time lost in retrieving bino's i could not get a clear view.  in about 5-10 minutes max another object same as above again traveled across same flight path.  with bino's in hand i observed a sphere shaped object that had 5 seperate bright orange glow sections.  again object was in view less than 30 seconds, could not believe the intensity of the bright orange glow this aircraft emitted.  finally once again a third aircraft flew over the same flight path, probable 8-10 minutes from last sighting.  the object as viewed with bino's was exactly as second craft.  this craft however once banked east at a very prononced pitch, then was out of my vision.  my house lies in the flight path of incoming aircraft to tampa int. airport.  no civilian a/c flew during these incounters.  i waited outside an additionally 30 minutes and began observing civilian a/c once again flying into tampa, which i could also hear, which is is common because of there reduced altitude.  there is no doubt these object where observed at both tampa int. and macdill afb.  as a 20 year us army special forces soldier i have observed no object that matched this sighting to include b1 and b2 bombers, assorted fast movers, nasa shuttle launches and having witnessed scud & mlrs missile projectiles in the 1st gulf war.  this event was very unusual and worth noting.","distance":"Over One

some lights that looked like camera flashes in the sky south and southeast of us . we kept watching for them and saw them a few times . at about 12:00 am (midnight)we were watching some other weird things in the sky that were not airplanes or helicopter as they were making no noise at all and they would appear and then disappear , we at first thought they were stars , but then we felt something overhead and we both looked up to see a craft that was shaped like a missile or rocket . it was long and had short wing looking things on both sides towards the back and the front of the craft , there was 2 rows of yellow lights going along the length of the craft . my daughter had her phone with her but we were so stunned that we didn't think to take pictures of the thing , we watched it as it went slowly over head .It made no noise at all it was totally silent .As it went passed we watched it as far as we could watch it and then it veered off to the right or to the west and then for a few seconds we lost site of it . we caught site of it again across the highway and over towards the college so we went down to the entrance of where we live and we saw it again heading west . it went higher and then just was gone , i don't know if it disappeared or it just went so fast away that we could not see it leaving , we have seen a lot of things in the sky over where we live and a lot of it we can not explain , we see airplanes and helicopters but then we see things that are not . we have seen a saucer shaped ufo fly over and when it turned lightly we saw a rounded top on it but could not see anyone inside . we have seen round one with strobing lights and flashing lights that are too bright to be planes .About a week after we had our siting of the rocket shaped ufo i was on face book and one of my face book friends had drawn a picture of a ufo that someone he knows saw in fresno california i believe and it was the same thing that my daughter and i saw , ","distance":"501 Feet

10 or 10:30ish pm. i looked up to the end of the street and saw a bright round object coming across the front yard of the corner house across the street (two houses up from us). it went right up to the front of the house close to the bottom then raised up to the second floor. i nudged my friend to look up there. as soon as she looked up there this ball of light zoomed down the street (to the right) and stopped right in front of us (about 25 or less feet from us) and hovered a second or two then shot to the left and around to the backside of her house. my friend ran after it around her house but quickly came back after it disappeared. never saw it again. it definitely had direction and speed changes and purpose in it's movements. very cool!","distance":"20 Feet or

a red light up pretty far ahead of us almost like a tower light. my boyfriend at the time was in the air force. he was like i don't think so but not sure. as we drove the red like seemed to have little more color to it as it got closer.  eventually it was coming down in front of us while we were driving. it almost seemed like it was in the middle of the road and it got to the point we we're going to hit it head on!  the light was so bright we couldn't even see.  i screamed to mike to stop. all the sudden we were still driving down the road i guess had gone through it i said why didn't you do something he said he couldn't said it was like he was just froze. he said look behind us. i looked back and we could see the light behind us and it was way behind us like a red light again.  then a few minutes later we could see the red light up in the sky then it was in the road again we went through or hit it or whatever happen and the same thing happen we could see it behind, then in front of us this happen over and over nothing we could do was like rewinding a movie over and over.  i was in the floorboard crying at times and he just cried. we would say should we pull over in between it coming back down but was scared to death we were out in no where pitch black. finally saw a small town and stopped immediately, also realized we had lost about a hr or so of time.  never been so scared in my life can't even explain and had never heard of ufo ' s tell after this had happened.  we were never going to tell anyone but every day i wonder what happened to us.
