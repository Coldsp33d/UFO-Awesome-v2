was traveling towards the northeast, i'm my direction. i continued to observe, and as it got closer overhead, i truly though it was an aircraft on fire, as you can see the presence of flames on it. very scary. the fireball continued for another two minutes or so in a northeast direction, and i observed that it was drastically slowing down just about over my head but slightly to the east.It appeared as if it were going to change directions, completely stopped for about five seconds, just burning. then it began to flicker, like a type of strobe, it flickered twice, then completely disappeared.I went online to see if an aircraft had disappeared or crashed, nothing reported, and i'm thinking i may have been the only one to see this object. in australia, a few days ago, there was a report of space junk from a recent space launch. i don't know if its possible for this to be space junk from the launch, but it was very frightening and has me baffled to this very moment. i observe the night sky as often as possible, seen many other objects which have been unexplainable, but this was absolutely frightening. i sure wish i had photo or video proof.","distance":"Over One

angle, north west at this time, and just disappeared. the structure was as long as boeing jet, but with a long cylinder body. we have seen in past years, the space shuttle, the iss cross the sky in

sky. the first very surreal experience was when i was 14 in goa with my brother. i saw a light make sudden movements in the sky, when i asked my brother to confirm if it's a plane, it made one more quick movement and disappeared. this scared the life out of my brother and i. since that time, i remember waking up one morning in what felt like my room. i was paralysed and everything was white and bright. i felt as if something was holding me down and that scared me a lot. i tried to say 'our father' in my head and it felt extremely difficult to process any words in my head. eventually, everything the room was clear and was no longer paralysed. throughout being under paralysis, i had been trying to screen and think i even managed to scream a couple of times. i ran out of the room and asked my family why they had not come in to help and why they did not hear my screams. turned out, no one heard anything and i probably just had a nightmare - a very very real one. my mother sprinkled some holy water on me and told me it was going to be fine...\r\n\r\nin london, my bed was next to a window. i had had a couple of 'paralysis' moments then but none of them seemed to scare me. i saw glowing objects in the distance at night from my room and felt like i had to look at the sky on most nights. for a few years after i moved from there, it was all fine. no sighting, no paralysis. \r\n\r\nin 2010, after i got married, it started happening again. i started seeing more 'lights' in the sky and dreams of natural disasters. \r\n\r\nlast year i had a dream that has stuck in my head - well, parts of it anyway. i was in an operating room and these two beings were extracting what looked like fat out of my body and injecting it into theirs. i was very comfortable with it all and even went on to say to one of those beings that \"it's okay. i think you need the fat.\" soon after, i was shown this room  full of people from different backgrounds wearing white clothing. i was told this was the new world and everyone here is happy. within seconds, i was getting on the london underground with my friends and woke up. \r\n\r\nover the last few weeks, i have been having recurring dreams of looking up at the night sky. sometimes alone and sometimes with friends or family. the theme is the same. i am looking up and there are crafts of different shapes and sizes. recently, i also noticed a triangle formed on my left arm that feels like it means something. there is a birthmark on my right hand which also feels like it means somethings - it looks like a number '4'. i have also been waking up with scars that disappear over time. the most disturbing one was on my navel that looks like a burn/rash and disappeared soon after. now i have what looks like snake bit marks on my right arm. \r\n\r\ni know how crazy all this sounds and maybe my mind is just making everything up to cover some deep sub concious issue i may have? i do not know. \r\n\r\ni almost forgot to mention, i have gained a deep interest in astronomy and astrology in the last few years, just 'know' certain things before they happen and can hear high pitch noises if i try to meditate. currently, i think i can guess what people are thinking and i am right on most occasions. i am working on developing this further. \r\n\r\ni have attached a picture of the most recent marks i found. this could also just an insect bite - i am not sure.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":57975,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":52.055098737478325,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-07132014-0021","longitude":-0.304053467223078,"occurred":1055311200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":null,"reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1405264573000,"summary":"I

at the end of a road on a cliff. there were 2 roads that led directly to it as it was at the end of both roads. before we ever got close, from the freeway we noticed a bright light that seemed to be above the area where i apartment building was. as we got to the road that would take us to the apartment we saw it. it was huge, round, silent, with small lights that went around the middle section of the craft. it also had a dome on the top. as we drew closer it began moving in our direction, it was right above the tree tops and the trees were just slightly taller than our 3 story apartment. my husband at the time said that he was going to follow it and i said, \"not with me in the truck!\" i remember getting out of the truck close to the entrance of the apartment door. as i was walking towards the door i turned back to see my husband pulling away to follow the craft. i never remember going into the apartment or discussing the event even with my husband after the event occurred until at least 20 years later, when for some reason, the memory of that night returned. i suspect that we could have been abducted, or simply just had our memories erased for a time. when i mentioned the event to my husband, who by then was my ex, he immediately remembered it, but not in as much detail as i did. i am not aware if anyone else saw it and if they had, i bet their memories would have been tampered with as well. i am sure i could find the address to our apartment as it would be listed on my son's birth certificate. at this time all of my belongings are packed as we plan to move to alaska again. i wish i had pictures.\r\n\r\nwhen i saw the craft, i knew exactly what it was as i had seen a smaller version of it before around december 1975, when the same husband was in the army and we were living on the military post in el paso, texas. it was also late at night. that's a whole other story. one that sort of creeps me out. \r\n\r\nsome family members also witnessed close up sightings as well. my grandmother saw one hoovering over the end of her trailer where i was sleeping, when i was visiting her in louisiana, when i was around 8 years old. my mother, the neighbor across the street, and some friends leaving our house saw a small craft as it was hoovering just above our road and when our friends car was driving away it rose to just above the car then in a flash it shot straight up. that happened in front of my childhood home located right across from houston's hobby airport. there were 4 witnesses to that event.","distance":"21-100

speed.I couldn't believe my eyes. these 2 orbs were abnormally bright (not the usual air plane lights)and my wife,who is a sceptic when it comes to ufos, was freaking out. we both stayed there,flabbergasted at what we just witnessed. the lights kept flying straight right over our condo and then we lost sight of the orbs of light.
