evening.  my 22 year old daughter screamed, \"dad, look\".  to the northwest, between the trees in our back yard, there was an orange light that was moving toward the east.  it was bright, not star-like, but like an orange roman candle ball, larger than the landing lights we frequently see on approaching aircraft.  it was moving slowly, on the horizontal, and disappeared behind the trees.  a few minutes later, maybe 5 minutes, a second 'orb' was seen, also orange in color, to the south-west of our position, about 30 degrees above the horizon.  it faded out (or entered clouds) quickly.  we talked about it for some time, trying to debunk what we saw as possibly being chinese lanterns or something.  they were located in completely different areas of the sky, and if they were, they were not launched from the same location, as they were clearly at least 2 or more miles apart, and there was no surface wind.  as we were debating what we were seeing, the third one appeared, to the left of where the first one was seen.  it was above the trees, looked to be either rising in the sky, or approaching straight toward us.  it also was orange-red in color, and increased in brightness (like it was coming out of the clouds) and brightened to a yellow or yellow-orange color.  it moved 'up' in the sky, maybe to 45 degrees above the horizon and stopped.  there appeared to be a small orange light that fell from the bottom of it, and it then proceeded to turn to the east, almost a 90 degree turn, and continued in an easterly direction, past as many as three trees, before either fading out or re-entering the clouds.  we attempted to video, but couldn't capture it before it faded out.  we waited excitedly for maybe another 30 minutes to see if it would return...But didn't see it after we got a film camera out, too.  thanks.  jc.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path

the super moon, which had just risen within a few minutes earlier (maybe 15).  \r\n\r\ni saw the object first, which appeared as a glowing white light, much like a typical airplane, but larger, and moving far faster than any plane i've ever seen.  there was no noise.  i alerted the other to the object, as soon as the realization hit me that this was not a plane.  the speed of the object, rather than the brightness, was more unusual.\r\n\r\nthe other three people with me jumped up, and ran down the front steps, upon which the lead person, female, named ann, saw the object arc slightly over the roof-line, whereupon it split into two lights.\r\n\r\ni observed the tail-end of the object disappearing over the roof-line, and just before it did, i too observed the object diverge into two orbs of equal size, with one arcing north and dissipating into darkness, while the last continued on the same trajectory until out of sight on account of the roof.\r\n\r\nwe discussed at length, and google'd common sightings, and the best we found were drones or space junk that commonly divides into two pieces.\r\n\r\nmore info: we can commonly view planes over the same treeline/horizon, and this was moving far too fast to be one.  also visible at the same time was the moon, obviously stationary.  the orb/light was so fast that each viewer remarked upon the speed.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
