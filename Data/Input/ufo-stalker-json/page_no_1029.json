 the whole viewing was about 20 minutes.  i estimate that the ship was less than a mile away and about 15 foot long.  i assume that it was a typical flying saucer with 2-3 operators.  i'm sure that there were people on board, not like those orange orbs i saw which i think are drones.  by the way i'm sure by now the pilots of these ships know me and are also curious about me.  i'm sure they've got my number.  i believe this is the same ship and pilot that displayed the pulses of light that i observed on june 28, 2014.  we got a game going.  wait until they see my 635-638nm red-orange 500mw laser!

shop and was leaving the industrial park approaching a red light when he notices what he said looked like a ball of fire.\r\n\r\nbefore i continue with his description, i would first like to say that he is a very reserved, logical and practical man. he is very familiar with aircrafts and aviation through his hobbies. he has little to no time for interest in things outside of normal reality like this. and thus, when he called me, was hesitant to describe this until i think i broke the ice with the word \"ufo\" and then i heard that comfort in his voice as if it was assuring him i would not think him crazy for what he was about to tell me.\r\n\r\nso he's approaching the red light when he notices this fireball in the sky. at first he thought it was a star by initial glance but immediately realized it was moving at an incredible rate when it then slowed down very quickly to a point of \"almost\" hovering (i believe he really wanted to say it stopped and hovered but wanted to hold some level of reservation even in his awe). this is when he noticed that it had what he called a \"sparkler effect\" almost as if the same look as sparklers you see people waving on the 4th of july and such, coming from what he assumed was the back end based on its direction.\r\n\r\nhe had with him a good digital camera and snapped this photo. the bright light on the left is a street light - the small cigar shaped orange object in the center is the ufo. he says he pulled over and got the camera rather quickly, however, he is not very familiar with the hardware and originally intended on taking video footage, but in haste and fear of losing a shot entirely, took this photo as is without zooming or anything.\r\n\r\nso he pulled the car over and took this photo. he says he believes in the time that he grabbed the camera it began moving in a new direction again and thinks it looks cylindrical like that because it was in motion. right after taking the photo, he looked down at the camera to make sure a picture had actually taken and when he looked back up a second later it was gone. he doesn't know if it disappeared or flew away, but it happened so fast that that aspect alone amazed him as much as the sighting in the first place.\r\n\r\njudging by the picture, its saturation level is very bizarre - and it almost looks more like an illuminated object with a hard surface of little reflectivity rather than a light object or a highly reflective surface. he described it as spherical and a light source like fire. very odd in comparison to the photo. could this be a morphing ufo? i would assume that the streaking of an object in motion would have a faded tail, but i can't tell which direction it's going or if it even is moving.\r\n\r\nit's a perplexing photo to me really, and i'm sure it's 100% legit. just taking a photo and getting it to me in an email is the extent of his technological capabilities concerning tampering with a photo, not to mention his trustworthiness.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:01","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

drawing. i attached a better sketch to this posting.\r\n\r\n\r\nin the summer of 1974, i saw a pair of triangular objects while stargazing with binoculars. at the time, i assumed that they must have been aircraft. but it's been a long time since then, and i haven't ever seen any airplanes, or whatever, that even remotely resemble the objects i saw. i have just recently gained access to the web, and being amused by ufo stories, i found my way to a couple of the ufo pages. while browsing at rutgers, i ran across some reports of \"triangular ufo's\", which made my hair stand on end. up to that time, i had not heard of \"triangular\" ufo's. here's what i saw in late august, 1974 while i was in the back yard of my house in campbell, ca (south sf bay area). \r\n\r\ni was laying on the ground, looking through a pair of 20 power binoculars. my feet were pointed east, and the binoculars were pointed slightly to the right of straight up, at about the one o'clock position. something went through my field of vision, moving right to left. i caught up to it quickly, and saw two objects flying in close formation, one behind and to the right of the one in front.They were both the same size, shaped like equilateral triangles with straight edges, flying point forward. their color appeared to be flat slate grey, against a deep black sky. there were no features, and i saw no lights, or glow of any kind. they appeared to be illuminated by the city lights. it looked something like this: \r\n\r\n(original ascii drawing removed. please see enclosed drawing. it depicts the two ufos travelling due north, which is towards the left edge of the drawing. the stars in the background appears as streaks because i was panning the binoculars to the left) \r\n\r\nthere was something very peculiar about the way they looked as they flew. the craft in front appeared more steady than the trailing one, and the distance between them fluctuated randomly, varying from nearly touching, to a maximum of a triangle length. when the rear one began to lag, it would suddenly snap back to a comfortable distance from the front one. my impression was that it looked as though they were being manually controlled by pilots, and as if they had very high power to weight ratio, and like they were somewhat hard to control. i watched them for about 8 to 12 seconds. during that time, they maintained a due north heading, and covered about 80 to 90 degrees of azimuth. after i lost sight of them, i waited for several minutes for any sound. i heard nothing. the binoculars were 20x50, with a field of view of 157 feet at 1000 yards. if you assume that the objects were about 100 feet long, and took up about 1/3 of the field of view, then their altitude would be 2000 yards, or 6000 feet, and their speed would be 568 mph. that seems pretty conventional, but i think i would have heard jets at that altitude. furthermore, what jets have a perfect equilateral silhouette? the closest thing i can think of (that would be flying in 1974), is the b58 hustler. but my view was clear enough, that i could have seen the little bit of fuselage in the front and back of the delta wing. i probably blew the simple geometry i used for the altitude and speed calculations, but i've given enough facts that one could calculate height and speed for any craft of a given size.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet

amateur astronomist, so i regularly look up into the sky to see what planets and constellations i can see. we ate at pizza buona on sunset and were walking on sunset blvd heading east, back to our house when  on the corner of sunset and park i looked up at the almost full moon and noticed a red pulsating light in the sky. i told my boyfriend, he looked, we speculated, hmmm looks like the color of mars but i said it's oval or star shaped like saturn yet it's the size of jupiter. the light we saw was just left of the moon, and we were walking east, the moon was to the southeast of us so the ufo was southeast of us as well but just north of the moon. i have a sky viewer app so i pulled out my phone to see what planet it was���.Here's where it got weird: we both noticed the \"planet\" was moving slowly, i personally couldn't say it was moving quickly or in any particular direction but there appeared to be motion. it got smaller, like the star shape went away, it went from being oval/star shaped and pulsating to being really small, still red still pulsating and then it was just gone. by then i had gotten my phone out, opened sky viewer and it didn't show that there were any stars, planets, or satellites anywhere near the red light. i did notice, however, that there were 2 distinct contrails in a v formation north and south of the moon and the unidentified object, they literally looked like a right side up v on either side of the moon and where the light was. i have zero idea if this part means anything, but as a scientist, particularly a biologist, i understand detailed observations, are critical. i didn't at any time see a plane or a helicopter, just the contrails but shortly thereafter i did see a plane and a helicopter but not as high up or in the same place. which is not unusual, there's a few airports kind of nearby and a our neighborhood is on a helicopter route. it bears emphasizing that i know what a plane looks like in flight, and a helicopter, in the day, at night, when it's cloudy, dark, bright, low, high up, ect. and this was not a plane or a helicopter. for sure. it was up high, equal to wherever the moon was in los angeles at about 11:30-ish on july 11th. i honestly thought it was a planet for 90% of the time it was visible, from the size, the color, the pulsation, the angle, then it suddenly moved and or shrank either in a quick succession or simultaneously. i was shocked, but my boyfriend agreed that it happened pretty much exactly as i've stated. sorry i don't have any additional info or details, it was a weird occurrence and i'd love a rational explanation.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:01:45","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path then

the lights (green and red) blinked in sequence in a linear movement suggesting to me it was a circular shaped object. it made no sound and moved in fast, and slow patterns in no particular direction

moon, also perfectly placed to balance out our tides and life on the planet. so many questions i feel i have to search for now more than ever.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

the apes inb friendswood, tx and pulled into my subdivision autumn creek. i then just happened to notice a perfect triangle above and actually only could make out 3 perfectly rounded whitish yellowish but one exact color lights in the 3 perfectly bottom part of the 3 sided aircraft from three bottom lights, that were in a triangle. they were descending towards the street. i then stopped the car 4 ft from driveway and jumped out to make sure i was really seeing a triangle object or 3 bottom triangle lights descending from what seemed like the pitch black at night around 12:45am-1:15ish am 7-11-2014. as i jumped out the car and realized this was not a ordinary aircraft with jet engines because there was no noise what so ever. i then got a little worried and jumped back in the car, turned the car in to half way into the driveway and that is when i could see a rapid, smooth, silenced, 3 sided triangle almost a perfectly 3 sided triangle but a little wider with 3 lights in each corner of triangle craft and it seemed to be 15 secs from seeing it high in the sky to a decent down towards the street lights and high trees above the autumn creek neighborhood. i then  could only say this air craft is beautiful, as i was in a daze.15 secs later i jumped out of the car as triangle shaped aircraft was descending  and still could only see the 3 lights underneath, but knew this aircraft was coming down. i then jumped out the car in the middle of my driveway as a 3 sided triangle shaped aircraft with the 3 different lights underneath coming down at me began to get larger in width but absolutely  beautiful in exact in triangle shape. i was in such a daze cause i kept saying beautiful , this is beautiful and still trying to get my phone to go to the camera. i was absolutely astonished because it was pitch black out, street lights were out or about half and i finally have my phone in the air but as im pressing the camera icon and i could not get my screen to move on bit. as the triangle shape aircraft descended to about 100ft above tree level it was huge. i still could only see the bottom of the craft until it made a perfectly beautiful left degree turn over me and the full moon just barely shined on the side of the craft to allow me to see this very unusual stealthy black but blended great with the night. i also can say it was the size of my house, the width of the triangle can guess and say 5ft-6ft give or take . i apologize but hard to guess aerodynamics flying in air at time. this large triangle shape air craft mad a left turn over me perfectly silenced in air. i saw no jet engines for a b-2 bomber, there was no engines or noise period. that is what amazed me the most. i mean this was a piece of aircraft workmanship and i have never in my 32 year life seen anything like this so outstandingly perfect flying in the air. making small adjustments in speed in small amount of time and as it turned left it was above tree level and went perfectly above and between my two neighbors house which then i was about 15ft away but could see this black triangle shape aircraft almost seem to stop on a dime in the air, perfectly silenced, no noise, but of course a whitish yellowish but one color 3 round lights in the 3 corners of the craft and it seemed to hover for a sec or two in between my 2 neighbors houses. i still was watching this craft and as it made this small seconds hover maybe 50-100ft above. all of the sudden as fast as it came it made turn hovered and then went back to same speed it came in but away from me in the pitch black and almost seemed like lights came together or just moved faster away and got smaller but was going then. it completely blended into the night and i was standing in my driveway with phone in air but could not get camera app to open for around 15-16mis and it vanished very quickly. i walked into my house and exactly 10-15mins after triangle shape aircraft vanished there was a all black black hawk helicopter on scene , and exactly in path of were aircraft was descending  before left turn. actually the black hawk helicopter flew over me and went left of me instead. i'm not sure if there was any meaning to that for this is my first time to ever witness or write about something i saw in the air, flying, and large triangle shape aircraft. i do live in houston are where we do have nasa and we have military bases. i love and respect my country fully , but this is something i decided as a man to write about because it was the most beautiful, amazing aircraft i have ever witnessed before and i hope i one day can figure out how this craft was flying with no jet engines or any kind of engined aircraft but mainly was amazed by zero sound.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then

eye through the nearby patio door.We both jumped up and said what is that? i remarked that it looks like a ufo. we are in the descent path to philadelphia int. airport and we've seen many airliners on their approach. we are also in the path of helicopters from news bureaus, coast guard, and nearby mcguire afb. we both agreed that it wasn't anything like we had seen from our backyard before. as we ran outside i noted the time 9:12. the bright orange light that was like a sphere or orb, was the size of an aspirin and pulsated at a random clip. the brightness then began to diminish and it started to move. it was first spotted in the eastern sky at appx. 30 degrees above horizon. it moved slowly to the se as an airliner on a ne route passed between us and the object. they appeared to be about the same height of which i would estimate at less than 5,000 feet and the airliner was about a mile or less away. i remember thinking at the time that the sphere/orb should be visible to the passing airliner. the pulsating light then became very dim and stopped for about two seconds before reversing direction. it then brightened slightly and followed a straight line course towards where it was first spotted. about halfway to that spot the pulsating orange light just blinked off. it did not fade out but was like turning off a light. i checked the time and it was 9:16. i was glad my wife had this sighting of her first ufo. i have had multiple sightings in my life going back to 1965 and being an enthusiast since then i've been unable to share an actual sighting with her until now. i should add that due to hurricane arthur passing by earlier a high front coming down from canada caused very clear skies with a strong wind out of the nw. all local fireworks were postponed on this day, the 4th of july.

southwest sky from back patio about 9:45pm. we were sitting on back patio talking when fiance spotted the 2 orbs. i immediately knew that this was some type of ufo as we live by 2 airports and a major police agency, we see all sizes of planes and helicopters at all times of the day and night. these orbs were like nothing i have ever seen before.  they appeared out of the sky bright and clearly visible to the naked eye. the orbs hovered and changed direction frequently, one would hover above the other or move the side of the other. twice the orbs became 1 orb and then split back into 2 orbs. the sighting lasted about 20 minutes. 1 orb then got smaller until disentigrating into the sky (almost looked like traveling higher into the atmosphere and at a fast speed) until no light could be seen. the remaining orb continued to travel in an easternly direction until also disentigrating, then moving fast higher into the atmosphere until it could no longer be seen. no sound, this area is surrounded by 2 airports (chino and ontario) and near a freeway, with a lot of helicopter activity due to major police agency near by. there was no sound, my fiance and i along with my nephew were mesmerized, we could not even run into the house to get our phones to record or take a picture. there was an airplane traveling west that had to have also seen the orbs, it should have also come up on the 2 airports airspace radars.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

vague. i'm writing this, cause i hope you to help me understand what happened, maybe you already received others reports like this one, maybe you know some explanation, but, in any case, please, let me know.\r\ni don't remember exactly the year, month and date of the event, all that i know is it happens between 1990, 1991, in a wednesday. i know it was a wednesday, because i was coming back from the church that i used to attend the mass at wednesdays. i was between fifteen and sixteen years old, and  was with my boyfriend of nineteen years old. it was a quarter to ten pm, i remember the exact time, because i had to be home by ten o'clock, at the risk of being punished by my parents. so, disregard the month i pointed in form, because i don't remember...\r\nit was time to back home and me and my boyfriend start the way back. i use to live in a street named prudente de moraes, and we where at the perp��tuo socorro church, so we started down the street s��o lucas, toward adhemar de barros and when we where crossing the street silviano barbosa, the most amazing thing happened.\r\nit's difficult to explain, so let me give an example that is more familiar: the old photo labs had a dark room, usually illuminated by a red lamp. within this environment, everything is in shades of black and red, right?\r\nwell, we were crossing the street silviano, and when we were exactly in the middle of this street, everything turned to black and red, as if we were entered in a photo lab's dark room! \r\nin the form you ask about the lights emission, well i can't say that was a light emission. in that moment, that lasted half a second (the time it takes for blinking my eyes three or four times) i thought i'd been hit by a car, and the shades of black and red that i was seeing, would be blood in my eyes.\r\ni mean, the shades of black and red seemed to come from within, as if somethin had affected my vision.\r\nsuddenly everything went back to normal. me and my boyfriend were still there, in the middle of the street, in a kind of a shock. i look at him and asked: did you see that? about the same time he asked me back if i had seen it too.\r\nwhat we saw?\r\nhe told me he had seen it all turns red. just like me. \r\nwhat could have been? \r\ni remember looking for street lamps, they usually shone. i remember we considered the possibility of a lightning, but there was no thunder, there was no physical sensation, beyond the disturbance of vision. we look to the sky, but he seemed dark, starless, overshadowed by the light of the street lamps. we saw nothing else. there was no explosion of any kind, no electricity transformer was burnt, there was nobody else on that street besides us. nothing that could explain what affected our vision.\r\nsince then i have been trying to find an explanation for this event. i've talked to physicists and meteorologists, they could not explain what happened. i thought it could be an atmospheric phenomenon known as \"sprite\", but i was told that it only occurs at high altitudes in the atmosphere. s��o jo��o da boa vista is about 700 meters form sea level, not high enough for sprite phenomena.\r\nwell, that's all! i hope you have heard about something like that before, because i can't believe it only happened with me and my boyfriend at that time. please send me a feed back if you ever heard about something like this before, or even better, if you have any explanation. i don't know if this is related to ufo's, could it be? \r\nthank you for your attention, and sorry about my poor english.\r\nhopefully\r\ncristiane
