later i was in the same location with my father working on my car and he spotted another orb, but this one was red he called me over to see it. as we watched it hovering for about 30 seconds, it made a violent turn to the east slightly descending. at that exact moment it either turned into a green orb or it split into 2 orbs red & green. hard to tell, happened very quick. then a few moments later, a loud \"boom\" like a cannon.. made us jump and continued throughout the night every 15 minutes or so. no media coverage of these loud \"booms\" and they shook the ground we stood on. however not as bad as a sonic boom. a little more subtle.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other, Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

can't adequately describe the color except that it was soft, enormously beautiful & my perception was it was emanating from above my house. at that point i never saw anything except the blue light.  i got up and walked to the window in an attempt to see what was causing the light.  as i stood there looking,  about 500 feet away an orange orb suddenly  appeared.  it was small about 6 to 10  feet in diameter.  i thought an \"telephone\"  pole  electricity transformer had exploded.  the orb  was hovering (not moving).  in a few seconds it began to very slowly rise from  approximately 30 feet to 50 feet.  after a few seconds, the orb began to elongate and travel from where it was toward  my house.  it was approximately a  4 to  6 foot  wide \"river\" of smooth orange plasma about a 18 inches thick with rounded edges. it traveled from it's elevation down toward ground level and my house.   my perception and best description is it flowed more than being projected toward me.  it flowed at a measured pace i estimate to have been about 20 miles an hour  but not like a flash.  i was not fearful only curious and puzzled.  as i continued to watch, the leading edge of the plasma flow reached the edge of the blue light and both the orb and the light vanished in an instant.  there was no flash or explosion.  they just vanished as inexplicably as they appeared.    i was  shocked, dumbfounded and enormously astonished.  i went to wake  my wife who had a cold and was sleeping in a bedroom across the hall.  she was up and drowsy asking me what were \"all the lights\".  \r\n\r\ni have been curious about  this and a couple of other very odd events that occurred over the next 30 days or so.  i've only told members of my family because i didn't want to be thought of as a kook of some sort.  although i believe there must be  a logical answer to this event i cannot explain what it was  i witnessed.  there are large electric transmission towers within a half mile.  although they are not located in the direction of the light or the orb my best guess this event had something to do with those towers and  the electricity they carry.\r\n\r\ni'ver never had anything like this occur since 1991.  it's helpful to finally write it down.  this occurred  in a residential area east of seattle.  it would be very interesting to know  if there was  any other odd experiences recorded in this area in october of 1991.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

there were no clouds and the stars were clearly visible. i noticed a strange noise on the other side of our fence. we have a lot of birds and squirrels, and i assume thatâ€™s all i heard. a moment or so after, one street over, a neighborâ€™s car alarm began ringing. \r\nnow i normally stargaze at night when i go out for a cigarette. i like to spot shooting stars, nighttime planes, and the occasional satellite passing by. i just got my contact lens prescription updated, hence why i can clearly pic out a satellite passing through the stars at night. but back to the car alarm.\r\ni hear the alarm go off. some neighborhood dogs start barking. i think nothing of it until i look up to the sky a few moments later. i look up to see a shooting star, but it wasnâ€™t like the shooting stars iâ€™ve seen in the past. it appeared much brighter than all the stars in the sky. it was traveling north/northwest. normally, the shooting stars iâ€™ve seen always travel fast enough to leave a streak of light in their path.. this one seemed to travel much slower than others. it left no trail of light. it passed over and disappeared within 2-3 seconds. \r\nshooting stars iâ€™ve seen previously leave me with an happy appreciation. this one left me wondering what exactly i just saw. i thought maybe it could have been a shooting star, a bird flying overhead highlighted by our streetlights, etc. \r\nafter i finished my cigarette, i walked inside to find my family sturring over some strange knocking in the house. the family dog had been barking at the empty hallway, and they seemed mildly excited over the experience. i let them finish telling their story before i mentioned what i had seen outside so as not to influence their storyline. after we all exchanged our stories, we went back to enjoying the rest of our evening. \r\ni like to think ai have anpractical way at viewing the world around me. that being said; i do find myself interested in the unknown world/universe around us all. these could all have very well been independent, ordinary events happening in a small frame of time. however, the coincidence of them all happening so close together cannot leave me with some speculation. \r\nalso, i failed to mention shortly after, i did notice two planes blinking inthe distance. we normally have a good number of planes in the airspace around my house at any given time, so i highly doubt there is any relation.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:03","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
