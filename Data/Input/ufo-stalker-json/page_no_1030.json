(going up and down left and right). as i focused in with my binoculors i could tell right away what it was. there first thing i noticed every now and then on it was it had what appeared to be a set up lights on what appeared to be fins on the craft. as i observed it spin it appeared to be shape shifting and spinning its mass as it was moving with some lights visible. once i saw that i started to get excited and look for any other person in the area to point out what i was seeing. i kept an eye on it as i was moving, i found to construction workers talking in their trucks and walked up and pointed to what i was looking at. they thought it was a balloon but with my binoculors i could see what it really was.. as all this was going on it was drifting south east and gaining altitude. i did get a view of the craft when it was not shape shifting and it was diamond/teardrop in shape and had an organic appearance with fins in the middle with low light lights on it. the surface had a vein like appearance of something like a vegetable with black and dark red in a striped like organic way. i may have seen a windscreen but it was too far too tell. after seeing that i ran back to my apartment to get my camera and try and get a view shots through my binoculors but by the time i came back out it had already been lost in to the clouds. i have a broad knowledge of all kinds of aircraft and balloons and can say this was not like anything i have every seen in my entire life and has changed my perception about life as i know it. i have attached a sketch and a video of the area of its flight. sadly i could not get any hard evidence of it.

three (3) years.  i started documenting the vehicles that were stoking me, taking photographs and recording tag numbers.  when i looked at the photographs i noticed that the driver's were not human - they had heads, but their necks were either tubes or metal boxes and there was no steering wheel.  i also noticed that there were drone and/or ufo's in the photographs - that seemed to be connected to the vehicles - they never separated.  i started taking more photographs - which makes them very angry and the terrorism kept escalating.  i took pictures of et's that were landing in my trees and on my neighbor's roofs.  when i tried to look at them - i couldn't see anything - because they have special lights that distort the photographs, so i tricked them and started taking pictures when they least expected me to and was able to get some photographs of them - that you can actually see who they are.  they have air craft that i have never seen and land in the trees, on roof tops and hoover in the ski above my residence 24.7.  i woke up one night and i could see someone standing above my head, dressed in black, with black gloves and suddenly the glove came down over my face and that's all i remember.  when i woke-up in the morning i was soaking wet, could barely move and my hair was in knots - all tangled up like a rats nest - at the back of my neck - it has some type of substance in it and was pretty nearly impossible to brush out - i had to cut some of it out, to get the paste stuff out of it.  that has happened to me a few times and i have bruises on my arms, knees and ankles.  i also have an v shaped scar on the top of my head and the only reason i noticed it was because it was hurting and i keep having headaches.  when i touched the spot of my head (the left side of my crown) it was wet and when i went to wash my hands - they were all red - because my head was bleeding and i didn't even notice until i saw my hands.\r\ni need help - i am in dire straights and exhausted.  i have been running from these extraterrestrial beings, from coast to coast, no body believes me - that's debilitating and traumatizing in itself - let alone having these things all over

else was around so we had decided to go back home. it was midnight and summer. i was driving. i didn't see it. she saw it first and said \"did you see that?\" i said \"no.\" so i made a u-turn and when i turned the car back in the opposite direction i saw it. we were less than 1/4th mile from it. it was up in the air, hovering above the tree tops. we had previously passed the turn off to get close to it, so turned  and drove down a dirt road toward it, drove into a recently mowed pasture and stopped the car facing the ufo, and both of us got out and stood by the car, looking up at it, which was between 200-300 ft. away. neither one of us said anything. the object was very close and made no sound. it had a glowing aura around it. it was the shape of an upright cigar only much thicker around (like a rocket). guessing it might have been 100 feet across the front. it looked to have a wide 'belt' of multiple colors in yellow,red,orange, blue. it reminded me of an oriental pagoda because the top had appendages, four of which i could see. i would guess it was at least 30 stories high. i felt no fear and i was looking at it very hard to see as much as i could. neither one of us said anything. i'm sure we must have been standing there at least 10 minutes observing it. then all of a sudden, just like someone flicked a light switch, it disappeared. it was dark, quiet and we both got in the car, not saying a word. i drove us home. she stayed at my house that night. the next morning the incident was on my mind because i wanted to talk about it but neither one of us said anything about it. fast forward 2-3 yrs. later i brought the subject of that night up and she said it never happened. i said she was the one that saw it first and she was so upset she left. about 20 yrs. later i was at her family holiday dinner with all the family visiting with each other in the kitchen. she was slicing vegetables at the counter when all of a sudden she turned around and said to me, in front of everyone, \"do you remember when we saw that ufo?\" i was stunned. she went into a lively dialogue to everyone. i acknowledged what she said but i didn't really add to the conversation. everyone seemed to find it amusing and that was the end of that and it was never mentioned again. that was over 15 yrs. ago.","distance":"101-500
