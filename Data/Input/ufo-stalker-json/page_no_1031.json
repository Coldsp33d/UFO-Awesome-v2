color and flying in series of 2 or 3 ufos with 3 or 4 separate series. the entire event during 10/12 mn.\r\n\r\ni watched the sky and the stars in the western direction from the balcony of my apartment when i saw the first orange light in the sky disappear (there was no moon in the sky that day and sky was clear but with a bit of moisture in the air). this light has appeared strange to me because it was not blinking, it had a yellow-orange color and there was no noise given the speed at which it was moving. this caught my attention. the light disappeared up in the air and speeding.\r\ni then scanned with a great attention the popular night sky in search of other ufos. about 30 seconds later i saw 3 small orange dots appear that came from very far on my right (north) hovering about 8-10 miles away and between 500 m and 900 m in height. they came from the direction of north hovering almost vertically over \"la defense\" then these points of light grew larger and became brilliant light orange color, quite similar to those i had seen previously, when it came over the \"suresnes\" city. the orange lights are then directed to st. cloud city and then to the park of st. cloud and the forest of versailles. they went into the southbound then they accelerated soaring into the sky (40 ��) to the southwest (above the parc de st-cloud). 3 lights flying together in formation and at the same speed. i have observed that these lights were not connected by the same structure, they are completely independent of each other. speed &#8203;&#8203;constant at first but seemed much faster than a plane or a helicopter (approximately 3 times the speed) and their speed is accelerated (between 6 and 8 times the normal speed of a plane before disappearing quickly) what makes me say that these are ufos. the training was then separated and the ufo took slightly different directions from each other by speeding up and disappeared in 2/3 seconds in the atmosphere.\r\nafter the passage of the first ufo, then i woke up my wife to be also witnessed the event.\r\nthree other sets of 2/3 ufo were then reproduced with a similar scenario.\r\ni detected no noise, no breath, no reaction. no flickering, flashing lights, trail of condensation of water vapor (contrail) or otherwise.","distance":"Over One

lady can speak a marselian language that is the language that she claming speaking in mars,and as they shown the letter i was terriffied as the letter or words resembles to the message which i have gotten 9-10years before.One day i was sleeping and as i got up i have seen a message which 9i cant underdstand what it was written and i was more shocked when i have seen the date it was from 2027,i thought may be the setting in my phone was incorrect i have send message to that mobile from my alternate number but when i received that message it was showing correctly and the date was also correct and i have tried to forward the message which i was gotten to other number but as i forward the message,the other mobile to which i fwd the message was showing blank,so that means i cant resend that message,i thought may be it was some error ,until yesterday when i shown that marselian language it was exactly same as which i gotten a 10years before from 2027 i dont remember the date and month as i was just 12-13 years at that time and after sometime my brother deleted that message he was too young that he have not noticied the date on it,and after some years i have started to got the

say something to me,i one insident i have seen that one man or may be someother thing actually face was not visible it was full black and height of around 5.4 ft,he was shooting a bullet at me as bullet was approching my head i suddenly wake up or able to move myself as i was not sleeping my brain was sleeping and my mind was wake,these thing continue to happen to me for 3-5 years,now it was not happening to me,but as iseen the episodes yesterday i thoght i too had somewhat similar to it,in that too man had been seeing a nightmare in which he sleeps but his mind is awake.\r\n  i dont know

of tomatoes looking across another 12 miles of oak and crops or dry scrub toward the slightly hazy mountains on the west of the big, central valley. so, i was looking due west and just slightly north of the canyon entry to lake berryessa. it was clear and sunny outside. looking due west at about 1500-3000 feet and 1 1/2 to 3 miles from me i saw a large, brightly reflected metal face, seemingly wedge-shaped in stationary, possibly hovering mode (not making sound), which, after about 1 second, disappeared. then it appeared again, this time in more or less the same place. it was clearly a large, roughly 35-60 foot metal canopy and it shifted position so suddenly that it could not be a normal curved aerodynamic maneuver. after another 2 or three seconds, it appeared again, this time with crisp, clean definition. it was a smoothly domed, shiny metallic saucer that had a dark metallic (blackish or dark bluish) apron around its lower rim. i noticed a kind of fast, very elastic distortion of the air and light at the edges of the disk, a field effect as it hovered with a slightly wobbly center of gravity. after 2-3 seconds in plain view, it suddenly folded into a kind of space and, after a couple of seconds, appeared about 2-4 kilometers to the southeast and farther away. then, after a few seconds, it appeared about a kilometer closer (still to my west-southwest) it hovered, again making no sounds, then began to shift position, then appeared to possibly be joined by another. i essentially felt a communication asking me if i would want it shot down, which i certainly didn���t. but then i pulled back to a merely observational, studious mind-frame. unlike some people, i don���t welcome incursions by what appear to be so-called ���gray���-related aliens. instead, i am on highly active, expanded watch for if and when such cases arise. as a citizen, i don���t want aliens to enter and operate at will in our atmosphere.\r\n\r\n i followed the disk as it began to move in a northwesterly direction, moving at about half a mile to a mile per second, following the line of the mountains as they grow gradually taller ��� out along the range, looking north-northwest along the big valley���s western rim. the disk hover flew, causing a kind of flickering of its outlines as it moved. in order to see where it went, i followed north along a dirt road for 80 yards in order to not lose sight of it. then it was joined by first one, then two and then, finally, four other domed objects, each featuring a kind of oscillatory, linear creasing of (gravitic) space just beneath them. they hovered, clearly aware of each other���s positions, then one began to swoop down toward the ground suddenly, faster than any aerodynamic form could without fatal injury, then they all faded out and were gone. \r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then

sky watching.\r\nmoving southeast to northeast in a straight line i was surprised to see what appeared to be a red rectangular shaped object with a bright white light in the middle (diffused light-didn't have specific edges).  the shape was something like a parachute a sport skydiver might use, except this rectangular object was moving lengthwise and steadily straight-line.  i know it wasn't a helicopter (saw & heard the police chopper flying earlier before & after the fireworks show), it didn't look like a plane and i never heard any sounds.  i moved to the front yard to keep it in view and saw my neighbor (retired military, worked on helicopters) so i called him over to look at it.  he was as surprised and puzzled as i was as he didn't hear anything and saw the same

plainly see within the three lights that it was a solid object we tried to see it on my camera phone but it didnt show up on it. after the smaller ejected lights wefe gone. about two minutes later these latger lights went out one at a time. i really dont care who believes us, i always remained sceptical about this stuff, and now my son and myself look up always, i wonder why, how, and  why, but mostly how many are there and how much larger they can get. the size was very disturbing. ive lost many friends since by telling them, but if they were true friends they should have believed me. please help us better understand this event, mostly what those smaller objects were if they wernt ships then what were they? please keep me unamous to everyone. we know what we saw was real there isnt anything here we saw that had a second possibilty, it was massive.Thank you and please email us back on more ideas of exactly what this was. it was n nw from us.From my cjrrent
