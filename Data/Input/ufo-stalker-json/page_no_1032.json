moon because the moon was almost directly over my house. i went outside and noticed it was moving from 280 degrees from my position toward 100 degrees from my position or from wnw to ese, approximately. there were four of them equally spaced and seemed to rise out of the western horizon and travelling almost over my head at, perhaps 3,000 feet and spaced at perhaps a mile apart. they made no noise and they had no blinking lights like an airplane or helicopter would have. the balls were completely bright orange in color. the travelled in a straight line with no deviation whatsoever. i am somewhat hard of hearing, so they may have made some sound, however, they had no running lights which makes me think they were not private or commercial aircraft. i estimate they were traveling about 100 miles per hour or more, but without any references i have no way of knowing for sure. i plan to watch for a repeat performance during the next few nights at about the same time.\r\n\r\nmy only feeling was that they were very, very unusual and unlike anything i had ever seen. having been a student pilot and having done a lot of flying i easily classify then as ufos.\r\n\r\ni did try to see them more clearly, using binoculars but they simply made the orange balls seem to glow brighter.\r\n\r\nmy wife was asleep so i have no other witnesses. i am a

this object just sitting in the sky right below the cloud line. i started yelling at my partner look look omg omg look what is that? he couldn't see it for a minute, once he spotted it the object started moving across the sky with a strange energy globe that was pushing the clouds away from around it as it was spinning and changing shape almost.  my partner at first tried to reason it into an airplane or helicopter but as it moved across the sky even he clearly could tell that from no angle did it have wings or a propeller.  we both noticed the \"aura\" surrounding it and how it seemed to separate the clouds as it moved through them.  from a greater distance it seemed spherical but as it drew closer it seemed to be an asymmetrical oblong that was spinning.  it moved across the sky from south to north slower than a low flying airplane but much faster than a helicopter.  this settled a dispute that we had about what appeared to be three objects similar to this one escorting a large black airplane that only briefly appeared from the clouds but never exited the cloud line in the direction they were headed.  we wanted to see it better so my partner ran into the sports store and bought a pair of binoculars but while he was inside the object disappeared in the distance.  there was no doubt at this point even to my partner whom is a serious skeptic that what we had seen was not a normal human craft.  what was truly baffling to us is that it was visible in broad daylight, since we assumed that either alien or military experimental crafts would travel under the cover of night.  shortly afterwards a helicopter appeared and circled the area relentlessly for hours as if searching for something.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

june 15 around 3.11 pm.\r\n\r\n���suddenly, i captured mashak khangdaba potsak ama (ufo) in the sky,��� the farmer said. ���i fainted for a few seconds after a small round black object sped towards me.���\r\n\r\nshowing the video image of the ufo captured in his mobile phone, koiremba claimed he felt an electric shock when it came towards him. he returned home after few moments of unconsciousness.\r\n\r\nthe family took him to the nearby district hospital due to deterioration of his health, and later referred to rims hospital in imphal the following day.\r\n\r\nbut he was discharged from the hospital the same evening after receiving treatment, as there was no symptom of any illness. however, koiremba said he has not fully recovered.\r\n\r\na similar mystery shrouded

mass might have been accidentally ejected from the support system of a rocket or a space craft.\r\n\r\nthis is the startling footage of an unidentified flying object, filmed by a fish farmer in manipur. after filming for 19 seconds, the man experienced loss of consciousness.\r\n\r\naccording to his family, he was in a semi-unconscious state of over 18 hours after he sighted the ufo in his fish farm, located at ngangkha lawai, moirang near loktak lake.\r\n\r\nthe doctor's diagnosis read 'loss of consciousness, showing signs of weakness with non-responsive motor response.'\r\n\r\npuzzled
