whim, i poked my head out of my window to take a glance at the dark blue light from the soon-to-be-rising sun.  at that time, approximately 5-5:30am, i spotted something odd in the sky.  i'm a fairly intelligent and rational sort of person, so i went through the standard list of what it could be.  \r\n\r\ni live close enough to ontario international airport that i'm no stranger to aircraft of varying types, including blimps, which look rather strange at night.  i also know what a satellite usually looks like, what a shooting star looks like, what planets look like, and this only resembled, possibly, a satellite or string of satellites.\r\n\r\nin my excitement, i woke my parents, who weren't too happy to hear from me saying, \"hey, wanna see a ufo?\"  all three of us looked out the window to spy whatever it was.  my step-father immediately said he believed it to be a geosynchronous or geostationary set of 3 satellites, and they returned to bed.  while i don't want to discredit his assumption, i looked through a small set of binoculars at the lights to try and get a clearer view.  \r\n\r\nthe centermost light was the brightest, and the other two on either side seemed dimmer.  i'm not sure if it was due to something on the glasses of the binoculars, but it also seemed almost like it was refracted/reflected somewhat by the atmosphere.  though, i'm fairly certain there were, in fact, three separate lights in a line.  they also moved, very, very slowly.  so slowly so as to be almost imperceptible.  \r\n\r\nif they were geostationary or geosynchronous satellites, as my step-father suggested, it's possible they were simply moving with the rotation of the planet around their orbit somewhat, though i'm unsure if such things are able to be viewed from the ground, and i am also unsure if they appear to move at all, since doing so seems to violate the name of the orbits in question.\r\n\r\ni ultimately lost sight of the object(s) when it(they) became too hard to see from my bedroom window, and i went to bed.  i tried to find a list of satellites overhead at the time, but i'm not an astronomer, and most satellites that were overhead were listed with a lot of information i didn't understand.  no planets were overhead in that direction of which i am aware either, and i do know it was not, in fact, the iss, if that helps.\r\n\r\noverall, i wasn't scared, just curious.  i'd really, really like to know what it was that i saw.  by all technical definition, it is currently an unidentified flying object, but even if it just turns out to be some satellites in a strange orbit, i'd like to know what they are, what they do, and all that.  i hope to get some clarification soon.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

on friday evening, july 4, 2014, at around 09:15 pm, we noticed an orange-colored \"orb\" slowly approaching our location from a nearly due south direction, from a distance of several miles away. this twilight skies were generally clear, and visibility was quite extensive at this time, so one didn���t have to strain ���at all��� to see this approaching ���craft��� of unknown origin. the object, which we witnessed (and undoubtedly scores of people at this fireworks event did as well), was \"clearly not\" any distinguishable form of ���traditional��� military or commercial aircraft, large \"chinese lantern\", weather balloon, commercial hot-air balloon, star, comet, meteor, etc., nor did it have faa beacon lights, etc., as neither its physical description, motions, movement, etc. during this event were not consistent with such. in other words, i���ve personally witnessed the aforementioned examples of cosmic and aerial phenomena, and this, clearly, could not be remotely described as any one of them ��� that is, it was clearly ���none of the above���. \r\nin any event, the object in question, again, approached our general location/direction from a nearly due-south direction, and seemed to travel at a slow, apparently-steady speed, although there was a very slight, but visually-noticeable, ���wobble��� or oscillatory type motion/movement associated with its flight mechanics/path) that seemed to be present for most of its (exposed) flight duration. although i did personally witness this object ���suddenly��� appear, or make an entrance into the southern skies, when i did notice it, it was already in motion, and heading in our general direction. the object, which was a bright, \"orange-colored orb\" (clearly noticeable and larger than a typical star in the night sky), appeared to move along a somewhat steady flight path and altitude the entire time. although its flight altitude was indeterminate from the scene, one might guess that it was at least a couple of miles high, although clearly within the cruising altitude range of today's commercial aircraft.  futhermore, i didn���t sense any ���pulsing��� or ���pulsation��� associated with this craft during its flight, but then again, given the fact that i witnessed it from a distance of miles, and without the use of a telescope, binoculars, etc. on this note, i just couldn���t be sure enough to comfortably opine.\r\nafter the object slowly made its way towards our location (again, along a near due-north trajectory), for a span of about three or four minutes, it seemed to ���stop���, for a few seconds, while in mid-air, and then slowly reversed course direction (making a near 180-degree turn) and subsequently ���disappeared\" about a minute (or less) later (i.E., after course reversal) - despite the fact the sky cover at that time was ���very marginal���, and certainly not thick enough to suddenly ���veil��� or ���cloak��� this craft, after almost immediately. \r\nwith regard to any noises��� (i.E., exhaust, sonic booms, etc.) emanating from this aircraft, no discernible noise was noticed, although given its altitude and distance from our location during the entire event, this is understandable. there did not appear to be any discernible exhaust or ���contrail��� in its wake either, so as to what form of propulsion system it was using is open for debate at this time.\r\nas for the distance the object appeared to cover during this three or four-minute flight event, one would be relegated to speculation, but given its relatively slow speed (seemingly at or below mach 1, or standard commercial aircraft speed), and the fact that it was only visible for a total of approximately a three or four-minute period, one might assume that it only travelled a few dozen miles or so during the time it was visible in the sky. whatever the case, at the time the object reversed course, it still appeared to be several miles from our location. as indicated, its flight path was generally along a somewhat-northerly trajectory ��� one that appeared to be slowly approaching our direction (and the \"warm-up\" fireworks display, which had just started about fifteen minutes earlier?). \r\nalthough one person i our party tried to get a few photos of the craft, all he managed to get (after hastily-attempting to zoom in on the craft) was an orange, blurry streak. this person was caught off guard and tried to get the best photos he could, but none actually ���turned out��� that well, or provided any definition of the craft ��� clearly not enough to warrant submission for analysis. this was quite unfortunate as this person is not really a camera ���novice���. i would presume he was just so wrapped up in attempting to get a good photo that he made some ���rookie��� camera mistakes. what a shame as if he had used his video camera, then ���that��� should have yielded some salient video for review.  \r\nto reiterate, in terms of the object���s size and appearance, it appeared to be quite a bit larger than the adjacent stars in the backdrop of the night sky, and was clearly visible to anyone that would have looked in its general direction. in fact, i���m quite surprised that dozens of people didn���t start running around and pointing up at the sky, etc.,  even if they did, from my vantage point (along a tree-lined street, in a residential setting), i didn���t see much of that. but hey, given that this ���unexplained aerial phenomena��� was unexpected, and the fact that the crowd was eagerly anticipating the impending (���main���) fireworks event (which was due to begin at any moment), and simultaneously enjoying some live music, etc. the minds of this generally-rural crowd may have been generally ���distracted���, and thus left unaware of the southern skies during this (apparent) three or four minute ���flight event���, which we witnessed. although we did continue to discuss the object amongst ourselves, we didn't actually get out amongst the crowd to alert them of our discovery as again, and/or discuss it with them as again,  the crowd was then enjoying the live music (in a direction away from the aerial phenomena)  and eagerly anticipating the impending, and ���main��� fireworks display. but i digress.\r\nso, whether or not this intelligently-controlled aircraft was ���terrestrially-based��� or not, or else some ���military-based��� or ���black ops-related��� aircraft of some sort (which seems somewhat doubtful given the craft���s seemingly innocent and ���investigatory��� movements/nature towards the fireworks location), who can say? as for it being some sort of black-ops/���secret drone��� of sorts ��� well, not this thing. there was nothing clandestine about this object (other than its quick disappearance). in fact, it would seem safe to say that any drone used by whatever ���spook agency��� would clearly not construct it as large, or have it so brightly-illuminated as this ���craft���  - that would be ludicrous on the face of it.  to be sure, this object was so brightly-illuminated that everyone could clearly see it.  consequently, in regard to assigning a ���traditional��� cosmic or aircraft ���explanation��� for this object ��� such would not seem applicable here, at all.  so was it even terrestrially-based? who can really say, at this point.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

(in relation to it's view point not height.) so i looked up still trying to find it when it finally hit the sunlight in such a way it glinted and was brightened up enough. at that point i was looking up staring at this thing for a minute before deciding to go grab the binoculars in our garage. i went to get the binoculars and gave them to my father who sighted the object first and let him look at it. his description was that of a satellite or space station but wasn't completely sure, once i had gotten hold of the binoculars i took a look myself positioning in such a way on the deck that i was flat on my back being as still as possible, i came to a focus on it and noticed that it was (at first) a ball shape but i came to realize and focus more that it was a triangular shaped object with red blue and green lights, in which the red light was flickering either randomly or in a pattern (i didn't pay attention to that particular light much.), i had watched it sitting there stationary with its lights and rotating in an anti-clockwise motion for about 2 or so minutes with intrigue before i decided to get my telescope from my basement. i got up from the deck and went downstairs into my basement to look for my telescope (meanwhile my father was shooting off more fireworks.) lo and behold my telescope was packed away and i didn't have the time to get it out, so i came back outside to observe it again with my binoculars but by the time i had gotten there, the object was gone. that's the last i've seen or heard of it since, other than some family friends saw another triangular craft earlier on(within a 10 day time span from the 4th)during the night.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":57769,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.10063298278473,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07062014-0048","longitude":-88.2486928413934,"occurred":1404520200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1404714201000,"summary":"Back deck \"star\" sighting","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"61821","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2,"locationName":"Champaign, Illinois","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:137802"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Riverdale","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving with a friend on newark-pompton turnpike in riverdale towards hamburg turnpike at about 9:45 or 9:50 pm on saturday, 7/5/14. as we were approaching the traffic light at that intersection, we saw in the distance in the sky above tree top level, what looked like two orange circles. they were diagonal in distance to each other with one being upper left. as we approached the traffic light and then stopped due to it being a red light, the objects did not move, flash or anything. they stayed stationary. the distance between them also did not change. there were other stars twinkling in the sky and planes moving and they did not look like any of those and they were not the warning lights atop towers which are red. the objects were bigger and the color different than the stars and planes which is why we noticed them. from our distance, they were not chinese lanterns from july 4th fireworks. the traffic light changed so we continued on hamburg turnpike north and then decided to use a star gazer app to see if they were stars or planets or satellites which they weren't. we then turned around and went back (probably within 3 minutes) and they were gone from where we saw them and we could not see where they went.
