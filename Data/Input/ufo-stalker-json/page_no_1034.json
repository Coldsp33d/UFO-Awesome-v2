mars is not located between the earth and the moon.  we kept looking at it and wondered if it was moving or if we were.  so i said, hey i'll get my camera and will do a times exposure to see if it's moving.  still not in any big hurry, thinking it must be a helicopter, i set the camera on my tri-pod and set the camera on auto, and then set the timed shutter release so i could minimize camera shake.  we had a very slight wind which i believe made a slight movement while the camera was taking the shot.  i took a total of four shots, before we looked up and this orb went from one side of the sky to the next.  i knew at that moment i was seeing a real ufo.  my friend become very upset and walked away.  i kept watching and the other red object when it appeared like it dropped and then it took off in the same direction.  i would say it went from the south to the north and was gone in less than 5 seconds.  this all took place above the ocean so we had a very clear view of the horizon.

it might be a helicopter but as i continued to watch and it got closer it was obvious that it was not a conventional aircraft.I have an aviation background have worked on gov't avionics projects for over 25 years and am familiar with many aircraft not familiar to the general public. the object moved from my south to a position to my west at about 70 degrees elevation and hovered. the object was under the cloud ceiling and no sound could be heard. the object appeared oval with light beams projecting from the circumference of the object and had a hemispherical red lit dome like area on top with short red spikes of light projecting upward.When the object came to a hover and i got a good look at it i knew this probably was not something built here. i had to peek out my of my car window to see the object and i had it in sight about two minutes and last time i peeked out it was gone. the main reason for this report is that i saw a picture of this object published by the chilean government online and it was exactly the same except that their photo was in daylight and the reddish dome area was not visible but the light rays from the circumference are. my gut feeling is that this is a new type of craft.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Other","flightPath":"Path then
