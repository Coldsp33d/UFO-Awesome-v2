States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At approx. 10:30-11pm. while laying down relaxing, i was just looking out of my 4th floor large bay window & skylight that overlooks lake erie, i suddenly saw reddish glowing circular objects approaching from the west in pairs of two's and four's. they appeared to fly around in unison, in a geometric formation of sorts. during the twenty minutes i watched, it was as though an entire linear formation of these \"entities or flying objects\", cruised by the lake front and seemed to be flying somewhere between, as low as 1,000 feet above the lake, to as high as 3,000 feet as they departed moving northward out over the lake. i opened my window to see if i could hear an engine or any sound and there was absolute silence in the sky during the time the objects were visible. i filed a report shortly after my sighting last night which contained the basic documentation above, but upon reflection today, and following the suggestions on this site, i want to note the following additional recollections:\r\n1.) at first i tried to convince myself that what i was witnessing might just be thai balloons. but  of course, because they moved so deliberately fast and always in some sort of formation, and were able to almost instantly fly toward the horizon, i knew they were nothing i could rationalize as a known object. \r\n2.) it was nearly impossible using my iphone and ipad to capture the intensity, or the scale, or the color, the energy emitted or the trajectory of their movement. all approximately 12-14 of them flew in sequentially from the west, high over the treetops traveling very fast until they came into view above my skylight. then each one seemed to slow down and move out maybe a half mile or so over the lake and hover. they all hovered in groups of two and then another object would arrive always forming triangles. other formations were clearly geometric and involved five objects. these \"formations\" would hover within eyesight for a minute or so and then fly off over the lake in the direction of canada. i've provided photos of these formations.\r\n3.)i quickly realized that i was experiencing something remarkable due to how close and repetitive these flying objects were. i began counting them and trying really hard to photograph and video them but nothing i captured, in any way reflects their intensity--and the red-orange glow that enveloped each one. when i reviewed my photos, i found one picture of a bright green streak. that was a photo i took trying to capture one of the objects flying away like lightening toward the horizon. apparently, my photo just caught the energy the object emitted.\r\n4.) after somewhere between 20-30 minutes, the formations of flying, glowing bright reddish-orange orbs or objects simply ceased coming into view. the last formation consisted of the bright green streak i described as the only image i caught of the object hovering for minutes, then finally--instantly, speeding away. the only words i can use to describe the entire experience were, exciting, amazing and unbelievable.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path then

triangle shaped craft of some sort coming over the highway and flying a straight path about 500 feet to the ne of our position and about the same distance in elevation. it seemed to fly right over the trees heading towards the nw. it made no sound at all and had no flashing lights such as those on an aircraft. the moon was about 1/3 full and this thing was brighter than the moon by far, as it gave off an intense red/orange to yellow/orange glow! it somewhat looked like fire, but steady and contained. the craft being triangle shaped, looked exactly like a pyramid turned on its side,point towards the nw, base to the se. it flew a straight line path in my view as far as i could see heading nw. my wife had went to get my binoculars and she picked it up and watched as it flew the same general

grasp the intensity of this event unless you\r\nsee the full group of at least 100 photos i took that night.\r\napparently these same objects have been seen from texas to canada all\r\nheading from east to west.\r\ni have been photographing ufo's for nearly 20 years; almost all seen in this current day are our own black budget projects i am sorry to say;\r\nbut i must say these objects travel in such an odd manner as if they are skipping in and out of our own dimension.\r\nthey appear and then disappear as they pass toward the west.\r\nnever before have these objects gotten directly overhead as they did on this evening. these shots are the perfect circles of varying colors.\r\nas the fireworks were nearing an end. i photographed one of these craft\r\nstopping and hovering near the fireworks display as if they were enjoying the show as well.\r\nhopefully mufon will request all of my photos for analysis.\r\none photograph i took appears to show an actual physical craft.\r\ni

been videotaped by others and featured on the news. but this most recent sighting occurred around mid-june, just a few weeks ago. it was twilight, and we were driving home along the main boulevard. he spotted it first- we could see it at the end of the street leading to the beach. we drove up the street and parked to observe. the craft was sort of rectangular, but more like an upside-down pie plate, except very thick. there were a series of white/pale yellow round lights all along the mid-section from nose to tail. i don't know if the lights were on the other side, but i assume they went around the craft. it was just before the summer season began- most of the houses (oceanfront and beach block) were empty and dark. this made the night sky even more brilliant because there were no street lights, lights from homes, cars, etc. there are no shops or businesses along the beach- there is no boardwalk. just beach and homes. \r\nwe observed it for quite a while- it made a silent horizontal path, from south to north, then declined nose down at an angle near the shoreline. \r\ni wanted to get out of the car- but i had recent surgery and was walking with a cane and felt unsteady on the sand. \r\nhad i been able to, i'd have flagged them down if i could! i would have gotten on board that craft so fast! eventually my husband wanted to drive home- it was just a mile away. i don't think he wanted to risk an encounter- had they seen us watching them. the craft was close- i'd say we were about 30 feet away. \r\nthis isn't my first encounter. i was 15 when that happened- oddly- also near the beach, but a different city. a friend and i were \"chased\" by a craft that hovered at the height of the treetops on a clear night in the summer of 1964. it was shrouded by a cloud cover and the noise we heard was like nothing i had ever heard - to this day. like a thousand bells/gears turning at once, each having their own individual sound. we got away- we think. (my husband still thinks they got me an implanted something that programs me to make his life hell...) but i don't have any marks, scars, or missing time from that event, so i'm pretty sure we got away. we talk about it every once in a while- just to be sure we remember it correctly.

went to leave the house. my cousin, first out the door said \"look at that!\"\r\n4 of us ran out and stood on the back patio and stared in disbelief at an incredibly bright deep orange object slowly moving about the sky. \r\n\r\nwhat made this sighting so extreme enough for me to submit this report is that it was sooo obviously not a satellite. so obviously not a plane, helicopter, or firework. this thing had to have been huge as it was too far out to be a plane. it was not out of the atmosphere; not far enough out to be a vibrant satellite by any means. \r\n\r\nas we stood and watched as it hovered, i thought to myself \"it probably knows we see it and will disappear.\"\r\n\r\nwithin seconds, it moved due east a little bit. stopped. slowly moved southeast, then directly east. at this point is when the big orange globe went away and turned into a much smaller, much less vibrant deep deep red. as if a single light was on in the middle or something.\r\nthe red gave way to the huge orange globe again, and then 2 seconds later the red reappeared, and then nothing. it was gone.\r\n\r\nall in a matter of 4 seconds, it turned red (the second time), it disappeared, i blinked and then i absolutely immediately realized i had an incredibly painful migraine. i felt dizzy and had some difficulty walking. it was at this time i told my friend i was sorry but had to go to bed. which i did.\r\n\r\nthere are a total of 4 witnesses. my best friend, my cousin and my uncle. it was the first ever ufo sighting for my uncle (a blue collar montana man) as well as my cousin (17). my friend and i  have been seeing a lot of strange activity in the skies over my back yard over the last couple of months. \r\nthis is was the most intense and extreme sighting either of us have ever had. which is why i immediately started filling out this report form as i went to go to bed after the sighting. although, the migraine had grown so rapidly with such intensity i was asleep before i finished typing out my name.\r\n  \r\nthe migraine may, or may not be related. the timing, however, is suspicious.\r\n\r\n5 hours prior to the sighting, a small plane had gone back and forth across the sky.. may or may not be related. honestly, most likely a private plane trekking the skies to view the fireworks from above. \r\n\r\nalso, a satellite did pass over the exact area this thing appeared approximately a half hour before the sighting. the satellite was moving due north.\r\n\r\nlast thing: what is most strange about the whole event is that we live less than 10 miles from the airport and are right alongside and directly under flight paths. there is a hospital less than a mile away with a very busy life flight. for 5 hours leading up to the sighting, except for the aforementioned small plane, and one commercial jet - absolutely zero planes passed overhead or near by. a commercial flight, most likely an allegient flight came overhead right around 9:30pm.\r\n\r\nthat was the last plane i heard or saw until the following day. normally a plane comes over the house, or over mount sentinel (due east) every half hour or so since there are direct flights to and from las vegas from the missoula airport. this lack of planes may have had to do with it being the 4th of july? fireworks and such.. i don't know. just trying to entertain all possibilities here.\r\n\r\nbest,\r\ntommy
