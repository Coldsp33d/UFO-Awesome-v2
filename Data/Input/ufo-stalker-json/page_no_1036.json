movements.  it changed directions in a strange manner, not making a turn, more like a 90 degree angle.  it hovered for a minute and then started to move slowly.  i was over excited (adrenalin rush) and started babbling and yelling for my husband to come and look.  we went out the front door and watched the circle fly away slowly, too large and low to be a plane or helicopter.  the object made no noise.  the item just slowly flew out of our visibility.  i called out to my mother in law to come downstairs so i could tell her what we just witnessed. we noticed an aircraft flying fast in the sky right after the object left, but the plane was flying in a different direction.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

watcher with those tools over 40 years. \r\n  i saw a bright object coming from close to the moon as bright as\r\nthe international space station which i watch whenever predicted but traveling at a much higher speed.  i would estimate it to be three times iss 1 speed.  it was the fastest satelite type of point of light i've ever seen as in passsed directly overhead from wsw 255 degrees and dissapeared withoud much diming ne at 80 degrees. it, if it were a normal satalite it should have dimed as it crossed the meridian which would have been at about 50 degrees in altitude from my place end time.  this only barely dimmed as the atmosphere thickened with the lower angles of it's progression.  i wasn't able to time it unfortunatly but it was sure fast.                                                                        as soon as it dissapeared into the tree line i went in the house and marked the time as i always do when seing something.  i later tracked three normal satelites. does anyone have an idea as to what the exceptionally fast light could be?  you may communicate directly with me at my gmail above please.   i don't think there is anything i havn't seen, including a black triangle 4-22-08 at 21:57, but nothing like this.  on the triangle i astoundingly found 5 other witn4esses 5 years after my solo experience.  the light of 7-4-18 i have recently discovered could be called an uap or unidenttified aerospace phenomenen, there is an organization for that. i tried without success to report the event to them. where else could i discuss this or report

city. this happened at around 10:00pm and i was just out having a smoke when i saw these and i thought to myself i need to tell someone beside's my mother who did not get to see them . i saw at first these orange object's that had a triangle shape at first and they where orange in color and then they would go in and out ( the color) . they where bright orange then they where faded to not even being there and then they would come back but they did it slow and i have never seen anything like this before it bothered me a lot and i had to tell you about it because it kept me up all night and it is today still bothering me and i just can not explain it. i saw 3 other objects in formatation flying low and making no noice at all they where heading from the west to the east i ran into the house to get my camera and to get my mother to show them to her i was only in the house for 10 to 12 seconds and when i came back out they where no where to be found and i had a very good view of the sky so i don't know where they went to. they made no sound and so that is something else that made no sence. i when bac k out to see if there where anymore to be seen and after about 35 to 40 minute's i saw another one of the shaped objects coming at me from the south i had my camera with me and as soon as i took a few  picture's it started to fade in and out and then while i was watching it it just disappeared it went no where it just was not there anymore and the funny thing is that i looked at my pictures and there was nothing on them so how is this possible ? i have seen some very weird things since i have been living here about 2 weeks ago i was out having a smoke as always i always look up to see what might be there and i normally see how many plane's pass over and on this night at about 10:30 or 11:00 pm i saw a light that just appeared out of no where it was just there a light very bright white it slowly came on and i mean it was bright white about 5 to 10 thousand feet and it slowly came on and then it slowly went out and then about 10 to 15 seconda later it came on very slowly again about looking at the sky from my point of view about 40 to 50 miles down range futher then the first time and it did the same thing . i went to take a better look at it from a better place a more clear place and it just was not there never again it just was gone and i was in the military  i built helicopters and planes mostly helicopters but i know what i am looking at and this was nothing i have ever seen before or since and it was and still is bothering me a lot and so that is why i am telling this too you because i have to let someone know what is going on around here. i see these type's of thiongs every once in awhile i am not looking for them like i told you i am out having a smoke and i look up to see how many planes are in the sky just to see how things are going in the airline industry to see if people can even afford to fly anymore and that is when i see these objects and believe me i did not believe in this stuff before but now after seeing these things i am starting to change my mind i mean what could these objects be because as far as i know we do not have things flying that can do things like these objects can do well not as far as i know anyway. i would like to know what these objects could be or are and thought you could help me out . can you? there may be other things i forgot to tell you but that is only because i was so confused up after seeing these objects that i might have forgotten somethings but this is the closest i can remember about what i saw but if i remember anything else i will let you know and if i see anymore of these objects again i will let you know that also if you need me too. i never thought that i would be telling you or anyone else about seeing these objects but it has been bothering me a lot for the last few years so i just had to say something. i started watching your show about ufo's after seeing these objects and to be honest i thought yea right but now i just don't know what to think anymore. i hope you can help me out with this and i hope i have helped mufon out by letting you know about what i saw.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional

we witnessed 2 groups of lights. the most suspicious group was ene of our location, approximately immediately south of dia. this was a group of 4. they maneuvered up/down/left/right for at least 5 minutes. they would change formation, but typically would return to a string of 3 with a 4th that would maneuver around them. from my research i discovered an excellent example of some of this maneuvering that was recorded on 5/11 and posted to youtube. this video is narrated in spanish and says that it is from denver. these objects finally winked out moving north to south.\r\nthe second group of 5 lights appeared to be over westminster. they descended and circled. they appeared to land. this group may very well have been parachutists that were reported to be performing in the area for a fireworks show. their movements could be similar to descending parachutists that were doing acrobatics. i mention this to clarify that there were 2 distinct groups of lights and to clarify the differences between the 2. \r\ni am reporting this because it is the 2nd time that i have seen these lights. last year on the 4th of july, we also saw the lights in the location of dia. these lights chased each other, moved radically in all directions, appeared to land/crash (very rapud descent) and ascend. this lasted 5 to 10 minutes, maybe more. it was long enough that we got bored watching them and went back and forth from watching them to watching the fireworks.\r\nsince both events occured on the 4th of july, i will clarify that these objects were most definitely not fireworks. we saw an incredible amount of fireworks during both events and these objects were distinctly different.\r\ni am by nature a skeptic and cynic. i was a member of the us navy attached to an air squadron. i am familiar with flight characteristics both normal and extreme that can be performed by aircraft.  these were incredible events worthy of note.\r\n","distance":"Over One

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was attending the dublin, ohio 2014 fourth of july fireworks display with my daughter and the family of her friend, including her friend's mother.  we were set up in a grassy area outside the dublin coffman high school stadium.  it was exceptional weather for july 4th--cool, very clear, with just enough breeze to move the smoke from the fireworks away.  a while after the fireworks began @10pm, perhaps 15 minutes in, i heard the friend's mother who was seated next to me say \"what is that?\"  i'm unsure whether the mother or her daughter were the first to notice the object, or really why they did, since it was a full 180-degrees opposite the fireworks we were watching, and required turning one's back to the display.  when i turned around, it was very easy to see the object.  i immediately realized it was nothing one normally sees in the sky.  the moon was at about 1/4 fullness, and was above the object in the sky.  the object (if i understand elevation correctly as 90 degrees straight overhead) was at about 45-50 degrees in the sky, beneath the moon.  a few stars were visible and relative to the object, much smaller lights. the object was not a single point of light but clearly had dimension and definition of a round to oval shape.  if you held your fingers up to the sides, it would have appeared to be about 3/8-inch across.  it was not possible to say how distant it was, but it seemed relatively close--much closer than a high-altitude jet would look, for instance.  as we continued to look at the object, it clearly was stationary--there was no movement whatsoever.  i have lived in the past under the approach path for port columbus airport, and am very familiar (say, one plane about every 25 seconds day and night) of what conventional aircraft look like when approaching from assorted angles in the sky--this was nothing like that.  i am also aware of the phenomena of an aircraft approaching you in a direct line appearing to be stationary for a time--but they do eventually move, normally look like a point of light, and the lights normally appear clear white to bluish-white.  i also used to live blocks from a police heliport and within a couple miles of two hospitals with medical transport helicopters and have seen those in flight countless times.  this was also nothing like that.  additionally, the goodyear blimp, and those of other companies, make regular visits to the area, especially during osu football season--this was no blimp.  i would also emphasize that the object was opposite the area where the fireworks display was occurring, and no sparks or other burning material from the pyrotechnics were in that area of the sky.  also, there are often small planes noticeable in the sky during fireworks shows--i know what those look like too, and this was nothing like that.  the most curious aspect to me was the color:  the object uniformly glowed an unwavering distinct pumpkin-orange--rather like a chinese lantern that is lit from within.  (my bemused mental image of the object now is a floating lit pumpkin--an uncarved jack-o-lantern.)  unlike aircraft, there were no other lights of any color, nor was there any blinking.  also, again, there was not a light on the object, rather the entire object was lighted.  i have a sense that there may have been faint darker lines in the surface, but that perception is a little vague.  those of us looking at it turned away to speak to each other a couple times, and turned back.  this was over the space of 1-2 minutes.  (it was a little distracting, since the fireworks display we'd intended to watch was going on during this and we couldn't look at both).  so, turning back and forth, after a brief time we tuned back and there was no sign of it.  it was just gone.  except for lower-hanging smoke from the fireworks, the sky was clear.  the only accounting for it disappearing would be if enough smoke had drifted up to cover it, but it didn't seem to be quite high enough to do that.  once it vanished, the mother said \"we've seen a ufo.\" and, since i can't explain what we saw, i guess we did.  we were making jokes that they'd come to see the fireworks, that we'd have grey visitors later that night, etc.  our main emotional reaction was curiosity and interest, and perhaps amusement--nothing upsetting.  the major aftermath for me is a mystified irritation, as having read and seen recorded accounts of ufos for literally decades, i am dumbfounded that i sat there with my camera in a tote at my feet, and never thought to reach down for it and attempt a photo.  what was i thinking?  i'm left shaking my head, as this was the most distinct exposure i've had to a craft i cannot explain and i cannot account for my utter lack of alertness to realize this was something i might want to try to record.  i'll be interested to know if there are other reports from the evening of similar sighting.
