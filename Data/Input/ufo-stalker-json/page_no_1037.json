the sky. looking upward to see the arial displays, i noticed a bright orange orb that didn't fall to the ground with the other fireworks. instead it became smaller and slowly travelled ne across the sky behind the trees. minutes later another fiery orange orb appeared in the same location that we had seen the first orb. this time it was slightly larger and appeared to be pulsating or almost flaming. this object moved from its orignal location on an easterly path until it was out of sight. we thought the event was over and began discussing what we had seen. it was defintely not any conventional aircraft, there were no navigation light, no beacons. 5 minutes later another object appears in the southern sky. it again was bright red orange, it slowly made its way east. before the third sighted object was out of sight another orb, same color and intensity, appeared and travelled in the same direction. this time the glowing lights turned off and you could see the objects moving through the sky. the were very pale but you could still see something moving. they eventually moved out of sight and that was the last we saw of them. i wasn't able to get pictures of the first 2 objects but had my phone when the last 1 appeared. when i took pictures my camera flash was activating and i remember thinking oh great, they know where i am, at that i see them. we felt very small

first i thought it was an errant or stray firework from down the street but i quickly realized it was nothing of the sort. it was moving slowly over the house without changing direction and it made no

about 4:00am to use the bathroom. i decided to smoke a cigarette after using the bathroom and proceeded outside to my backyard. as i���m standing in my backyard smoking my cigarette i noticed what appeared to be a single orange light hovering in the sky. i didn���t think anything of it because cleveland hopkins airport is in the direction from which the light was coming; i simply thought it was an airplane. but as the orange light slowly hovered in the direction of my house it changed into multiple lights, still orange in color but illuminating a soft white color from the center of each light. i counted twelve lights hovering along in a horizontal formation; in sync moving as one. and as for how did the formation change occur? imagine you closing your eyes to blink, just a natural blink like all humans do. but the formation change occurred faster than the blinking eye of a human being. i was visually locked in on this object to say the least.\r\n\r\n��the lights continued to move in the direction of my house and soon would be literally passing over it. i���m like wow what can these lights possibly be. as the orange lights traveled closer to my house the formation of the 12 orange lights changed to a circular formation, a ring of lights! ��again, the formation change occurred faster than the blinking eye of a human being but i wasn���t blinking. the lights didn���t make a sound of any kind, as if they weren���t there. all outside noises that a person would hear, or any sound whatsoever! period! it was mute. i could hear myself think and that was it. it was as if i and the object were the only two things on this planet. i���m freaking out at this point but at the same time i knew i was witnessing something special. nevertheless, but just as the lights moved in closer i realized the 12 orange lights are part of what appeared to be the bottom of the object. the top of this object had the appearance of a meteor rock and resembled the night sky. it looked like a floating city. ��it had an odd octagon shape, with 12 orange lights underneath it. the texture of the ufo was transparent, meaning i could see through it and see the night sky simultaneously. ��i���m looking at this thing like for real. this can���t be real! \r\n\r\nas i stare in amazement all of a sudden the ufo makes a subtle transformation and becomes more graphic in detail but it still had resemblance of the night sky. the next thing i know the ufo hovers at a stand-still right as it was moments from passing over my house. i mean it literally stopped! it was if the ufo knew i was watching and wanted me to observe. the size of this thing was at least a half mile long or longer; it was enormous. i started thinking that i got to go in the house and get my camera and take a picture of this. but i didn���t want to move and take a chance of the ufo not being in the sky when i returned. i started screaming for my wife to bring me my camera out of my office. baby! baby! bring me my camera out my office! \r\n\r\nnevertheless, due to what i was experiencing at that moment i forgot she was sleeping and its 4:00 am in the morning. so, i had to make a decision. i took a real good look at this ufo in its entirety and locked it in my memory forever, than i ran in the house to get my camera. i came back and i couldn���t believe the object was still there. i aimed my camera up towards the sky and located the ufo thru my camera viewfinder. right before i took a picture i peeked at the ufo one last time with the naked eye. i took the picture and when i took the camera away from my face the ufo was nowhere to be seen. i mean literally gone, nowhere in the sky period. how could something so enormous totally disappear out of the sky from all directions in a matter of two seconds? \r\n\r\nmy picture didn���t take properly due to partially dead batteries in my camera. i was very disappointed. during the encounter the ufo didn���t make the slightest sound whatsoever. i mean nothing! literally! all i heard was pure silence. it was like watching the tv with the mute button on. all details of event occurred in a time span of twenty minutes. the ufo i observed is somewhat like the ufo photo below; ufo photo below was retrieved from the ufo evidence website.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

hundreds of dollars on some pretty impressive fireworks. it's still going as i write this.\r\n\r\ni went outside for the second time around 10:30 tonight to video the great fireworks we have here at the beach. i was out earlier and chased back inside by mosquito's as there was virtually no wind at ground level. i saw the red orb and was disappointed i did not have the camera. i pretty much passed it off as it vanished.\r\n\r\nthe second time i went out, i was trying to gather as much fireworks action as possible and then i saw the \"orb\" again but this time i was able to get a video of it and also zoom in on it.\r\n\r\nthis is not a great video as i was moving the camera around fast until we get to the orb which occurs around the 3 minute mark. the red marks on the film are something on the camera. there are two houses in the background and one has a porch light. you can see the windows on the house to the south.  \r\n\r\nthe orb did not exhibit any distinct motions and then just

report this. i have not erased the memory card.\r\n\r\nif they can make a firework that can hover that long, i would be very surprised. it was not the uscg helicopter that flew by earlier or any

and behind us a bright, orange-colored orb traveling from north to south. it did not travel at an unusual rate of speed but it also did not display any blinking lights that a small to medium conventional aircraft would have shown at that altitude, which we estimated to be approximately 5,000 feet. if it were a large conventional aircraft, we would have heard engine noise. \r\n\r\nthe light traveled steadily for two to three minutes as we captured the image on a cell phone video.  it then seemed to head in a southeasterly direction and disappear. however, within 30 seconds it reappeared brightly at the same position it had been approximately a minute before.  this disappearance and re-appearance was repeated one more time before the object finally faded from view. \r\n\r\nthe orb did not resemble any kind of \"firework\" that i had ever seen.  it was simply too high and glowed too long.  it also did not resemble any of the many small airplanes that i have seen on many a 4th of july night cruising above fireworks displays. those craft were easily identifiable by the position of the blinking lights on the wings and tail. this orb appeared as a solid object and did not blink or pulsate, although a thin, very bright white penumbra appeared to rim the orange light. \r\n\r\nshortly before -- approximately one-half hour -- we noticed the orb, a helicopter

next to a water tower located maybe 500 feet away from us. none of us knew what it was. it appeared to be a gold or orange like color that gave a bright aura like look to it. we slowly went on until the trees were blocking our view. as we drove on home we saw at least 4 more of them but were slowly moving in that same direction. we got out of the car at home and 3 of the 4 of us stood outside and watched at least 8-10 more traveling in the same direction with a slight curve from southeast to northwest. all of which seemed to be spaced about 20 to 30 seconds apart at the same altitude. these were more of an orange or more red in color. we could see each one as it traveled through the night sky moving to slow to be a helicopter or plane and had no flashing lights. more of a pulsating light instead. now i know this is the 4th of july, but these were not fireworks or flares from a plane! i have no idea what they were or are exactly, but it still has my girlfriend a little freaked out. they made no noise and all we could hear was fireworks. no engine of any kind was heard. i saw another move from east to west just above the trees on the back side of our place and it was much lower than the others. it was a brighter and dark red aura looking disc like object. what was weird is they just seemed to disappear after they went over our entire neighborhood. but that was only after traveling i don't know how many miles. each object we could see for a good 2-3 minutes before they just vanished. but i know these were not fireworks or flares! my girlfriend did get some video of them with her cell phone, but she was very shaken and couldn't stand still. we could see a jet way off in the distance but they did not come from a jet or airplane. surely we were not the only ones to

july. after we had completed our show i went into the house for 5 minutes to attend to one of our children and when i returned my husband our 3 friends and his mother told me what i had missed in the sky while i was gone. they had viewed an oval shaped white with a slightly green tint object cross the sky at an extremely fast, yet not shooting rate of speed north west to north east at about a 55-60 degree angle at 10:45pm lasting for a 15 second duration. considering that i am a mufon field investigator my husband was very enthused that i missed the occurrence, my mother-in-law and friends were very excited after learning about my involvement with mufon and i was very agitated at my husband, because my camera was right there freaking right there in a chair beside of him. i asked them questions and continued to discuss what happened while in discussion my husband, mother-in-law, and friends continued pointing in the sky at star-like ufo's travelling at high rates of speed, flashing, one moving erratically in circles and another moving, hovering and then moving. within the course of 55 minutes i observed a total of 5 star ufo phenomena 6 were observed with the largest initial oval sighting. my husband was a flight operations specialist in the army we both worked on an airfield, however my mos was not in aviation and he stated the objects observed were way above mach 3 or any speed he has ever seen. the first two star objects were observed at 45 degrees directly north passing directly along side one another the left moving nnw to sse the second sse to nnw for a duration of 15-20 seconds. after this sighting a few minutes past 11pm there was a third star like object 65 degrees north east circling in a small penny sized pattern clockwise my friends comment \"like a mosquito\" for a duration of about 30 seconds then slowly faded. the fourth star object i observed at an estimated time of 11:20 moved slowly from sse to nnw from 90 degrees to 75 degrees and then shot just like a meteor viewed in a shower to 40 degrees nnw. the last object observed for a duration of 15 minutes between 11:30 and 11:45 was like a star moving in the north east from 75 degrees to 60 degrees and back again  flashing occasionally in an erratic pattern as if it were signaling, then staying stationary, moving slowly again from one position to another, fading out, fading back in and flashing during the time observed. i attempted to video record some of the phenomena, but the objects were too small for camera on video recording. when i took pictures a sequence of stars forming a triangle pattern appeared on camera that was not viewed by naked eye. i had problems with the operation of my camera during the 55 minutes of siting. the camera kept on displaying full memory capacity, when i did not have very many pictures stored. after i deleted some pictures and videos off of my camera i still had the \"memory too full\" display and finally i had a window where i could record video, unfortunately that did not come out, but the pictures i took did with the unusual triangle pattern. whether or not i had actually captured something in the sky or light reflection i do not know. mysteriously the pictures jumped in sequence skipping 041 and 042 as if i had never taken the photographs or deleted them off of the camera.","distance":"Over One

headed north and disappeared in the clouds. i have the videos posted on youtube and can provide the link. \r\n\r\n((i tried to upload the videos to the mufon website twice and it timed out so i will not include them)) \r\n\r\nit then came around for a second pass about ten minutes later. i recorded it again with my phone and we also had the opportunity to view it through some high-powered hunting binoculars. whilst viewing it through the binoculars you could definitely tell it was disc shaped with a very distinct circular outline. it flew in a similar pattern as the first pass, disappearing in the northern sky in the clouds. \r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

along hwy 99, and was almost at the town limits of rockvale, when out of my driver's side window i observed three orange/yellow lights at the 11o'clock position at a distance of approximately a half a mile.  the lights were arranged in an echelon pattern with the lowest of the three to the southeast.  my first thought was that they were aircraft warning beacons atop communication towers, but then i realized that they were the wrong color and too bright, and to add to it i live less than two miles from the area, and had never witnessed them there before.  i said to my wife, who was in the passenger seat, \"hey, those are new\".  she replied that they were what i had thought, tower lights, but after she spoke, we entered the town limits, and turned slightly westward, and behind the dollar general store, it then became very obvious that they were not tower lights.  the original three were now joined by at least four more behind them in what i would describe as a wedge formation.  the first three were maintaining an echelon formation.  my thoughts now moved towards military helicopters on night maneuvers, as we do see them here frequently.  their size and movement was similar to a hughes 500, but there were no flashing arial beacons visible.  i nearly ran off the road straining to see them, so i pulled off  onto the shoulder and rolled my window down to see if i could hear anything.  there was absolutely no sound.  the car behind us also saw them, as he slowed to a near stop and was looking up as he drove by.  the objects never displayed a solid form, but seemed to produce a red/orange/yellow light from within that seemed to flicker.  were it not for their speed and direction, i may have thought that they were lanterns that had been released in honor of the country's birthday.  i estimate that their speed was between 60 to 100 mph, and they turned westward to parallel the highway just to its south.  the wind was coming in from the southwest.  any illusion that these objects were being carried by the wind was further dissolved when one made a 180 degree turn to the south and disappeared.  i was not in a very safe spot on the side of the road, so i drove about a quarter mile to the entrance of the local elementary school, and we all observed them there moving to the west still, but then abruptly disappearing one by one in the same point in the sky, with the exception of the trail object that faded to near extinction, the re-emerged to its original intensity twice before finally disappearing.  i have a strong military background, and have seen virtually every type of aircraft in service today operate at night, and i have absolutely no idea what these objects were.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

stay off for about 5 seconds then another would blink off. after about 10 total seconds it would turn back on. so i ran back home to show somebody because i did not have my phone to take a picture and i knew that nobody would believe me. i saw a pedestrian and showed him. he thought that it was weird. so i started running again. i turned the corner and looked back so i looked east, it was still there. when i got home and got my girlfriend to come outside to look. it was gone. it would have been about 10 minutes that i had seen this going on. it was about 9:30 in the evening. i know what i
