outside. as i looked up i saw 3 prominent and distinct orange orb like lights. i just stood there in the parking lot looking at them. i noticed that there were 3 independent objects and that they were moving. 2 of them were already past my position but the last of the three flew/drifted right over my head.I actually thought they could be flares or something related to the 4th of july until i realized that they were flying away from me and not floating down toward the ground. i did not hear any sound like a helicopter or airplane. we live pretty close to cvg airport and i see planes all the time. i figured it was to low to be a plane and i didn't hear a helicopter.  i tried to take a picture with my cell phone but i have a poor quality phone and i couldn't make anything out in my viewfinder. i noticed they were kind of shimmering but the color did not change. kind of pulsated possibly but always stayed bright orange. was certainly not any fireworks. i put my phone away and they actually started moving faster way from me  and well. kind of zoomed off. they were just continuously moving faster until they were out of sight. i hopped into my car to try to set up my position with i-75/i-71 as my apartment complex is right next to north/south  i-75/i-71. to my best calculations it was traveling south eat coming from north west the entire time and basically all three whatever they were stayed in a pretty tight line although the were separated and kind of in a row. i was never afraid but rather excited. after i made my thoughts i realized that it had to be a ufo. not flares (they burn out and drift to the ground), not a plane (made no noise at all), not a helicopter (no noise). i don't think it could have been anything like a meteorite or comet (3 in a row and not streaking in the sky and were moving slow then speed up). maybe it was a flying rc controlled craft but i mean they were so far stretched apart and eventually traveled really quickly. i don't know. i am just trying to give my understanding and rationalize but i guess that's your guy's job. it would be great to speak to someone further on this. i jotted down some basic info so i could remember the event.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:07:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

( it's  actually about 2 degrees off according to my compass.) the fireworks were in the north to northeast east area of the sky. (it looked like they were being set off from the high school.) these odd lights originated about 5 degrees west of due north. ( from the area near the expressway.)  it was hard to see in the dark exactly what they were. i can say they were higher in the sky than the fireworks, just below the cloud line. i saw one, single light that i am positive was not a firework. it originated in the sky with no tail at all. no tracer from a lit fuse.  it traveled in a horizontal path several hundred feet above the tree line. the path was from the north in a swinging arc over the condo roofs to the west. it was followed by another about a minute later then one more maybe a minute later. three in all. (that i saw. there may have been more earlier when i was inside.) i got the binoculars out to see them better. could only see a light, no shadow of an airplane or helicopter, either of which have at least 2 if not 4 lights on them for night flight. the light was very bright and a red/orange segmented in color. they looked like large, flying light bulbs. hard to tell the exact size because i couldn't judge the distance in the dark. but at least the size of grapefruit. \r\n\r\nmy first thought was,\" ok, we know this isn't a real ufo, what is it though?\" because of the odd color of the light i thought it might be a kids science project, a homemade weather type balloon made from a small candle and a paper bag but like i said, it did not flicker and the path was steady not \"drifty\". it flew pretty high and never wavered. each subsequent light flew the same way, the same direction. airplanes and the like have multiple lights on them and i think i would have seen the shadow in the sky of the body of the airplane especially with the binoculars. maybe they were drones? i know you can buy them privately (theo's neighbor has one that buzzes the upstairs windows periodically.) but i would think they would be pretty pricey. and i saw 3 of them. that's a great deal of private money in the sky at one time. and i don't think i would put them in the air with all the yokels setting off rockets and sky cannons. i couldn't hear them make any noise but then the fireworks were going off at the same time. but even in between booms i couldn't make out a buzz or hum or rumble of any kind. \r\n\r\nso, if you have any ideas what i saw i am open to suggestions. it'll bug me all ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":57620,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.3390109,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07052014-0001","longitude":-85.4750849,"occurred":1404539400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kentucky","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1404543629000,"summary":"3 glowing red/orange lights in sky traveling on a straight, unwavering path horizontal to tree tops.","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"40014","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Crestwood, Kentucky","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:140043"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Gurnee","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Friday, july 4th 2014, around 10:10-10:15 or so.  the neighborhood was watching the fireworks, when i heard several people asking what something in the sky was.  my daughter came to me and asked me what it was, she pointed toward the moon, the object was just left of the moon, this was far more west than any of the fireworks which were directly south.  observed large greenish-blueish light hovering, witnessed by around 20 people including several neighbors from street.  everyone was pointing and asking what it was.  i said i thought it was a plane, because it had a flashing light, but the realized planes usually have a more rapid flash with two double blinks or so.  this was more like a slower pulse.  it then started moving south slowly, increasing speed.  i then said this must be a helicopter or some type of drone.  the light instantly changed direction, moving in the opposite direction, at a very, very high rate of speed.  much faster than any plane could go.  we were all in awe, and i said that is no drone or helicopter, nothing can move that fast and change direction like that.  everybody seemed shocked.  we see planes flying over our area all day, and nothing goes this fast.  as it was traveling north, only the color red could be observed and it was not flashing any more, it was only a solid red.  there was no more bluish-green color.  it quickly disappeared as it got too far away to see.  my neighbor captured a couple seconds of video on her phone.  i watched the video while in the dark driveway, and could only see a small dot on the video.  she tried to capture it as it was flying away to the north, so it did not turn out very well.  everyone was amazed at what we saw with many saying they never believed in ufo's but now have changed their minds.","distance":"501 Feet -
