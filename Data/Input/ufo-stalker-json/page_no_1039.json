milwaukee avenue in niles, illinois on the evening of thursday, 07/03/2014, at approximately 2315 hours, my eye was caught by two (2) pulsing round red lights in the sw sky, one on top of the other, which appeared to be a cell or water tower in the vicinity of maryhill cemetery. this caused me to do a complete double-take, because i know there are no such structures in that area. when one of the objects began moving slowly from west to east, and the other followed in a \"wing-man\"-type formation (slightly behind and further south than the object to the forefront), i thought, because of their basketball-like appearance and large size, that they were helicopters of the \"bubble-cockpit\" variety, flying low on the southern horizon. i parked my squad car and shut off my engine and all lights, and exited my squad car to observe the aircraft. as soon as i got out of my car, i realized that these were not helicopters, and were much farther away and larger than i originally thought. there was no helicopter sound whatsoever in the relatively quiet night air, and the presence of many airplanes in the sky (niles and park ridge are under major flight paths in and out of o'hare)provided me with an excellent contrasting point of reference to what the ufos at least \"were not.\" the objects glided eastbound, slowly and deliberately. they were basketball-sized spheres, approximately 5-times the size of the strobe lights on an airplane, with a shimmery white halo completely circling the sphere. the red light was unlike anything i have ever seen, having a pulsating, almost \"liquid\" or \"living\" appearance, and glowing, rather than piercing the night sky. the white light appeared like an aura (similar to the heat you see emanating from a rocket or jet engine). i was awestruck. when the first craft was almost directly in front of my line of sight, the spheres both suddenly \"receded\" quickly up and into the western sky (back where i first saw them, but much higher). the ufo that was offset to the rear disappeared so quickly that i barely had time to register that it was gone. the craft that was more \"in the lead\" receded up and back to the point that it looked like a red star, and then blinked out of sight. i saw that there were two adult male citizens, one african-american and one caucasian, looking up at the sky from a residential driveway across the street and south of my location. i approached them and we all verbally confirmed that what we had seen had not been fireworks or flares of any kind, but were definitely very large, unidentifiable aircraft. we were all very excited. i remember that my emotions were in a \"condition red\" or \"high alert\" status - i remained in this psychological state for many hours after the sighting. the african-american citizen kept repeating \"warp speed! they took off into space at warp speed!\" two things i would like to point out are that 1. for the 20 minutes or so prior to this sighting, i was unable to connect to the internet on both my blackberry cell phone or my in-car panasonic tough book laptop with verizon air card. five minutes after the spheres ascended out of sight, both my telephone and in-car computer came back online. 2. i did not think to take photos of the craft because the camera on my blackberry produces very poor quality photos. i've tried to take pictures of the full moon in the past, and they come out as a blurry white pin-dot of light. i am working on getting a record of any 911 calls for suspicious lights in the sky during this time period.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

a black helicopter with a bright green light came into the area where i was observing the clouds. it was quieter than the blackhawks i became accustomed to at ft. campbell, but bot nearly silent. it hovered briefly overhead, the turned to pursue a thick smooth puff of cloud as it started to suddenly rapidly ascend towards the main cloud cover. the cloud seemed to have a slight glow and as it speed off the rear fanned slightly making it look like a little flying whale. s i lost sight of them quickly behind the treeline. shortly thereafter, noticed a dim bluish pulsing light coming from the larger group of clouds. the mist settled quickly and i thought there could be craft overhead but when i stared my vision became blurry and my eyes wouldn't focus. repeated attempts to avert and clear my eyes and observe the object through the mist began to give me a strong headache. by the eerie way they moved and the abnormal consistency i assumed that something other than then nature was influencing them. however i decided to check around the back of my building as it has less lightposts and better visibility, not sure how long i sat out there, but just when i was about to give up a glowing yellowish white ball of light dropped straight out of the sky, i couldn't judge the distance properly or discern where it came from, it seemed to just materialize at high altitude and drop straight down. however a few minutes a an aircraft ascended at a steep angle from what seemed to be where the glowing ball must have fallen. this craft was possibly unrelated as we are close to an airport. had rapidly flashing red and white lights just as civilian craft, yet it was silent and moved very fast. i remained outside a short time, until my growing headache compelled me to call it a night.

lights, then thought it was a plane on fire. once i realized it was neither of them i thought it may be mars the red planet because the starlike object in the sky gave off a red hue. i was perplexed by this object so i kept watching it as i walked down the road. since i was walking i couldn't tell if it was moving so i stopped to see if it was moving. after stopping i realized it was stationary just up in the sky in the north east part of the sky at about 65 to 70�� off the horizon. there were clouds that moved quickly across the sky towards the north and you could see this red light through those clouds, it was that bright. i watched this light for about 12 minutes and when i met up with my friend i told her to look up in the sky and see this and right as she started looking up in the sky the light went away. it just disappeared, didn't move, didn't blink, didn't flash, just dissolved. it was very weird. i continued to walk around my complex for about the next hour and it was a gorgeous night with stars out everywhere and that light was nowhere to be seen in the same area of the sky, it was just gone. \r\n\r\nwhen i was a kid i had the opportunity to see two ufos. both separate incidences, one when i was about 8 and the other when i was about 11. both ufos were very different. i don't talk about it much because i think people would view me as crazy if i talked about it. my point in telling this is that i believe in ufos and i know what i saw last night was very strange. although i didn't see an object itself it was just a light in the sky, i know that what i saw was nothing man made nor could anyone explain what it was. \r\n\r\ni thought it was really strange that when another person have the opportunity to view it, such as my friend, it dissolved immediately
