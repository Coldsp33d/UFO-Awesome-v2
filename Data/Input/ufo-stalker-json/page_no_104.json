full swing and every day a huge storm system would form up and we would get a huge downpour usually from mid afternoon onwards. this day i was outside my office waiting for my other workers to finish up inside one of the buildings, i was looking roughly north west at a huge cumulonimbus cloud that had formed and was moving towards lucapa, i expected a downpour as usual within the hour. as i watched the cloud i saw a black circular object approaching the top of the cloud formation, it was moving very slowly and as i wondered what it was i tracked my vision along the line of movement to see if the object would re appear out of the cloud but it did not and i never saw it again. the interesting thing was that within 30 minutes of the object entering the storm cloud the whole cloud system had dissipated completely and we were left with a clear blue sky almost as if this object had absorbed all the energy from the storm cloud and disappeared. although i never told anyone about this sighting i have always wondered what this could have been.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

noticed the headlights of the ufo diagonally to my left. intregued i wound down the window and watched as the craft moved slowly closer. \r\nit had two round lights on the rectangular leading edge. it was black, matt and with no visible doors, windows, engines, or nuts and bolts, completely smooth. as it approached at about 15_20 mph i noticed it was completely silent. at this point alarm bells began to ring. this was no helicopter or any flying vehicle i had ever seen. it was wedge shaped flying blunt edge first. my immediate thought was \"it looks un -aerodynamic, why isn't it flying pointy end first\" my husband was concerned and continued to advance to the junction. i remained looking out of the window and as we reached the t junction so did the craft which passed diagonally above us. at this point i thought \"if anything is going to happen, it will be now\". nothing did and now i was able to see the craft from the other side which was identical to the other. at this point we were parallel with it but as we reached the end of our road in preparation for joining the main walsall road the craft flew at the same speed over the industrial units close by and disappeared into the distance.\r\non reaching my parents house we excitedly told them of our experience, they had always been interested in ufos and subscribed to flying saucer review, however they appeared sceptical but said they would contact the magazine. \r\nmy parents never spoke of the incident and there was no comeback from fsr and no reports in the media. we let the matter drop. friends thought it was funny and thought we were joking. at that point in time i thought ufos were saucer shaped, period. it wasn't until years later i realised they came in many shapes and  i still haven't
