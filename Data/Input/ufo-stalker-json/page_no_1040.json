this particular phenomenon, of a bright object moving at a usually controlled speed, soundless, following a path, or orbit,   my attention, this time however, was drawn by the fact that there were at least two different ones, with different directions, and a slight difference in behavior between the two that i became aware of. one of the objects travelled to a basically southeastern direction; the second object travelled from the southeast, then altered its direction and speed hurtling toward me- but overhead, and much faster, as i ran to my car for binoculars.Astonishingly, it stopped moving and just hung in the sky for about 20 minutes as i attempted to look through the binoculars. i saw an object that seemed to have a cylindrical flame inside of a dark-edged shrouded object, almost like a hot air balloon, but with distinctly different characteristics. this flame was shaped like an old power line transformer and never fluctuated or changed intensity . the object the flame was contained within, reminded me of the appearance of a  lunar eclipse.This object, after this encounter, lifted itself disappearing into a single cloud and then the cloud disappeared. by the way, i know what satellites, and the space station, etc look like , and in different light, at different times  of the day and evening--and the velocity and orbital patterns, and this does not match up to anything. also, as usual, there are one or two helicopters that seem to come rapidly from somewhere, shortly after this event. on this particular evening, it was too dark to spot the physical attributes of the helicopters, but i often see these as dark---possibly black. i became afraid after this point and went inside--vowing not to check nightly.  also, this is in relative proximity to the railroad yards, major airport, and military bases.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with

sighting:\r\nat about 19:30 myself and my partner where outside for our nightly walk with our cat when i looked directly up 90 degrees to the horizon and saw a spherical light travelling very high up at a great speed because we only managed to see it travelling across the entire sky for about 4 seconds. that same night there was also a power outage in the centurion and surrounding areas so it was a very dark night. there was also no moon so the sky was incredibly dark. i am an amateur astronomer and i could see saturn very clearly with my standard store bought telescope which is on a normal night never possible due to light pollution. the spherical light was about the size of canopus (much bigger than a satellite) and from my experience looking at the sky was very high up so with the short time we could follow it i do believe it was travelling at vastly high speeds. centurion is near two major airports and we watch airplanes come and go constantly and they take sometimes minutes to cross small patches of horizon. this object covered the entire sky in about 4 seconds. the spherical light travelled straight for most of the distance but did make a curved adjustment before coming back onto its straight line this took hardly a full second. this object was also travelling in the area of the sky that is the milky way and this is also why it stood out so much against all the stars we observe nightly. the object was travelling west to east and just travelled straight out off our field of view.\r\nafter seeing the object my partner and i were feeling quite excited as we truly believe this was a legitimate sighting. we have had suspicions before but with this there was no doubt for either of us.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

facing north.  in the northern sky, traveling north-east at high speed (not a helicopter or balloon), towards an area where fireworks were been displayed but still considerably west of that area, i saw a lighted object (couldn't discern shape) pulsating (not blinking) at about 2 pulses per second and undulating up and down in it's flight path until disappearing.  i couldn't hear if sound or not because of noise from air conditioner.  likely the idea was for the fireworks to provide clandestine cover so as to be undetected.  i could not discern distance but it looked pretty low.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
