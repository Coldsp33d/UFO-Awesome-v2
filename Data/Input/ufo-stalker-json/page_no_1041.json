that the light i was watching dimmed and almost faded out. at first i thought it might be high clouds but the stars were not dimmed so it couldn't be that. i have never seen a satellite dim like that, the light is always steady. after a few seconds, the light began to get brighter. after the light was bright again, i continued to watch it and then it started dimming again. at this point it was almost directly overhead just a little to the east by maybe 1 or 2 degrees. suddenly it seemed to slow a little but i assumed it was just my eyes imagining it until it suddenly changed direction and started heading due east. i have never seen a satellite do that before. it moved east for a few seconds till it was at about 85 degrees off of directly up and suddenly stopped. i closed my eyes for a moment to make sure i was not seeing things and looked again and sure enough it was not moving anymore. at this point i had to come to the conclusion that there was absolutely no way this was a satellite. i continued to observe it for another couple of minutes to see if it might start moving again but it didn't and then came

67)  and i (i'm 31)  were sitting in lawn chairs in front of his garage when his wife who is 10 years older yelled from the porch to look up in the sky. she came running down and before you know it most of the people in the neighborhood came out and watched 3 saucer shaped objects burning bright reddish orange darting around in the sky for about 20 minutes. after about 15 minutes several planes formed a large circle around 2 of the objects they disappeared and reappeared or were just flying so fast it was ridiculous. they were the size of an aircraft carrier or 4. dave claimed they had to be above 34,000 feet . it was a clear night and you could see all the stars.We were in ahww in how they flew so fast and were burning so bright. they made no sound. then suddenly a 3rd object came then they all headed west so fast it was incredible. the planes circled and flew off after them but couldn't even come close to the speed these objects were moving. also a few of what we all agreed were fighter jets came from the south in a v formation and shot out after the objects. by the time we had a camera it was all over. then today i was on reddit and found this link about altoona ufos and it brought me here. the video does not do justice to what we saw. today i went to my local pub  to have a beer and an off duty nurse who was talking to her son and he started talking about how he was camping saturday and that a group of his friends (around 30 of them) saw ufos. i listened to what he said and he described the same things i had seen. also after interrupting their conversation and finding out where he was camping i figured he had saw them after our sighting and that he was in a direct line west about 5 miles from where we sat. i have been to many airshow with my grandpa a ww2 vet i have never seen anything like it in my whole life. i didn't know anything that big could move that fast. we all talked about it for an hour afterwards and came the conclusion that they were some kind of flying ship because they seemed to have an intelligent person or something behind some controls. we also agreed that the ufos were aware that the planes were tailgating them and following them and when they were surrounded decided to haul ass.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then

a thin elliptical shape that was spinning along its horizontal axis. this is not my first time witnessing a strange object like this, however it is my first time seeing something like this by myself.

the lights were blinking. at first i thought it was a ship on the horizon. however, after blinking for about 20 seconds, all of the lights disappeared suddenly. i thought that maybe this ship had sailed too far to the west over the horizon that i could no longer see it. a few minutes later, these lights appeared suddenly again. they blinked for a good 20-30 seconds and disappeared suddenly again. over the course of about 15 to 20 minutes, this happened a total of four times. the first three times, the lights appeared in the same location and didn't move much but rather seemed to hover.

we noticed a large beam of white light shining downward from the clouds above the power transfer station for the local hydro electric dam (about 1/2 mile away on the hilltop. the beam shone to ground level. it was a dull, overcast evening with low clouds. at first i thought the beam was a spotlight from a helicopter that often scans the power lines for hot spots, etc. then, it occurred to me that the beam was way too wide for a conventional spotlight. it was too wide for the largest spotlight - it was between 50 and 100 yards wide. i pulled over to the roadside and slowed to a stop and looked again with concentration. the factor that makes me believe it was of ufo origins was that the beam of light withdrew slowly upward into the clouds. it was as if i were watching a cartoon. light, as we know it, is either on or off - we cannot visually comprehend the speed of light. light can be bright or dim; but we cannot see it withdraw when a light is turned off. this was an extremely wide beam that withdrew slowly into the clouds (almost in slow motion) from where it was emanating. the sides and bottom appeared to be laser edge straight. i could not see an object nor hear anything unusual. the beam just disappeared into the low clouds. after a short period when it did not re-appear we continued on home.\r\n\r\ni actually phoned the local provincial police detachment in our village when i arrived home (about 10 minutes later) to see if they had received any reports of unusual sightings. they did not indicate that they had.\r\n\r\ni am curious to know if any other similar sighting reports have been made? although this is several years after the fact it is probably something i will never forget. seeing a television program that made me aware of mufon encouraged me to make this report.\r\n\r\ni do not believe that any natural phenomenon could replicate the slow retraction of light.\r\n\r\nthank you\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

and noticed lighting in the distance near the waupaca area. as i was looking in that direction i noticed a small round bright light heading in my direction. i thought it was plane at first since the waupaca airport is in that area (about 18 miles from my home) but as it got closer, i realized that it was not a plane but a round lit up object that was similar to a bike tire with many spokes that were all lit up in different colors, and blinking white lights all around the outside ring. it continued to come towards my property at a steady level only about 40 feet above the ground, moving at about 5 mph.And even with a steady wind it was not affecting its movement. it was about the size of a hula hoop (maybe larger) and the thing that most amazed me was that it did not make any sound. when it was right across me in my yard (about 20 yards away) it went over the top of my shed, barely clearing the top of it by about 5 feet, and continued thru my back yard and small woods just above the tree tops. once it passed my property, all the lights (spokes included)kept blinking on and off until i could not see it anymore as it headed towards new london and beyond the trees. i told my wife and several co-workers the next morning and listened to the news hoping someone else had witnessed it but heard nothing. the only way i could explain the way it looked was to compare it to a small ferris wheel but with many more spokes, almost like a fireworks display contained in a round circle with blinking lights all around it. i went back inside with the dog and checked the time. it

cordobesa.\r\neran cerca de las dos y media aproximadamente de la madrugada cuando regresabamos a casa mi pareja y yo despues de dar un paseo por dicha ciudad cuando de repente detras nuestra podimos escuchar a un grupo de personas entorno dos o tres repetir sin cesar que mirasen al cielo.\r\njusto en ese momento cuando levantamos nuestras miradas pudimos contemplar como cinco o seis puntos de luz naranjas se desplazaban despacio en linea recta e iban desapareciendo uno a uno tornandose esas luces naranjas en tonos verdosos y apagandose por completo hasta desaparecer uno a uno siendo asi el primero hasta el ������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������ltimo. aquello no se parecia a nada visto antes ya que un avion se perderia de vista y estos objetos desaparecieron delante nuestra. \r\nhe de decir que en el video no se llega a apreciar la intensidad con la que se apreciaban dichos objetos pero eran de un naranja destellante.(objetar que cuando alguien toma una foto a la luna ya sea con dispositivo movil nunca llega a apreciarse como en realidad la estamos percibiendo)\r\nel movil con el que se tomo el video fue un lg optimus g .\r\nsin nada mas que decir y ya por ultimo, encontre en internet casos parecidos al mio y fotografias similares a lo que aquella noche se contemplo.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

after 2 hours the object is still in view. slowly heading north. i watched the object for over 2 hours, i found it very fascinating and mysterious. it wasn't a plane, or a helicopter, or a star, or planet. it was an object or \"orb\" that was being controlled by something, that's all i can be sure of.\r\n\r\ni never lost sight of the object. it is still in the sky as i type this report. still

cigarette. i went out before her, lit my smoke and from the top of the stairs to our patio, my wife asked asked ���what are those? they aren���t planes.��� i looked up to where she was pointing to the ssw. there were two orangish orbs that were flickering slightly. the first thought i had was that they were chinese lanterns. however, the hair on the back of my neck stood up as i realized that they were moving towards us and, far too fast to be any sort of lantern or balloon. the objects appeared to be at 2,000 - 3,000 feet in altitude, moving at 200-300 miles per hour towards nne. the two objects traveled silently and in apparent formation, perhaps 2,500 feet apart. they traveled at a constant rate and did not change bearing.\r\n\r\nas the objects approached, not quite overhead, but maybe offset by about 15-degrees from directly overhead, i noticed that the glowing, flickering orange nearly disappeared and i was able to observe the underside of the objects, which appeared round in shape with a dark center and a ring of somewhat dim, fuzzy light around it. the two objects disappeared behind our building. i considered running through the front of the apartment to see if i could observe the objects on the other side of the building, but decided against it. my wife ran inside to grab her camera. she returned just as a third orb appeared and followed a similar vector to the other two objects. again, as the third object passed nearly overhead, i observed the same structure as the first two objects. my wife was able to get one very nondescript, streaked image with her camera but honestly, it doesn���t look like much.\r\n\r\nthe entire incident lasted perhaps 1 minute and 30 seconds. after the three objects had passed, my wife and i were somewhat shaken and tried to make any sense of what we had just seen. they clearly were not any sort of aircraft or drone that i have seen (and i consider myself an aircraft aficionado along with being a drone and r/c aircraft pilot). the other thought i had were that perhaps they were some sort of debris entering the atmosphere and burning up, but that would not account for what appeared to be a level flight path and lack of a tail.\r\n\r\nabout a minute or so after this, a commercial aircraft crossed the flight path of the objects at a perpendicular angle, heading east. i have no idea if the pilot of that airliner, likely landing at jfk, was able to see what had just occurred, but i suppose we have no way of knowing. we checked the internet for any other reports of this incident and found nothing, which is astonishing considering it occurred over new york city.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
