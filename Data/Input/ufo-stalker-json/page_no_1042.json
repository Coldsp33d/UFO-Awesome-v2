street there is always alot of traffic.  i was walking toward the first intersection and saw and heard what i thought was a whirlwind and to my surprise there were 4 cube shaped objects in a square formation about 10 feet apart coming up from the ground!!  then there came up a plastic bag looking thing that looked blown up and 4 more cubes came up and then 4 more and then 4 more - a total of 16 cubes and this blown up bag looking thing which i think was leading them.  while this was happening i looked around and there was no one - not a person - not a car - and i'm thinking this is impossible!  i watched it go into the wind (which was quite strong)and up into the atmosphere until i couldn't see it anymore.  once these cubes (which were all silver) were up high the traffic started flowing and people were coming around. the first thing i thought when this happened was - they found me...\r\n\r\nthen about a week later i was up stairs staring at the beautiful clear starlit night and one star in particular caught my attention and i thought to myself what a beautiful star and then - as if to read my mind - it went from side to side.  i felt as though someone slugged me in the stomach!  i then thought i didn't just see what i thought i saw and it then moved side to side.  i ran down stairs yelling about the ufo to my son and daughter but they want nothing to do with it and so i grabbed my camera and went outside to take pictures and by then it was almost right overhead.  i snapped a bunch of pictures.  they weren't the best but you could see the lights which were green and white.  it was triangle shaped and small about the size of a small plane with 3 lights underneath which were not pulsating at all or blinking.  it went by very slow and silently.  i watched until i couldn't see it anymore.\r\n\r\nabout a week and a half later at exactly 2:30 i woke up because my room was lit up as though it was day time.  i went to my window and it was so bright i would see what was causing it.  it had to have been very small because my back yard it quite small and big trees.  there is a little space where this object could fit.  the light was shining for about 5 mins.  i was too scared to go outside and look at it.\r\n\r\nthe next day i went to get my camera and it was gone.  the case was there but the camera was gone.  so, i have no proof of the ufo i saw.

Flat","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My wife and i were driving on the apache trail road towards tortilla flat. a couple of miles before reaching the saloon at tortilla flat, we noticed a silver disc in the sky on our passenger side. my wife was taking pictures the whole way with her phone (sitting in the passenger seat), so she already had the camera ready to go. we literally took dozens of pictures on our trip, so i not only have this picture but pictures leading up to it and afterword (if they need to be provided in the future as proof). \r\n\r\nthe object was hovering in place, and then appeared to start moving. our view was obscured for a split moment after the sighting, and when we could see again, it was no longer there. the disc was highly reflectant, bright silver (like a bare aluminum can), with no lights other than the light reflecting from the sun, which was significant. it had a very large dome in the top center of the craft. we never saw the bottom half of the craft, so the best description i can give is that it was slightly tilted downward so we could see the top part, not the bottom. almost as if the craft was banking a turn, although it didn���t appear to be moving in a curved line. it was too far away to see a great amount of detail, such as windows or panels, but it was close enough that it was right in line with the closest rock formation in the distance. i���d estimate it to be about a half a mile from our vehicle. \r\n\r\nwe kept driving and enjoyed the rest of our evening. we saw the craft at about 4 pm, and continued on our way to tortilla flat and canyon lake (and a bit further until the dirt road turns into a single lane road, where we turned around).\r\n\r\non our way back, which was roughly at 5:30, we had just passed tortilla flat, coming back on our way home, in roughly the same place as before, and i witnessed what i'd assume to be the same craft about two thumb-widths to the right of the sun, if your hand is a foot from your face. it seemed to almost be trying to hide in the blinding light of the sun, but was clearly visible to me as the sun was heavily reflecting from it's shiny surface.\r\n\r\nthe look of the surface of the craft, including its reflectant, shiny metal is why i believe each of the two sightings were of the same craft. the second sighting was a bit humorous to me, as it appeared literally a second or two after i realized where we were on the trail. i remember thinking to myself, i wonder if we���ll see it again, and then there it was right in front of my view. i didn���t mention the second sighting to my wife, and she didn���t see the second sighting. i don���t know why i didn���t say anything, but i felt it was best not to bring it up. i wasn���t afraid of it, but i wasn���t sure how she���d feel if she realized we kept seeing the same craft over and over. looking back i wish i had told her so we could have taken a picture. not that it would have done much good, as again, i don���t think the picture would have come out with it being so close to the sun. still, it would have been nice to have attempted it. each sighting was also in the roughly the same area, and had the same characteristics.\r\n\r\njust like the first time, when i saw the craft for the second time, we had to go around a corner for a couple of seconds, which obscured our view. when we got around the corner, the object was gone.\r\n\r\nboth times the object was hovering, and the first time it seemed like it was just about to move before we lost site of it. it was not a quick darting movement, but it did seem unnatural as it didn't accelerate like a normal aerial craft would. it went from a dead hover to a constant speed before exiting our site.\r\n\r\ni did not feel threatened by the craft. i didn���t have an ���anxious��� feeling, or a pit in my stomach. i didn���t feel at any time we were being threatened. thinking back, the only oddity would be that my 2014 jeep wrangler made an audible ���ding��� sound literally right after we saw the craft the first time. i���d say, maybe 5-10 seconds after the sighting. it���s the same ���ding��� as you���d hear if the safety belt wasn���t fastened or the door was open. at the time, i didn���t correlate it with the sighting, but thinking back it is a bit weird, especially since both me and my wife had our seat belts on, and the doors were closed, with no error light on my dashboard.  the only reason i mentioned the year of the vehicle is to show that it is new, and thus probably doesn���t have any mechanical issues. i���ve never heard the jeep before make this sound randomly. again, i don���t know if the two are related, but i figured i���d mention it.\r\n\r\nthinking back, it was odd how easy it was to spot each time. again, with the second sighting being quite funny to me when it appeared. despite the fact the second siting was near the sun, it was just.. there. you really couldn���t miss it if you were looking forward down the road. same with the first sighting (if you were looking to your right). despite the fact it disappeared on both occasions, i didn���t feel it was being anything but obvious about its position, and i seriously doubt if we were the only ones who witnessed the craft as it was plainly obvious, and we were not the only ones on the trail.\r\n\r\nthe only other thing worth noting i guess is that it didn���t feel like anything significant was going on during the time, but the more i think about it now, the more amazing the experience really was. i guess that���s opposite of how i should have felt, instead being shocked at the time of seeing it and then not caring later. but it really didn���t seem that important until we got home and looked at the picture and started talking about it. i���m fine with the idea of ufos; my wife isn���t as much. but both of us felt ���good��� about the experience, if that makes any sense, and i���m glad my wife isn���t walking away from this freaked out. in fact she wants to go back to apache trails again, so i guess it wasn���t a bad experience. \r\n\r\nhope this helped, if you have any questions please let me know and i���ll do my best to provide any more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

was the light from.  neither of us knew what the light was and assumed it was a plan with its landing light on.   as i got off the highway and moved off the exit ramp, i saw the light again and thought it was the plane we talked about earlier.  i continued to look at it and noticed something weird, it wasn't moving as fast as i thought it should be and it was very low.  it came over my head, about 100 yards above me, i rolled down my window and heard a sound.  it sounded like a blow torch.  it turned back about 120 degrees on a dime but still moving at a slow speed.  it moved about 100 feet and stopped and hovered.  it did this for about 15 seconds then turned facing the tree line, it moved backwards about 10 feet or so, then slowly took off forward towards the tree line.  it took off slow and gained speed.  during this short minute to two minute time frame, the light i was at turned green and i pulled into the gas station across the street and this is pretty much when i saw it go over the tree line.  i was not driving and watch this with my window down the whole time.  we searched for the object after and couldn't locate it.  \r\n\r\ni observed what looked like two engines like a jet, shooting flames out towards the ground as a jet would should out to power itself.  these engines were much smaller and much more quite then a jet.  \r\n\r\nsome of this might be better told then typed.  i have good details on the event.  \r\n\r\nwhat could this have been.  keeping in mind, quonset airbase is near by, and tf green airport is also close by.\r\n\r\nthis event occurred around 12:40-1 am sunday morning, 6/29/2014.  the time frame is large because it was 1:05 when i got home, i searched for the object after seeing it for a few then drove home.  so i think it was probably about 12:50????Ish","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then

looked up at the sky..Suddenly i saw this light blinking.\r\n\r\ni got really surprised at it because i saw something like that in the past, so we both started discussing what it was (obviously, she thought it was an helicopter or a radio antena blinking).\r\n\r\ni explained that we didn't have antenas in that area and that we stared in that direction for months without seeing anything...Plus, the fact that we both noticed the object meant that it was new to our \"eyes\" or memories of that portion of the sky.\r\n\r\nthe mos compeling thing that made me grab my video camera, was that the object was blinking changing colors (red, blue, yellow, white, purple) at a very high rate...Not steady like a man made bulb or devise.\r\n\r\ni got out my video camera and tried to tape as much as i could...First i started taping from the distance making a reference from a close building to prove it was far, how big it looked like and that i didn't hang nothing in the air to hoax with.\r\n\r\nthe a started panning and zooming at the object....And although you can't see the colors i mentioned, you can clearly see it's blinking and is kind of rounded.\r\n\r\nmy wife continued explaining that it was just a star, but i replied that no star blinked like that and was as close as \"this thing was\" and that i bet her it was going to go away eventually...\r\n\r\nsearching for more objects....I did see another 2 \"star like\" objects on the opposite direction. the two of them were behaving and looking like the first one found....But they were smaller and farther away.\r\n\r\nafter spending almost an hour (and having the video) we both went inside....I came out, before going to bed, and all the objects were gone.\r\n\r\nyou make whatever you want...I should mention that i'm not a ufo chaser, nor do i have a stack of books from von danieken in my shelve. in fact, i'm a bit suspicious and scheptic at events like this.\r\n\r\nmy intentions is just to help out to find answers and
