look up there at that!\" \"what is that?\" \"wow! that might be a u.F.O.!\" etc., etc. my friend and i both commented that whatever it is, we are not the only two people who can see it. the object changed in brightness and slightly in shape as it crossed into the north eastern sky and began to fade away. then it was suddenly gone leaving no smoke or emission trail or any evidence as to where it had been flying. the object flew far too slowly to be a simple \"shooting star\" or dust/sand particle scraping the edge of earth's atmosphere. the flight path of the brightly lit and pulsating triangular object seemed to be fairly straight and did not appear to change course too much. this thing we saw was in fact 1.) an object of some sort. 2.) the object was in fact moving on a steady course very high up in the sky, so it can be considered to be flying. --and 3.) we could not positively identify the object as to what exactly it was, therefore we concluded that it was indeed an unidentified flying object. i apologize for being so interested in keenly observing it's flight path and commenting on it that i forgot to reach for my phone and take a photo of it. both my friend and i are certain that we were not alone in observing this oddly behaving thing in the sky since we could hear other people and children at the event commenting on it from across the parking lot. once we all re-entered the arena, the event started back up again, so there was no chance to discuss what we saw with other patrons in attendance.

she indicated more had already moved out of sight.  in this larger grouping they were somewhat uniformly spaced out at generally 2 elevations and south to north (but not in a perfect line - they just followed a general path south to north).  trees were blocking our se view so as we watched we could see more of these lights emerge into view (almost due east) and head north.  we continued to see 1 and sometimes 2, at a time emerge into view on a regular basis for a total of about 15 minutes (i sent an email video at 9:17 after the last one passed).  we are sure we saw at least 20 and probably closer to 30 lights. lastly, as the lights moved north they seemed to disappear.  there were spotty low clouds and i could see their glow diminish as it moved into the clouds but the lights totally disappeared as they moved passed the ne line of sight (i assumed that if there were a light on the front of the craft that light would become obscured to us as it reached that point on its northerly course).  as another witness (in pa i think) noted, they gave the appearance of chinese lanterns moving across the sky. there were no blinking lights, just the steady glow. once the steady glow disappeared (was obscured?) we did not see an other lights (such as the blinking lights on an airplane or helicopter).  one other viewer noted that they seemed to be moving at a rate consistent with a small aircraft and i would agree except that we could not determine the distance to the lights (although based on our view of them moving into the clouds i would guess the distance to be on the order of 2 miles or so).  i did capture video toward the end of the viewing and the simply show small orange dots moving across the black night sky. in the video you can hear boats on the lake below our lake home -
