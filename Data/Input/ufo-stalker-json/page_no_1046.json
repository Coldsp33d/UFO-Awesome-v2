security domain. his email stated the following: \r\n\r\n\"a new family acquaintance brought up an interesting story that we had not heard previously.\r\n\r\nlast summer there was a forest fire in the massanutten range which falls under the national park service. it was quite close to our home so we were very aware of it over the weeks that it burned.\r\n\r\nwe were told today that some witnesses saw a ufo descend into the range and initiate the fire. several local volunteer fire departments, including our rivermont fire department, were, apparently, prevented from entering the fire zone by federals.\r\n\r\ni have been a mufon member since the mid 90's and read the magazine religiously. i recall no mention of this.  was there ever any discussion of this event that crossed your path?\"\r\n\r\nthe gentleman wrote the email to me as promptly as he could, but unfortunately, it had already been over a year since the incident. in a subsequent email the witness pointed us to a local newspaper, the warren county report, volume vii, issue 14 �� mid july, 2012. we were able to download a pdf of this paper with some effort: it is a huge 45 meg file. the ufo fire incident was given a front-page mention: \"earth, wind, fire - and sky? a tumultuous weather week. did a ufo ��� unidentified falling object ��� start gw forest fire?\" the very long article was the feature  article, starting on page 2. the article was a treasure trove of names, maps, etc. to begin researching this incident. two fi's were asked to coordinate their efforts with norm gagnon, star team member: phil reynolds & victor rodriguez. and so the research began, and this ends the introduction by the state director.

house. the brother of the witness was also there and joined them on the porch. the object,at its closest, seemed to be size of a quarter or a bit larger at arm's length. it passes in pretty much a

to be an octagonal dark craft with\r\ndarker seams or partitions around its perimeter,perhaps dark windows although witness is not sure of this. as this was a very brief flash, other witnesses apparently did not see this. as the object moved away to the north, it appeared to blink out, disappear from view,not fade out into the distance.\r\nwitness felt no particular emotions save

told me to look up. i must say it was very clear out and there were absolutely no lights ahead of us in the sky prior to this. when i looked up, there were 4 blue lights and some object hoovering about 30 feet above my car. the moon-roof shade was open and we could clearly see the whole object. as soon as we looked up and started to point at the object, it began to fly  away from the car, covering what we discussed and concluded was about a mile at most in 5-10 seconds. the object stopped and started to land. it moved and turned in ways that we all have never seen anything do before. i must clarify this object was bigger than a jet but smaller than a commercial plane. about 10 seconds after it landed there was a helicopter that appeared in the sky ahead moving very fast toward the downed object. there were many other lights in the sky that started being noticed in the next few seconds much higher up in the sky but above where the object landed. this vehicle made absolutely no noise and covered a lot of ground in a very short time. the passenger in the back seat as the object landed became obviously frightened and fell into a deep sleep 20 min after seeing the object. the front passenger and i have had weird visions, tingling, and nervousness, nauseous , and other interesting things since seeing the object...It was like we had to fight something off inside our heads

my back porch. every night for several months, going back as far as new year's (estimate, give or take a couple weeks) whenever the skies are clear i observe the exact same craft in a window between the hours of 10pm and 3am. it always appears in the same part of the sky to the southwest, hangs there for no less than an hour, often times longer, before slowly beginning to drift away from my location on a southwest heading. \r\n\r\nto the naked eye it first appears to be a typical commercial aircraft with typical night flying lights. it is only when you look at it long enough that you realize it's not moving in any direction, it simply hangs there in the sky. then it appears to be a commercial aircraft that is stationary in the sky with multiple strobes flashing in very, very rapid succession. through binoculars, a shape or outline of a craft is not possible to make out. what is visible is a single intense yellowish light that occasionally pulses very slowly. on the right of this slowly pulsing yellow light appears to be a sometimes single, sometimes multiple very visible red strobe that flashes in a manner so fast and bright i would almost describe it as aggressive. on occasions when there appears to be multiple red strobes, it appears that one is directly beneath the other, and sometimes it seems a third one is visible on the left side.\r\n\r\nalso to the left of this yellow \"main\" light is a single green strobe, which also flashes extremely fast, but slightly slower than the reds. it also often appears as though the craft is either changing shape or possibly rotating on an axis, as often to the naked eye it appears to go from a horizontal series of strobes to a much more compact mass of lights. sometimes through the binoculars it also appears to give off smaller singularly lights, usually the same yellow as the \"main\" light. these smaller off-shoot lights appear to separate from the main entity of strobes and either very briefly orbit around it or sometimes seem to 'dance' or 'play' with each other before rejoining the main body. these off-shoot events are infrequent and last only a few minutes. \r\n\r\ni watch the object as long as i can before losing visual on it as it drifts farther and farther away into the southwest night sky, always very slowly. my home is located near a small municipal airport which rarely handles traffic larger than a cessna type aircraft. i am also approximately equal distances from philadelphia international, atlantic city international, and dover afb. i have observed a variety of aircraft flying over my house or on a flight path that is nearly over my house for years, always from the south to a north/northeast heading. i know what commercial jets, turbo props, and light aircraft all look and sound like in the sky. i swear to you this is not an airplane, nor a helicopter. it hangs stationary in the sky and moves away, and despite never being able to determine a solid hull or shape or outline, i can best describe its movements and behavior in the sky as being similar to a blimp or some other form of airship, but no such aircraft (to my knowledge) are known to operate in this area, especially late at night.\r\n\r\ni live with my mother, and i have kept this from her since the very first time i saw this craft. despite the fact that in her life she has had three different sightings herself (one of which a frighteningly close encounter with a massive craft at treetop level which left her extremely frightened) i decided not to tell her about it until just days ago. i can't tell you why. i just felt it was something best kept to myself. a few days ago i finally told her. during a sighting of the craft i called her to the back porch, pointed it out to her with the naked eye and handed her the binoculars. she sees what i see. unfortunately, our most reliable recording devices for picture and video are our iphones, and between the craft being distant in the sky and the night sky being so dark, the phones cameras are not able to register it. the most recent sighting was tonight, \r\njune 25, 2014 at 1:30am lasting until approximately 2:20am. i should note that i have never witnessed this object appear in the sky. every time i have seen it, it has already been present upon my stepping outside.\r\n\r\nmany of my friends believe in ufos and alien life, and that includes myself, but i am not eager for my experiences to be known to others. i know they're up and out there and that's enough for me. but this has been happening for so long with such frequency and consistency, i feel that it would be wrong for me not to file some kind of official report about this as a matter of record, so here it is.","distance":"Over One

pictures would come out showing anything. it appeared as if it was coming from westminster and heading towards fullerton ca.\r\n\r\nthe weird thing about this object was the color and no sound. it reminded me of that movie predator when it would turn invisible, but you could still see it. \r\n\r\ni've been out at about the same time to see if i can see it again. no luck.
