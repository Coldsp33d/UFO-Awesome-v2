creek trail on the north-western part of the valley near wellington lake (appr. 39.335346, -105.407524), appr. 2.5 miles from the lake.\r\nat about 10:30pm on friday june 21, with my son (25 yrs old) and his girlfriend (also 25), we heard a jet flying a normal approach to the denver airport from the south to the northeast.  while peering through the forest canopy in the direction of the jet, i was able to see the flashing lights of the jet at normal altitude high in the sky.  shortly after first seeing the jet's flashing lights moving away in the distance, i saw a vivid, bright green-white, solid light flying through the trees but in front of the \"castle\", which is a large rock formation at the south side of the valley.  the light was clearly at very low altitude, and was in fact within the confines of the valley, lower than the ridges that form the perimeter.  there was still enough ambient light to see the horizon of the ridges to the south/southeast, and the light was lower than the ridges.  it was in a slightly descending attitude, and i could see it clearly through an opening in the trees, and then intermittently through the tree-cover as it traveled to the north/northeast. i lost sight of it after about 5 seconds.  it appeared to be traveling at about 50 to 70 mph possibly. there as no sound whatsoever from the object.  it did appear that it could have been a small plane or helicopter, but the area is remote, and other than the faint sound of the other jet flying away from our position, there was no engine or other sound from the low altitude light.  highly unlikely that a seaplane could have been attempting a landing on wellington lake, as it is very small, and the sound would certainly have been very loud.  the night was very quiet, and the sounds of campers at wellington lake were audible in the distance from miles away at the time.  my son did catch a glimpse of the object as it passed behind the trees.\r\nwe thought it could have possibly been a drone or some sort of remote-controlled object, but the location and time of day made this seem unlikely.  also the light was quite bright, similar to the headlight of a car.  there is no possibility that this was a land vehicle.  the light was viewed with the \"castle\" as backdrop, which is a sheer cliff around the north sides.  there were certainly people camping at the wellington lake campsites, and someone there may have also seen this object clearly, as it's flight path appeared to be towards the lake.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

in the sky, but after a few seconds i realized it was the blinking lights of a number of aircraft. they flew directly over me as i stood on the road, and i could see that there were about ten aircraft flying in a formation. it was night, but i'm positive that i saw their triangular silhouettes against the sky and didn't merely assume a triangular shape based on the lights. the objects all looked the same except the one in front had different or extra lights. at the time, i estimated they were 1000 feet up, but it might have been anywhere between 500 and 1500 feet. as i recall, the formation was basically made of several diagonal lines with three aircraft in each line. i've never seen this same formation, even now when searching on the net.\r\n\r\nthe craft appeared to fly in a straight line at a constant speed the whole time, and they maintained the formation. they didn't land at the airport or descend or ascend at all. they came from the sw and continued to the ne behind and beyond the trees. nothing else happened. i wasn't abducted. i can't recall any sound, but i probably would have noticed if the craft were very loud or silent. they weren't going very fast like some jets do, but they didn't seem unnaturally slow. the entire event probably lasted a couple of minutes.\r\n\r\ni always assumed these were probably military stealth aircraft, but i felt i had seen something unusual, and it always seemed like an odd experience. i now wonder if these could have been related in any way to the prolific black triangle ufo reports, so i wanted to report the event just in case it's a missing piece of some puzzle. i wish i could remember more details. i wasn't drunk or dreaming, and i don't hallucinate. thanks for taking the report.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

a smaller orange light fell from it and quickly disappeared, the large orange light then changed direction and headed south once again it paused and a small orange light fell from it and quickly disappeared. it then continued to move southwest and apparently gaining altitude disappeared into the clouds. my wife claims to have heard a humming noise before it disappeared the rest of us did not hear it. my youngest son later found out that the space station would be visible at 9:45 near cleveland, but we are 200 miles south of cleveland and the sky was cloudy and i don 't believe the space station flies below the clouds, nor does it change course and jettison items. a couple years back on a very clear evening we saw the space station in the same area as this sighting but it moved quickly and did not change direction. i am a ufo skeptic i don't know why aliens that travel light years need lights, but i can't explain what we saw saturday night.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

was a thunderstorm to the far east over the gulf in florida. i was enjoying the lightning show as it lit up the dark sky, there was no moon in the sky yet. a reddish orange ball of light caught my eye in the direct south i watched trying to figure out what it was and it vanished as i was watching. i immediately told my wife what i had seen and she did not think much of it until 2 lights appeared to the east of the first light then 4 more lights appeared next to the first 2 lights then 2 more to the left of the 6 lights now illuminated.  made  a total of 8, 6 were in a perfect row and the other 2 were to the left and at a varying angle. i got the impression they were all part of the same craft. they appeared only for a few seconds and then began to disappear at different intervals.\r\n\r\nwe stayed on the beach another hour or so, but never seen the lights again.  i had no way to tell the height or elevation of the lights but if they were part of the same craft, this thing had to be several hundred feet long.  there was no noise affiliated with the lights.  there were lots of people on the beach and out on their balconies so i know we were not the only ones to witness this.  i have searched for reported sighting and have found none, but over the years many people have reported very similar sighting of these lights with no explanations.\r\n\r\ni have never witnessed such an event and i did not want to be one of the millions who have had sightings and never report it.  what i seen was not of this earth and it cannot be explained as balloons, chinese candles, flares, planes, helicopters ect... no movement that was seen, no noise, appeared and disappeared without incident.","distance":"Over One

like a helicopter sound but reminiscent.  i decided to look closer at the skies from several directions.  with my astronomical binoculars, i started scanning.\r\n\r\n1.\tfirst i noted a cluster of many pulsating lights in a rough spherical arrangement in a sse direction which disappeared from view behind a neighboring roof.  they did not reappear even though i waited.\r\n2.\tnext i noticed pulsing lights from the left and right sides of the field of view that were travelling toward each other.  the pulsing lights normally looked like two lights blinking off and on varying in color.  occasionally a third light seemed to be present.  the two lights kept changing configuration with respect to one another despite the forward direction of travel.  when the lights came close together they both stopped, and then reversed direction.  the altitude and location from my vantage was between the stars antares on the right and sabik on the left.\r\n3.\ta few minutes later a pulsing light was seen travelling from the right slightly above the roof line of the neighboring house toward the left.  at the same time, another pulsating lights travelled directly toward the fist lights from the left again.  suddenly the left lights increased in speed toward the right group, and then abruptly stopped.  it hovered, then moved up to allow the first lights to continue travelling from right to left.  the one travelling to the left eventually disappeared behind the tree line, and the right one at the higher altitude continued on.\r\n4.\tlater, another set of the pulsing lights travelled from left to right, then slowed, and rose vertically and stopped to hover again.   at this point i noticed an airplane had come into view and was coming generally toward my direction on the right but stayed on that side and seemed to be going in the direction of mci (the airport).  the hovering lights seemed to be observing the aircraft.  then they continued once the aircraft was out of my sight travelling still toward the right, and made a large arc downward and in a direction to follow the airplane��� but slower.  \r\n\r\nnote:  most of the time, the pulsating lights would be either red or orange, green, white.   this was a characteristic of all the lights in the four occurrences.  the pulsing and change of direction of the lights never became static, that is, they kept changing in location although it was obvious that they were on the same craft.\r\n\r\nthe total time period was from 9:33 pm to 10:25 pm.   the direction of most of this was from the east to the southwest for boundaries of the entire series of events.  it would be difficult to estimate the distance of these lights exactly.   the best estimate would be to approximate the distance to the aircraft, which i would judge to be about 3.2 miles away, or over the southern end of lake jacomo which would be 2.5 miles distant.  (assuming the aircraft was at 11,500 feet when at 39 miles from the airport on landing approach).\r\n","distance":"Over One
