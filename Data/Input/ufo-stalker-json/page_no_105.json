the first time i actually realized what they were is because one hovered just above the big tree in the courtyard when i first saw it i thought it was a helicopter but what caught my attention was it was making a humming sound. as it flew over my head i followed it straight up into a cloud where it stopped and hovered almost like it masked it self in the cloud not to be seen it stop showing so many different colors and almost looked like 3 little stars. where it sat for duration. i then started to look for what i saw and now every night since then im seeing 2-3 3-5 every night. they are continueasly circling the area and are really annoying me with their prescense. i have taken pictures and from what i could see there are two or three different types one looks like something robotic like with lights on it at the end of its appendages. with what look lkke little cilynders on its body. the other type looks like a single black wing with three white lights im not sure if its the same one morphing but they dont look friendly. the reason why i say drone type is because the way they move around they are not going super fast but they are ascending and descending to high elevations they are constantly flying around me as i go outside to smoke like they are surveiling me.","distance":"101-500

green and red... alternating (what blinked green then blinked red and visa versa). it stayed still for the 20 minutes or so i watched and then i went back inside. i would say it was at least a mile away and 20degrees above the horizon... it was in the air, very clear cloudless night sky. if it was a mile away i'd guess it was 200 to 300 feet tall... if it was farther then it was bigger........ the best way to describe it would be if you had a double column of colored spotlights attached to a telephone pole and the lights were as close to each other as possible and each light would blink green and then red and ten green again. i took a photo with my cell phone but it was so far away you can only make out that there are lights in a short verticle column (not as tall, not as many lights

sterns' patio with my wife and richard boswell.  we were facing the west looking over indian creek.  the night was clear and a one-quarter moon was shining.  there was no wind.  an ideal night for romance.\r\n\r\ni turned to my wife and said jokingly, “no saucer yet.”  she gave me a warm smile, which was broken by a shriek from across the creek.  a startled woman said, “there it is again.”  she was mrs. hunt who lives at miami beach, i learned later.\r\n\r\nimmediately i jumped to my feet, checked the camera and shouted, “where is it?”\r\n\r\nit seemed like hours for the reply and a thousand thoughts went through my mind—could this be the same saucer from the night before?  do i really have my chance i’ve waited for?  will the lens be powerful enough? will this be a false alarm?\r\n\r\nactually the reply was instant. mrs. hunt said, “to your left above the apartments.”\r\n\r\ni moved quickly but still didn’t see it. my wife excitedly said, “there it is!” i was as well prepared to meet the situation as anyone could be.  but still i wasted about thirty seconds in amazement!  without any reason or doubt this was it!\r\n\r\nbelieve me there is nothing in this world that this saucer could be compared with.  i held my breath and pressed the camera tightly against my cheek and followed the disk the best i could.\r\n\r\nwords cannot explain the weirdness of this thing but my pictures may.\r\n\r\ni did not get results with all 50 feet of film.  the disk was so high it could be seen clearly with the naked eye, yet when i tried to view it through the viewer of the camera it could barely be made out.  i think this is self explanatory to anyone who has ever held any type camera in their hands.\r\n\r\nknowing this may be a chance in a lifetime i followed the image with my naked eye instead of through the viewer.  this is very difficult to do with a telephoto lens, but the results were sufficient.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

we are seeing diamond shaped objects when looked through a telescope you can see them with the naked eye they look like stars but they flicker red and blue then you notice all the other colors the main event that made us realize what we had been seeing for the last 2 months was not normal i walked outside one night and looked up to the east towards klamath falls i saw two objects at first that looked like they were hovering around a thousand feet or more above klamath air force base at approximately 3 in the morning i went and woke up the family that i stay with there was eight of us that observe these ufos 4 approximately 3 hours we video taped then with a camcorder zoomed as far as it would go and saw that the shape of the objects were a hexagon or diamond-shaped with incredibly beautiful lights coming off of them in the days since i have counted one night 15 of these objects surrounding the rogue valley above the tops of the mountains hovering not orbiting like a satellite on the 9th we videotaped the two massive ufos over klamath air force base we saw bright light switch look like explosions directly in between the two ufos they were approximately 20 miles apart or more then later we observed as the one on the left started moving away because it got smaller and smaller but it stayed in the same height on another night we observed same objects different in sizes hovering over the hill behind our house we have also observed one night when we were outside the moon was about three-quarters and we were looking at 2 of the unidentified flying objects as a plane from the medford airport took off and started heading for one of them when it got close the plane veered sharply away from the ufo and then started heading towards the other one and then veered again sharply as if the plane headed out over the mountains away from the ufos as we're observing this one of the youth that lives with me says why did it get just get so bright outside this was approximately at 11 p.M. as she said that i look up at the moon and it looked like somebody had turned on a light bulb inside of it the moon is always a grayish color this time of year especially after fire season i have never seen the moon light up and shine yellow like a lightbulb for some reason no one in the valley is talking about it i posted a comment on facebook telling everybody about it and to look up and i have quite a few friends and only three of them commented back saying that they had been seeing the same thing every time we get a clear night i can look up into the sky and see them sometimes there are many miles away and look very small but sometimes there are a lot closer and they are massive this is imperative that you understand that this is still going on it hasn't stopped the earliest i've observed them is 6 in the evening these objects hover for sometimes hours and then move two different positions also on the night we videotaped we watched as the giant ufo on the right over klamath had a smaller but the same blinking light ufo move in close to it these aren't stars because stars don't move one way and then back the other way it is the biggest evidence i've ever seen for unidentified flying objects and i have watched a lot of your documentaries these have been moving and appearing and we have witness them now going on 3 months please send an investigation team here immediately if you want to see the greatest evidence that more is going on then we actually know if you want the video evidence we need to download it off the camcorder but i expect to be contacted before we send it by the way i am a associate and youth pastor in the area you will not be able to contact me by phone till next week due to my phone being shut off so please

a sleepover. it is dark out, 9:30 pm about. they both suddenly look to the sky, as they sense something strange. they both see it and the christian friend starts freaking out and denies its plain existence when my best friend keeps insisting it is real. he goes inside and grabs his phome to record it. he then starts talking about how he is recording for me because he knows i am a big fan of ufos and aliens. he runs outside to get the ufo in shot of the camera and it is there, hovering, then goes into the sky abrubtly and blinks as it goes. my friend said he has never seen something like it before. skip ahead 3 days. i mention to him about how often ufos come back at similar times for repeated visits, and i do look outside aswell. from my window at 9:45 three days after the skghting my friend had, insaw a ufo with my brother. but this one is different. it is pulsating, a yellow-orange glow. it is about 1000 feet in a seperate direction from the first ufo sighting. i freak out, but then try to dismiss it as a plane, but i realise, 'do orbs of light pulsate? especially planes in general? no, planes do not pulsate in any way, shape or form.' it goes very slowly for the next 10 min in the same direction. it dissapears. for the next whole week at 9:45 pm it happens, then suddenly the phenomenon stops. i look for the next 3 days, too no avail. during those 7 days it did appear it sometimes changed direction from west to east, but gradually. each time the sighting would end the ufo gradually dissipated into thin air. each time it always appeared in the same spot. in fact, me and my brother took notes on the phenomenon. i often still look in the same spot today, hoping to get a photo, but every time i saw the ufo i always teared up because i was so filled up with emotion from seeing a ufo for myself. thinking back on the sighting, i still almost cry. i hope to see another ufo in the future, and maybe prove to disbelievers i wasn't crazy after

aircraft.\r\nalso at the very end of the video as i'm tracking the object it seems to suddenly dart in the opposite direction, when i shot the video i thought i had lost it so it was only when i reviewed it that i noticed this.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:00:44","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
