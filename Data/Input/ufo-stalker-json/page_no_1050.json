observer:  unknown.\r\ndistance from ground:  unknown.\r\nweather conditions:  80% visibility in the direction of objects observed, denser clouds in the opposite direction (west).\r\n\r\nthis report should be viewed as an extension of the previous report i filed, regarding the previous nights's events (below).  i would recommend reading that report and watching the video before continuing with this

the previous night's events, we observed increased military plane activity the following day, which included awacs planes and three ospreys, which all flew directly toward the area we saw the objects the previous night.  at 8:02 p.M., a military helicopter made a large circular sweep in the area of the objects.\r\n\r\nthe objects appeared at 8:47 p.M., and were in the same location as the previous report, and behaved in the same manner (with the exception of one splitting into two, and one ejecting another object).\r\n\r\nthe only noticeable difference was one object (identical to the others), which appeared to the south, out beyond the end of the jolly roger pier.  this object was not in the sky, but on the horizon where the water and the sky meet. \r\n\r\nat 9:19 p.M., less than ten minutes after the objects had 'stopped' for the night, four military helicopters flew over our house directly toward the ocean in the direction of the objects.  the group split, two turning north, and two turning south, simultaneously shutting off all of their lights.\r\n\r\nfor the next hour, four planes and an assortment of helicopters began making wide circles over our house and heading out toward the area of the objects.  military aircraft activity stopped around 10:30 p.M..\r\n\r\nit's worth noting that each night of the occurrence, all military aircraft that flew to the area of the objects returned inland.  in other words, no military craft were in the area when the objects appeared.\r\n\r\nattached are two videos, taken with a droid ultra phone.  these videos have not been doctored in any way, and no attempts have been made to 'clean up' the image quality.  please ignore the lights moving near the bottom of the image.  these were groups of beachcombers with

looked up and out over the lake when this happens:\r\n\r\n   space opened (like a slit) \r\n   this budding flower came out\r\n   then bam, the flower bloomed like a pom-pom.\r\n   the flower glowed, it had yellow white maybe even orange\r\n   next the inside of this flower came out,  \r\n   and as it did the shape now was a ball\r\n   as it glowed it went whoosh to the north the stopped and went east.\r\n   then it zigged and zagged went north, east, then north.\r\n   and it went out of view over the horizon. \r\n\r\nthe next morning june 3, 2014 something happened:\r\n\r\nwe were out drinking coffee and you could hear the jets coming in over,or to the south of us. it was loud and we actually thought the jet\r\nwas crashing on or near to us. we jumped and actually ran toward this\r\ncrashing sound to see if we could help.  however what i saw was a very\r\nup close and personal view of an f-15 fully loaded with bombs and other stuff on the wings, it was about 300 feet above us. it was very close.\r\ni could see the pilot's face, side view. three other f-15's flew over\r\nnext and all flew over the lake to the north east.\r\n\r\nwe have been camping there for 6-7 years and never have we seen\r\nany military aircraft.\r\n\r\nin brief:\r\n\r\nwe were camping, the fire was great and i just looked up. i thought\r\nthis was really unexplainable and wow it really looked like a\r\nflower coming thru a tear in space and went from bud to full bloom.\r\nthen the inside came out and turned the flower into a huge ball\r\nof glowing i do not know what. all of this took around three minutes\r\nand in this period it went north stopped went left stopped then\r\nzigged after all of this is just west north. this whole thing really\r\nfreaked me out.\r\n\r\nthis is

about the mufon website to report sightings. i felt it is important to report this sighting eventhough it happened a year ago. i was working in a restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. around 8 pm i was working in the indoor portion of the restaurant but i stepped to the outside portion of restaurant to get a drink of water. the patio or outdoor area was full of people. when i looked around to notice the people outside i saw to the south three pulsating purple/violet swirling lights decending from the sky. it descended rather rapidly because within seconds it came from a few thousand feet to hovering about a hundred feet to the parallel building to the restaurant  at first i was confused about what i was seeing but once i focused myself onto the object it was just about hovering to the building parallel next to the restaurant. i was suprised nobody else was watching what i was witnessing. the object had the three pulsating violet/purple lights and was simply hovering over the building which is about 3 stories high. i would say the object was about70 - 100 feet above the building. i didnt notice the outside shape of the object because it seemed as if it was invisible. my opinion was the object was either triangle shape because of the three pulsating lights rotating clockwise. there was about 50-70 feet in between each light. the object was moving north and i decided to watch the object from the opposite side of restaurant. to do this i would have to go back into the restaurant and out into the street. unfortunately that night i had only one table and of course they were very needy. because of them i was not able to come around the building where the restaurant is and witness the object hovering to the north. about twenty minutes later i did exit the restaurant from the front of building but by then the object was gone. hard to tell if it was alien or military, but the way it descended and then hovered within a matter of seconds, i believe it was definately not domestic.I have seen a few strange objects in my lifetime, this was the most recent. just wanted to share. thanks for your time and keep up the great work!! we are obviously not

gehen, bis ihr endlich so weit wart um zu uns zu kommen und um freunde im universum suchen zu d��rfen, in der unendlichkeit!\r\n\r\ndas universum ist so kalt, so unendlich und so lebensfeindlich. das leben braucht sehr lange zeit, bis es soweit entwickelt ist, dass sich das bewusstsein und noch l��nger bis sich das globale bewusstsein auspr��gt - das globale f��hlen ��� denken und handeln.\r\n\r\nihr seid schon so weit, aber wir noch nicht. viel zu unterschiedliche entwicklungsstadien haben unsere staaten und wir menschen selbst. erst jetzt dank der vernetzung ��� dem internet, fangen wir an uns mehr zu kennen und zu verstehen. es fehlt uns noch die globale bildung, damit sich kein menschenleben missbrauchen l��sst f��r die kriege und egoismus und bis jeder verstanden hat, dass wir alle zusammen geh��ren, dass man nur zusammen alle probleme l��sen kann. \r\n\r\nso gerne w��rde ich euch die hand geben und umarmen. ich kann mich auf den boden setzen, solltet ihr kleiner sein, damit ihr euch sicher f��hlt. ich w��rde euch so gerne sagen wie froh ich bin, dass ihr die unlebendige materie besiegt und den langen weg zu uns ��berwunden habt. es ist so sch��n euch wahrzunehmen! das leben ist etwas ganz besonderes und ich freue mich sehr, dass es euch gibt. wir sind nicht alleine! das zu wissen ist das sch��nste geschenk, gleich nach meinen kindern!  danke! \r\n\r\nich w��rde euch so gerne besch��tzen und sagen, dass euch nichts passiert, solltet ihr bei uns landen. aber viele menschen wissen nicht einmal, dass es euch gibt. und ich wei�� nicht, wie die menschen dann reagieren werden. es tut mir so leid���\r\n\r\nich hoffe sehr, ich werde euch noch irgendwann pers��nlich kennen lernen d��rfen, bevor ich als alte frau sterbe. man lebt nicht ewig und das leben ist so kurz. passt auf euch auf und richtet bitte meine herzlichen gr����e an eure zivilisation und nicht nur von mir, auch von meinen zwei s��hnen und ich bin mir sicher auch von der ganze

enough to get a camping spot and really lucky that i had a small tent in the trunk of my car. so the four of us (including myself)are just talking and laughing and having a few beer's not paying much attention to the hardcore party-goers that had filled the park to it's limit. my sitting position was facing north and what happened next just blew me away.A flash of light so bright and a sound almost like that of a shutter on a camera came right into the tent!I jumped up and was out the tent in seconds. i just stood there dumbfounded because i expected to see kids running off or maybe a feww guys trying to get our attention. but there was nothing.And there was really no place to hide.So back into the tent.No big deal. no sooner had i sat down when it happend again!This time my friend flew out that tent right behind me. and the both of us just standing there looking at each other and getting the creepiest feeling. so back inside we go and we are questioning each other as to what is going on? so in total it flashed 3 times.And it was as if someone was right up next to the tent just inches away. by morning all was forgotten.We headed on home. the following weekend the four of us ended up at my house and we were sitting on a picnic table all facing south.It was just getting dark when from behind us(that would be north)it was a flash and that sound that was like the shutter on a camera.We turned around so fast and our jaws just dropped.Clear sky,no planes,no pranksters,no nothing!It had tracked our location even after a week. but that's not the end of it.No one believed us.We had just made this crazy story up. they would soon be in for a surprise. went to a party and most everyone was there and it may have been a few weeks later. a group of us in the kitchen just socializing when out of nowhere this flash came in through the window and lit up the entire apartment.That was more than 30 years ago and to this day i still have no idea what it could have been. after all that time i just hope they don't show up at my front door. i've looked online trying to find someone else who may have experienced such an event but no such luck.","distance":"20 Feet or

a smoke outside and seeing this craft at eye level, he and i had just had a brief exchange /squabble about et's. ironically or not, below are the details of our discussion just minutes before our sighting. in a nutshell, i am a huge, huge fan of dr. steven greer- the founder and father of the disclosure project movement and the awesome sirius film documentary. i had recently downloaded his et contact app on my cell phone. i had performed the meditations using dr. greer���s ce-5 (close encounter of the 5th kind) app to vector an etv (extraterrestrial vehicle) to our location for several hours earlier in the day. i was now in our bedroom listening to a podcast with dr. greer explaining the details of his near death experience and i paused the podcast to find my husband in our living room, to tell him about it. i told my husband, unsolicited of course, that i too, like dr. steven greer, believe that when we die, we go to where we are, consciously and cosmically. so, i was nagging my husband for the 100th time, that i wanted him to increase his conscious awareness, start meditating immediately because i was now four years ahead of him in learning to do so, that he needed to quit smoking yesterday and be at a higher level of consciousness today, so that by the time we both die, we might have the chance to know each again in another dimension, pending that he cultivate his cosmic awareness. he was not very receptive to my thoughts, especially since i had made him listen to recordings that had come out of a crop circle, known as \"crop circle tones\" via dr. steven greer���s contact app, earlier in the day. so after lecturing him, i walked back to our bedroom to resume my podcast with dr. steven greer and my husband walked outside and into another dimension. below are the details and our four videos of this sighting attached. the third and fourth videos are the best of the etv. thank you et and thank you to the most cosmically conscious man on our planet, dr. steven m. greer, to whom we will be forever most humbly grateful. \r\n\r\nat approximately 8:00 pm, my husband went outside our front door to smoke a cigarette, after the run in with me above, where i lectured him about et's and his needing to learn to meditate. he came running back in the house screaming my name, yelling, \"come outside!!!!!\" he was running so hard through our house, his hands smacking the walls, as he was running down the main hallway, that he was shaking the house. i actually thought we were possibly having a small earthquake. i yelled back at him, \"hold on!\" before i could even get outside, he came back inside again absolutely screaming, for me and my son to ���hurry up!��� my son and i go outside and see at eye level, why he was so excited. a brilliant, absolutely gorgeous, sphere was at tree top level, directly across the street from our home, hovering directly over our neighbor's large pine tree. it turned colors from an aqua/neon blue, to a cobalt blue and a bright red, as it was spinning in a counter clockwise fashion. it was so freaking awesome there are simply no words. after capturing our full attention, the air show began. the maneuvering capability of this light ship was beyond all comprehension. it would arch its flight path in a \"c\" shape jumping or hopping right over the top of the pine tree, hopping back and forth, over the top of the tree with ease and back again. it would stop about 50' from the left side of the tree top, hover, then free fall to below the tree line, then ascend straight up faster they anything you could ever see at six flaggs, hover again, go behind the tree, jump over the tree, free fall halfway, stop in midair, free fall again, then ascend straight up, hover and this went on and on and on and on. this lasted for approximately thirty minutes. in fact, my husband had the time to go back inside to find his camera, a nikon d3100, then he scrambled to find the right camera lens, as he run inside and outside about changing lens, but he was successful in videotaping the light ship. the ship remained with us until our teenage neighbor and his companion arrived by car at their home, where the action was taking place right over their heads. as they drove up, they could clearly see the three of us standing in our driveway, excited and my husband with a camera in his hand filming the sky above their home. they naturally crossed the street and walked into our driveway to see what we were doing and to see what we were looking at. i told them as they approached, not to be afraid and then my husband yelled out at them, that it was a ufo and i think they got a little scared as they turned around to look at it. it was at this point that the ship seemed too dematerialized to our naked eye, but on the fourth video attached, what you can see that it actually did, was to take off so fast, going to the lower left, that we couldn't see this at all, its speed was so quick and fast. i believe it left us because our teenage neighbors were afraid and to avoid causing anyone, any emotional duress whatsoever, they will remove themselves because this is how truly loving they are. i believe, rather, i know with 100 percent certainty, that this was a completely peaceful contact experience and the \"et's\" are so kind in fact, i even tried to tell the teens to not be afraid but the ship would not rematerialized in their presence. we had to show them the video so they would not think we were all crazy. please excuse my husband's profanity in the videos, as he was so frenzied and frantic to film this sighting, that we can now both laugh at his reaction. i, on the other hand, was talking to the craft, thanking it for this awesome experience, asking it if we could photograph it, etc., and my husband clearly wanted me to \"shut up!\" our conversation on the audio is hilarious. the experience and sighting left me so incredibly happy for hours. while watching it live, i felt like i could predict its next movements. my husband would say, \"it's gone.\" i found myself responding, \"no it's not, it is going to come out from behind the tree and drop straight down\" and it would. i seriously felt like i was somehow communicating with it and could direct my husband where to point his camera next to try to capture this fast moving object again and again. it was one of the best moments of all of our lives and i wish this same experience for all of humanity. someone should nominate dr. steven m. greer for the nobel peace prize as the preeminent genius of the 20th and 21st centuries and beyond. we wish everyone peace, blessings and universal happiness and freedom to all our members of the human family.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

a smoke outside and seeing this craft at eye level, he and i had just had a brief exchange /squabble about et's. ironically or not, below are the details of our discussion just minutes before our sighting. in a nutshell, i am a huge, huge fan of dr. steven greer- the founder and father of the disclosure project movement and the awesome sirius film documentary. i had recently downloaded his et contact app on my cell phone. i had performed the meditations using dr. greer���s ce-5 (close encounter of the 5th kind) app to vector an etv (extraterrestrial vehicle) to our location for several hours earlier in the day. i was now in our bedroom listening to a podcast with dr. greer explaining the details of his near death experience and i paused the podcast to find my husband in our living room, to tell him about it. i told my husband, unsolicited of course, that i too, like dr. steven greer, believe that when we die, we go to where we are, consciously and cosmically. so, i was nagging my husband for the 100th time, that i wanted him to increase his conscious awareness, start meditating immediately because i was now four years ahead of him in learning to do so, that he needed to quit smoking yesterday and be at a higher level of consciousness today, so that by the time we both die, we might have the chance to know each again in another dimension, pending that he cultivate his cosmic awareness. he was not very receptive to my thoughts, especially since i had made him listen to recordings that had come out of a crop circle, known as \"crop circle tones\" via dr. steven greer���s contact app, earlier in the day.  so after lecturing him, i walked back to our bedroom to resume my podcast with dr. steven greer and my husband walked outside and into another dimension. below are the details and our four videos of this sighting attached. the third and fourth videos are the best of the etv. thank you et and thank you to the most cosmically conscious man on our planet, dr. steven m. greer, to whom we will be forever most humbly grateful. \r\n\r\nat approximately 8:00 pm, my husband went outside our front door to smoke a cigarette, after the run in with me above, where i lectured him about et's and his needing to learn to meditate. he came running back in the house screaming my name, yelling, \"come outside!!!!!\" he was running so hard through our house, his hands smacking the walls, as he was running down the main hallway, that he was shaking the house. i actually thought we were possibly having a small earthquake. i yelled back at him, \"hold on!\" before i could even get outside, he came back inside again absolutely screaming, for me and my son to ���hurry up!��� my son and i go outside and see at eye level, why he was so excited. a brilliant, absolutely gorgeous, sphere was at tree top level, directly across the street from our home, hovering directly over our neighbor's large pine tree. it turned colors from an aqua/neon blue, to a cobalt blue and a bright red, as it was spinning in a counter clockwise fashion. it was so freaking awesome there are simply no words. after capturing our full attention, the air show began. the maneuvering capability of this light ship was beyond all comprehension. it would arch its flight path in a \"c\" shape jumping or hopping right over the top of the pine tree, hopping back and forth, over the top of the tree with ease and back again. it would stop about 50' from the left side of the tree top, hover, then free fall to below the tree line, then ascend straight up faster they anything you could ever see at six flaggs, hover again, go behind the tree, jump over the tree, free fall halfway, stop in midair, free fall again, then ascend straight up, hover and this went on and on and on and on. this lasted for approximately thirty minutes. in fact, my husband had the time to go back inside to find his camera, a nikon d3100, then he scrambled to find the right camera lens, as he run inside and outside about changing lens, but he was successful in videotaping the light ship. the ship remained with us until our teenage neighbor and his companion arrived by car at their home, where the action was taking place right over their heads. as they drove up, they could clearly see the three of us standing in our driveway, excited and my husband with a camera in his hand filming the sky above their home. they naturally crossed the street and walked into our driveway to see what we were doing and to see what we were looking at. i told them as they approached, not to be afraid and then my husband yelled out at them, that it was a ufo and i think they got a little scared as they turned around to look at it. it was at this point that the ship seemed to dematerialized to our naked eye, but on the fourth video attached, what you can see that it actually did, was to take off so fast, going to the lower left, that we couldn't see this at all, its speed was so quick and fast. i believe it left us because our teenage neighbors were afraid and to avoid causing anyone, any emotional duress whatsoever, they will remove themselves because this is how truly loving they are. i believe, rather, i know with 100 percent certainty, that this was a completely peaceful contact experience and the \"et's\" are so kind in fact, i even tried to tell the teens to not be afraid but the ship would not rematerialized in their presence. we had to show them the video so they would not think we were all crazy. please excuse my husband's profanity in the videos, as he was so frenzied and frantic to film this sighting, that we can now both laugh at his reaction. i, on the other hand, was talking to the craft, thanking it for this awesome experience, asking it if we could photograph it, etc., and my husband clearly wanted me to \"shut up!\" our conversation on the audio is hilarious. the experience and sighting left me so incredibly happy for hours. while watching it live, i felt like i could predict its next movements. my husband would say, \"it's gone.\" i found myself responding, \"no it's not, it is going to come out from behind the tree and drop straight down\" and it would. i seriously felt like i was somehow communicating with it and could direct my husband where to point his camera next to try to capture this fast moving object again and again. it was one of the best moments of all of our lives and i wish this same experience for all of humanity. someone should nominate dr. steven m. greer for the nobel peace prize as the preeminent genius of the 20th and 21st centuries and beyond. we wish everyone peace, blessings and universal happiness and freedom to all our members of the human family.   \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1
