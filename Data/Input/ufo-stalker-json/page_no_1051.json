looking north-east towards maybe lyra or cygnus, large dark shadow crossed fov, moving almost directly north to south .. blocked starlight as it moved, no lights but definitely could make out an outline.     no sound, object flew at  constant velocity and straight.  difficult to tell distance of object ... definitely blocked multiple stars in backdrop as it cross the sky which gave me the mental impression the object must be lower in elevation ... but with no standard aeronautical lights it seemed out of place.  son was standing next to me and could neither see nor hear anything .. i thought about transferring the binoculars but it was moving so quickly and was essentially \"black\" in form against a mostly black dark sky, i knew there would be no possible way for him to locate it.   as it moved i could detect or sense a general shape ..  at least for the leading edge .. a very subtle angle from tip sweeping back to both sides .. reminded me of the old flying wing shape from northrum ... at least on the front edge.   could not clearly distinguish shape in rear of craft.    this was not a satellite or space station ... those are quite bright.  this object was dark, and indistinguishably quiet.   not like anything i've ever witnessed before ... \r\n\r\nhoping someone else along utah's wasatch front maybe saw this object as well but given its exquisite stealth (visual and audible) behavior ... i would be surprise if it was noticed by anyone w/o binoculars looking skyward at the stars.    it would be interesting to see if a radar signature was detected from the salt lake airport at around this time ?\r\n\r\nafter the sighting was over i had to wonder if it was a military test flight .. but this seemed implausible as it would be highly unusual to fly in the dark, over populated cities.  no way for me to distinguish height of object though .. but physically seeing it block multiple stars as it flew makes me believe it was at a lower altitude .. somewhere within the commercial level airspace .. at altitudes consistent with helicopter to small fixed wing aircraft altitudes.   if it was any higher, the object would have had to have been massive!!\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

aircraft flying extremely low to the ground, just above the treeline. the craft, who's wingspan was approximately sixty feet in length, flew through our development, which sits just west of the atlantic intracoastal waterway. the sound of the object is what first caught my attention; it hummed like a commercial jet except not as loud. i looked towards the sound and a moment later it passed in front of me, flying over a small lake that is bordered by homes. it was travelling east to west at a \"casual\" speed, and once it passed the house, it banked to the right at a severe angle, exposing its \"belly\", and flew across the adjacent property. the underside of the craft was dark gray and had three bright white circular lights at each of its points. at its center was another circular light, slightly larger than the other three, and its color was a glowing, pulsating bright orange-red. that light was encircled by another thin ring of red. because the marine corps base camp lejeune is located approximately 30 minutes north of our area, we often see military jets flying over our skies, but never have we seen one like this, nor have we seen one fly so low. the craft

from lebanon to deerfield township. we had decided to take advantage of some of thursday night's black friday sales at the big shopping centers around deerfield township. it was around 8:30 pm that we were making the drive. we noticed the first orb as we came into view of kings island, a major amusement park in our area that is situated right next to the interstate. the orb became visible over the tree line south of us as we drove south on the interstate. \r\n\r\nat first we both thought that the red-orange light was perhaps a helicopter with its search light on. as we came closer it was obvious that the light was simply being emitted around the orb, it was not a steady beam pointed toward the ground like a helicopter's search light (which we were both familiar with, having lived in a questionable area of columbus, ohio for a couple years.) we were speculating that perhaps then it was a low flying plane, but couldn't justify such a low flight path considering how far we were from the major airports in convington, ky and dayton, oh. then the second orb appeared behind the first, following it precisely in a straight line. not long after that the third orb appeared behind the second. they were all spaced the same distance apart. from our vantage point on i71s it looked as though they were maybe 150-200 yards above the interstate and about 40-50 yards apart. \r\n\r\nthese three orbs were red-orange in color. they were not blinking on and off in anyway. every so often they would kind of brighten with a yellow tint, but in no way did they disappear and reappear. they remained visible the entire time. because of the distance and the speed we were moving it was hard to judge the actual size of the orbs, but i would estimate they were at least as large as our car(ford focus), but no larger than your standard sized helicopter that say the police or local news agencies would use. they moved in a straight line above the interstate heading north. they did not waver from this line or change direction as far as we could see.\r\n\r\nduring the sighting we did not have any issues with our vehicle or other mechanical/electronic devices with us. there was no feelings of fright or unease, no nausea or headaches, just amazement at what we were seeing.\r\n\r\nall told, by the time we reached the fields ertel exit on i71s and lost sight of the orbs, we had viewed them for about eight and a half minutes. i have kept a keen eye out ever since, hoping to catch a glimpse of something, anything similar to those three orbs, but i have not seen anything.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:08:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

have never spoke out about my abilities; but they are the reaaon behind my latest abductions. i contacted the few on board the craft once i had enough evidence gathered to sit down and tune in.

this craft.\r\n\r\nthe private area around a lake where this had taken place usually has no traffic after 11:30; given the weather, it should have had zero cars on it. a small team of vans and mid

by the time we had returned back to the car it was almost dark. as we were traveling toward town, i looked north east toward highway 95 south and noticed bright lights which appeared as though we car lights traveling toward hawthorne from tonapah. it wasn't until an actual car rounded the point of the mountain on 95 that i realized that the light i was looking at was actually airborne and not on the highway. our travel was north on nv359 about 10 miles from hawthorne.  as we watched the lights move toward hawthorne, i reached town and turned right on 1st street where i then made my way to o street and parked on the corner of town. i turned off the lights of my car and then the ignition and exited the car as the lights approached. i had first thought that it was a formation of helicopters (as many army helicopters always in the area). there was no sound of rotary wings as a helicopter would make as it approached my position. the lights seemed to get brighter as it was upon me and over 50 group of hawthorne army ammunition depot. i got a good view of the lights as it passed between 1st street and west rd that is the main road that feeds into 50 group.  the lights looked like search lights and were in a triangle on the leading edge of some sort of craft. the leading edge was not rounded off like that of a wing, but rather squared off and had indentions but that is all the illumination of the lights would allow me to see. the night sky was very dark and could not make out a trailing edge of craft. as this thing flew over all you could hear was a low hum, like that of high tension wires with current through it. no anti-collision lights nor wing tip or vertical stab lights noted. as the craft continued over me to the opposite side of town, it slowly turned to follow 359 south to mono lake. i got back in the car and told my wife i didn't know what that was, but i know that it was a single craft of some sort.  she said she never seen anything like it and didn't want to see anything like it again. we made a pack not to say anything about it...Ever. after watching your program and now knowing that others have seen the same thing ( or like it) i'm compelled to tell my story. couldn't start my car after the sifting for some time...About a half hour.\r\n  have no video or photo evidence to confirm this sighting.  certainly wasn't expecting to see anything

-- and left his telescope behind. we weren't sure what just happened, we were all sixth-graders. shortly after the sighting, the teachers sent us all off to bed and no one even discussed after that.\r\n\r\nwhen we got back from camp, two plain dressed men showed up at our school asking questions about what we saw. most of the students didn't seem interested to make a statement, but i was!
