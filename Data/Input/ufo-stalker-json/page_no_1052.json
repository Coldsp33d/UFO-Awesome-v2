States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I drove into anderson park just after 1 a.M. for a park check as part of routine patrol in the area as a police officer. as i began driving towards the back i see 5 or 6 lights; 2 red, 2 blue, and 2 green, or it was 2 red, 3 blue, and 1 green. the lights were near a tree line on the other side of a softball field and about 150 yards away. the lights were clustered around each other at various heights in a kind of oval shape. i would estimate the lights were clustered around something the size of a car and were about 3 feet away from each other. the lights looked like led quality light and were as bright as car headlights, not moving, and each light was about the size of a softball. as i drove into the park the lights do not change in intensity or move like a directional light would as you move a flashlight around. as i drove i observed the lights from about the 5 o'clock to the 4 o'clock position covering about 50 yards and there was no change in intensity of the light or any idea as a direction they were pointing; thus giving me the impression they were some kind of dome light or spherical in nature. i could not see any beams of light that lit up the grass or trees around it like a car headlight would do. i looked at this for about 5 seconds and then all of a sudden the lights go out simultaneously. to clarify, there is no way the light was emitted from separate sources. the lights went out at exactly the same time and had to have been controlled from a single source.\r\n\r\ni call this out on the police radio saying that i was going to check the park as i had just seen some strange lights. the radio works just fine. i go check the area and observe that the trees and grass are frosted over with freezing dew and i could see my breath. the low that night was 52 so it was probably about 55 degrees, possibly lower due to the proximity of nearby clear creek. i did not observe this frost anywhere else in the city that night and i was near another water source in a different part of town about, about two miles away and one hour earlier and did not observe the frosting of the vegetation. i turned on my spotlight and could see what appeared to be snow falling in the beam of my light and remember thinking, \"is it snowing? no it's too warm. is this ash from a forest fire? no there's no fire and i don't smell smoke.\"\r\n\r\ni then walked onto the freshly frosted grass and see no signs of disturbance on the grass. there is a bike path near there so i go to the bike path and turn off my flashlight and stand still for about 20 seconds to see if i can hear anything (like kids laughing). as i am standing in the half-moon light my hand goes to my gun and i think to my self slowly, \"i'm gonna go back to my car.\" it wasn't a physical feeling that made me uneasy but not knowing what i was dealing with made me feel vulnerable.\r\n\r\ni went back to my patrol car and throughout the night parked nearby to see if the lights came back and they never did. i went back to the area just as the sun was coming up and did not observe any signs on the ground and the vegetation was no longer frosted.\r\n\r\nthe only rational explanation i can think of is that there were these lights on an atv on the bike path, but they were arranged asymmetrically and did not appear to be directional. but i would imagine i would have seen the lights move as the atv drove down the bike path or heard the vehicle driving away. furthermore, the path goes into the trees and driving an atv as fast as it would have to have gone for me to not hear it would be insane without lights. there was a traffic signal about 50 yards behind me but the colors i saw were different hues than traffic signal colors and i have driven that area at that time a hundred times and never seen this. there was no water on my windshield and it was too clear to be a reflection.","distance":"101-500

about one mile south of the intersection with route 16.We were heading north, i was traveling about 50 mph.The time was 10:41 am cdt.I know this because i had just checked the time on the truck radio,when my wife asked what the white thing was in the sky about 300 yards west of us at just above an behind the tree line.She thought at first it was a cell phone tower but that tower is a mile to the north.I immediatly slowed to look.The sky was very clear some broken clouds in are,where the object was located it was very clear an no clouds near by.There was no sound or movement to the object,the sun was up an there was a glint of sun off of the object,though it was very white ,almost like polished porcelan.As we passed the object it appeared to be on the other side of the tree line ,maybe at the tree tops or just below,as we passed we could see the object still between the different branches.I stopped the truck an turned around to see if we could tell exactly what it was,which only took about 30 sec.When we got back to that place it was no were to be found.I proceeded south on route 159.To the next country road about 150 yards an turned west.Passing the tree line it opened to corn an bean fields,no trees to the west or south.Some to the north about a mile away at royal lakes subdivision.The view  we had was about ten miles to the west an south.There was no trace of that craft anywhere.It vanished period.I would estimate the craft to be about 20 to 30 feet long,with no wings or tail fin,the front or south end of craft was thinner than the tail or north end,it seemed to have a raised area half the length of the craft. i feel we were viewing it from the side.It appeared to be abouit 20 degrees abouve the horizon as best as i can judge.Having never witnessed anything like that in 68 years,the hole thing lasted maybe two minutes.I must sayi have seen many strange sites over the years in the sky an at sea in the navy but nothing to compare to today.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

central time i was standing in my back yard with my dog, and i looked up and saw two lights in the far distance, in the south east portion of the sky. i usually check out the moon and any interesting stars at night, so when i saw those two, i was very surprised to see that they were not white lights, but deep golden. the far back one was just a tiny dot moving toward my direction, coming at an angle, going north west. the slightly larger one was slightly off to the actual right side of the farther back light. both were deep golden lights.  \r\n\r\nat first i thought that i was seeing two very bright satellites, but they were moving so quickly toward me, growing larger, so  i  quickly stepped inside my door and grabbed my dad��s former naval  binoculars .\r\n\r\nlooking thru the binoculars i could see there was a large cluster of the golden lights that looked like they were tucked under the objects, which appeared to have  an oblong shape.  the lights were extremely bright, and very gold. the first one was moving toward a small cluster of clouds, where the outside of the clouds were very thin and whispy.  \r\n\r\nthen the lead object moved behind the whispy outside of the clouds, and i was surprised that i could only see one faded gold light, since that part of the clouds was very thin, and i had the binoculars. \r\n\r\n i was watching for it to come out from the cloud, and was completely taken off guard to see a ��flat cloudy perfectly round shape with no lights at all�� come out !  i watched the circle move quickly across the sky, toward me, closer but at the same height, and could not believe i was watching a ��circle�� flying across the sky.  when i took my binoculars down for a second..I could not see the actual object, just  a tiny bit of movement, but when i used them again, i could see the circle. no lights. \r\n\r\ni have a sketch i am drawing, and will scan and send very shortly. caj\r\nthe circle would best be described by saying it closely resembled the ��blob/circle�� that is used to disguise a person��s face on television when the identity of a person��s face  was not to be seen.\r\nalthough this circle was perfectly formed, as was the others.\r\n\r\npage two\r\n\r\ni looked back and saw the second object entering the same section of the cloud, and the identical thing happened, with me watching it having turned into the flat cloudy like circle as well, and flying at a  fairly good speed, going the same direction of north west.  \r\n\r\n i looked back again, and saw one more object with the golden lights heading toward the clouds, go in , and yes, the same thing happened. as i looked at the third one, i also saw two other lights in the distance, but did not see what they did, as i turned my attention on the two still within distance to watch, no lights..Just two more circles flying across the sky.  when i looked back and up, i did not find the last two of the five i saw.  \r\n\r\ni stayed out there a few more minutes, but i did not see any more of the objects. \r\n\r\ni spent a lot of time trying to reason it out, but i do know that any type of plane has to have lights on them to fly at night, even a hot air balloon can��t go up. these lights just went out behind that cloud. and with out the binoculars  i would not have seen the circles.  \r\n\r\ni looked for a place to report it��.I was back inside by  9:30, and ended up calling channel 58/cbs news about 10:30 pm..But was just basically blown off.  \r\n\r\ni left a message with  mufon/ california, but nobody called me today. \r\n\r\nthen tonight i called nuforc, hoping to have someone talk to me about this. i have heard reports, but never a description of the gold lights..And certainly not the flying circles��\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:13:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

outside my living room window and sit on top of a knoll in murrieta, ca.  i happened to look out the window and noticed a very bright orange light just above the tree line and over the distant hills (sw from my home).  at first i thought it must be an airplane that was coming directly at me because the light was getting brighter. but the longer i watched it the more i realized that it wasn't moving.  it was just hovering in place.  \r\n\r\nat that point, i jumped up and got my binoculars and began to watch it.  what looked like a solid, bright orange light with the naked eye looked like a spider web of orange light when magnified.  it changed shape several times . . . became larger and more web like, smaller and flattened and surrounded by a halo.  at times, there seemed to be a solid vertical bar of light running down the middle with web-like lighting to the sides of the vertical bar.  twice, it just disappeared (poof, gone . . . to reappear almost instantly)and then it reappeared and there were two, one hovering above the other.  \r\n\r\nduring my 30 minutes of observation, two lights appeared twice with one disappearing each time and leaving one.  they did not move (dart across the sky; did not appear to be leaving a trail; made no sound).  i went outside with my binoculars twice to look at it (them) and moved to various windows within my home to observe. \r\n\r\ni also got on the internet to see if anyone else was observing with me and, so far, have not found anything on the net that mirrors my experience on june 18, 2014.  but i did find several similar sightings in the area over the past four years.\r\n\r\ni'm new to the area (been living here two months) so i'm not well acquainted with the geographical locations around me.  i do know that camp pendleton is south and west of where i live and this sighting could have been some type of night maneuvers.  i've also been told that there are night parachute jumps at times.  however, these lights did not descend and behaved quite abnormally . . . which is why i've found this site and am reporting it.  (sorry that i did not take any photos.) \r\n\r\nfinally, at almost exactly 11 p.M., the last light, poof, disappeared and never returned.  i checked periodically until after midnight. just weird! :-)\r\n\r\ni see i can attach a drawing.  here it is!\r\n ","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:35:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":57166,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.557517055985585,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06192014-0016","longitude":-117.13998623735189,"occurred":1403155800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1403209668000,"summary":"Two bright orange lights at treetops over murrieta, ca, june 18, 2014","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/57166_submitter_file1__UFOSightingJune182014MurrietaCA.pdf"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"92563","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Murrieta, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:147839"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Menifee","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Walked into back yard and just happened to look up at the sky. i observed what looked like a tube white in color with the middle of the object seemed to have a solar panel each 180 degrees apart and silver type center each 90 degree. the objects appeared to rotate cylindrical spin then u could see panel go from black to silver then black again!\r\n\r\ni thought of a satellite but 5 in a row spaced by 5 minute intervals and the last craft appeared to be glowing reddish haze. they appeared in sets of two and seemed to be about 5 minutes apart for the second set and then within 5 minutes the same type craft with reddish haze outline spaced exactly like the previous two pairs.\r\n\r\nif it were not for the reddish/orange glow of the 5 th craft i would like to think they were some type of communications satellite's but 5 and 1 colored following the same path exactly and so close together. their speed was slower than any aircraft could maintain lift from. no trails, noise etc. completely silent. did anyone else see these last night? my friend a i took pics but the camera does not expand or enlarge enough to see the crafts. maybe they could be enhanced?\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":57165,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.69013354214355,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06192014-0015","longitude":-117.19859636132273,"occurred":1403145000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1403209511000,"summary":"Tube like craft with solar panels in the middle it looked like","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"92582","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Menifee, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:147840"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Mission Viejo","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Two bright lights appeared to be hovering in the air with little movement other than small side to side movements. lasted for approximately 10 minutes then disappeared.

very bright light lit up and started dropping at a very rapid speed . as it was dropping it pulsed some very bright intense light then made an extremely bright light and shot straight back up and disappeared .After seeing this we noticed a few other very high altitude planes right in the same vicinty as if they were investigating ,the planes were very fast !

called bunn, nc. i was messing with my radio, then looked straight ahead and seen a gold colored \"craft\" that at first glance i thought was a hot air balloon. only reason i thought it was a balloon is because the area i was facing (bunn, nc) is know to give hot air balloon rides, i seen the object for about 3-4 seconds, since i thought it was a hot air balloon i looked down back at my radio, then said to my self, wait that hot air balloon is huge, there's no way its a balloon, so i looked back at the craft and it was gone, when i say this thing was huge, im not joking it was far away and still took up a lot of my viewing area in the sky. also it resembled a old time submarine. the skies were clear, no clouds in sight, and to this date i have never seen the object again, but have seen multiple hot air balloons, but they have never match the crafts description, im sure others had to have seen this object, it was the biggest thing i have ever seen in the skies, and it was gone within 1-2 secs of first seeing it, afterwards i kept saying \"no way\" no way\" i rode another 10-12 miles to my buddies house without the radio on, just thinking i seen my first object that i couldn't tell what it was, of course my friends didn't believe me at first, but im not a liar or a thief, my word is solid. i hope this helps, would love to know what that object was. i wish i could tell you more but i just seen it for maybe 3 seconds, the color and size is what stood out to me the most, and it was just sitting still ( as far as i could tell, i do believe the object was near bunn, nc) about 12-15 miles from my location","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
