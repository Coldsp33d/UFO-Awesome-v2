phenomenon. i'd gone to bed thinking about what we have that might be of interest to ets. i'd been asleep for less than an hour when i was suddenly awakened by something, i don't know what. right away i became aware of frantic clicking sounds, insect or bat like, in both my head and outside of it, above me. this was very unusual. i've never felt anything like it before. i removed my earplugs to see how this might change the sound and thought it odd that it made no difference to the volume of the sound in my head. it was like what we imagine telepathy might be like. very clear, loud, and fast..As if whomever was making it was upset about something. i had the feeling this was related to my sudden waking.\r\n\r\ni'd been out of bed and to walk around the room while taking out my earplugs. this went on for about four minutes before i returned to bed and lay staring at the opposite wall to try and make sense of this odd occurrence. at the time i did not know about insect-like ets, only the greys and communion's blue people. gradually i became aware of blue-green lights reflecting on the inside wall i was looking at. there are no roads nearby and our neighbor keeps a red bulb going most nights, but not this one. the lights blinked only 3-4 times then they were suddenly gone. the sound had left before i returned to bed. i believe it had faded gradually.\r\n\r\ni know this is not a lot to consider but i believe in the work you're doing and in reporting what happens to us. my personal hope is to eventually discover whether anything similar has happened to anyone else so i might confirm its origin. it felt to me as if my waking had interrupted something. immediately prior to waking i dreamed--rare for me after so little sleep--of being in a sort of assembly-line with an aunt. we were having a disagreement and i said, \"but i'm the one helping you out here\" my only association with this aunt is of her choice to raise her family in the inner city, among a far more diverse population than my own mother chose. childhood visits to these cousins were always filled with new and unusual experiences and friends. i would never speak to any of my aunts as i did in the dream. \r\n\r\nthere is no possibility that i dreamt the sound or visual stimuli. i am certain of my wakefulness from the moment i became aware of the strange sound

have been occurring the entire week)\r\ntimes:  each evening any time during the 9 and 10 o'clock hours.\r\ndistance from observer:  unknown.\r\ndistance from ground:  unknown.\r\n\r\nthe first two nights observed, a series of one to four orange lights of varying intensity appeared over the atlantic ocean.  lights would suddenly appear in the sky, varying height (and assumed varying distance from observer).  there seemed to be no organizational pattern or formation.  on the evenings of the 16th and 17th, the lights would only appear, then disappear.  this lasted for anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes.  after appearing, disappearing, and reappearing, lights vanished and the skies were normal for the remainder of the evening.\r\n\r\napologies for incomplete or inaccurate reports of the first two night's events.  i wasn't planning on reporting it until the events of the 18th took place.  had i known that i was going to submit a report, i would have paid more close attention to the first two nights's events.\r\n\r\non the 18th, around 9:00 p.M., ten witnesses saw three lights appear in the sky above the ocean.  these lights behaved as they have the previous two nights, with the exception of one light 'splitting' and becoming two.  some objects were noticeably closer than others.  when viewed through binoculars, one could tell that each light was actually two lights, one at each end of the object. the closer lights (when viewed through binoculars) appeared to have a vague disc shape, with a light on each end.  the most notable event of the 'show' was the ejection of an object from one of the lights, which traveled right across the sky (south).  the entire event took place over the course of about 40 minutes.\r\n\r\nafter the lights had disappeared, two military helicopters flew the length of the island (north to south) along the shoreline.  when they reached the south end, one turned around, looped over the island, and then flew over our house, directly toward the location of the lights.  upon reaching the approximate location of the objects, the helicopter turned around and flew back inland, making one final lap along the shoreline (north to south) before returning to wherever it came from.\r\n\r\nattached is a three and a half minute video of a portion of the event, taken with a droid ultra phone.  the video has not been doctored in any way, and no attempts have been made to 'clean up' the image quality.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:45:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":57146,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.4784314,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06182014-0028","longitude":-77.4639499,"occurred":1403150400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North

direction.  dozens of planes take this route daily.  i thought it was louder than normal planes, but when i focused on it, it was a pretty normal sighting.  probably a 737 or a-319 at about 12kft.  \r\nas i looked away, i noticed a bright ball slightly behind the plane.  i re-focused on the plane, then found the object.  as i watched it, i noticed a brownish/red ball smaller, heading north of the bright one.  i hustled through my house to the back deck and re-focused on the object.  i had my wife look at it, and then she went in the house to retrieve the binoculars.  \r\nwith the glasses, i watched the object slowly drift to the west right above my head.  i gave the binocs to my wife, and as she looked, the red ball came back into view.  she handed them back, and i watched the red ball orbit slowly around the main white object.  not an exact circular path, but it came in closer proximity, then drifted away.  \r\nby now, 10-15 min had passed, and i got tied of looking straight up.  so i laid on my back on the deck and watched the objects laying down, looking straight up.  over the next 15 min or so, i watched the red ball come and go, as well as 3 more white balls come into view.\r\ni estimate the objects to be at least 100kft above ground level.  i say this because i was an engineer on the redbull stratos jump.  when felix baumgartner jumped from the capsule, the balloon was clearly visible from the ground.  the diameter of his balloon was approx 100 feet in diameter at 130kft.  the objects i viewed were smaller based on the same altitude.  so i would estimate the objects were smaller than 50 ft. in diameter.  and like the stratos jump, which took place just after dawn, the light of the sun illuminated the balloon as a bright silver-white.  the sun did the same thing to the objects i observed, though it was late afternoon, with the setting sun reflecting brightly upon the objects.\r\ni tried unsuccessfully to record the objects on my cell phone cam.  eventually, the objects drifted east into darker skies, and i was straining to stay focused.  i gave up after about 40 min of observation.","distance":"Over One

observed one through 50x binoculars but couldn't distinguish what the heck it was. i also saw a satellite zip past in the same relative direction. i love to sit out in the back yard at night and watch

newly assigned airman: area familiarization, patrol zone, procedures. at approximately 0200 hours we drove up too the rpl, rocket propulsion laboratory, in our security police vehicle. i drove up a ridge line, so i could show him, a complete view of area. while observing the area,we spotted a black large disc shaped object, appearing to be sitting on top of one of the laboratory buildings. my trainee asked me, \"what is that,\". i said, \"i have no idea.\" the object started to slowly rise up, a couple hundred feet from building, than slowly started moving in a circular motion, toward our position. i raised the microphone, to our vehicle radio, tried to transmit, when realized our radio, was dead. we both attempted to use our portable walkie talkie radios, both were also dead. all our radio's had been checked, before and after guard mount. next i turned on our light bar, as a signal device, although we were in a desolated area, many miles from main base. the lights on the light bar rotated for 10 seconds, than they went dead.  could not get them to come back on. we had no emergency flares. when the disc was approximately 100 feet away, our vehicle engine died. i could not re start it. i took out a remington 870 shotgun, from its mount. i opened my vehicle door, gripping the shotgun, in a death grip. the disc shaped object, a glassy black color about the size, of two c5a aircraft, wingtip to wingtip. it made no sound, totally silent. saw no lights. i looked for any type of markings, insignia saw none. the disc stopped, right above our vehicle. we both just stared up at it. it seemed to stay their for just a few minutes. it started moving again. i could not see any type of propulsion system. again, no sound, no lights. it rose up, too approximately 2,000 feet. it stopped. it started rotating from a horizontal position, to a complete vertical position. stopped, when completely vertical. than the disc started spinning, rotating very rapidly and shot almost straight up into the air, was gone from visible sight within seconds. all our systems started working. the engine was on, light bar was rotating and our vehicle radio was working. desk sergeant was calling us, i answered said they had sent patrols out looking for us. we had missed our radio check. evidently two hours of time, was missing. i looked at my watch, was 0430 in morning.\r\nwe both filled out 1569 incident/complaint reports. both would be read, that morning by the base commander. the desk sergeant said object had been reported by are radar, when it shot into the sky.\r\ntwo days later we both were told to report to base commander.  when we were outside his office we were met by a full bird colonel, wearing no name tag. he was very tall, at least 6'4, gray hair, and sparking deep blue eyes. i went into a office with him. he told me to draw a sketch on chalk board, of the object. i did. then i described exactly what had happen. he said nothing, had no recording device. he asked not one question. i got the strange feeling, he already knew, what had happen. i told him i would take a polygraph tests. he said, that was not necessary. he said he believed i had seen something. he told me, to never tell anyone what i had seen. ever. i left. my trainee went in next.\r\na week later i was called back to see base commander. outside his office were two very large men, in suits. looked like linebackers. i knocked than entered his office. it was the real base commander. he told me to sit down. he told me to sign these papers. i asked to read them, he said that was not necessary. i said i will read them first. it was a nondisclosure agreement. it stated i actually had saw a helicopter, on a training mission, with all lights out. i looked at the colonel. \"sir, this was not a helicopter: it had no rotors, no blades, no sound. sir, this is a lie. this is not what i saw.\" when i started to tell him, he told me immediately to shut up. he looked scared. he told me, he did not want to know what i had saw. this is a national security issue. he said, \"please sign these papers, for both of us.\"\r\n\"if you do not sign these papers, you will go with those people, outside my office.\" \"you really don't want to go with those people.\" i asked if i could get a copy, of these papers, he shook his head. i told him, i am signing these papers under duress and protest. i signed them. several weeks later i got a remote assignment, to go overseas. i have no reason to make up a story, like this. i am a highly decorated veteran, that held some very high security clearances. i never believed in ufo's until i had this strange encounter.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path

was the passenger in my friends car, we were on our way to hang out and play guitar. approximately 6:30pm while still day time. it caught my friends eye first while driving. he said wish a ufo, i looked and said 3 ufos!. they were almost straight up above us. if you reach out and put your pinky finger up. they were about the size of half an average pinky nail. we could not see any detail besides looking either circular or spherical and white. they seemed pretty far away like a plane would be. they were in a triangle formation. if you reach out infront of you and put your index and pinky fingers out (like heavy metal devil horns) they were that far apart from each other. they did not seem to be moving.But after about  a minute they started to straighten out into a horizontal line. and then again just seemed to stay like that for a minute. most of this time i was fumbling to record it with my cell phone but it just didn't turn out due to the distance and movement of our car. then we had to make a turn and lost visual of them. we were pretty excited about the experience.  the sighting only took a couple of minutes. when we got to his place about 15 minutes later we started play guitar and about 5 minutes into it the power when out for a few seconds then back on for a few seconds then off for good. quickly found out it was at least his whole block. then since we couldn't jam he drove me home. neither of us saw the ufos on the way back. i tried to go on the internet at home to find out any info on the ufos but haven't heard anything. i just want to hear other people accounts and or hear about what if may have been.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering
