were triangle in shape with a large white light at each corner. the corners were not sharp, but rounded. as i drove under the crafts i could clearly see their shape because they blotted out the stars

of my ability.  i drove on to columbia wondering what i had seen and still wonder what it was to this day. i would appreciate any input into solving this mystery. the crafts appeared to be at an

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"When i was nine years old (summer of 1989, i believe) i lived in a small trailer park in colorado springs, colorado with my mother. my mother was dating a man who lived down the street from us. one evening when we were at her boyfriend's trailer, they had an argument that lasted late into the night, and at around 3am my mother awoke me so that her and i could walk home to our own trailer.\r\n\r\nour place was directly down the street from my mother's boyfriend's place. our trailer park had a few street lights, but not many, and i remember it was extremely dark out. i held my mother's hand, and my eye focus was on my feet and the street before me. \r\n\r\nwhen we were about four trailers away from our own trailer, the street lit up all around me and my mother. we stopped and looked up, and directly above us was a large, round craft. i have no recollection of seeing it move up to us, it was just there. because i was a child at the time, and had no sense of measurement, it's hard for me to now say exactly how far above us the craft was, but i'm going to guess it hovered around 30 feet above us. it was close enough that it literally took up the whole sky; i couldn't see anything beyond it. it didn't move, it remained stationary above my mother and myself, and we stood motionless watching it in return--i have no idea for how long. \r\n\r\nit was perfectly circular, and in the center were three, round white lights positioned in the shape of a triangle. the craft itself was a lighter gray color. there were rows of square, orange and green lights that curved with the round shape of the craft. i don't remember exactly how many of the orange and green lights there were, or their exact configuration. it was like six or seven green lights in a row on one side, then a few orange lights in a row on another spot. i saw a lot of (i guess) tubing and mechanical looking stuff--i'm not sure how else to describe it. i've drawn a rough picture of the craft, but because i don't understand all of the mechanics i was looking at, it's a very basic interpretation of what i saw. there's no way i'd be able to recreate it exactly; that would almost be like trying to draw a circuit board, or an engine. \r\n\r\nas far as my feelings and reactions to the craft; i first want to say that i don't recall ever feeling any fear. it was more along the lines of fascination and curiosity. i never felt threatened at any time. the first thing i actually remember thinking and acknowledging was that the craft barely made a sound. it was just a slight humming, and the wind didn't stir or anything. the air was all calm around me. that was something that seemed abnormal to me, as though seeing this thing in the first place wasn't abnormal enough. it seems like the next thought process i remember was the actual realization of what i was looking at. i vaguely remember thinking something along the lines of, \"they really are real\", and somewhere deep down, it's almost like i remember feeling a form of happiness. almost like a familiar happiness; something i had felt before, or related to a feeling i had felt before. my memory of the craft itself pretty much ends about this time, so the memory of those last feelings are a bit muddy.  \r\n\r\nnext thing i knew, me and my mother were walking up the porch steps to our trailer. my recollection comes back as i'm taking the first couple steps up the porch. i remember looking at the steps, my sight turned a bit to watch my mother's feet go up the steps, then i looked at my hand which was being held in my mother's hand still. i remember at that point looking up at my mother's face; she looked straight ahead, and continued to walk to our front door. i remember thinking, \"why isn't she saying anything? does she know what just happened?\"\r\n\r\nwe get to the door and she puts the key in the lock, and it was at that point, before she turned the knob to open the door, that she looked down at me and asked if we just saw what she thought we saw. i just remember shaking my head, yes. she said that we shouldn't tell anyone about it, and not to talk about it ever. we both went straight to bed, and i don't believe either of us looked at a clock. because of this last fact, i can't say whether or not we lost any time, or if i simply lost my memory of the craft leaving and the walk home.\r\n\r\nthe next day it ended up being all over the local news and radio that somewhere around 200 people (i believe more than that, actually) had been calling in ufo sightings all throughout the night, many of whom lived in our general area of the city.

brilliant white glowing oval appeared in the sky south & east of my position at somewhere near 25-30 degrees above the horizon. it appeared to be hanging in the sky with the edges of the slim oval pointing up and down, it made me feel as if it was attached to something above it but that was only an impression. it was moving in a direction from south to north. it was moving at a rate of speed much less than any traffic would move past. it was moving much slower than any meteorite could have moved. it was closer to the earth than any satellite could have possibly been. there are some very tall trees in my yard east of where i was and it was just above them. i lost sight of it when it went far enough to the north that it went behind the tree line 800 to 1000 feet north of where i was. the whole sighting was about 30-40 seconds. it was completely silent and it was glowing brilliant white. it could not have been reflecting from the sun or moon as they were not in the right positions to reflect on the side of it that was facing me. at first i didn't know what it could be and i went through my mind trying to come up with possible things it could be. nothing fit what was happening. when i finally decided it must be a ufo i was a little afraid and hoped it would keep moving. it shook me up enough that i didn't want to talk about it for a few days and i search youtube for anything that looked like it. i only found 1 or 2 possible ufo videos that may be the same shape and size. as far as size i can't say for sure how big it was because i have no clue how far it really was away from me. i am now fairly convinced that it was a real ufo. i wish i had had a camera or some sort of recorder with me to capture it on film but i didn't. i am an artist so i suppose i could draw it or

the speed of the object that we seen that night, and especially the fact that the object stopped and appeared to hover and then instantly disappeared over the horizon to the southeast, no jet could hover with no sound for three minutes and then accelerate at the speed that this object travelled, we told our parents what we had seen and they told us that we seen a falling star type of object,

around 10:30 pm to grab some snacks as they were closing at 11 pm.\r\nit was storming outside but the trip there and back only took me about 15 minutes in total. \r\nas i exited my car to go inside my home i noticed an object hovering in the darkened sky to the south. although i live not far from the local airport i am very familiar with aircraft flight patterns and this did not look like any aircraft i had ever seen in my entire life. \r\ni pulled out my lumia phone and started the video recording mode.\r\n\r\nthe object looked almost cylindrical and was illuminated from within. it just sat motionless in the sky slowly and randomly pulsating different colors. even with all the lightning lighting up the whole area, i could still see it sitting there not moving at all. the sky was really flashing with lightning and it started to rain quite hard to i ran into the house to get out of the weather.\r\n\r\ninside i started playing around with the phone trying to show my wife the video. as i had not had the phone very long i was unable to get it working to show her. i gave up after about 30 minutes and over the next couple of days it faded from memory.\r\n\r\nabout 6 months later i discovered that i had cloud service for the phone data and lo and behold i was able to recover the video on my laptop. i was very happy to show my wife and son what i had seen that night but what i hadn't expected to see is what appeared in the sky along with what i had originally recorded. \r\n\r\ni was shocked to see to the right of the hovering object slowly appeared a shimmering cone of tendrils that seemed to sit motionless in the sky as well. \r\nit glowed and was bright enough to be seen even with the lightning going off.\r\ni had never heard of anything like it being caught on video before so i hope to see if anyone else has reported a similar incident.

small engine i looked up, i was in front of the house and the noise was coming from in the air on the back side of the house.\r\n3.  i immediately got scared because i never saw anything like this object before and my mind just couldn't figure out what it was. it was flying so low and was so strange looking.\r\n4. it looked like a large rectangle about 30 feet across and i'm not sure maybe 4 or five feet wide.  it had two huge white pulsating lights about the size of the old car headlights, being round.  the lights were centered about one third up from the ends of the rectangle.  i ran to get my camera and i tried to get a picture of it and i couldn't because it was still to light and not dark enough to focus.  the strange thing was that the back of the ufo also had the same huge white pulsating lights on the back side of it as it was flying away.  \r\n5.  well i am very used to seeing planes of all types out here in the mountains.  an airport is about 15 miles from here and it wasn't an airplane. it wasn't a passenger anything.  i am 68years old and have seen a lot of flying machines and pictures and videos of drones, but this was none of those.  i was so scared because it was flying so low and unfamiliar.  it just was on a flight path over my house coming from snowflake arizona across concho, and on the way to show low az. i started shaking and really didn't know what to do, i was afraid it would land and i was home alone at the time.  i had my 4-wheeler lights on because it was getting dark and i turned the light off right away, i didn't want who or what this thing was to catch sight of me and come on down and visit me.  i went and got my camera right away which took about 3 minutes and by then the ufo flew over the house and was heading to show low arizona.  i tried to get pictures of it but the camera wouldn't focus right.  i was shaking really badly.  i wanted to get a picture so someone would believe me, because it is pretty unbelievable.  plus i wanted to know what the heck it was.  the lights, all four of them, two in front and the two in back were pulsating rather than the rapid flashing planes lights flash, and the four lights were really bright. i called my friend who lived toward show low and told her to get her camera and see if she could get a picture of it but she said she saw it but it was to far from her so she couldn't get a picture either.  i talked to her the next day and she said she talked to a neighbor and they saw it also.  i don't know what or how much they saw of the ufo.  i haven't talked to her recently to find out what her neighbor so.  i called the police in show low but they hadn't heard anything about it.  \r\n6.  as i was trying to get some pictures of the ufo with my camera, it just steadily kept flying toward show low arizona about 15 miles away.  then i lost sight of it. i am going to try to find someone who lives in show low or near town who got a picture of the ufo.  \r\n\r\ni keep looking to the sky at night about the same time to see if the ufo is coming back.  i don't want to run into this thing.\r\n","distance":"101-500

one moved in front of me and the other stayed behind me (as if i was being penned in), when abruptly the trooper in front of me slammed his brakes. as i braked, in my periphery (to my right), i saw two red lights about 50 feet apart, hovering approximately 250 feet in the sky. for a split second, i looked back at the state trooper in front of me to make certain he was a good distance in front of me, then i looked back to where i had seen the lights (this took less than one second). now, two green lights had joined underneath the red lights, and the entire light sequence rotated into a vertical position, as i lost sight of them. i was so excited (when i saw these lights rotate in a vertical fashion), that i turned around at the first chance i could turn off the highway, when i realized i wasn't being pulled over by the state troopers, and went back to see if it was still there. it was not.
