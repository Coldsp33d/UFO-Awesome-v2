clouds in the sky, with the full moon and stars fully visible and spectacular, especially the full moon.\r\nas i was returning into my back yard  to go back into my house after watching the show, and also surveying all of the visible sky to look at the stars and see if there was anything else to view like airplanes or helicopters, which i saw none at all, i then heard a roaring jet like sound in the sky for a second or two just to the east of my position.\r\nsince i had seen absolutely no jets in the sky only seconds before, just a chinese lantern like red glowing object rising vertically in the sky next to the beautiful full moon, which rose up in the air vertically until it disappeared from view due to distance, i ran into my backyard to see what was making the noise.\r\ni then spotted a round object the size of the full moon traveling at a great rate of speed, traveling at four to five or more times as fast as a jet would go at maximum cruising altitude, maybe 1500 to 1800 mph or more, traveling from the ese to the wnw just above the cirrostratus cloud layer (12000 feet?) just above and slightly to the east of my position at 85 degrees of elevation.\r\ntrees blocked my view before that elevation, with the view of the sky being unobstructed past the elevation. it passes directly overhead, and seemed to be either a dull orange in color or silver in color with a slightly orange dull glow to the object. i could see the slight cloud cover passing directly beneath the object, individual filaments of cloud being clearly visible directly beneath the object as it passed above me, like it was skimming directly above or through the topmost layer of clouds, as thin as the cloud cover was that night. the cloud cover appeared as more of a thin misty layer almost fog like in appearance, but very thin in substance.\r\nthe object passed above me heading to the wsw in a very rapid manner until it disappeared behind a large tree just to the west of my position at an elevation of 25 to 30 degrees off the horizon. it made absolutely no sound in passing, and did not part the cloud cover at all, thus my assumption that it was passing above the cloud cover, as thin as it was, or that it was passing through the very top of the cloud layer. i could see the cloud wisps passing directly beneath the objects belly.\r\ni can only assume the roar like a jet that i had heard for a couple of seconds before the object was visible to me was of the object entering our atmosphere directly to the east of my position, because the object was completely soundless as it passes above me. there was no sonic boom, just a roaring sound like a jet makes at altitude but much louder sounding.\r\n\r\nthe whole experience, from hearing the initial sound, to the object passing completely from my view, lasted maybe 8 to 10 seconds, with the object actually in my view for only six or seven seconds.\r\n\r\nthis the fifth sighting in my area in the last 10 years of clearly discernable and well outlined objects. two objects were of a classic delta shape, two of the objects were a classic saucer shape, with one being two different colors denoting a central part of a dark gray blue color with a silver bottom and top surface, and the orange/silver one which i spotted last night, and one other that i spotted in the summer of 2012 which started as an orange sphere shaped object with a white strobe light flashing at the rear, which stopped and then morphed into a classic saucer shape, with a saucer shaped bottom and a squarish top, which changed color so that it had a glowing bright red outline and then it ascended straight up to space from a stationary position from tree top level, cutting a hole through the cloud layers with it's body as it went through them.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

the time he saw it, the object was at a greater distance and higher altitude so he asked if maybe it was a weather balloon. it was not, though. it was almost thickly transparent-like, but then it would ���morph��� into a jet black with absolutely no plasma look to it. it did not look like it was ���made of matter��� in the sense that we usually perceive matter.\r\n     i am somewhat shocked because i am a hard sceptic of almost any phenomena reported on any subject. i called the airport. they said that they know of nothing in the sky, that there is a national guard base nearby. really though, i���m not sure why i called them because this ���object��� did not look natural and moved in a very unnatural manner as well. it was not a ���vehicle��� per se. i am truly at a loss for words. \r\n     i saw it earlier this week too, but it was very far away so i did not call or make a report because i was not sure what i saw. on that day, it seemed to hover in a completely still position and darted off at an extremely high speed. i was intrigued as to what it could be, but it was very far away and pretty much a small, dark spot in the sky. i am certain now that this was this object or something very similar that i observed.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":" it was about the year 2008, still new to austin. it was the night before a christmas eve & my parents, my son & i were going to the \"women & children's shelter\" off of 183 & martin luther king dr. to make some donations. none of us have ever been there before & were not too familiar with the area. it was night & the sun had just set so it was still a little light out but getting darker by the second, the street lights were already turning on. the directions to the place were difficult as there were no street signs telling us of any shelters & there were no visible driveways. we later found out that it's kept sort of hidden for a reason, most of these women here are trying to escape violent living situations. anyways, my dad is driving & my mom is in the front passenger seat. i am behind my dad & my son is behind my mom & we were in a kind of bigger sized suv. as we were driving around looking for the streets to turn on (we were at 1 point facing the austin-bergstrom intl airport, it was about 15 miles away?) my dad points to the lights of an airplane that is hovering & says to my son \"look over there....Do you see that airplane? see how it's not moving? it's waiting for it's turn to land.\" i quickly piped in \"thats not what airplanes do when they're waiting for their turn to land! they circle & with each circle they drop a layer in altitude until it's their turn. that \"airplane\" is not circling! that \"airplane\" is not moving at all! it's completely still!\" my dad stopped & pondered that. he then said \"maybe it's a helicopter?\" at this we all recognized that we did not know what the hell that was because none of us could actually see anything! all we could see was the lights on it....3 lights that made a triangle. then we realized that it's not at the airport 15 miles away anymore either! that thing was about 1 block away from us! it came so close so fast that we didn't even notice it moving towards us! bam! it was just there! it also was only about as high as the tree tops...A helicopter would surely have not flown that low without hitting telephone wires & stuff. my dad kept trying to say it has to be a helicopter. i said \"that thing has no sound! a helicopter is loud as hell...This \"thing\" is completely silent.\" (i then realized that the windows were locked so i asked my dad to unlock the windows) we rolled down the windows to listen & there was nothing, not a single sound but this thing was now right in front of us! it's about as high as a 2 story house & a little smaller than a house & about as far in front of us as a few car lengths. still......We can not see a thing except the lights that make up a triangle but could tell that the front of it was tilted down at us. the lights were not bright but there were different colors, i can't remember what colors but i do know there was a red one. meanwhile my mom is yelling at my dad to turn the car around & go down some driveway....As my dad turned the car i scrambled to the way-back to look out the back window & did not blink as i might miss something & i wanted to keep a fixed eye on it, i wanted to just stop everything & watch what i was a part of. as soon as i turned my head to look from the front windshield to the side window to the back window.....It was gone. completely disappeared. not a sound, not a breeze, not anything. just gone. we found the shelter & pulled in to park. my mom asked my dad to help her get the stuff & he looked at my son & said \"there's no way i'm getting out of the car!\" so my mom got out herself & started walking in. i said \"you can't let mom go out there by herself! i'm going with her!\" & i quickly ran to catch up to her. my dad said \"i'm not staying in the car alone!\" & he & my son ran inside...They practically ran me over. \r\nmy dad was in the air force & he says he's never seen anything like that before & has never heard of anything in the military like it either. my mom refuses to talk about that night & my dad doesn't either. it's kind of hard to say that we saw something but it was invisible without sounding really crazy but that's what we saw.\r\nme, coming from a career in optics tried to contemplate the idea for a few years (before giving up on the idea) that we put anti-reflective coatings on eyeglasses to eliminate glare & make glasses look \"invisible\" every day. maybe the military has a new high tech type of coating that they can apply to aircraft to make like an \"invisible & mirrored\" coating to camouflage. kind of like a movie screen where what we would normally see on the other side of the craft is somehow projected onto the side that we do see so that it seems invisible? but that does not explain the speed at which it was upon us nor the complete lack of any sound or air movement from it. the speed itself was like it was on us before i even had the chance to complete my thought. i just haven't been able to find any reports of any other sightings of anything like this. also the fact that it knew that we saw it from about 15 miles away & zeroed in on us. how did it hear us? or maybe it didn't \"hear\" us....Maybe it knew our thoughts & was attracted to us by us being attracted to it? i just don't know.","distance":"20 Feet or Less,

out the stars. i noticed, almost directly above me, a very bright orange/red light. i first thought it was the north star, but i realized this was too high from the horizon and somewhat toward the east. then i thought perhaps it was a flare, but living next to a military base, i've seen them let off flares many times. they are never this high in the sky, they are brighter, they fall, and being so close to the base i can see the smoke from them. \r\n\r\n the size and features of the light was just like a star only much brighter, it was certainly the brightest star in the sky. i watched it for about 5 seconds then it just faded away. the fade to gone took about 1-2 seconds. \r\n\r\n  the light never moved. there were clouds in the sky, by none in the area where i saw the light. i went back out a few minutes later, then 30 minutes later, then 1 hour later and it didn't appear

this event i was able to call my coworker and have them come outside and have a look. the coworker i called tonight actually witnessed the same sighting i had last fall, in a diferent part of the small city we're in. the event in the fall happened pretty much like tonight.\r\ni work as a nightwatchman at a facility that is more or less on the edge of town. residential area on three sides, a hospital and beyond the hospital are fields. \r\nthe area is sparsely lit but ther are street lights and the buildinds are fairly well lit. \r\nso im doing my rounds in vehicle. i come off the the city street onto the property. my vehicle is now pointed east, i notice the light in the sky. and think briefly\" oh the globes again\" still not sure till i see the other three. this time there are four of them and not in the same formation.\r\ni stop and call my coworker on the work phone and ask if he wants to see these things. he obliges. i had been feeling a little sickly earlier. sweats/chills. the adrenalin made the feeling go away briefly. \r\ni start heading toward the office were my coworker is at. i drive a little ways stop and decide to try take a video with my iphone 4. got out of the vehicle . again ,no such luck. too much light from the building and light standard nearby. about 2 minutes have pass at this point. also one of the objects. are north of me at this point. the lead one .They are skimming beneath the clouds . one seems to be changing to a white color as it disappears into the cloud. the others trailing do not change color as they also disappear into the clouds at different points. i go back to the office were my coworker is at to find him out behind the building watching the northern sky. he says he saw three. about four or five minutes had passed at this point. i was feeling like i had earlier. \r\nthey moved east to northwest. hard to tell how fast the were moving maybe a little faster than a small plane or a helicopter. i dont really understand why i felt the way i did i figured i would be more excited to witness such a thing. i do get a little intriuged. been a sci fan fan for as long as i can remember, discovered coast to coast , the radio show, a few summers back and have heard one of your associate on the program. recently i had heard him discussing the orange globes on the eastern seaboard somwhere. \r\nafter i talked with my coworker i told him i was also feeling a bit sickly and would be going home if the feeling didnt pass. i left work at midnight and have been thinking about it since. i texted my brother and cousin to tell them what i saw.\r\nback in the fall(2013) i had witnessed pretty much the same thing the same way except i was  at the office , or about to go into it, looking north. northeast, five globes in a w formation headed southeast , called my coworker outside to have a look. sighting had taken place over a space of four to 5 minutes. happend about the same time 10:30 ish . a few weeks before the snow came. tried to take a pic or vid, too much light around me\r\nthe first time. i had seen just one. and as i recall that one seemed to be flying too slow to be a plane , plus no blinking lights. and no sound or trail of any sort. this was about a year and a half ago.\r\ni googled \"orange globes\". the event from belgium dated dec 24 2013 seems to be what i saw, except not as many or that long.Thank you.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

cigarrette. we sat down at a picnic table and began to converse. i spotted a strange looking light appear about 70 ft above us and behind him. the courtyard is rectangular and completly surrounded by two story apartments with a lawn approx. 100ft across. the object was a burnt orange hue ommiting a lighter fiery orange pulsating dome-like shape. this \"dome\" seemed fluid and appeared translusent. the object moved slowly and was low enough to clearly come to the quick educated assesment that it was not a plane, helicopter or drone. the object was completly silent and moved in a straight line from east to west towards the full moon. when the object approached a low whispy cloud, which you could clearly see the moon through, it accelerated and vanished. while viewing this phenomona my friend was trying to get a picture or footage with his smart phone but it mysteriously shut off. he claims his phone had never shut down spontaniously before and it had over half a charge left. when we got the phone to turn back on we looked to see if any photos took and one did, but the orb was too far away to get a clear image. approximatly 5 minutes after this occurance a plane appeared comming from the se which is the direction of the hickory regional airport. seeing the plane so soon after the sighting was great to compare how dissimilar the two objects were. soon after i looked up \"orange orb\" on google and found many youtube videos with similar if not exactly the same type of object my friend and i witnessed.\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, Over 1
