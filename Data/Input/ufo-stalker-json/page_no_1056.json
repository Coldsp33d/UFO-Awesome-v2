terrace looking at the sky. there were some swallows flying in the summer sky and a hawk interested at them. the sky was clean and azure, except for a low soft cloud of some kilometers wide; height no more than a thousand meters from the ground. the sun was almost covered at the border of that cloud, so i could watch the sky and the hunt made by the hawk.\r\n\r\nsuddenly, i seemed to have seen a metallic reflection near the cloud. so i watched better at the sky, but i saw just a plane passing and the sun-white reflection on it. i thought it was that. but then i saw again another reflection near the cloud out of the corner of my eyes. so i began to gaze upon the cloud and after few seconds i saw a grey-steel metallic disk with a sphere inside of it, that classic ufo shape. that thing was visible for less than two seconds each time, was hovering like mad just below the cloud, performing curves similar to the boomerang path. each time the object exited from the shadow under the cloud, i could see it for 1.5/2 seconds. out of the shadow cloud the sun was reflected on it like in a common airplane. that white  reflected on metallic surface. so i saw his crazy curved direction for a couple of second then became completely invisible, and some seconds after i saw it exited in another point of the cloud. and so on for almost 5 minutes. ufo was running around madly under that cloud, and even itself was rotating. because was too fast and unpredictable, at a certain time i focused only on a side of the cloud so to see it clearly when passed.\r\n\r\ni was very impressed by its form, its agility and speed. it was totally out of place, nothing of natural, nothing of human. it seemed fake to my eyes because i had ever experienced under the sun such a strange thing. a perfect sphere dressed in a perfect disk. elegant, amazing, charming, but in some way even terrible and wrong. i felt strange because of the implications of it on my life. i saw it clearly at least 4 times, and more than 10 out of the eyes corner. after almost 5 minutes, i stopped to see it. \r\n\r\nthe way in which ufo became totally invisible let me with no words. simply invisible from a moment to the next. and i wonder why each time the direct light of the sun hit the ufo, it became visible for a couple of second. honestly now i saw clearly that they are here, but that invisibility can make me paranoid soon.\r\n\r\nwhat is interesting is that even the hawk saw the ufo. near the beginnig, the hawk forgot about the swallows and went toward the cloud, flying always higher. when the hawk reached the border of the cloud remained stop up there for twenty seconds, that is, until the ufo appeared again from the cloud. after that, the hawk went down.\r\n\r\ngreetings.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"    i was standing at the back door of my home, smoking a cigarette. the door faces roughly sse into the back garden.\r\n    i noticed a series of what i deduced to be five lights in the se moving from left to right. my view was partially obstructed by a tree, so i had to observe these over roughly one minute and move from side to side to get a better view at first. then as most of the objects moved past the tree i could see them clearly.\r\n    as i saw the first light i thought of an aircraft, but then realised this was not a usual aeroplane or helicopter. the light was solid and single ��� there was no variance in colour, nor was there any appearance of flashing, both of which i would associate with an aircraft.\r\n    i then realised that there was more than one light and counted five. all appeared to be of the same colour and all were moving from left to right from my vantage point, which i assumed was consistent with objects floating in the wind, which immediately made me think of chinese lanterns.\r\n    i have observed these objects before however, indeed i have used them myself and these did not appear consistent with my previous observations.\r\n    firstly the lights were constant ��� there was no flickering such as you would get with the flame burning under a chinese lantern. this was the case until the objects faded from view in the sky.\r\n    secondly, they were a pink/rose colour, not the usual orange/red i would associate with the flame on a lantern.\r\n    thirdly, these objects did not look like they were drifting. they were moving quite quickly, quicker certainly than a typical jet-liner would move, although slower than a fighter jet.\r\n    unlike a military or civil jet however, there was no noise, and i did listen for some. with five objects moving at once the cumulative noise should have been detectable at least, and considering the late hour of the sighting i do not believe the military would be flying jets this close to a town.\r\n    the elevation of the objects was not the same, as if they were moving in line astern. their elevations varied from maybe thirty to forty degrees between them.\r\n    as the objects moved directly in front of me (more or less to the south), they started to ���go out���. this at least would be consistent with a chinese lantern, although it did not look like a flame guttering. they simply dimmed from sight.\r\n    at least one, possibly two had disappeared when i saw a sixth light moving into my field of vision from the w, which was white and slightly brighter than the others.\r\n    this last light was to the south of me by some distance and at an apparent elevation of thirty five to forty degrees also. i believe its trajectory was from nw to sse. possibly my angle was confused however, as i���m reasoning it might���ve been moving from west to east, which would of course be consistent with some man-made orbital objects.\r\n    however, this was a very bright object: brighter than any satellite i���ve ever seen. i don���t believe i���ve seen the iss as bright as this either. a cursory check of internet sources appears to show that the iss was currently over the southern indian ocean in any case, closer to australia than it is to england, which if correct would rule it out as an explanation.\r\n    i can say that it was brighter than sirius and brighter than most manifestations of the planet venus, barring a direct opposition to earth.\r\n    i can say with total certainty that its apparent magnitude was below zero. \r\n    this object traveled some way in a sw direction, ending up more or less directly to the s of me before it faded out. (in a manner consistent with the way satellites would fade.)\r\n    by the time it faded out most of the pink coloured lights had also gone. at most only one or two were left and these faded out too, leaving the entire incident with an estimated duration of approximately two to three minutes.\r\n    at the time i realised that these lights didn���t appear to be aircraft, satellites or chinese lanterns, i did call inside the house to try and get my parents and girlfriend to come out and see, however, none of them did.\r\n    unfortunately i had no devices to hand which i could have recorded the incident with.\r\n\r\n    i would like to request that whichever fi is assigned to this case that denise stoner be allowed a copy of this report and subsequent investigation data, as i have had dealings with this lady before and she holds a large amount of data on file about me. (she has been my fi with regards to a number of abduction incidents in my life.)\r\n","distance":"Over One

was going to sleep late at night, passing near a window i saw a weird light in the horizon east. the light was really far and was too near to the ground and too bright for a star. so i waited almost 5 minutes watching at her to understand if it was moving or not. it was lower than the height of a mountain range in the horizon of which the height is 2100 meters. after that, i began to see the light clearly moving toward me, following the side of the mountain. \r\n\r\nin a couple of minutes that strong light was near enough to see that was an airplane. it flew low and slow, i heard the swish of the air and just a really soft sound of engine. not common. it had a blue light on the edge of a wing and a red on the other, whereas an airliner here has a green one and red one. then another double whit light flashing in the middle, and the strong light i saw in the horizon was what in a common airliner is called \"taxi light\" that is a beam of light used to land. the fact is that it was not a commercial airliner. it was incredibly huge and of the shape of a bat, with the wings that are curved toward in front (the opposite of a normal plane). the wings were enormous compared to the central part of it. the picture of a bat with open wings, that was the contour. at the end of the wings and near the center of it there was a some kind of missiles shapes.\r\n\r\nmy feeling was that i was seeing some kind of secret military vechicle, because following the direction where he came there's the biggest italian military base for the aviation (publicly known, north of a city called treviso) and the direction where he was going was the high part of the garda lake, where there are a strong military presence. i thought that it had some kind of trouble; i even thought that it was crashing because was really low and had that \"light of landing.\" it was lower than the height of the mountains in front of me, so less than 2100 meters, almost 1500 meters i presume. it was so low that the lights of the villages and roads below, together with his own lights, allowed me to see him clearly, his shapes, those kind of missiles, grey color. i supposed that his owner had tried to mask the plane with those light, because i do not see the reason why a secret aircraft must have lights like all the other airplane, even if a little bit different. but with those lights, if that plane had been high in the sky nobody would notice it mistaking it for a common one. another thing i noticed is that there were no other planes in the sky while the aircraft was passing. the only airplanes that i saw were incredible far in the horizon and changed trajectory, this is never happened before. only after, i saw planes return as usual. this made me think again to a military approach. \r\n\r\nso, there was the biggest human flying vehicle i've seen in my life upon my head, really low flight, really low sound (the sound of air he was moving was stronger than the sound of his engine). seemed strange, i feared it would have crashed on another mountain in his path or on the ground. then came a ufo and everything found a sense.\r\n\r\ni heard as an impact on the air, like sonic boom, and in the same time i saw a white flash that lighted the air in the direction of the sound. like the flash of a thunder, but without a thunder, and the sound was far, not so strong. i saw a dark object, too high to see a real shape. didn't seem big and in some way it was a compact object as a sphere, but i said was too far. that ufo was exactly in the path of the other aircraft, higher but really near. what made me mad is that the giant bat plane did not go away, but went suddenly toward the ufo, going upward. the ufo remained in the position for just few seconds and went away in up at the same point from which it came. again a far sonic boom, a white flash. ufo remained for not more than four seconds in total, from the first flash to the second. it went away out of the corner of my eye because i was watching the reaction of the aircraft. so the military aircraft went down again as before, made a great curve that i didn't understand why. here, that airplane was passing above my home. i went in a window to the other side of the home just in time to see the airplane disappear beyond the mountain horizon toward west. after few minutes i saw common airliners return.\r\n\r\ngreetings.\r\n","distance":"Over One

have experienced sleep paralysis on average 2 times per week since approximately 1994.  i have become accustom as to what to expect with sleep paralysis, what type of entities visit,  and what that particular experience should feel like.  in recent months, the events that occur alongside with sleep paralysis have been different and i feel it is of extra-terrestrial nature.\r\n\r\nalthough i have had several experiences that i associate with extra-terrestrial occurrences throughout the nights, i will detail the most recent experience, which happened on march 22, 2014 around 2am.\r\n\r\ni was falling asleep and sleep paralysis occurred.  but something was different this time. usually my eyes are open, and i wiggle my big toe, the entities go away (if any are present), and i wake up easily. the entities usually either are at the side of my bed ready to attack me, or just provide an evil presence at the door or at the head of my bed where i cannot visually see the entity.  \r\n\r\nthis time the experience was different.  i was laying on my back with my eyes closed (my eyes are usually easily kept open).  i started to wiggle my toe to wake myself up - but i didn't wake up. i realized my eyes were closed - so i opened them.  my eyes were unusually heavy, and it was a struggle to keep them open. \r\n\r\nat the foot of my bed there was an entity (usually the entities are, as mentioned above, not at that location).The entity was wearing a dark cloak which covered its face. it was approximately 5 feet tall. the skin was of darker shade and darker eyes.  \r\n\r\nusually with sleep paralysis i do hear sounds (for example, footsteps, papers shuffling, voices, etc.).  this particular occurs had no sound whatsoever. no sounds from the entity, and no sounds from the light orb which i will now describe before i describe more detailed events of the entity.  \r\n\r\nas the entity stood at the foot of my bed staring at me, i noticed a light orb at the intersection of my ceiling and door.  my eyes were still heavy and it was a struggle to keep them open.  the light orb was made up of about 20 small balls of light about the size of marbles. i \"think\" they were white, yellow, and blue.  the light orb hovered silently. it glowed. it was beautiful.\r\n\r\nmy blankets hovered off my body with the entity still at the foot of my bed. at this point i start to think that there are so many things different with this experience than what i am accustomed to.  the sense of evil presence was not there (whereas with sleep paralysis it always is there)- it was a rather unique experience. i was not afraid. my body began to hover about 2 feet off of the bed. i \"think\" my body made 2-3 spins in the air (in the motion a ceiling fan would).  at this time i am hovering at my window.  i remember my bedroom looking rather long and narrow than what it is supposed to look like.  the entity is closer to me now but not touching me. but there is a struggle of some sort at the window - not a struggle with me, as i was paralyzed from the start of the experience , but a struggle with the process. my eyes got so heavy i could not keep them open. that is all that i remember. i would love to know what happened next - i woke up in my bed, with my blankets off.  this is strange, as i am a person that even in the heat of the summer, i always feel that i need to have many blankets on me - and the blankets tend to always stay on me. this time, again, was different.\r\n\r\ni did a watercolour painting of this experience. i will include if requested, however have not included it in this report.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

was spring and i was smoking a cigarette on the balcony of my home, near evening, before dinner, as usual. i observe the sky since always, because i love clouds and stars, so i was simply thinking, contemplating the firsts stars that come after the sunset. that day there was a low soft cloud in the sky that was moving fast, pushed by the wind. when the cloud disappeared, i saw some stars, but between them was one different.\r\n\r\ni noticed a bright dot white/gold/yellow in the sky, really similar a star, but i had never seen a similar star in that point of the sky. it was too vivid, clear, lively. so i waited a couple of minute, watching that occurrence and lighting another cigarette. during those two minutes, the light seemed moving toward the earth, that is, it seemed to become bigger. but until then was just a sensation.\r\n\r\nafter those two minutes, it was clearly becoming bigger. it was getting close to the atmosphere. the first feeling was that a meteor was pointing me, even if it banal, i thought that and i was afraid. then that light drastically enlarged herself in few seconds, as a meteor does when entering completely in the atmosphere and the air attrition burns it in a great light, but it is not so big than that light.\r\n\r\nso in those few seconds, it became from the size of a grain to the size of a globe wide than a half moon. after this it disappeared, without crush, flash or fragments, nor sounds (i live in a quite silent mountains region). it simply disappeared after being expanded.\r\n\r\nso, for two minutes i observed a dot wide as a star in the sky, then for near thirty seconds it expanded until the size of a small grain, then in five seconds that thing became big as a little moon. then disappeared.\r\n\r\ni started to feel that something was not ordinary when i saw happening again the same equal event, no more than forty seconds after the first. in the same exact way, in the same exact point of the sky, same direction. i felt as i had a dejavu. that dot in the sky was up there again, like the first, and did the same. i understood i wasn't so unlucky to see two meteors that mechanically pointed me, but it was something else, not natural.\r\n\r\nthe day after, at the same hour, all of this started again but with three differences: a) this time were three lights (or bright objects i cannot know). b) i saw this occurance from the beginning: i saw the first dot appears slowly in the sky beetween stars from nothing and the rest was the same of the day before. c) was in another position of the sky: a little bit right than the day before and the direction was no more directly toward me but a little bit off-axis compared to my position. i could observe this clearly when they became greater, and so, nearer. they had an almost lateral direction compared to me, so in the last part of their journey became clear they didn't point toward me. thanks to this, i saw they were not perfectly round lights and i'm not sure if inside that lights i saw something of grey, because when nearer and greater they were really radiant and i was not able to watch directly to them. then, the window of \"near observation\" lasted not enough seconds.\r\n\r\ni didn't see other for some days, but near five days after i saw another one. this time i was late and i saw only one that was already enlarging himself. and there were thick clouds this time. the light/object was in another part of the sky on the right and again with another angle of direction compared to the horizon.\r\n\r\nin the end, the first event had presented an angle of descent between 45 and 55 degrees respect to the horizon, the second near 60 and the third almost 70. the events were each time more to the right and in some way farther in relation to longitude. looking at them i was looking in the west horizon. those things disappeared at a height of more than 5000 meters. (first event cloud's height near 3000 meters, third event cloud's height 4000 meters. they disapperad above the clouds height. pretty sure of this, in the first and second event they were not covered by clouds.)\r\n\r\nat that time, i was a little bit shocked from all of this. because no natural phenomenon acts in that way. a meteor swarm entering in the atmosphere breaks in a lot of pieces, produces a sound similar to the sonic boom of a jet plane, and of course does not follow an exact rythm of entry: one by one in a row, at the same distant, with regular intervals. then meteors emit lights only for the friction in the atmosphere and are not visible before, so we should talk about a unique swarm of comets that is hard to think and never been spotted.\r\n\r\nanyway, i observed that the apparent different directions and positions were not by chance. they followed the movement of the planet. in other words, if we were on a space vehicle that is \"parked\" in a certain position of the solar system, remaining stopped we should see the planets move slowly and round. from there, if we shot an arrow each day at the same hour aiming to a certain coordinate of the solar system, presuming that in that moment in that coordinate there is the earth, so each day we should hit a different part of the earth accordingly to his rotation and movement. the entries of those lights/object followed this approach. they didn't change their coordinate, it is the planet that was moving.\r\n\r\ni hope all of this helped.\r\ngreetings.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

8 near mccleary, wa between approximately 47.049197, -123.237347 and 47.044459, -123.256487. the event occurred around 11:10pm pst and lasted for approximately 15-20 seconds. \r\n\r\ni was traveling with my mother. she was driving approximately 65 mph; i was in the backseat resting. after turning a corner and entering a dark stretch of road, we both noticed a prominent white light behaving in a strobe-like manner in the car's interior. we assumed that a state patrol officer was pulling us over for speeding, even though the light was just white. as the light continued, we noted that no automobiles were visible from any direction and no sources of light were visible from beyond the trees that line sr 8. the light seemed to move about our vehicle's interior while flashing. it was visible in both the front and rear sections of the car. prior to seeing the light, the car's interior was only illuminated by dashboard controls. after the light stopped, the car's interior illumination returned to baseline. \r\n\r\nafter the light stopped, we slowed the car dramatically to examine our surroundings. we could not detect noise or lights that would commonly be associated with aircraft; we could not discern sources of direct or refracted light from the roadside. weather was slightly overcast yet fair; the moon was covered by clouds and did not provide significant illumination; we did not experience lightning or adverse weather events. we did not have electronics in the car that could have accidentally emitted light: my mother's cellphone was off and my iphone lost its charge about 20 minutes prior to the light. the car functioned perfectly throughout the ordeal and its clock matched my watch with no indication of \"lost time.\"\r\n\r\nafter returning home, we roughly approximated our experience by shining a cellphone flashlight on the roof of the car in the dark and oscillating it quickly. we are considering the possibility that something emitted light onto the roof of our car - from above - during the event.

facing north then before i knew it it was right on top of me to the north a little bit and it was treetop level and i got out of my car and looked up and with in 5 seconds of getting out of my car the 7 light orbs that made up this arrow shaped craft turned 180 degrees facing right at me and i was still in shock at that time i was still watching untill what i thought was some kind of arrow shaped craft made up of the 7 lights broke in to 7 diffrent crafts that went diffrent ways at 1st and i jumped back in my car i stepped on the gas as fast as i could and 1 of the orbs came right up on my left bumper in less then a few seconds and i could see the other 6 lights over the trees to the north on my way in to town i was flying up new valley hill as fast as my car would take me. i had about 2 miles to drive to get to town. the orb fallowing me and the orbs fallowing me and the other orb continued untill i got in to a more populated area where there was meny houses and a trailer park i seen the orv on my left rear bumper shoot off north of the trees and connect with the other 7 orbs and thay went north west as fast as my eyes could fallow. this was the scary'st  thing i have ever
