observed a very fast moving object leaving a very distinct smoke trail traveling accross our line of sight at about 60 degrees above the horizon. the speed the object moved caught our attention and we watched it and could see it reflect light at one point, but we could not see wings or any lights or markings. the reflection suggested the object was bullet shaped -we assumed it was a military jet or something similar because of the very fast speed it was moving - much faster than a passenger jet, which are extremely common in the skies above where we work. just after the point it passed closest to us and began flying away from our point of reference, the object disappeared and the trail came to an abrupt end. although the object was no longer visible and the smoke trail came to an abrupt halt, the remaining trail was still clearly visible and intact along the path the object had traveled prior to disappearing. i took 2 pictures with my cell phone which focus on the point the smoke trail ended. to clarify, there was not a \"trailing off\" of the smoke - it just stopped abruptly as if it had been severed, for lack of a better description. the object did not turn or land and the smoke trail remained in a perfectly straight line, from our vantage point. i would estimate the object to have been flying at about 20,000 feet. i am not able to load the pictures onto this computer,

each other.  i told him cool, but what are you talking to me for take pictures and videos.  his location is around three miles to the east of me so i called up to my wife to come down and bring the binoculars.  about ten minutes after he called we saw a white strobing light pass from east to west.  it looked like a plane until it appeared to back up then go down then go up.  my wife was looking through binoculars while i was attempting to video tape the event.  the first strobing light disappeared and then we noticed several other strobing lights to the east.  it was really hard to tell how many of them because they were moving around quite a bit then they would stay stationary.  i got to see one through binoculars and it was not only strobing white but blue and yellow as well.  i gave the binoculars back to my wife and attempted to film it again.  my iphone 4s then went dead for some reason.  i thought the battery was dead but when i plugged it in it came back to life with 30 percent power.  could be coincedence.  unfortunately, the lights were not bright enough for me to videotape.  after my phone died i noticed a plane heading straight for the strobing lights.  my wife said they just stopped when the plane got near.  meanwhile, my nephew had taken my advice and snapped a couple of pictures which clearly show triangular objects.  a couple of days later i was able to interview him and my son.  my ten year old was brief saying yeah we saw some weird lights in the sky one disappeared then they all dissappeared.  my 17 year old nephew however was very informative.  he said that there were originally three seperate craft circling around each other.  he also stated that they were very high up and that one disappeared before the others.  he was able to get a picture of two of the ufo's but did not realize that they were triangular until i enlarged it and sent it back to him. about 30 minutes after the event we noticed a helicopter with a search light in the area, but that could be another coincidence.  i put the original photos back in so you will have to enlarge it to see the three lights and triangle shape.","distance":"Over One

to see if it was on the picture before and the picture after and it wasn't.\r\ni had sat very still and held the camera as it clicked away continuously.  it had to be something in the sky that was picked up in that split second as it wasn't anything i could see with my own eye.  obviously it was moving at a rate of speed that only a camera would pick up.\r\ni am attaching 3 pictures that were taken in approximately 2 seconds. the one before the white circle, the one with the white circle and the one that came after the white circle.\r\ni will also add 3 that are cropped to the show the

20,000 mph.\r\nall i know is my camera showed it there one second and not the next.\r\nmy feelings about this?  excited.\r\nthe last time i saw anything was in the late 70's and it was a distant
