\r\nour tv faced south, on the side of the driveway which had no roof at the time.  no cop cars passed our streets nor no one was there.  the unusual characteristic of these reflections was that all colors flashed independently from each other but from one point, from what i remember.  it appear to hit the middle of the window pane and colors spread to each individual colors (white, red/orange, bluish/green.\r\n\r\nthat's late night a flash of multi-colors reflected off our living room window panes.  in my home, no glass is used in the windows, so the light reflected off the white window metallic panes into our living room and into our eyes.  the colors appears to separate like a rainbow.  we heard a swish sound.  the object seems to appear over our house and traveling across from street to back yard or going east. we used to have the door open to the street so we ran outside to see what it was but it must have been pretty low because under the clear night, we didn't see anything in the sky, however, i called my grandmother who live east of where we lived and we asked her if she saw something that night in the sky and she exclaimed she did.  but when i asked what she saw, she didn't want to speak about it.\r\n\r\nmy entire family experienced this event.  it was something i cannot forget.  i did not speak about this till i was in my late 20's and i asked my mom if it was a dream or reality.  she remembered that day and that confirmed that our experience was real.\r\n\r\ni was always searching for anyone else who might have seen it or at least an even during that time, but i have not yet.  hopefully i find it here at your site.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

house when something flew by from the north very high up in the sky to the south and caught my attention. i stood up and looked over my house when something extremely bright to the east way far away  and way high up in the sky shot a beam like a laser and hurt my eyes. this larger bright orb seemed to have somewhat sent three orbs to the west which by then was over my house straight up and a little to the east. two of them did a right angle turn and then went straight up out of sight while the third orb did a left angle sharp turn and seemed to have traveled several miles to the north and instantly turned the opposite direction which was to the south in just seconds and disappeared. i ran in the house to get my camera to take a photo of this event. i was  absolutely terrified. when i came out the back door of my shop there was two more very bright orbs coming from the east and i started taking pictures of these two orbs. they went straight up into the sky where i could not see them anymore when another group of very bright orbs, 16 of them, were maneuvering in different patterns and configurations to the west in what seemed to be a straight line doing stunts i have never in my life seen like this. i don't really know how long i was taking pictures of these orbs. i just know i kept on taking pictures until this group of 16 orbs finally went over my house to the west where i could not see them anymore because the sun was to the west over my roof. all of these orbs were the same size except the large one in the beginning of this event. at times they would turn the color blue just like the color of the sky that day. note, there are not any clouds at all and then they would turn very bright like shiny stars again. the photos i'm allowed to send to you are some of the best of 42 photos i took that day. i would say they were flying 30,000 to 50,000 feet in the air. there were not any contrails of any kind and there was no sound of any kind. i showed my wife these photos that day when she came from work but i'm afraid to talk to anyone about this because it will completely destroy my credibility and reputation. i play music in public for a living and this would i'm sure end my public life. i have tried to show some of these pictures to family members and they think i'm a lunatic of which i am not! i have real bad insomnia since that time and i just can't stop having nightmares night after night after night! please try at least to help me to understand what i'm going through. i did not want to take these photos and story to the government because it would most definitely ruin me. i am not crazy. thank you for at least seeing my photos and hearing my story. i have nothing to gain and everything to lose.  thank you for your time on this

meeting him and another friend and i and him arrived first at the entrance of a cove in a neighborhood located less than a quarter of a mile from highway 64 and houston levee road. we were facing each other talking waiting on the third friend ,who lived in the cove, to come outside. he was in the middle of saying something when i noticed an aircraft headed our direction behind him. i cut him off and said, \"look at this helicopter coming\" as i noticed it was very low and headed right for us. he said, \"thats not a helicopter.\" as it approached very close. it soon became apparent that this was a massive triangle with bright white lights. one on each tip making three lights and a light in the middle of the object. it was so low to the ground and moving so slow i could have picked up a rock and hit it. i would estimate it traveling at around 5 mph with a powerful humming/vibration sound or feeling eminating from it. we were both awe struck and just started running back to our houses as fast as we could. it was just known to run and tell someone at home. i ran inside and upstairs to my moms bathroom were she was takin a bath and started telling her through the door what we had seen. she broke into what i was saying and asked if thats why the walls were vibrating and she heard a strange humming noise. the path that the object was taking was straight as can be and went directly over my house. i said yea. the next day people from around our area of shelby co. were calling into radio stations to report the same sighting. later on in life..Maybe 2 or 3 years (im 26 now) i learned of the events in belgium and the events in illinois of reports of a triangle shaped ufo, some people who said they saw it were military personel and police. the object photographed in the belgium case in the i think early 90's is exactly what we saw and i feel a sense of pride knowing i saw this same object very very close and at an extremely slow rate of speed. almost as if it didnt care. thinking back ( it is very vivid) i saw no means of propulsion only a humming noise. it was massive and was directly above us. very intimidating and instantly when its close enough to be seen one knows immediantly it is something very diffrent. i have felt a sense of enlightenment since. that was eleven years ago and i haven't seen anything else odd execept for a cylinder shaped very large craft moving very very fast at a really high altitude. that was about 3 years ago. i cant help but feel that this was a special moment i will remember forever becuase i no longer question ufos

front of the mailboxes and gas tanks/lines, waiting for the school bus. while looking east down the road in the direction the bus would come, i noticed a silvery, metallic, pill shaped object  <1/4 mile down the road, north east of my position, at an ~45 degree angle above the horizon with the apparent size of a dime or penny and with what looked like black square panels/windows all around the middle, with something like a heat haze shimmer around it, travelling very slowly, almost hovering, in a south westerly direction crossing at <45 degree angle the road which runs east - west. i had no idea what it was, but was young and curious, as i always enjoyed watching the hueys that would fly overhead all the time back then. however i knew that the object was not a normal aircraft as it had no wings or tail and was moving way too slowly, and it was not a helicopter as it had no rotors and did not make any noise at all. over the course of the next ~3 to 5 minutes i watched it in stunned silence until it disappeared behind the tree line on the hill <1/8 mile due south of where i was standing. it did not reemerge from the tree line on the other side where i expected to see it and either landed, stopped/hovered, changed course to the south, or something while it was out of sight behind the trees/hill. i noticed on the satellite map that i did the sketch on for this report that there is, or at least was when the satellite photo was taken, a round depression ~100feet/200feet in diameter in the ground in a field behind the tree line on the hill right about where i would have lost sight of the object, i have never been to that depression to the best of my recollection, especially since i didn't know it was even there till just a few minutes ago when i went to make the map and saw it on the satellite image ... i am still shocked that it was right where the object would have been when i lost sight of it. i do not know if it would still be there today, since i don't know when the satellite image was taken. i wanted to go up the hill and see if i could see anything, but i knew the bus was coming and stayed put. i never mentioned this object to the bus driver who came a few minutes later, nor to my teacher, parents, or sister. in fact i never mentioned the object to anyone, although my family is aware of my encounter later that day with the ape-man like entity. i could clearly see the object which the upper and lower domed surfaces were silvery grey metallic with the center diameter composed of flat glossy black panels/windows, there was a suggestion of a clear dome on the top and/or bottom, though my angle nor the lighting was good enough to be certain, and it had no navigation lights that i could see, or would expect on an aircraft or helicopter. ~12 hours later that evening ~7:00pm i spotted a large, ape-man-like, reddish-brown fur covered entity, ~7foot/9foot tall judging by the size of the ~10foot/12foot tall tree next to it (which i estimate based on the size of the nearby excavator crane cab door height), standing upright ~200feet/300feet away from me on the ridge of the strip-mine above our house (<1/8 mile north west of my early morning sighting location) watching me while i was putting my bicycle away. when it saw me staring at it, it grabbed the tree next to it with one hand and bent it over. seeing that, i dropped my bike and ran into the house, i told my parents, but my dad made me go back outside and finish putting my bike away :/ when i went back outside, the creature/entity was nowhere to be seen. i have been attending the mufon gatherings with my father-in-law (who is a member) for the past few years (in fact i was just at one last saturday), where i discovered that there are field investigators and a website for reporting. i am now retired (22 years) from the us navy as of february 2009, and do not see the harm in reporting it at this point. i am oddly still drawn to that area after ~38 years, although i only lived there a few years, and i hope that it might be able to help the field investigators with their research. please see the attached sketches/map and excuse my poor rendering skills. if any of the mufon field investigators are interested, i would be happy to show them the location.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

plane or helicopter. i have no idea what it was. the black part that appears on it looked like a band or stripe to me but honestly it was hard to tell. i did not see it land, i only saw it change directions end over end after the initial hovering. nothing came out of it that i saw. it moved very slowly but in ways that i've never seen an air object move ( appearing to turn itself end over end, front over bottom - like a sommersault).","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

it and we were on the roof and in the window working on it.\r\n\r\n we were facing north and we saw a craft about 10 feet in diameter hovering over trees about 200 feet from us. the one thing i remember most is how we could see heat waves coming off the bottom of the craft. it appeared to be very, very, hot on the bottom which was copper color and the top part of the craft was chrome colored. the object just hovered about 10 feet above the trees for a couple of minutes. my friend looked at me and said, \"what the hell is that the second coming?\"\r\n\r\nmy friend is now deceased so i can't ask him anything about what he saw. however, i do remember we were both very frighten about seeing it. then the craft took off to the east very slowly and appeared to be landing in the woods about 200-300 feet away. \r\n\r\nwe were unable to see if it actually landed because of the trees but we did not see it leave either. we soon finished up our work and went down stairs to the living room and started talking about what we had seen. i left to go home about 20 minutes after seeing the craft. \r\n\r\n my friend ask me to drive over to were thought it landed on my way home. i did drive by the woods and saw nothing. i was still so shook up over seeing this craft and i had a terrible fear of getting close to it, it was an strange feeling i had. this all happened at twilight so it was getting dark when we spotted the craft but still light enough to see it well.","distance":"101-500

of a business where a fundraiser car wash and bbq was taking place. several bands were playing during the day. it was very hot with direct sun over head. most of us were against a wall that provided a small amount of shade. while watching a band playing to my right i noticed several objects (7) rising above the buildings roof. they looked like pearls, slightly elongated at the bottom. the tops were clearly solid and pearly colored silver grey and like a hard surface. the bottom looked slightly darker grey and unusual. they rose slowly a little uneven but overall at the same rate. i watched them for several moments but they didnt seem to be moving. so i watched the band for a couple moments and looked again and they had changed their positions. some at the same place some had risen to make a zig zag dot pattern. i looked at them more closely. they were not moving but had moved. they still looked the same a pearl white on top then a bit of silver grey on the sides and then turning darker grey for the final third of the bottom. i began to seriously think what could they be? i was analizing everything i felt they could be. balloons? no too stationary even though some had changed position some didnt if balloons they would floated away or all risen together they were pretty much evenly spaced and not moving. another song started so i watched for a couple minutes more and when i looked again they had risen higher some lower than the others some much higher still evenly spaced. the pattern looked something like the little dipper. they were not moving but moved when my attention was diverted. i looked away again after a minute or two and looked back and now they had changed again to a bigger formation like the big dipper( im no expert on the dippers but thats what they looked like to me) i had my phone with me for once but with no sd card for it my memory was full. so i had to delete two pics to free up the space. i took the two pics and went back to watching the show after a minute or two more i looked again and they were gone. i stepped out into the drive way and could see a 360 field of view . they were instantly gone from the entire sky. interesting to note that the photos show roundish white puffy cloud like objects and a strange black object that was not visible to the eye   ","distance":"501 Feet - 1
