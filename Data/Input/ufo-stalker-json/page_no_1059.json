the room was very quiet, so no sound woke me. i was lying on my back and i turned my head to look at the clock and it said 5:30 am and i remember thinking , that i had just 1 more hour to sleep until i had to get up for work. then while my head was still turned i noticed this fairly large irregular 3 dimensional shape on the wall behind my alarm clock, it was pulsating with red turning to orange and then yellow continuously without any sound, i was scared but fascinated and as i tried to move i couln't i was immobile, and then i felt this strong presence on my chest, but there was no weight to it, and i tried to turn my head back to see what it could be,  i kept trying , until i finally was able to move my head back but it took a lot of effort. when i finally managed to turn my head back, this is when i saw the entity, it looked right into me, it had large black shiny eyes almost like glass and the skin was a dull matt grey , it looked like clay with folds in the skin, the nose was just two pin holes with a very small mouth, it had a flat expression,  this scared me so much i let out a scream so loud, and the entity then reacted with putting his very long finger on the left side of my temple and a flash of light, like electricity went through my temple and as this happened  the entity disappeared like it never existed. by this time my husband at the time who was sleeping next to me woke up, he heard me scream, and i asked him if he had seen anything or felt  anything and he said no.\r\nthe whole day at work, i was thinking about the experience. i was embarrassed by my experienced that i only told a few close friends and family, but even some were making fun of it. so i did not speak much of it anymore. however ever since i have had that experience, a month later i started getting these terrible headaches. i have been to many specialists and neurologists and brain scans, no one knows why i have these headaches, and 8 years later, i am still with the headaches.

inserted) the witness is a deputy sheriff. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"i saw your report about the 1969 ufo sighting over lake city army ammo plant and decided to talk to someone about it. i must remain anonymous because of my position or i could lose my job. other people have reported similar things and have been transferred or lost their job. what i saw is unexplainable. i work nights and i patrol eastern independence. for a couple of years now i've been seeing strange lights or balls of lights in the trees and along the highways (78 and 7). the lights range from baseball sized to larger than a basketball and are generally white, blue, or orange. at the time of this most recent event i was driving north on highway 7 just past the little blue river when i noticed a small white ball of light and a larger orange fireball to my east (right side) at about 30 yards from my position also moving north at approximately 45 mph. i watched the objects for approximately 10-15 seconds then they moved further east and out of sight. at that point, i noticed a sliver metallic spherical shaped object ne of my position, which would have been near or over the army ammo plant. the object was hovering and spinning and at times looked like a saucer shape, then morphed back to a spherical shape. it began to move very slowly further north for a few more seconds, then stopped. i pulled into the little blue trace park and got out of my vehicle to observe it more closely. the object remained in the area, moving very slowly around in circles and back and forth just above the tree line approximately 300 feet from the ground and perhaps approximately 500 - 1,000 feet away from me,or maybe more. then the object flew away at a high rate of speed to the se at 75 degrees. it appeared to stop and at that point was very small and looked like a large planet. then this object and four others that were already in that position that just looked like stars moved around a little bit and then stopped close together. a small fighter jet came into the area from the east and circled twice in a large circle, then returned in the same direction it came from. i mentioned this to another deputy and he said he had been seeing strange things in the area for years but he didn't tell anyone about it until now. \r\n\r\nnote: this is the same location as the blue springs lights in 2012, a sighting of a sphere ufo in 2013, and the recent 1969 report.

about 11:30 pm and was on my normal route of trails and back roads.  i pulled onto south airport road shortly after midnight heading south, started going through the gears and noticed to my left something with multicolored lights just above the tree line hovering there.  i stopped just about a 1/4 of a mile down airport road and was watching this object just floating there in the corner of the potato field.  as i was watching this thing wondering what it was and then all of a sudden it was directly over top of me, in a instant.  i was round in shape, bright multicolored lights on the perimeter, dark on the bottom and the lights inside of the object were like dash lights shining but much brighter.  the windows appeared to go around the object but not totally sure about that.  the size was about 50-75 feet across but this is a guess.  i was looking inside to see if i could see any thing inside but could not.  all this happened with in about 3-5 minutes time.  as i was starring at this object in amazement and wondering what it was, all of a sudden i realized it was not a normal craft that i knew of, it made no sound that i could tell but my dirt bike was still running, the craft was just floating there, then i got scared and took off on my bike just as fast as i could going through the gears.  i looked back and there it was just above the trees chasing me, i looked back a second time and it was right there, shifted into 6th, looked back and it was gone.  i got home and pulled into the driveway looking but not seeing anything above me, parked my bike went inside and never told anyone about what happened.  i thought if i told of what i had seen or experienced they would think it was a joke or i was crazy.  it was about 20 years or so later that i had finally told my wife about what happened that night.  i still to this day do not know what it was but i remember as if it was yesterday. i will more that likely never forget that night, it was cool and scary at the same time.

it was only slightly more forward, but the center one was ahead of both. i looked carefully for identifying marks, lights, shapes, angles, anything...But the only thing was the length and back-end width and the fact that the three \"corners\" were slightly rounded off, not sharp pointed and the \"black\" color was very dull, not reflective at all of the bright daylight. every other second, fascinated, i continued to watch them and the road. when they were about 68 degrees aloft to me on the left, i glanced at the road and back and they were gone! in a half-second, just gone. not a sound, not a cloud nearby. tiny distant white cloud puffs could not have obscured them. it was that kind of sky. \r\n\r\nthis is my second experience; i would so like to talk with someone about my first. i never wrote this one or the other one down for years, until now. i wrote the other one to my brother and now this one to you. the other one is not believable, or explainable by science as i understand it, but i was there and it happened. i called my son and told him immediately, that time.   \r\n\r\nthanks for this...[name removed/cms/tg].

every since then i have searched for other similar sightings and only a few have come close. i am a believer of god and a believer of intelligent life on other planets, but i just felt god would not allow others to interfere with earth. so this went against my beliefs or did it? to some degree, it has \"jacked\" me up and i want to know the truth about everything. unfortunately, it seems the truth has been hidden very well and what we know and what we think is so far apart. this craft was being operated by someone or something. it wasn't some natural occurrence due to weather or man-made object(in my opinion). i knew when i went inside to tell my wife that i will be looked at liked i lost my marbles...B didn't care...I know what i saw! after telling my wife, she looked at me and said \"i believe you\". how can she? i couldn't believe it myself. i care not who asks me what about what i saw....I will tell them the truth. it was real and i just don't see how this object could carry people or have the power to fly.

white light travelling soundlessly north to south. the light was many times brighter than the surrounding stars, considerably brighter than venus: clearly artificial. no navigation lights were visible. it took approximately a minute and a half to travel from one horizon to the other. i lost sight of it when it reached the southern horizon.\r\n\r\nplanes often travel overhead, but even high altitude planes can be heard, and their navigation lights are usually easily seen. i thought that it may be the international space station. it was much too bright and fast to be a satellite. \r\n\r\ni went back in the house and checked the location of the iss online, but it was currently above the eastern seaboard and not visible from my location. i checked a flight-checker website for planes in the area, but the closest plane was on a different heading,at 36000 feet and approximately 50 kilometers to the north of me, whereas the light vanished to my south. \r\n\r\nit was not consistent with any aerial phenomenon i am familiar with. if it were a plane, it's brightness and speed would suggest a lower altitude, and yet it was utterly silent and i could make out no navigation lights in spite of the fact that i witnessed it in several profiles: approaching me, passing overhead and from the 'rear' as it receded from me.\r\n\r\ni am struck by my inability to clearly identify it. i am unable to even give a 'likely' explanation that fits what i observed.\r\n\r\neric
