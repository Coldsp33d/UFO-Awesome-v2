lake, los angeles. from our street there is a clear view of downtown los angeles, mostly the northern sky scrapers including the newly built wilshire grand center. as i approached the gate to my yard, i noticed two glowing red orbs slowly moving south/ east towards the sky scrapers. at first i assumed they were helicopters, however after a few moments, i saw that there weren't any flashing white lights. i also saw a helicopter in the distance, a little further than the glowing red orbs, giving me a clear comparison between the two objects (i could see the white flashing lights, and body, and could see that the two objects moved in a different manner than the helicopter, more fluidly, although they weren't moving very quickly.) i had seen identical red orbs on the fourth of july, and so after determining they weren't helicopters, i stood there for about a minute to watch them. they seemed to be pulsating slightly in brightness. i was frozen trying to decide weather or not i should run into my house to grab my boyfriend (he has seen similar objects in the sky that he's described as ufos) or if i should stay and watch, worried they would disappear before i could get back outside.\r\n\r\nonce they moved directly over the buildings in downtown, one seemed to slowly fade in brightness before disappearing. i began to turn to walk into my yard, deciding the second would disappear as well, but as soon as i started opening the gate door, three larger, brighter (i'm assuming closer) orbs appeared out of nowhere to the north of downtown. i ran into my house to grab my boyfriend and we both ran up the street to get a better view. \r\n\r\nwe both stood and watched the three orbs slowly move across downtown, not in a straight line, but moving about fluidly like the first two. we watched for about 5 minutes before all three orbs slowly faded in brightness and seemed to vanish directly over the buildings. they did not disappear by moving further away, being covered by the buildings from our vantage point, they disappeared while in clear sight. there wasn't any cloud cover, we could see stars out and actually noted how clear it was. a black car that was parked behind us drove off as soon as they disappeared (not sure if they were watching the event or not) we both walked back into the house after waiting a moment to see if any more would appear. we could hear a couple helicopters fly in the direction of downtown, and continued to after an hour, however it's common for the downtown la area.\r\n\r\nunfortunately, in the excited state i was in, i took a video on instagram and sent it to my sister, forgetting to save the video, and not realizing the video would disappear as soon as she viewed it. she did watch it on while we were standing outside watching the event and agreed it was an incredible thing to see. \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

never seen anything like this. folks the skies here seem to have turned hot for seeing unknown objects in the last 3 weeks. i have no night sky cameras. \r\n\r\nthe first viewing (moving north to south) was a pair of what i thought were satellites, one following another. it was a clear tracking path but at a faster speed that any other i have (satellites) seen before. 5 am.\r\n\r\nat our lake we have not seen satellite prior to these past weeks.\r\n\r\nthe second sighting was to the east of our position. 45.308642 - 93.152487\r\n\r\ni thought it was a very slow moving satellite (168 degrees to south) but then it changed direction 180 degrees to the north. the object changed direction going up and proceeded to do 2 to 3 odd semi circular movements.It then disappeared and in 1 to 4 seconds appeared higher up. this was about 2 am.\r\n\r\ni could clearly see its location because i was framing the object through the branches of one tree.\r\n\r\nat that point i decided to try and film it and ran into my cabin to grab my only camera. that took 2 minutes. when i returned to my deck the ufo was gone. at this point i walked south into a more open sky view.\r\n\r\nwhat i think i saw was possibly another object 198 s. it was doing a similar slow odd tracking movement.\r\n\r\nmost recently 11-6-17, i was stargazing again to the east and heard a large jet (airliner?) and thought saw the jet coming toward me at about 40 to 60 degrees up from the horizon. 160 degrees towards the east. about the speed one would expect an airliner to move but the sound of jet was to the north. the object was moving from east to west. as the jet was coming into view the object abruptly changed direction to the south. the rapidity of the change ruled out any satellite or airplane.\r\n\r\ni

friend a nj mufon field investigator ,(gleen) mention with permission.When i looked up, i couldn't believe it i just finished explaining the day before an ufo sighting.This round circle object was stationary in one spot for the remainder of my walking distance to work. at first i thought it was a planet,then a ballon since this object was very high up in the air,at least 30,000 feet my best guess.It looked white metallic cause it seems very reflective (bright) i figured is not a planet cause its too bright and not a ballon cause is stationary. after few minutes of walking i decided to take a picture of it.Got to my destination and dont know about the object after that. when finished my shift at 3:00 pm came outside looked up again to see it and it was gone. i believe that same day

traveling down the access road of interstate hwy 10 between comfort and boerne, texas when i saw bright lights scanning the ground on a hilltop which i knew to be unoccupied by any residence. i first though it to be kids in 4 wheel drive pickups with bright kc lights on their roll bars, but soon learned otherwise. a large spade shaped craft flew off of the top of the hill and proceeded to follow my car. i went under an underpass to the access road on the other side of ih-10 and the craft followed me. i then drove up a small incline about 1/2 mile to a three way intersection where i stopped my car and got out. my wife was in the car but was scared to get out. i wanted to see what the craft was. the craft circled directly over the top of my car really slow but never stopped completely. i observed the craft in detail and will offer the best explanation that i can. it was very large about the size of 3 football fields, it was probably 300 to 500 feet above me, it had two bright lights on the front that it used to scan the ground on the hilltop. no other lights were present other than a blue glowing triangular platform, that protruded off of the bottom of the craft, and a light propulsion system in the back. the triangular platform looked almost like stair railings made out of florescent bulbs and there were 3 layers from the top to the bottom. imagine 3 bulbs in a triangular shape with 3 layers. this platform was underneath, closest to the rear of the craft. i am not sure if it was used for landing, transporting, or had something to do with the ability to hover. the propulsion system in the rear (at least that what i think it was) used light which got brighter once the craft eventually accelerated away. the rear of the craft had what looked like fins or rudders on a boat in which the light propulsion emitted. the surface of the craft was rough like a rock and it had many surface levels unlike something sheet metal that we would build. it had small windows, but i could not see any occupants. the feeling was as if i was in a stadium of people and i felt the presence of many people aboard the craft. it might sound crazy, but it almost looked like a tour ship of some kind just checking us out. i have tried for years to find a report or photo of a similar craft because i would like to be able to have an artist recreate the scene. if you have any knowledge of this type craft, please let me know----thanks--donald  ","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s), Patterned
