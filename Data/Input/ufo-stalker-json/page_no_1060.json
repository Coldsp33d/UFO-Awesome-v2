of mine.   we were downtown victoria and rode to the roof top of one of the parkades.    if i can remember correctly, it was a summer day and it event took place late in the afternoon or early evening.\r\n\r\nwe were only up there a short time when i noticed a low flying v shaped object.   it was solid black with what appeared to be windows that seemed to be pulsating different colours.  it was travelling slowly in a westerly direction.  it would stopped occasionally to drop orbs of some kind that also flashed different colours of light.\r\n\r\nthese flashing orbs disappeared a short time after leaving the object.  seeing this my brother and my friend quickly rode away leaving me to watch the object.  i managed to see the flying object drop a couple of additional flashing orbs before i had to chase after my brother and my buddy. \r\n\r\nbecause of that i did not get a chance to see where the flying object went to.  to this day i regret not sticking around for a longer time.   i know for a fact that it was (in my terms) a ufo.  since it was flying object and it was unidentified to me, it was and has always been a ufo. \r\n\r\ni recall the my brother and my friend were not comfortable with the object, but as for myself, i was fascinated with the object.  for a long time afterwards, i began researching ufos (and ifos, efos, etc).   \r\n\r\nthis event has been with my for over 40 years and i never thought about telling anyone.   a number of years ago, i asked my brother if he  remembered the event.  he said he vaguely remembers seeing something, but he really can't remember what he saw.\r\n\r\ni have no proof of what i saw, except for the visual images in my head.  therefore, i'm sure that many experts would simply say that i imagined it and my \"dreams\" have now become my reality.  however, i know what i saw and i don't care what anyone else has to say about that. \r\n\r\ni know i should have reported this years ago, but it's only since i've started to watch some of the mufon shows on tv that i thought i should report my old sighting.  \r\n\r\nif the information is too trivial or the information insufficient for your records, i understand.  i simply wanted to let someone other my family to know what i saw and that i'm standing behind what i saw.\r\n\r\nthank you for your time.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

because my dog was whining and i thought he needed to go out.  my son was staring out the screen door and said, \"do you see that\"?  i looked out expecting to see a coyote or similar animal which is common out here(rural area 150 acres).  instead i saw huge bright red lights hovering right above the treeline toward the middle of our mile long gravel driveway (woods on both sides of driveway).  i didn't know what it was, i just knew it shouldn't be there.  we never see anything out here in the middle of nowhere.  i stared in shock before deciding to take a closer look.  i opened the screen door and as soon as i did the lights completely vanished.  just totally disappeared. my son said, \"we need to go inside now\".  i agreed.  \r\n  my son is 24 and does not scare easily.  he was freaked out and will not talk about it at all anymore.  he won't go outside after dark now and pulls all of the curtains closed when the sun goes down.  what he told me before he shut up completely about it was that when he first noticed the lights they were red and blinked rapidly, then they went white and then the shape appeared to be halo graphic. he told me that they turned solid bright red right before i came out. \r\n  since that night my husband and i have both seen increased activity in the sky at night.  there is seldom any kind of air traffic here day or night.  now, nightly there are flashing red lights, bright white balls of light that appear and disappear, red blinking lights that will have a bright white blinking light that follows behind it, and once a round green blinking light hovered in same spot as the first sighting.  most of the lights we see come from a north west direction and go south east then turn and go north. the past few nights when i've been sitting on the porch with my dog (all three times between 10:15 p.M. and 11:00 p.,), my dog will start whining and getting agitated.  he will nudge me and sit by the door to go in the house, and the past two nights he actually started barking.  my dog is a pitbull/boxer mix.  he's very smart, protective and does not bark unless there is something serious enough to bark at.  when he barks, i listen.  \r\n  it took me a while to search anything out about this.  honestly, i was afraid of what i would find out.  i'm having a real hard time living out here now and am noticing more strange things like static on radio, weird clicking noises outside etc.  i might be imagining things due to what we've seen.  but whatever the case may be, i'm not relaxed out here in the country anymore. my anxiety level is through the roof, especially when it gets dark.  i feel like i have to watch the sky at night, but am scared of what i will see.  not sure what i should be doing or not doing. would love to hear i'm imagining things, it's nothing and not to worry about it.  i could really use some help here.\r\n","distance":"101-500

my aim and start focusing a little closer to the horizon. i discovered that when i can catch a ufo just above some roof tops it tends to make the photo a bit more exciting, and also ads an element of context to the picture. i didn't get anything remarkable during my lunch hour last wednesday, but i got some incredible photos during the bus ride home after work.\r\n\r\nwhen taking photos i've been basically just shooting blind. in every case thus far i haven't seen anything other than the normal backdrop, whether it's the sky, clouds, or whatever. then when i get home i download my latest pics and examine my catch, often using filters to make sure i haven't missed anything. well as you'll be able to see, i didn't need filters to reveal these ufos(except just to clarify a weak part of one photo).\r\n\r\nshould also mention that last monday i believe a crab eyes ufo eased up on me at a very low altitude, during the last few minutes of my lunch break, at around 12:30. had been taking photos earlier, and had filled up the internal memory of my camera. after taking my camera back inside i saw i had enough time left for one more smoke. while having my last smoke, a narrow rectangular cloud came sliding along from the southwest and then stopped just short of being directly overhead. there was a lacy sort of cloud ceiling in the sky, at a much higher altitude, and it was barely moving. this rectangular band was the only cloud this low, and moving this deliberately. the cloud was more dense at the outer edges, and thin in the middle, making me suspect it was a crab eyes concealing itself with something akin to cloud blinders. i stood there thinking \"man, you guys sure have some brass to slide up here in broad daylight like this, in the middle of the city\". after finishing my cigarette i waved at them, and then lifted my cup of coffee upwards as a gesture of salute before heading back inside.

before seen anything strange in the sky. right around 4:30am may 6th 2014 i noticed 2 small planes who almost look like they were on a collision course seeming to head into the local johnson county executive airport near my house. one from the west and the other from the south. it caught my eye and seemed odd. two planes so close to each other (from my view at least)seeming to be coming in for landings at the same time was something i had never seen before. slightly above these two planes in the distance a bright light caught my eye. two to three times brighter than a bright star or planet with no blinking lights like on the planes i usually see. the light moved very slow and steady from west to east not covering much distance at all. i wrote down the viewing at around 15 seconds but it had me so mesmerized it had to be 30 or more with time for the planes to clear and the sound from them gone. the light slowed to a stop and disappeared shooting in a different direction to the south so fast with a slight tail like streak and gone. over the next five minutes i saw 2 blinks of light from the area it disappeared in. i went inside to get my phone so i could document the time and came back out. in awe of what i had seen i continued to watch that same area of the sky. at exactly 4:48am in the same small area of the sky i see a similar if not the same bright object moving south to south east. it wasn't moving in a straight flight pattern but not quite zigzagging either. i wrote down viewing time for 12 seconds but once again with my amazement distracting me it could of been closer to 30 moving slow and steady. then the object disappeared is the same area. one blink from the same area a couple minutes later. i was spooked! 5am i came inside and wrote all this down. a full page of descriptions, thoughts, times, etc. i am an amateur astronomer at best but my good friend (who teaches astronomy at a local college)and i have been out many nights a few years back with large telescopes tracking and photographing the moon and various planets. i have seen all kinds of planes (which usually at night you can see their blinking lights even at great altitudes), choppers, blimps, satellites, meteors and it resembled nothing i had ever seen before. no tail except when it disappeared at great rate of speed in a different direction. the light moved abnormally slow and high in the sky way to slow to be a meteorite or a satellite. i did some research the next day and found out that the eta aquarids meteor shower was peaking that night. i am ashamed to say i had never heard of this meteor shower before. i stayed up until 6am the following evening to watch the shower while it was still in its peak and saw many meteors. these meteors all having long tails streaking across the sky in the blink of an eye but were nothing like what i saw on the previous night. i have questioned reporting this for a month now but believe with more educated eyes possibly watching the skies that night and the two planes in the vicinity that there is a high possibility that someone else may have seen it also. i do not believe that this was part of the meteor shower but that's just my opinion. i have no idea what it was. july 6th 2014 around 3:25am i saw something very similar fly across the sky. it was a very bright light just like what i saw before. no blinking lights. flying from north to south southeast. it cleared the entire skyline in under a minute until it was out of view. it cleared more distance in so little time than i have ever seen. it gave me chills. i am a hardcore skeptic but am open mined. i do not know what i saw but these two incidents were nothing like i have ever seen before. an email reply would be nice on any thought or similar reports on these dates and times.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

girlfriend.I was sat inside ,opposite the open double doors.Outside was a cable between two buildings that went above the road,which had banners on it.Slightly above the cable,i saw a black dot,stationary.I initially thought it was one of our seagulls hovering in flight.Upon watching it for about twenty seconds ,i decided it was not a hovering ,distant bird.My staring caused my girlfriend to ask what i was looking at,and i told her theres something up there thats not moving.About a minute had elapsed by this time since first spotting the \"dot\" and it had not moved from its position,although i did notice it rise and fall very slightly before remaining still again .My girlfriend then went out onto the doorway to look and then take a photograph.By now it must have been just over two minutes in since first awareness of it. i then went out and was handed the camera to take a photo,which i did.Immediately i took the picture,the \"dot\" began to move in a southerly direction,but erratically,in that it seemed to go up and down ,whilst moving forward at the same time,and then loop around on itself.At this point i looked away to look at the camera,but my girlfriend was watching it still,and said it descended as a building in the foreground then hid it from view.\r\nan employee of the cafe,and a customer of the cafe,witnessed mine and my girlfriends activity surrounding the sighting and photographing of the \"dot\" but did not actually see it themselves.\r\nafter seeing the way the object moved after being photographed,i can only say that it seemed to \"react\" to being photoed.It had not moved at all,untill the second after a picture was taken,and then it flew away in its erratic fashion.This is what convinced me that the object was in no way a helicopter,its turns were too tight and too swift in my opinion.I am familiar with aircraft to a degree,and the characteristics of the objects manouvre were not at all consistent with a manned helicopter.To say it was an aeroplane is ludicrous.I was then excited ,as i am convinced that the object was a \"u.F.O.\"\r\nwe took three photographs with a nikon coolpix l820 zoom digital camera.\r\nupon arriving home my girlfriend immediately loaded the photos onto her laptop computer,onto a \"viewnx 2\" programme,which is a nikon photo programme.Only two pictures were clear,showing the small \"dot\".Upon zooming in on the \"dot\",its image becomes very distorted and unrecognisable as any definitive object ,wich i find most strange....\r\nall that does appear to be seen of the enhanced image of the \"dot\" ,is that it appears to be in two halves,each half looking like a burger bun.The whole shape overall looks like a burger!
