just gotten home from work. typical day.  i was tired and went straight to bed at about 11:00-11:30 pm.  i was in a deep dream state, and can recall my dream for the most part, which is largely unusual for me.\r\n\r\ni was awoken around 1:00 am june 2 by a series of 3 loud knocks coming from somewhere close by, inside the house.  the knocks were loud enough that i woke up with quite a start, and sat straight upright in bed. wide awake, my eyes were open and the walls were moving in a wavy sort of way.  i noticed the window sills bending and twisting.  i was a bit wierded out, but figured my eyes were adjusting to having just come directly out of a very vivid dream state.  i looked up at my ceiling fan and it was fading in and out of darkness, like what one might see when you are about to faint when you stand up too fast. also i notice my hearing is super super keen.  i can hear the refrigerator humming in the kitchen and other sounds that i think are the house settling. there is slight banging and knocking sounds and its almost as if i can tell from exactly what direction each noise is coming from in the house, i imagine its like how a bat must hear. i am also feeling like i am not alone in the house, like something is there. my small hairs are standing on end at this point. \r\n\r\n i'm sitting upright in bed still, my eyes not focusing and feeling like i'm having an acid flashback of some sort, fear is setting in, and after a couple of minutes sitting there, my eyes still aren't adjusting. i cover one eye with one hand, hoping i will help focus them and do the same with the other eye, nothing changes.  i look out the north east window, and see 2 bright stars, swirling and dancing with each other and realize that my vision is quite messed up, i am freaked out and decide i need air.  so i get out of bed, iphone in hand (because i'm more frightened than i have ever been in my life and i might need to call someone) and walk to the west facing windows, which look out over a valley that the village of jackson is in. \r\n\r\nas i am looking out the window,thinking of opening it, i notice the stars in the sky are all perfectly in focus, no swimming or blurring, just perfect wide sky- the two white lights to the northeast that i saw while i was still in my bed- they are still 'dancing' with one another. then an orange, steady light comes into view from the south west, about as high as a regular plane would fly, but orange- non blinking.  it travels relatively slowly across the sky- stops for about 15 seconds- starts moving again at its original speed in a different direction- stops again- starts moving after a short 5 second pause, then proceeds to fly out of sight beyond the treeline by my house.\r\n\r\n as i am watching the orange light move across the sky, i text a friend who lives up the street @ 1:11 am:: \"look out your window ufos in jackson sky!\"\r\n\r\n why i didn't film it- i don't know- i was super scared and remember considering doing it, but had the distinct feeling that it might piss someone off or wouldn't be the right thing to do.\r\n\r\ni am more scared than ever in my life at this point and decide i need to go out and be with other people. so i turn to head to the garage and hear sounds in my house.  i am freaked and realize i cant run from this, that going outside might not be a good idea either, so i close my bedroom door, look in the closet for whatever is in the house, and climb into bed- turn on my relaxing music to drown out the sounds in the house, pull the covers over my head and bury myself in pillows and fall asleep.\r\n\r\ni wake up same as always 4:30 am, feeling calm and rested. i remember everything clear as a bell.  i walk thru the sun lit house, checking all the doors and closets to make sure no one is in the house. i go about my day, pondering the night before, my rational mind going over everything, making excuses about what i heard and saw.  by the end of the day, i have everything rationalized, explained logically, except the 3 knocks.  so i google it '3 knocks at night' and the first website that pops up,of course, has an alien on the homepage~~~> creepy shivers! \r\n\r\n i take a shower before work, look for any strange marks on my body- none.\r\nthats the end of the story i hope.  i don't remember seeing any other worldly beings, i was not hurt in any way- just terrified.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

route 322 westbound onto interstate 271 south (mayfield heights, ohio)when i was watching for traffic merging onto to interstate and i noticed the objects. they can best be described as appearing like \"chinese lanterns\" with rotating white, yellow and red lights. at first i saw about 4 of the objects in a row rising into the sky moving west bound across the highway from where i was. they were fairly large maybe 50+ feet across about 1/4 - 1/2 mi. away and were rising into a low cloud deck that was about 1500 ft. high. i was so startled seeing the objects i pulled over to the side of the interstate to get a better view. when i looked northbound and toward a eastern direction up i 271 i saw about 13 - 15 objects all moving in the same direction. the objects looked \"like pearls on a string\" since they were rising fairly slowly and steadily into the low cloud deck. i stood watching the objects until they all ascended into the cloud deck. there was no sound emitting from the objects. i tried to take a picture on my smart phone but it didn't come out because it was dark and they were too far away. i can say the objects were not like anything i had ever seen before. originally i thought they could be balloons or a procession of aircraft but i ruled them both out. the objects were too large for balloons and were omitting the lights and all moving in a linear formation. they couldn't be aircraft since i didn't see any wings or heard any engine noise and they were moving slowly. i can also rule out helicopters, drones, hot air balloons ect. this was truly a unique experience for me and one that i will never forget.

noticed a object out of the corner of my eye and look to the west i see this object a soft yellow and moving towards us. we stood the for about 2 mins as it slowly moved towards us arguing as to what

sumas mt. at night if a neighbor dropped a tire iron the whole mt top would here it. this hill before the four corners is like a knoll you could see back then clearly to the west ,north and clearly to

of objects many times in the past as a child and in my adult life.  however, this time, when i went back inside my house to go to bed, i noticed it was 2:00am.  \r\n\r\nwhat happened to the 4 hours, i do not remember?  i seems strange, as i felt like i did something, but i do not know or remember about what it was.  perhaps i was incorrect in the time, but pretty sure it was 10:00pm because of a television program had ended, then i went outside.  i have never experienced a missing time in all of my other sighting experiences.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

flashing in the middle of the bottom. first thing i thought was look for the colored lights on the end of a planes wings. there were no colors or blinking except for the center red light. i just watched it thinking 'i can't believe i'm really seeing this'. i do believe the triangle is government something, but still. it was moving from east to west. when it was out of view at that window, i went out front to watch. there was a hum/rumbling noise fairly loud, but it was fairly low compared to planes that we see in the area. still moving west but now seen from the back. the back 2 white lights that i could see from this angle were steady lit but flashing brighter in unison. i was wishing i hadn't already turned my phone of and could have gotten a picture. i watched a few minutes as it carried on steady west, no fast or random movements, just above treetop level (from my view point) as it got further away. total time was several minutes.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

off a movie at a blockbuster sort of late at night and was almost ready to turn into my driveway when i noticed these red lights flashing in a moving triangular pattern. the object itself was stationary. i immediately stopped and watched not knowing what they could have been since i knew it couldn't have been a plane and didn't look like a helicopter.It was a little after ten p.M. at night and i just sat and watched these lights going around in a perfect triangle shape. i began to wonder how long this could go on since it was getting later and my husband knew i was just dropping off a movie. i sat outside in the truck for probably ten to fifteen minutes,then all at once the red lights all went to a single point of light and then just disappeared completely. i knew right then that what i had just witnessed was a ufo. telling my husband and friends i had to face kidding and ridicule , but i didn't care. the next day at work, i told people and they all said i was \"having flashbacks\" kiddingly, but i still knew what i had seen was true. later that night, my friend from work called me to say that she had just seen on the news that there were sightings in kissimmee area and reports of a farmer having chickens die from something unknown. i immediately felt vindicated since that was the area in the sky that i was looking towards, even though it was a long way from my house. i even went so far as to call lockheed martin security the night before, to see if anything strange had happened there but of course not. to this day i still believe in what i saw and still look to the night skies to see what i might be able to see. i realize that this is being sent to you years late but at the time i didn't know who to talk to since i wasn't believed by anyone and i myself had no pictures or proof, but it can at least be on record and maybe help \r\ncooberate someone else's report of that time. i believe in life out there and we should all be open to

walking under the power line that serves my home and the others in the area. not a big power line but for home use.  there was still considerable ambient light i noticed a bright light to the sw which i thought was venus but i quickly corrected myself as venus is a morning star this time of year. the light got brighter and larger.  it seemed to strobe. also it appeared that there was a leading edge like a flying wing that was obscured by a fog or mist. for a second or two i saw the edge appear on the left side (my view) then obscure again. as the craft came close it morphed. crazy i know but the bright wight light changed into a solid triangle structure. it flew directly over me along the power line no more than 500 to 800feet above me. the triangle portion of the craft had a purple or violet light similar to neon outlining the triangles edge. there was a softer violet color on the middle of the craft and at the very center a bright white light. no sound what so ever. it moved from horizon to horizon in approximately 90 seconds.  it was a large structure. i would say the triangle was 100 feet by 100 feet by 100 feet but the object was larger as it was shrouded in some sort of mist. another curious thing. no emissions at all. no sound at all. it seem to be pulled along rather than being pushed like our know propulsion works.  it was steady no wavering in speed or direction.

more than 90 seconds before it was beyond view.  unfortunately i was charging my cell phone and did not get a photo.  it seemed that the object wanted me to see it.  from what i could determine it could have obscured my view using the mist or fog or whatever it used to make it  so it's true size could not be determined. this thing was huge.  \r\n\r\ni wish i had a photo.","distance":"101-500

watched it until it disappeared out of sight.I'm convinced that i would have brought it to someones attention immediately.I'm convinced that i would have been extremely excited about it and told my stepson or anyone for that matter.Reguardless,i didn't.Fact is,i didn't tell anyone about it all day until about 9:00 that night when my wife and i were in the hot tub and i remembered and said to my wife,\"holy cow babe you wont believe what i saw today.\"this thing was as long or longer than the body of an airliner but without wings.It was moving very slow.Slower than a blimp.I have seen several blimps at major league sporting events,and this thing didn't fly anything like a blimp.It was whiteish but didn't appear to be very clear in my focus at all.I made no sound.I recall it being approx. 1000' in the air if that.Seeing this object doesn't bother me,but,not recalling the incident until later in the evening does.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
