then all of the power came back on. i did not see any other people come out of the buildings, but the docks are in the back so we wouldn't have seen them. the first thing i thought of was \"they're back\" because i saw a similar object, only disk shaped when i was eight years old while playing with my sister one day. it was also a very shiny chrome color and there was no sound. everyone thought we were crazy so i never talked about it again. now there was a guy with us that night at lake city who mentioned that he saw a round chrome sphere over the dairy farm he was working at a few years prior (1965 or so),and this was off of 7 highway in blue springs not far from lake city. he was our cameraman at lake city and was age 60 or so at the time and i believed him. \r\nthe next day when i arrived at work two men came in that we had never seen before. one was wearing a black suit and the other was wearing a dark grey suit. they had no insignia, and showed no i.D.'s to us, and did not tell us who they were. only one man spoke, and he said \"remember you all have signed a security clearance and you did not see anything last night.\" he was very firm about it. we did not say anything. then they left. while at work that night the seven of us talked about what we saw and we were all in agreement about the description, however, i did not tell anyone about this event until now. i saw the show about missouri on the hangar 1 show and thought i'd call this in to report it. i am 68 years old now and don't think they'll do anything if i talk about what i saw.

or any other source about this event that affected an entire town called bass lake, california.  my father told me about this and he has never reported it but will discuss it.  i don't remember the exact date but it was in the 60's.  my dad and his friend were hitch hiking to bass lake, california when the sighting happened.  it was a two lane highway going towards bass lake when my dad and his friend found a mattress on the side of the road.  they were tired and took advantage of it and layed there looking at the stars in the night sky.  my father noticed an object in the sky towards the east of his position with three lights.  it was triangle in shape and the lights were that of the primary colors.  red, green, and blue i believe.  him and his friend watched it for a few minutes intrigued when it suddenly went from not moving at all to another point in the sky towards the west and stopped on a dime.  he told me that if he had blinked he would have missed it and it must have traveled 10 or so miles in one second.  this got their attention and the craft sat there in sky and darted again towards the south and stopped.  they said they watched this go on for 30 minutes or so until it disappeared.  now the most important part of this event comes a month or so later when my dad moved in with the sheriff of bass lake at that time.  one night my dad and the sheriffs wife were talking about ufo's and my dad mentioned what he and his friend witnessed one night and the sheriffs wife told my dad to not mention it to the sheriff.  well, my dad did ask him about it and the sheriff at first was unwilling to discuss it but as my dad described what he saw, the sheriff told him that he saw the exact same thing from his position the same night.  what happened to the sheriff and the entire town after that was what was really interesting.  the fbi, cia, and nasa flocked to the town of bass lake, california and would not allow the sheriff to leave the county for whatever reason but my dad knows and i would like whoever is reading this to contact me so i can put you in contact with him.  the entire town was taken over by the government until their investigation was over with and nobody was allowed to leave.  i cannot tell you more than this as my dad has the details.  my dad does not believe in ufo's but he cannot explain what he saw that night.  i myself visited bass lake in the past and spoke to my dads old girlfriend who was witness to this event and i can tell you that she told me not a lot of people who were around at that time will talk about it.  this event has eluded everyone and from what i can tell has never been spoke of on tv, internet, or anything for that matter.  please call me for more information.  i cannot be sure the exact year

evening of sky watching, looking for satellites and shooting stars. it was a perfectly clear night, no cloud cover at all, and the parking lot lights from the local business parks behind and in front of their home had just been turned off (the timers are set for midnight). the stars immediately became more visible and even the milky way began to show after a few minutes. while sitting in my camp chair with my head tilted back, staring up, i noticed 4 pale lights of equal magnitude, no brighter (but slightly larger) than the surrounding stars moving north to south, directly overhead, and cruising fairly quickly. it covered its own apparent diameter approximately 5 times in a second. 3 of the lights were in a perfect triangle, with the 4th light exactly in the middle. the lights did not blink, waver or change colors. i immediately pointed them out to my friend, exclaiming: \"what the f**k is that?!? what is that!?\" my first fleeting impression was a low flying jet, but it made no sound at all and the lights were not in any formation i had ever witnessed before. we stared at them as they passed perfectly silently overhead and continued in a straight line due south. the lights (or object, as i believe it was) appeared to be very low, only a couple of thousand feet above, much lower and closer than any other aircraft (with the exception of a probable police helicopter) we had seen that day or night, before or after this sighting. a few aircraft had been visible that night (none directly overhead) including 3 very loud military helicopters in a strung-out formation earlier in the afternoon heading south, though far to the east, low on the horizon. what was likely a police helicopter passed low, loud and close by a few minutes after the sighting, just south of us and heading due east.  my estimation of the object's altitude is based on the respective angle of the lights, which quickly became foreshortened as it passed overhead. the lights were only visible for 6-8 seconds, and became dimmer as they got closer to the treeline on the horizon. before they even came close to the tops of the trees, they quickly dimmed and then disappeared completely. every other conventional aircraft i have ever seen flying has very bright white and red strobe lights that are visible from miles away, at any angle, and sometimes even during daylight hours. this object had nothing resembling conventional aircraft lighting. i have been an aviation enthusiast since i was a child, and have often watched aircraft of all sorts flying at all hours. this was nothing like anything i have ever seen before. it gave me chills of excitement; i knew we had just witnessed something very high-tech, stealthy and rare. a true ufo in the strictest definition.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

however after about ten minutes their barking did not subside. i proceeded to put on my clothes to go outside, but was extremely hesitant and somewhat fearful based on an encounter just several hours before in a city some 35 miles away. nevertheless, i felt something inside of me compelling me to go outside, to check on the dogs if nothing else. i stood on my porch for several minutes and tried to coax the dogs into being quiet. my efforts failed as the dogs where apparently sensing something farther back in the wooded area of the property which i could not see. i base this on the fact that both dogs were facing in that direction and not only were they barking wildly at this point, but they had also began to growl in between their barking. as stated, i did not see what had the dogs so worked up, so after about 30 minutes i returned inside my home, but i took the precaution of opening the blinds in the living room so that i could keep a lookout outdoors. at around 04:10hrs my brother-in-law began to leave for work, but before doing so, from the window, i observed him go to the back of my mother-in-laws house with a bright flashlight to check on the dogs which were still barking and growling fiercely. not seeing anything he proceeded to leave for work and i once again looked outside for the source of the dogs irritation. i did not go outside this time, but instead simply stood in my front doorway. it is at this time that i observed a dull orange orb ascend from the wooded area of the property in the same direction (north) that the dogs had been facing. the object ascended slowly to a level perhaps 100 or so feet above the tree line then it began a slow trek in a northeastern direction. i observed the object for about two minutes until it disappeared beyond a distant tree line. i was able to capture about 30 digital photos of this object, but i will limit my submission of the same to just a few.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":56836,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.9864875,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06042014-0025","longitude":-87.0890241,"occurred":1401793920000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alabama","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1401942818000,"summary":"Dull orange colored orb moving slowly","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/56836_submitter_file1__June3earlymorn11.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/56836_submitter_file2__June3earlymorn21.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/56836_submitter_file3__June3earlymorn26.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/56836_submitter_file4__June3earlymorn30.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"35042","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Centreville, Alabama","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:154582"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Halifax","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My ufo siting report:\r\n\r\ni was in halifax, nova scotia working in the woods when i saw the same green and purple lights i have seen 4 months ago at another location 40kms from halifax.  \r\n\r\nfist sighting was at nice, 1:30am when i heard what i thought was a plane yet it didn't move like one.  there were just 2 dots and about 1 minutes later they dissappeared.  i decided to take pictures to see what would come out which surprised me. i was very freaked out when i looked at the photos later.  \r\n\r\nthe second siting just a few days ago is the one that has me really questioning what these lights could be.  it could have been a glare, but why 2 dots and why the same dots as during a night photo?
