still pretty much overhead. after about 20 seconds the object sped up considerably while gaining altitude.  i was still sitting and and the object appeared to me to gain altitude until it faded while ascending at a considerable angle. my 17yr old who was standing said it appeared to him to just blink out and was gone. we both lost site at around what appeared to be at the altitude of the stars in our view.\r\n\r\nthere where no blinking lights. the object was a really clean white solid light. to contrast i pointed out the airplane to my kids to show the difference. the altitude when first seen started lower than commercial or military planes fly and once it started ascending, it did so faster than any commercial or military plane i have ever seen. aside from the strangely clean looking solid white light, the slowness it was moving while level then the sudden incline and speed was really unusual. there was absolutely no sound.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

bright light in the sky that looked like a star was the biggest star in the sky at least it seemed it moved more then anything else in the sky but very gradually after i pointed it out to a friend and observing it we noticed more and more how what we thought were stars started to move around in formation after being in awe more and more things started to happen the first thing was all the dogs in the small neighborhood started barking and the coyotes in the distance started howling for about 20 to 30 seconds and at the same time they all stopped we were a little freaked out by time then it was complete silence about 10 to 15 minutes later birds from the west side off us no telling where they came from all took off in fright above us headed east hundreds of them it seemed the silence happen again then car alarms all through out the neighborhood went off at the same time for about 10 seconds then at the same time they all went off then again silence no crickets no sound at all about a half hour later these things that actually looked like stars started coming down to the horizon and passing through the sky with no sound eventually close to everything we thought were stars started to move and form triangle formations it was exciting but at the same time scary i wanted to call the police are the fire department to report it but at the same time was amused and appreciative of what i was experiencing not only that it was so crazy that i figured would let someone else do it not to long after that i seen one of the objects from a good distance coming closer the way it moved was like nothing else it did not move in a straight line it would be in one spot then appear in another i ran out around my drive way to the street and this craft was floated over me with no sound i honestly can't remember me even hearing my breath it was so close i could probably hit it with a rock......... well i've always wanted to get this out there and it does feel like a little bit of a

helicopter noise approaching from the south. i exited my vehicle and tuened south, towards the noise to see a helicopter flying about 150-200ft altitude coming just about over my position. it was moving south to north and passed roughly 100 yards to the west of me. as it got closer i noticed what appeared to be a star out in front and a little left of the helicopter. they were moving at identical speed and the \"star\" looked to be roughly 1 1/2 lengths of the helicopter away from the helicopter. the helicopter was black or dark in color in the night sky so the body was not visible; however, based on the lights & noise coming from it, it was easy to estimate the size and distance. the star was difficult to see due to the lighting in the parking lot and it appeared to be faint nonetheless. when it registered to me that the helicopter was chasing something i ran into the building as it passed nearly over and yelled for the staff to follow me out front hoping for others to witness this strange event. by the time i got the front door open and we ran out the helicopter was at a distance and position that prevented anyone else from seeing the object it was chasing. this is the 2nd time i witnessed a star like object being followed by terrestrial aircraft in this town. the first time was roughly 4 miles due east of this location approximately 1 1/2 years ago. i thought what i saw was weird then and talked myself into believing my eyes were tricking me. but after seeing this a 2nd time, i am sure something star he is happening now.

11:30pm. i was traveling outbound on 376 toward carnegie when my radio cut out completly. i found this unusual because at the time i was listening to tunein radio which is an app on my iphone and i had already lost and regained signal after i went thru the tunnel. so i looked down at my phone and it said buffering 3% so i waited and it never went past 3%. i went to put light a cigarette and as i looked up i noticed the light. there is an airport in the area so i thought nothing of it at first. as i continued to look at it i began to notice that at no point did the craft blink like a plane or helicopter. as time went on it seemed to slow almost to a stop a few times then continue on its path. the object looked to be a large triangle with 3 lights on the back and 2 lights on the side visible to me. the glow/blurr of the lights made it hard to even notice much of a surface but i believe it was a solid object not just lights in the sky. after a few minutes of it in the distance it started to disappear to my left and as i followed it out of view with my eyes i noticed the car in the left lane next to me was watching it too. we made short eye contact and he looked as confused as me about 15 seconds later the radio on my phone came back on which as right before the heidelburg exit. i am very familiar with aircraft military, commercial, and private and this is nothing i have ever seen before. if i had to compare it to an aircraft i am familiar with it would be the boeing x-45c drone. it was very similar in shape the light pattern was different and the drone does not have
