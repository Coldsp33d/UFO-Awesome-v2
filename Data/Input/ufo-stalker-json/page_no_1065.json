from my father. i find that using binoculars is the best way to view the night sky because you get dynamic movement and get a better field of view than with a telescope. i walked out my back door unto my deck and adjusted the binoculars with the brightest object visible at the time which was saturn about 20 degrees over the tree line. as i looked at saturn i noticed just below it what appeared to be a constellation of stars with about 6-8 stars in it. they were dim, like the stars that are much further away  but the entire field of view seemed to match perfectly as far as color, shading, contrast, brightness. in other words nothing looked odd except that these stars caught my attention. i focused mentally primarily on the four left most stars in this particular \"constellation\" then what seemed like a second or two later this \"constellation\" moved. all 6-8 points moved in unison against the night sky which i noted was stationary. i could see the other objects in the sky not moving except for this \"constellation\". the best way i could describe it was like i was using a photoshop picture of the night sky then used a lasso tool and selected this constellation then copied and pasted it over the picture of the night sky and i could drag that small layer anywhere on the picture of the stars behind it. it moved upward, what seemed to be about 10-20 degrees in elevation then stopped and moved down about 5 degrees then i lost sight of it. there were clouds in the sky and bluish heat lightning which i observed. while tis was happening i called out to my wife twice to bring me parer and a pen so i could draw what i was seeing. i was looking through the binoculars and didn't want to lose sight of it or had them to her to see so i could still track it. i felt physically shaken and slightly nauseous probably from witnessing what had just happened. the \"cutout\" had a similar shape an airplane in that it was larger and thicker horizontally than vertically but had a protrusion below it sort of like a wing or a minute hand on a clock pointing at about 4 or 5 o'clock.  i've included a picture of what i saw. i use an app on my phone called \"sky chart\" to show what i was looking at and where the object was. the red dashes in the picture where not visible but are an aid to show the approximate shape of what i was. it could have been any size but my impression was it was the size of a small city. the white dots in the red dashed represent the \"stars\" i saw that moved in unison.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Path with directional

our house and i went outside to see what she was calling me for. she pointed up to the sky and i saw what resembled a meteor or some object entering the atmosphere from space. however, it did not leave a trail like those objects and didn't seem to be moving as fast as i would imagine those objects to move (how they may vary in speed i do not know). it did appear to be aflame, which is why i initially thought of something entering the atmosphere from space. the color was bright orange/red like a flame. to me it was also reminiscent of the brightness and color of the exhaust of rockets i have seen launched from kennedy space center. it moved smoothly and quietly across the sky from north east to north west. i watched it for about 5 to 10 seconds from the back (under a screened patio) and quickly ran through the house to the front (the direction of travel of the object) so i could get a better look. i removed my cell phone camera from my pocket on the way to the front yard and managed to get a blurry picture of the glowing object before switching my cell phone camera to video mode. i recorded video of it for 52 seconds. the light appeared to extinguish about 20 seconds from the end of my video. for the remainder of the time it appeared dark, like a silhouette against the darkening blue sky.\r\n\r\nwe live somewhat close to boca raton airport which serves small jets and we are in their approach path. corporate/private jets fly over our house regularly and they can be loud enough to compete with our conversations on the back patio. the object in question here made no noise and traveled opposite to the direction we typically see of airport traffic. we are west and slightly south of the airport. planes fly east over our house to land. i suppose they might take off toward our house too, but i haven't paid attention or noticed if they depart the airport and fly over us. i only recall flights heading in for landing.\r\n\r\nthe video i uploaded is 42 seconds. i trimmed 10 seconds from the beginning because i had originally oriented my phone camera vertically and decided a few seconds into the recording that i would do the rest horizontally. additionally, there are a lot of trees obstructing the view as i come out of my house into the front yard, so there are only a couple of second in which the object is visible before i turn my phone horizontally. toward the end of the video the object goes dark but can still be seen moving across the sky. i lost track of it in a couple of spots on the video because i was mostly using my eyes to watch while  periodically glancing at the camera. apologies for the shaky video. also note, i used the digital zoom feature of my camera phone (4x, i believe).\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
