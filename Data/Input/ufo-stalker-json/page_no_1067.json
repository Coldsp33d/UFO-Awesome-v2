was perfect: things fell seamlessly into place and we were so excited to welcome in the new year.  we spent the evening talking and eating snacks.  we were in such positive spirits!  we had nothing bad to say about anyone or anything; we were just glad to welcome the new year.  shortly after midnight, c and i created a drinking game with champagne, proposing toasts to everything.  \"cheers to the multiverse, for always providing what we need, when we need it.  cheers to the sun for making all life possible.  cheers to creative expression in the new year. whatever's up there, cheers to you.\"  (we only consumed half a bottle of champagne and the temperature was below freezing; it is important to note that we were not in any heavily altered state!)  we sat down at our fire and decided to go for a nature walk before bed.  \r\n       we finished our glasses of champagne and walked into the desert and onto what seemed a different plane.  the moon reflected blue on granite rock faces as we explored.  we found ourselves on a trail that led us to the mouth of a ravine.  we stood in front of the ravine, c climbed on a rock and i stood below.  i was overcome with the need to pray so i put my head down and found myself suddenly still in a deep, rare state of prayer and good intentions for everyone i know: \"please help so and so get a job. my friend needs to regain health.  help my brother communicate better.  help me communicate better.\"  \r\n\tc said look up and i did.  up was a bright gold light speeding across the sky, about 200 ft from the ground.  i started weeping the moment i saw it.  all we could say was \"there it is!\"  we stepped away from the ravine and out into the open and the light stopped to hover above us, glittery, silently gold and pulsating.  \"let's go back to camp,\" c said and he turned and started walking but i couldn't move i was so mesmerized and the light was communicating something to me that i've yet to understand.  \"let's go back to camp\" and as we started walking the light drifted gracefully but quickly back up, true north, to space, to wherever.  \r\n\twe stumbled, hyperventilating, jumping and running over rocks and the light drifted higher, higher and disappeared.  we stopped, looked at each other and hugged, shaking, asking \"are you ok!?\" back at camp i just had to lay on the desert floor.  \"did we just get abducted?\" we asked, \"how long were we gone!\" (only about an hour.)  i'm not sure that we were physically abducted, but something happened with our minds and this light. \r\n\twe now refer to the light as the goddess and we've come to some conclusions: the light was not a machine. but a being.  a living, organic entity. it was an intimate encounter, terrifying, but not threatening.  the encounter did something to our minds/bodies/spirits.  initially, this experience confused and frustrated us both: how could we return to our normal lives knowing this exists?  fortunately, we've been able to integrate this experience positively, into our spiritual lives.  i believe i know that the entity communicated ideas of lovingkindness to us, for we had this experience when we were in a most positive, joyous state.\r\n\tlater, c confessed that i alone might have been abducted: \"there was a time when you weren't next to me.  there was a minute where i didn't see you.  i turned away to walk back to camp and you stayed there, alone.\"  the world didn't so much end in 2012.  it began.","distance":"21-100

were in a remote area, along an old train track, there were no houses etc.  my friend opened a beer and i lit up a cigarette.  suddenly a tremendous light surrounded us.  as i sat on my sled i could see my friend's face clearly. he still had his snowmobile helmet on and visor up but there were no shadows whatsoever...I could see the suspension under his snowmobile perfectly. i could see the laces on his boots as he stood on the other side of his sled...We could totally see every detail of everything around us, it was like we were in a circle of light, like we were in a spotlight but the light was coming from all directions. from underneath, the sides, from all around. no shadows, everything on the snowmobiles was illuminated. i knew right away there was something wrong because the light was so strange, like we were inside a light bulb. we said, where's the light coming from? what's going on? we stood up and looked around for a source, and even though the light was very very bright, we did not feel the need to squint or anything. it went on for what we thought was 30 seconds then it instantly disappeared like with the snap of a finger. we talked about this for a couple minutes...You could see the few clouds by the moon in the sky, it was a very clear night.  as we stood up, it came back again, making us both feel uneasy. we talked while we were in this light. the second time it lasted probably exactly the same amount of time. when it disappeared the second time, we said we are outta here! we went back on to the trail and stopped to see if it was coming back again. we drove like crazy back to his home. when we arrived...There were guys meeting us for riding for 6pm. they were saying where have you been? my friends girlfriend was furious because she informed us it after 8:00pm! where did the time go? i do not know. i just, i don't know. i tried to explain we just went out for a quick beer and there was a light. we told them everything. they were waiting for us for so long, everybody was pretty much drunk by this time. so, no one believed us but i did say jokingly, i think we were abducted. the first time seeing the light, we could have brushed it off. but when it returned the second time...We knew that there was nothing that could have been making that light. the light was so weird, so unnatural. like a spotlight shining from all directions, even from below. i remember looking at my gloves and there were no shadows. i will never forget it.","distance":"20 Feet or

it seemed as if the light then penetrated only that room i was in. it was rather unnerving and i tried shaking my friend awake. she opened her eyes for a second and went right back to sleep. the sphere remained in that position for a few moments and i almost felt panic like i was not safe. i then saw two more orbs appear over the same horizon, following the same path, same speed and brightness, but this time they joined the initial orb, hovered for a second and whooshed off at what i would describe as a speed and vibration and intensity that was almost unimaginable. they left over the roof top heading directly south from what i could tell.  \r\n\r\ni have had several more encounters over the years in the same area where i grew up and a few in other locals. my feeling is that they may have planted some type of tracking device under my skin as once a month or so for many years i would get a strong vibration in my foot and groin area, this would be followed by intense frightening night time experiences (dreams). this is the first time i have talked about this with anyone outside my immediate family.

2am to 3am (est) myself and one 18 \r\nwheeler were the only ones out on the roads. the 18 wheeler was about 1-2 \r\nmiles behind me and could only be seen when we were on a straight section of \r\ni-20. about a mile to 11/2 miles before i reached the 205 exit between \r\nheflin and ranburne alabama i topped the hill and far in the distance on my \r\nright side i saw the most extreme bright white lights lighting up the entire \r\nside of the road and pasture. i was very confused as to what i was looking \r\nat. at first i thought that there may have been an accident and the police \r\nand rescue response were trying to recover vehicles....But then i realized \r\nthat i didn't see any emergency police or fire department colored lights and it \r\nwas extremely quiet.  i began to slow my speed as i approached closer and then \r\ni noticed the lights that were shinning straight through the tree line onto \r\nthe interstate had not not only risen to above the tree line but had also \r\nturned from pointing towards the road to pointing towards to ground. i \r\nimmediately stopped my car in the middle of the interstate. i looked in rear \r\nview mirror to see where the 18 wheeler truck was in relationship to my car \r\nbecause i wanted to make sure that i was wasn't going to get hit and also i \r\nwanted to make sure that i wasn't the only person who seeing this. the 18 \r\nwheeler had also come to stop about 1 mile behind me and had his cab door \r\nopen and he also had not pulled off the interstate. when i looked back \r\ntowards the area where the lights were at.... the lights were just about \r\ntree top level and pointing towards the ground. the next thing i knew it was \r\ncompletely dark. i then was very confused and began looking about the sky \r\nfor any thing that could have done this. still very confused and extremely \r\nscarred, i noticed a huge... huge!!!! triangular shaped object that had a \r\nrounded edges where the point of a triangle  would be. there was no sound at \r\nall and no lights on this object were seen now. this object remained about \r\ntree top tall as it passed over my car heading extreme north west. this \r\nobject was as large as a football field if not larger. and was about 50 to \r\n60 feet thick. i could clearly see the pattern on the bottom and the sides \r\nof this object. i sat at a full stop in the middle of the interstate feeling \r\ncompletely terrified and violated and again looked behind me to check and \r\nsee if there was any other traffic that the was going to hit me. the truck \r\nwas no where to be seen and he was only about 1 mile behind me and was \r\nstopped with his door open only moments before. he couldn't have made an \r\nexit off the interstate because the 205 exit in front of me was the only \r\nexit off the interstate for a few miles. this left me dazed and confused. i \r\nnow realize that i have time missing from when i saw the object in the field \r\nabout tree top tall with its lights on and when it was coming over my car \r\nwithout any lights on. when i finally pulled myself back together and began \r\nto drive slowly home i realized that the time was now 4:12 am. i have been \r\nvery terrified ever since this occurrence and i can't stand it now when \r\nnight comes. please help me understand this so that i can once again go to \r\nbed and lead a normal life. i almost immediately began to have extremely \r\nterrifying vivid dreams about aliens tracking me and i have an unsettling \r\nfeeling that i am being watched. i want you to know that i am not crazy and \r\ni have no psychological medical diagnosis. i do not take any medications \r\nthat would cause me to see anything or cause me to lose any time periods. i \r\nam 47 years old and i am an rn with almost 30 years experience working as a \r\nnurse in the er, icu, and dialysis. i have searched the internet almost \r\ndaily to see if anyone has reported anything similar to my experience. \r\nplease contact soon. i can't discuss this with anyone. i can't take the \r\nchance that i am thought of as \"crazy\".\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 501 Feet - 1

noon)\r\ncavu, haze and high cirrus to north and south\r\ntime in sight: about 2 minutes\r\nother witnesses: unknown\r\nsize of objects: tiny, undifferentiated bright white dots at an unknown distance. the size of a bright star.\r\n\r\ni hold a private pilot license.\r\n\r\nchevron of white lights, about 7, traveling from north to south over reno. the chevron comprised six lights (1 center, 2 right wing, 3 left wing, the seventh trailing several lengths behind). the lights were uniformly white and of equal brightness.\r\n\r\nthis was not a single object. i could see blue sky between the dots. there seemed to be no connecting structure -- and from the way the individual lights moved, i don't think that there could have been one.\r\n\r\nthe trailing light closed. the chevron morphed into a diagonal line behind the leading light to the right. lights continued moving around and the formation kept changing. there was always a formation -- not a random set of lights -- but the formation continued to change.\r\n\r\nas the lights were overhead, i thought i could perceive two red-black panels, one to either side of three or four of the white lights. no blinking. no visible empennage. no sound (air conditioner was nearby, but i did hear a passenger jet pass over at contrail altitude shortly thereafter). \r\n\r\nno contrails. either the objects were below or above contrail altitude, or they weren't generating contrails.\r\n\r\nthe objects maintained a steady speed from north to south, eventually vanishing in the southern haze as i took my eyes from them for a moment and could not reacquire.\r\n\r\naltitude: unknown (no way to judge) they could have been small objects at a low altitude, or large objects higher. i did get the impression of high altitude, however. during the time i watched, they did not pass any clouds or contrails for me to see whether they were above or below. a commercial jet passed over, generating contrails, after they disappeared, and i did not have any difficulty discerning that it was a commercial jet (i could even see the tail -- the empennage).\r\n\r\ni am located about three miles south of the reno-tahoe airport, which has a tower control zone of about 5 miles in diameter, and rising to (iirc) 12,000 msl. these objects would have been in the control zone, or in the positive-controlled airspace above it. somebody must have radar information about this.\r\n\r\ngoogle is said to have a large weather balloon orbiting nevada, testing wifi signals. this was not a single object and not a weather balloon. the local tv station ktvn has a permanent weather camera trained on the sky. i have a call in to the station to see whether footage of 5/25 @ 11:45 am exists.\r\n\r\nthis being memorial day weekend, my first thought was a military formation, but the lights jinked around too much and got in front of each other as they changed position. also, they would have been in positive-controlled airspace, and that kind of maneuver would have been discouraged. the next thought was geese (which fly in formation), but there was no change in the brightness of the objects, and no sense of \"flapping.\" third thought was a formation of ultralights, but they're illegal over populated areas and -- again -- would have been in controlled airspace, another illegality. since there were seven and moved steadily from north to south, it's unlikely to have been the planet venus. they did not drop, so were not flares. they changed and formed new formations, so were not balloons.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

around 11 p.M.  clear sky, stars out.  i looked left (west) and saw a bank of lights appear over the mtn.  they weren't moving, & as i watched, more appeared in a straight line.  i asked \"jenn\" if she saw that...She said \"yes, whats on top of the mtn?\".  i said \"nothing, nothing is up there\".  then i noticed one lone light off to the left.  the bank of lights kept \"growing\", then one light, within the set of lights, began pulsating brighter, then dimmer, then brighter again.  \r\n \r\ni'm always sky watching & a firm believer (for years) & honestly, i kinda knew what i was seeing.  it def. wasn't a plane.  much to big.  i never saw a v shaped outline, just these lights.  all white.  \r\n \r\nanyway, i said to my girl friend, we hafta go back to my house ( a 5 min walk).  i wanted my binocs & phone to take a pic.  we walked back & watched it thru the trees.  watched it as i got onto my front lawn, was still in same spot.  i ran inside, she followed me in.  by the time i got outside with my phone, it was gone.\r\n \r\nentire time from i saw it to it disappearing, was about 10 minutes.\r\n \r\ni called west milford, nj pd & also gwl ny pd.  no one reported anything.\r\ni also checked on any local fireworks.  there were none.\r\ni stayed up late, outside, hoping to see it again.  nothing.\r\n \r\nwhen we woke up in a.M., i showed my friend a book i have on ny ufo's.  she pointed out a drawing from early 80's & said \"that's kinda what we saw\".  i knew it also.  i've seen enough drawings & illustrations to know what it was.  \r\n \r\nlet me know your
