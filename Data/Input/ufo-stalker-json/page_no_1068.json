(15 sec. sighting, two witnesses) clear, cloudless night with dead calm wind conditions.  \r\n\r\nit was a beautiful evening and my wife and i went outside to sit on the deck of our lake home to view the stars and the milky way galaxy on this excellent viewing night.  then, within a few minutes she mentions that she sees an orange ball of light moving over the lake (southwest to northeast direction) to my right (the lake home faces south east).  i immediately focus my attention to a glowing orange and yellow orb in the sky, moving about 30 mph to the northeast, directly over the center of the lake and at an altitude of ~ 200 ft. above the surface of the water.  the orange, glowing orb was completely silent and moved parallel with the surface of the water.  after the orb moved about 400 or 500 yds. to the northeast, the orb instantly ���blinked��� out!\r\n\r\nobservations: at first, i thought the orange orb was a comet!  however, i quickly dismissed that in a few seconds���  next, i thought it could be a meteor streaking across the sky but realized this was no meteor/shooting star or satellite traversing the sky after another second or two.  finally, i thought i was looking at a chinese lantern but i quickly dismissed that since the night was perfectly still with no wind whatsoever that would blow a chinese light parallel with the water surface @ 30mph!\r\n \r\ni now carefully observed the glowing orange/yellow orb and observed it for ~ 10 sec. and saw that the orange glowing orb actually had a rectangular/trapezoid shape that constantly rotated and change actual shape!  most interesting was that i noticed there was a distinctly bright, pin-point of light (like a very, very bright star��� but with perhaps 10 times the brightness magnitude that was very piercing in sharpness and intensity to the naked eye).  the bright star-like pin point of light was more glowing with a very, very bright yellow color than the orange glow that was around it, and the further you got from the light source, the more orange the gaseous glow became. however, there seemed to be a distinct design to the glowing nature of the orb that struck me the most!  \r\n\r\nmy wife and i continued to observe the object together until it instantly ���winked out��� of sight five or six homes down to our left field of view.  \r\n\r\ni carefully asked my wife what she saw and she could only say that it was definitely a glowing orange mass of light that quickly moved over the middle of the lake until we both saw it blink out after viewing for ~ 15 sec.\r\n\r\nthe gaseous orb/object definitely was rotating and changed shape as it moved to the northeast!\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

that is awful lot of bright lights for an airplane or helicopter. the weather clear with patchy clouds, wind calm, temperature muggy, there were no clouds where the object was seen. \r\n\r\ni was standing on my back porch waiting for my dog to do her business & i noticed the object wasn't moving, i was able to gauge this by the power lines & trees in my backyard, it always stayed in the same place. i also noticed there were no blinking lights like an airplanes or helicopter would have, the lights were all white & twinkling. i watched it for a couple more minutes & decided to go get my binoculars for a better look.\r\n\r\nwhen i came back out it was still there so i able to adjust the lens to get a clear look at it. it was rectangular at an angle with a bunch sparkling lights located in no particular order which looked like they were going on & off, but what was weird was a solid bar of light near the bottom. then the solid bar of light moved to the middle of the object, then after a couple of minutes the bar moved back to it's original position. all this time i'm thinking this has got to be a blimp or balloon but then all of sudden it turned into a diamond shape & the solid lit bar was gone. maybe it turned to the left to make it look like a different shape, i don't know, all i know is i'm looking at thru the binoculars and it changed shape just like that. \r\n\r\nabout this time i decided to go get my camera & a stronger pair of binoculars, by the time i came back outside i thought it was closer because it looked just a little bit bigger, but maybe that was because i took my eyes off it for a couple of minutes. so i turn on my camera (it is a digital canon rebel with a wide angle & zoom lens) & try to zoom into the object but i couldn't find it in the viewfinder. so i my eyes off the viewfinder to re-orientate where to point the camera & i notice it is still in the same place but now it is just tiny speck of light. so i try find it in my viewfinder again but couldn't, when i looked again and it was gone. whatever it was must of took off heading in the direction i was looking because it was gone in 2-3 seconds at a 10 o'clock angle. i

intrepid sea, air, and space museum. after touring the deck and interior of the museum i made my way to the adjacent dock to see the nearby concorde on display. it was new york fleet week so there were multiple news and tour helicopters flying up the hudson and a coast guard mh-65 helicopter performing a search and rescue demonstration over the water, there was also the normal commercial airliner traffic always seen in the area, with all this going on i had my eye on the sky anyway when i noticed another object that i didn't recognize, at first i thought it was a balloon, but upon closer visual inspection it appeared much larger than a balloon and was a different overall shape, and despite the noticeable wind that day the object appeared to be hovering in place or moving extremely slowly. it's color was also strange, it seemed to be mostly a metallic grey or chrome color, it was mostly circular in shape from my perspective. i estimated the objects altitude to be at around 4,000 feet more or less because it was noticeably higher than the various helicopters going up the hudson but considerably lower than the passing commercial airliners, i had no way to estimate the objects size due to its distance, and the lack of anything close enough to it to compare it with. after a few minutes the object began moving slowly and gradually increased it's speed. i began taking photos on my camera phone (an iphone 5) and began backing up to get a better view of the object before it passed over the deck of the intrepid and out of my sight. the following day i uploaded the photos onto my computer and reviewed them. the object was barely visible in the photos, but i cropped them to get a closer view of the object. the first few photos showed exactly what i described seeing, a small rounded metallic grey object hovering, however the 6th photo showed that the object clearly had a shaded edge to it proving it was an actual three-dimensional object. an uneven pattern began to develop where the object was completely shiny in one picture and then has a darker shaded edge in the next few, i could not explain if this was due to the sun shining on the object or not. however it was the 11th picture when i noticed things were becoming stranger. in this photo the original color and possibly even the shape of the object has significantly changed. on close visual analysis the photo shows the object as a definitively structured craft with a more angular shape to it, and a small ring of light around the center, something i did not notice while viewing the object (though i may have missed it through the phone lens). the final photo is by far the strangest, and most compelling, the object is again grey/chrome and metallic but the upper part appears to be a brighter blue-white color which may be reflective light or light generated by the object itself. i will submit all of the cropped, close-up photos and some of the original ones. there were no other witnesses that i ran into, although i find it unlikely that i was the only one who saw the object because there were hundreds of people on the museum deck and neighboring docks (not to mention the general area of manhattan) i did point out the object to my father who was unable to see it well at the distance and quickly dismissed it as probably being a balloon, however after i showed him the photos he no longer thought that. i have always been intrigued by the ufo phenomenon and know a lot about aviation and identifying aircraft, so all i can say is that the object i saw and photographed did not resemble or move like any normal airplane or helicopter i have seen before.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

thunder clouds had passed over the last couple days and now were accumulated many miles to the south with the storm moving west.  the cloud line rose to about 20 degrees above the horizon. the rest of the sky seemed to be totally clear for 180degrees. so when the lightning went you could see the top of the cloud it came from.  thats what had me watching the horizon out my parlor window. it was well past dark and about 8pm when i decided to take a run to the store to pick up a few munchies for later. as i was driving the 1/8th mile to the store i still had the corner of my eye trying to catch the lightning on the horizon but instead i caught a sight of a light that seemed out of place. i could only catch a glimpse here and there through the houses,power lines and trees so it had to be no higher then 30degrees or so off the horizon. the further i drove the more the trees blocked the view. so i kept going to the store.  when i got to the store i jumped out and kinda walked backward looking southeast toward where i thought it should be. no dice. until i got to the entrance of the store and looked directly south down a side street that if it kept going would end in the ocean about 500 yards from my position, and saw the object moving from east to west in a descending ascending pattern. like a ball bouncing but more smooth and controlled with a steeper decent and lesser curve on the ascent.  would have to say it was at least over the ocean which was 500 yards probably way further. it got about two \"bounces\" and out pops another one following directly behind it.  so at this point im standing in the entrance of the store backward looking out toward the ocean. its a small store and the counter is right there so i turn to the lady and say theres ufo's flying around out here.  two ladies come out and watch as they take their last bounce and head out to the south west upward and disappear. so i go inside buy my chips and candy and one girl is still outside looking out and around.  the other girl follows me out. we look around and sure enough to the south east at about 50 deg from the horizon a stationary orange star.  so i point to it and ask the girl thats not the right color right? she says no. so i start walking to my truck to get home and get my camera. as soon as i start my truck as i am watching bam it vanishes. so thats the first and second and even third sighting i guess. so i drive home asap and almost bang a few parked cars because im staring at the sky. run inside grab my camera and go out on the porch. i filmed three different objects in three separate videos between i would say 830pm and 930pm.  these objects have a orange hew they all seem further away and higher in the sky then the ones the ladies and i had seen in town. my video is crappy and shaky and goes in and out of focus because it is a digital camera making video with lots of light pollution. the stars are not visible in the video but are totally visible for a hundred and eighty degrees from the camera point besides the 20gress above the horizon where the storm clouds are.  i also have a video of military helicopters flying in the same area a week or so before.  the difference between the heli's and whatever these are is unmistakable.  also jets and planes fly by all night everynight and look much different. this is high traffic airspace jets and such dont just turn off their lights around here. oddly the choppers did and thats why i filmed them. again though the choppers were a week or so earlier. i will post one of the ufo vids and the one of the choppers from a week prior.

airliner overhead in the clear blue sky. it was moving from west to east at high altitude and at a comparible speed to an airliner in my estimation.  as i looked closer, i noticed the object did not appear to have wings. at this point, i pulled out my phone to take a few pictures of the object. i then took a short video. after the object was far enough away so as not to be visible, i got in my car and cropped the photos down to get a closer look. it was then that i was pretty sure that what i had just saw was no conventional aircraft. it appeared to have no wings or tailwing. it also appeared to be rectangular in shape, with perfectly squared front and back. did not look at all aerodynamic in the pictures. i shared the video and pictures with a friend who is a ups pilot, and while he cannot completely rule out the possibility it was an airplane, he is equally puzzled by the rectangular shape and lack of visible wings.
