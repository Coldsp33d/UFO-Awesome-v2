9 pm july 4th, 2013, i was driving and witnessed a white diamond shaped object in sky with a circular orange/red light in center hovering directly above road, maybe a few miles away, and maybe a thousand feet or more up,but very clear. so fast it moved, i cannot explain, it moved vertically, down, then up, then to the left.  then straight down. disappearing into horizon. it was so fast, like a laser pen would move, but it stopped on a dime. then moved again, stopped in a micro second. to go so fast and stop so quickly, i knew i was witnessing something extremely unusual. and to move perfectly vertically was very strange. also the shape was very strange. i knew what i saw was a ufo. i was very very nervous, as i was almost home. i got out of the car, looking in the same direction, it was gone. i told my boyfriend. i went again back outside, feeling very uneasy. gone. the rest of the summer i felt uncomfortable going outside at night, as i realized the event was somewhat traumatizing at a deep level. it was most definitely a ufo. thankyou.\r\nd.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

moving your arm from left to right and then it left my view. it was like looking at a very bright led christmas light only it was round and fairly large, probably about a quarter size of a full moon. there was no sound. the brightness was consistent. always bright. but it didn't light up the night sky around it. the only brightness was coming from the object. it certainly wasn't a plane, far too low. doubt if it was a satellite. again far too low. it probably was travelling as fast as a fighter jet would travel. the brantford municipal airport is about 5 miles to the west of where i first saw the object and hamilton international airport is about 30 miles to the east. when i initially saw it, the first thing that came to mind was that i was seeing the headlight of a truck moving along a road because there is a four-lane highway just beyond those the hill/trees. but then i realized, the light would have been facing me, not going from left to right. also, i went out the next night around the same time and never saw a thing so pretty sure you can't see cars or trucks travelling along that highway.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

off from a very heavy meal (i didn't want to catch the \"itis\" so early in the night). laying down, the sky was clear and one of the \"dipper\" constellations was slightly to the north of me.\r\n\r\nthe first object i noticed, seemed like a very slow moving meteor to me. it moved from south to north, through the \"scoop\" portion of the \"dipper\". it gained magnitude as it moved: from faint green, to intense, bright green. faster than a plane. slower than a satellite. much, much slower than any meteor i've seen. very high altitude. i felt like it was just one of those once-in-a-lifetime, beautiful, natural anomalies. it had me supposing that friction could happen, at such a low speed.\r\n\r\ni invited my lady outside to come see the lovely night sky.\r\n\r\nwithin 5 minutes the next object, had my full attention. approximately 500 meters to the east, at approximately 300-500 feet altitude. travelling south to north. it appeared as 2 lights within 100 feet of each other, in formation. the left light, slightly ahead of the right. they moved rapidly. much faster than an f-18, a little slower than a satellite. absolute silence. that is when we noticed there was no more air traffic overhead, just circling in the distance. we are on a takeoff/ landing path east of pearson international airport (hereafter: pia). i felt focused and alert, at this point. i felt kind of envious, towards whoever may be piloting (up there, free as a bird, pushing a vehicle i could only dream about). i pondered what type of propulsion it had. my girlfriend could corroborate the visual, however had a different perception.\r\n\r\nwithin 5 minutes, a similar 2 lights flew directly overhead. same 300-500 foot altitude. same south to north trajectory, through the mid point of the \"dipper\". same silence. a little slower than the previous, yet still very fast. the right light was slightly ahead of the left. as it passed under a small cloud, i could see that the lights were joined by a body. could have been cylinder, could have been a rectangle. i felt inspired by my curiosity, at this point. my lady's observation and perception, were very similar to mine.\r\n\r\nwithin 30 seconds to a minute of that, a 2 engine (under wing) jetliner passed directly overhead. same path as the previous object, however moving north to south. normal jetliner speed. under 1000 feet in altitude. i felt curious as to why that was the only plane in the sky. why did it fly that low? why did it take that trajectory? was that plane special- were the previous sightings a security escort? again i felt envy for the flight crew: they had a better vantage point, therefore understanding of the situation.\r\n\r\nat this point, i wanted to see more. i could feel the \"show\" wasn't over. it was still too quiet. i stood up and took a 360 eyeball.\r\n\r\nimmediately, i saw a very bright light, to the south west. yellow-orange, slowly pulsating in intensity. far too bright, for jetliner high-beams on direct approach. held position far too long, for a normal direct approach. i asked my girlfriend to keep an eye on it, while i retrieved binoculars.\r\n\r\nthrough a pair of 10 x 50 binocs with a 5 degree field, i could make out that the light was cycling the colours of the spectrum. not a linear cycle, but opposites on the colour wheel (ie: film correction colour wheel). it was hovering. i could not see a body/ frame, just lights. i estimate this light source to have been under 1000 feet in altitude. possibly over south mississauga or the north end of lake ontario. as one of the jetliners in the holding pattern in the distance approached that position: the light source faded, and travelled north. at this point, i had no emotions. i was in strict observation mode. my girlfriend was slightly more emotional, trying to rationalize what she saw.\r\n\r\nwithin 10 minutes, another similar light source appeared. under 1000 feet in altitude. i would estimate the light source was over the west side of mississauga, definitely east of the niagara escarptment (where planes were circling in the distance). stationary position. same colour cycling. same fade as a plane approached. same northern trajectory, on departure. at this point, i assume that norad is cool with what's going on. they know there is a halt to takeoffs/ landings at pia. they have multiple eyes on the situation. i assume flight crews in the distance are making observations (even if not reported).\r\n\r\nwithin another 5 minutes, i see what i assume to be a satellite. travelling south to north, through the \"dipper\". usual satellite speed & altitude. i felt very confident at this point. we now had known vehicles, to reference what we were observing. i was curious, if it was a \"bird\" positioned to record this event's data, or not.\r\n\r\nwithin another 5 minutes, another bright cycling light source appeared directly to the west of us. i would place this source directly over midtown mississauga, south of pia. hovering. same light cycle. same intensity. same fade behavior as a plane approached. same departure direction. i asked my girlfriend to use her phone, to document the event. she took several photos and a video. the images look like any other light source in the sky. at least they can corroborate time, colours and position. i felt satisfied at this point, that this event would not involve me, or progress any further. so, i went inside.\r\n\r\nwithin another 5 minutes, my girlfriend reported seeing another similar light source. i was only half interested. at this point, my thoughts were selfish. i'm a stereographer, and i didn't even have a bloggie 3d at my disposal to document it. now i know what my next purchase will be.\r\n\r\noverall my end feelings, were as of those in the beginning. last night was just one of those beautiful little curveballs life throws at you.","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1

central time. i saw what appeared to be a round ball of fire hovering in the sky above the louis joliet mall here in joliet, il.I was about a block away from the mall. at first, i thought it might be a helicopter, but i've never seen one with a light that large or that color.It was glowing and red or red-orange in color with some yellow streaks in it. it literally looked like someone picked up a flame and somehow enclosed it in a globe. it looked like it was at about the height that a helicopter would fly but did not appear to be moving. the mall parking lot has large lights on tall poles and this was much larger than the lights and seemed to be almost perfectly round.\r\n\r\ni pulled off into my subdivision which has a lot of trees and drove slowly down the street and could see it on and off between the trees and seemed to be in a stationary position. i stopped once to look at it. it didn't move and i rolled down the windows to listen for sounds of a airplane or helicopter. i heard nothing. i drove further up the street and lost it momentarily because of a large group of trees and then stopped at a large clearing and had an open view of the sky to the north. nothing was in sight. i drove a block back to the south to a school parking lot so i could see in all directions and nothing was in sight. the thing had completely disappeared in a matter of about 20 seconds.\r\ni then drove to the mall parking lot to get another open view of the sky but it was gone.\r\n\r\ni really couldn't believe what i was seeing and kept staring at it and trying to talk myself out of the possibility that it was a ufo. after i was convinced that it had disappeared and wasn't going to show up again, i texted my grandson. then i called my daughter and son-in-law and described it to them. i then texted my son because i wasn't sure he was still awake. he called me almost immediately to get the details.\r\n\r\ni've never seen anything like this and have never heard of any ufo sightings that fit this description but i'm convinced that this was not any kind of an airplane or helicopter. \r\n\r\ni'm a retired educator and i think i'm pretty observant. this is the second time i've seen a possible ufo but the first time was a very quick event and it was gone almost immediately. it was in minnesota and 4 of us witnessed it. this event was spectacular. i don't know how frequently such sightings occur near joliet. i would think that others in the area may have seen it as well.\r\n","distance":"101-500

last night there and we had just finished packing up and we're all hanging out around the camp fire at around 11-1130ish. i was star gazing as i normally do while sitting at the fire when i noticed a large smoke ring like object in the sky. at first i thought it was smoke from the fire until i saw that it was a perfect circle and was about 100 yards or so across, i pointed it out to my brother and step mother and they saw it to. so we grab one of spot lights we had been using to see while loading and we put the spot light on the craft and in a blink of an eye it was gone and had moved about 200-300 yards away still hovering at the same altitude. once we started lighting about 6 other camps in the area all noticed it as well and did the same thing for the next 2 minutes the craft kept zipping around going from stopped to being 500 yards away in less than a second before it disappeared for good. as someone who didn't and believe in ufo this kind of shocked me at the time i remember feeling kind shocked but super curious at the same time, why was the craft floating over open desert like that the six camps were the only life for about 45 miles before you hit the main road. also how did it move so quick nothing man made moves like that we have some amazing technology but that was crazy, and the stealth technology was great had i not been looking hard for star clusters i would have missed it for sure. i am really just curious to see if anyone on this site was there or had a similar experience out in this part of the desert and could she'd some light on what i saw, it's been
