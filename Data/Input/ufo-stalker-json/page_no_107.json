(i am familiar with location because i do my grocery shopping there).  it was amazing to see this type of movement...Stationary in sky, incredible diagonal speed, incredible upward and downward movement.  at one point i saw a plane, not sure if passenger, heading west directly towards the general area this thing was, but appeared plane veered to the left sky area rather than continue its forward westward path.  p.S. after observing that this object was not leaving area, i sat down and observed object for about 45 minutes. i was using  pair of binoculars & x 50 mm.  question: wondering why reports of other ufo sighting in el centro, calif are no longer on ufo staker map. this area is a major ufo route of ufos traveling north from the sea of cortez/gulf of california. i stopped looking up to sky (and reporting ufo sightings) because what i have seen really frightened me - like the red fireball i saw moving from west and heading east; don't remember date but i did report it on this wed site.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:45:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional

beaver moon. what was special about this particular full moon was that it was nearly a supermoon since its orbit brought it to almost its closest distance from earth. \r\n\r\nit was a little after 11 pm and i was getting ready to go up to bed; but before i did i remembered that the beaver moon was occurring. i have been a backyard astronomer for a long time and have always had an interest in the night sky and any celestial events taking place.\r\n\r\ni walked out my front door into the chilly night and looked up. i first noticed the large, bright, full moon shining in the cloudless sky and bathing the night in a soft white glow. - but something else was in the night sky. right around the moon, a small pinpoint of light was darting and swooping around in circles. it was very erratic: moving in tight arcs, pausing for a second, then circling again. it reminded me of the movement gnats make as they buzz through the air with no real, discernible pattern. the object appeared as a whitish-blue light, a bit less bright than the shining moon. if the object were stationary it would have appeared just like a bright star. it was impossible to determine its altitude from my vantage point. \r\n\r\ni quickly pulled my phone from my pocket and held it up to the sky not wanting to miss out on getting a photo. i got one, and i looked up again just in time to see the object seemingly fly behind the moon and out-of-sight. i stood there for approximately five more minutes, but the dancing object didn't appear again.\r\n\r\nif you look at the photo (which was taken at 11:18 pm), you can see the bright moon with a smaller light under it and slightly to the right. i wish that the photo were sharper, but it was the best i could do with a cell phone camera in the dark. a skeptic would easily dismiss the object as just glare from the bright moon, but i can tell you, the point of light in the picture was what i saw sweeping through the air for a number of seconds. even though the photo isn't fantastic, i consider myself lucky that i was able to get it at all. i've been searching the internet all morning to see if anyone else also witnessed what i saw, but haven't found anything as of yet. - keith in nj","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
