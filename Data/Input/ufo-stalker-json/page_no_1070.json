what you would class as an open-minded skeptic when it comes to aerial phenomenon, but tonight's experience was just too bizarre. i have absolutely no way to explain it. thankfully, my girlfriend saw the whole thing at the same time, so i don't have to sound like a nutcase alone...\r\n\r\nhere's what we saw:\r\n\r\nmy girlfriend and i walk our dogs at the local blind school track in brantford almost nightly.\r\n\r\nthe incident took place at some time between 10:33 and 10:37 p.M. on saturday, may 25, 2014. it took us a few minutes of amazement, rapid discussion and swearing to even think of looking at the time.\r\n\r\nthe track is adjacent to the westerly wing of the blind school, and we like to go there to walk our dogs because very few people go there at night and it's down a deep embankment so our dogs stay inside the boundaries of the park and can't stray onto the surrounding roads. we usually let them off their leashes and let them run free for about a half hour then go home.\r\n\r\nas we walk, we talk and usually look upwards to check for shooting stars. it's very dark at the track so it's a great location to star gaze.\r\n\r\ntonight was like any other except that we were possibly expecting to see a meteor or two because we heard comet 209p/linear's trail possibly hit the earth at midnight last night. maybe we would see some stragglers?\r\n\r\nso we're looking up and we noticed at almost 90-degrees straight up what we thought was a satellite. the usual type of affair: a small bright dot moving extremely quickly then slowly fading from view... only this time it flashed slightly, so i commented that sunlight must have caught the fuselage. i'd never seen a satellite flash like that before. it was pretty cool. my girlfriend did not see the flash. it was very brief.\r\n\r\nthose words just left my lips when movement caught my eye to the left of where we were both watching:\r\n\r\ntwo objects, one in front of the other (almost like one was leading or they were tethered together) flew ��� from what we later learned to be the south from my iphone app ��� straight over our heads in a perfect straight line towards the nnw. not directly over our heads, but on a trajectory slightly to the right of us, but well above our heads and the trajectory was a perfect straight line.\r\n\r\nwe both saw it at the exact same time and we both watched it sail over and past us.\r\n\r\nwe see commercial airplanes from hamilton airport (about 30 minutes away from brantford) nightly, but these objects had absolutely no lights or illumination of any kind.\r\n\r\nmy girlfriend thinks they were both a definite shape - either a hexagon or a shape with multiple facets. she has much better eyesight than me. i saw it as two ovals, but shaped like compressed rugby balls with the points dulled. not as pointy as a rugby ball. \r\n\r\ni can't tell if the objects were circular and appeared as ovals from the angle of our viewpoint, but after i thought about the shape as a rugby ball shape and thought it was curious that the shape would be the opposite orientation (north-south) to what i would think a circular object would look like from our vantage point (compressed east-west).\r\n\r\nthey moved at extremely high speed, i would say they moved from a 40 to 45 degree angle where we both noticed them in the sky over our heads and past the trees to the nnw of our position in less than 3 seconds.\r\n\r\nthey were completely silent, no engine noise or sounds of any kind.\r\n\r\nthey were a dull white or grey matt finish. it's hard to say whether they were white, high up and the darkness made them appear grey, or they were grey and closer to us. regardless, i'm a graphic designer by trade and i would estimate the tonal range to be around about 60-70% black, if you were to estimate the darkness of the grey against the black background of the sky.\r\n\r\nwe wondered between ourselves later as to whether the objects were part of a larger structure above it that we could not see and was possibly darker in hue - we wondered this because the lead object and the trailing or following object didn't deviate from the same path from left to right and the distance between them was fixed at all times, almost like they were solidly connected.\r\n\r\nthe height or distance from the ground neither of us could guess at. there was absolutely no point of reference that we could use to ascertain the height of the objects, but it did fly over the trees to the nnw of our location and they are over 50 feet tall i would imagine.\r\n\r\nthat said, i got the impression that they were quite a distance above us (maybe a couple of hundred feet), but that's more of a hunch than anything i can estimate with physical evidence. who knows?\r\n\r\nthe size of the objects i would place at about a centimeter in diameter in the sky. they stayed the same size throughout the flight path, so i assume they didn't ascend or descend any discernible amount.\r\n\r\nthe first thing we tried to do was debunk the experience - was it an aircraft? no lights. no sounds. high rate of speed. absolutely not. was it a bird? maybe a couple of herons or a crane from the river a few miles away? not flying that fast, and not in the straight, unwavering, almost robotic motion that they moved in.\r\nwas it a couple of low-flying party balloons caught in the wind? i highly doubt it because there wasn't a breath of wind tonight in the park. i know we were likely sheltered in the park's hilly terrain, but the speed that they were moving in and the shape of the objects would suggest something that wasn't a couple of balloons.\r\n\r\nwe wondered about a glider. we have a small airport to the south of brantford, but why was it flying at night? why did it not have any lights and to fly that fast it would need to be extremely low to the ground and on a collision course for the houses above the hill.\r\n\r\nnothing makes sense. \r\n\r\nall we do know is what we saw was extremely unusual. unusual for both of us to think that this was something extraordinary and it needed documenting.\r\n\r\nthat's all we can remember. the event was so fast, none of us had an opportunity to even think about pulling out a camera phone and documenting it firsthand. we stood around at the top of the hill (where we can see more of the surrounding skies for another half hour before heading home. we saw nothing else.\r\n\r\ni thought of maybe drawing what we saw, but all it would look like would be two ovals on a black background. if you want, i can try and submit it later.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

Barrette","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"As a teenager i was spending my summers at our family summer residence on a lake, close to mont-laurier, qc. at the beginning of the summer i was alone at that chalet with my father who was sometimes working in the evening at his office, a few miles from the chalet in mt-laurier. i can identify the exact place on google earth: i can say herein it was roughly w: 75 degrees, and latitude n: 46 degrees. one evening at about 9 i was reading alone in the living room of this chalet, on a chair facing the large windows overseeing the lake. i was alone and there was no noise anywhere but an occasional bird. suddenly i felt observed and uneasy, i lowered my book to look at the window. outside, but almost touching the window, about 10 feet from me, and well lit up by the living room lights, was a creature observing me intently without moving. i was instantly very frighten, my hair was standing on my head. i remembered running to close the screen-window of the outside door on the side of the building on my left, 8 feet from my sitting position, and to lock the door knob. (the windows facing the lake where the creature was had no openings). i do not remember anything afterwards, which seems strange to me because i would have continued observing the creature, logically. in the subsequent years, i had several nightmares about that evening and when i was waking up, originally i was remembering the creature as being a cougar observing me in the window, and after a few years, always in my dreams, i remembered the event differently, and the creature then appeared to me as a three feet tall slim humanoid with big black eyes. i am unsure of what i have seen. after many years, i saw the book \"communion\" from whitley strieber in a book store, and the drawing on the coverage made a strong impression on me since i had the impression that it was similar to what i have seen. i bought the book and it seems to me that what happened to me in 1971 could have been what i believe strieber calls a \"screened memory\". i am unsure, because a book like communion when you do not know much on the subject of ufo causes some emotions, but i am still very uneasy with the event. i also had, about 10 years after, an episode of lost time, when i was living in an apartment in montreal. i would like to be hypnotized by a specialist who is aware of the abduction phenomena; he could make me remember, and perhaps this could reassure me that the creature which scared me that evening was in fact a cougar. there were some in the vicinity, although just a few sightings were reported at the time. note that my older sister is certain that she had observed, in these times but perhaps not the same year, a ufo for about 20 minutes, flying in various directions over the island and the lake, from the same chalet. my sister is a down-to-earth librarian (retired now) and i am a down-to-earth professional accountant. if i asked her she would report it to you anonymously. i also had another strange event where i heard a voice in my head with a very specific sentence, a warning, which appears unrelated and i can describe to your group, if you find it worth something. i cannot submit any evidence of these events.","distance":"20 Feet or

minute.\r\n\r\ni was mowing my lawn and when coming up to the west block wall to make a turn i noticed that there was an energetic change in the atmosphere immediately around me, then it became difficult to see the wall, there was something like a mirage in front of me. then i sensed an acute increase in this energy around me and i thought to myself \"there is something wrong with me maybe i'm having a stroke\".\r\n\r\nsecond part. 1-2 min\r\n\r\ni was greatly worried and noticed that i had a thought that this was familiar like i had been through this before and then i started feeling panicky and went to turn the mower around and as i did then it hit me \"im being abducted again\". fight or flight kicked in when i saw the being 4 feet in front of me semi transparent holding something. i tried to ram him with the lawnmower but i was paralyzed - stuck - helpless. the thing he was holding flashed and i was then unconscious.\r\n\r\nthird part. \r\n\r\ni felt like i was dropping, yet still unconscious and when i could open my eyes i was on my bed in all of my dirty clothes with my shoes on. \r\nit was 5:30pm.\r\n\r\nforth part.\r\n\r\nmy right arm was hurting so i looked and had a big bruise on my shoulder.\r\nnow at this point my memory was fuzzy and did not know what happened to me.\r\ni went outside and saw that the lawn was not finished and there were grass clippings all over the porch and the mower was in the middle of the porch. i never leave things this way. \r\n\r\ni was woozy and perplexed. i sat outside until 2:am wondering what happened to me and why are things this way. i was so dismayed i could not sleep. finally i did, and at 4:30 am i woke up in a panic because the memories came flooding back to me from the back yard. so i got a pen and paper and wrote the event down. now i call this an abduction because since i was 5 yrs of age i have had night time abductions. my first experience at five i received 2 scoop marks on my right arm and have the scars to this day.\r\ni don't ever remember any daytime events before this.This has scarred me to death. there is something more benign about night abductions. being taken away in the middle of the day while completely conscious. no paralysis and obviously against my will is new to me and i want to know if this has happened to anyone else.\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

North","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I used to live on camp pendleton in san onofre housing #1. i want to say it was some time in mid to late 2011, me and three friends were on a side road to the 5-fwy called \"trestle's trail\" that leads to the beach, we were atop the cliff overlooking the shore and the ocean, around 8pm, in the ocean we saw a red light turn on and was just bobbing in the water, in some time two more red lights appeared bobbing in the water. we continued to watch for about 45mins as the lights would turn off, turn green, and multiply until their were about 13 lights bobbing in the water. we then decided to head home, me and one of my friends i was with lived in sanonofre 1 so we walked together as the other two went towards officer housing in san mateo (another gate of camp pendleton housing).About 30mins after we separated we were near home but decided to stop at a spot nicknamed \"the view\", next to san onofre middle school, to get a look at the lights again. we watched them bob for another 20 minutes before about half of them ascended and zoomed in formation into space without making a sound, as 5-6 others came in to view from what i'd say to be a warp-speed capacity and gently stop for half a second and then dive into the water and all of the lights in the water at that time disappeared as if diving down with the newly arrived ones. so we stay there for another 20 minutes fixated on the ocean before noticing there's a sort of stereotypical looking saucer-and-dome with a white light circling the diameter of the saucer, it was as high as a helicopter might fly, it was making slow, wide orbits around us overhead.  after some more time had passed we started walking from the dirt path we were on towards the houses we lived in up the hill and then we saw another fleet of the red/green light ships (they were all red at this time). they were moving fast, and low, id say only 50-60 feet in the air, and still not making a sound. the one in the lead of the formation did a loop while it passed us, quickly slowing speed and coming lower to us, about 30ft, then within 2 seconds of that, it matched the speed of the fleet and continued in the lead, they were being pursued by what we thought were highly sophisticate, small and quiet fighter jets but upon reflection they must have been drones. the fleet of ships went over the ocean where we had seen all the other activity, passing through a cloud, the drones were in quick pursuit but without any sort of sound or light being emitted they did not come out the other side of the cloud like the ufos had, then half the fleet of ships dove into the ocean and the other half zoomed out of sight towards the stars. but i saw with good detail the ship that broke formation over us, their ships are incredible. they were of a smooth metal, like liquid mercury, and their shape was like a red blood cell, with the red half-sphere light atop in the middle. they were probably about 6ft wide and about 12ft long, it wasn't even higher than the telephone pole we were next to. so we returned to 'the view' and watched curiously for another 45 minutes, but nothing else happened so again we started walking home. at the same light pole we saw the blood-cell ship at we noticed the stereotypical dome ship was still observing us, following us overhead, so we stopped and i started waving my hands like you'd do in an s.O.S, and it started orbiting in a circle above us again and then descended to where he was probably only 10 feet higher than the telephone pole and hovered there for about a minute and then all of a sudden zoomed into space, just as fast and quiet as the rest...","distance":"21-100 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

been mufon, but i don't know. i can't search your database that far back.\r\n  that report occurred when i was a veteran air traffic controller at chicago center south area. in approximately december 1993, i was working the chicago departures at a very busy time in the evening with aircraft heading towards terra haute vortac and southwards.  indianapolis center was my adjoining facility and suddenly did something they never did before or after in my career, they closed their airspace to all my high altitude traffic.  i spent several minutes turning all aircraft into the opposite direction and shutting down departures from chicago,and finally i got the word from my manual controller that the indianapolis controller reported that the pilot of an aircraft travelling from east to west along my border freaked out upon having a close encounter with a ufo.  i reported this in a timely matter to the ufo organization whom i can't rememember and suggested they request the tapes from indianapolis artcc.  \r\n  however an even stranger event occurred to me within a few months of the above event that i did not report.  it occurred just a little to the north of the previous report. it was late in the evening and i had taken over all the airspace in the south area which can be described as a rough square surrounding chicago, lafayette, indiana, and peoria, illinois.  i don't remember any aircraft on my frequency at the time, so i was bored and just staring at the scope at a fairly wide range.  i then noticed what i thought to be a departure from grissom afb.  i only recieved a primary radar target, without a transponder.  it started out somewhat normally, but immediately i realized it was quickly accelerating.  generally, at the range my radar was set for, a commercial jet moved about an eighth of an inch per 10 seconds or so.  however as i watched this object continue to accelerate to the sw towards la or god knows where, it gained unimaginable speeds in a straight line. i had to crank out my scope to maximum range to follow it, i believe 240 nm.  towards the time it left my radar it was updating its position about 1 and a half inches per ten seconds and still accelerating.  as far as i know grissom never launched missiles, and i'm sure that there were no airspace warnings that evening for such an event, but it was clearly not close to anything i was familiar with in almost 20 years of aviation experience.\r\n  another event occurred north of baltimore in august 1996.  standing outside looking to the east i saw three white lights in a perfect equilateral triangle travelling from north to south.  the lights weren't blinking as an aircrat would.  they appeared to be satellites, and moving at that approximate speed.  i watched them for about a minute, until they had traversed about three fouths of my horizon.  then the lead object disapeared, and within less than a second the two bases of the triangle also disapeared.  it was a cloudless night.\r\n  in october 2000, i was in gopalpur, india on my rooftop terrace when i noticed a bright red light near my zenith. at first i thought it was mars.  but within seconds it began darting about in small but very distinct ways.  eventhough it hoverred and darted about for at least half an hour directly above me i can not figure out what it was. finally my wife came home, and i got her to come up to see it.  but when we returned the object had moved far to the ne and was not darting around and could have been mistaken for a red star.\r\n  my last real report is second hand and comes from my mother who still swears by it.  in september? 1966, my father (a phd physicist working on the apollo missions), and my mother (a masters degree teacher) were on our patio on the atlantic ocean in indiatlantic just south of cape kennedy.  they were unusual for the time in that neither drank or took drugs.  however they observed an object that first appeared to the east along the horizon over the ocean.  at tremendous speed it moved directly over our house and hoverred silently at an altitude of about 30 feet, where it remained for over a minute.  it was a classic ufo shape and had three coloured lights that rotated or blinked. i'd have to ask hor that detail.  after that, the craft silently but with phenomenal accelaration departed nw.  my dad called patrick afb up the road to see if they had seen anything unusual visually or on radar and got a negative response.\r\n  these are all real, but the most vivid experience i ever had was after i mistakenly took 16 hits of window pane lsd.  i only meant to take four.  it was april 1977 in san francisco and nearly a full moon and mostly overcast.  however as the clouds parted the moon transformed into the mother ship.  it was enourmous, bigger than a city, countless rooms and people were there, and silent.  i was transported into the ship by a beam of light, placed on a medical examination table where a person scanned me with a hand held device but never touched me.  they seemed human to me, let me go where i could fly along with them, and watch out the window.  it seemed we were flying at aircraft speed to the east (towards area 51?) through valleys and firebrakes or utility cuttings in the tree lines.  it seemed to go on for hours and it seemed to me that some famous dead celebrities were aboard.  the trip was amazing even after i got off the craft, as i jumped from mountain top to mountain top all the way down to baja mexico where i learned to fly like superman all the way to india.  there is still a small part of me that thinks that this really happenned as it was so vivid.\r\n  the funniest one was when i lived on the 22nd floor of an apartment building in downtown chicago facing west.  i awoke that morning to observe a large object about a mile away and not much higher than i.  it was silver metallic and round from my point of view.  i watched it for nearly half an hour hover motionlessly and silently.  i really thought this was the time of mass alien contact, until it gradually shifted to face north and i realized it was a blimp.  motionless head on blimps can be quite odd looking in the sky.  i apologize for getting off the subject of my real sightings.

with a co-worker on the south side of the building.  i had just finished telling my co-worker about a meteor shower occuring that evening and was looking up at the sky in hopes of seeing the shower.  \r\nthe night was totally quiet at that moment.  not a single bird, cricket, or any normal night-time noise.  and my initial reaction of \"what the f@*% !!\" was clearly heard by a person in a nearby backyard.\r\nas i was looking up, i observed eight lights in a v formation approaching from the south in a northerly direction.  when they travelled over my head, i could see that the object blocked out stars, and it was soundless.  the object was approximately one hundred feet above me, and i could see clearly that the lights were \"pot-light\" and unblinking.  i could see that the lights were outlined as if they were indented inside of an object.\r\nmy first thought was that this object might be a stealth plane, but it was too quiet, given the altitude and speed.\r\nas the formation travelled over the building, i ran away from the building to continue to observe, and as i got a clear view, they lights spilt apart into four separate groups of two, that started a spiraling aerial manouvers in different directions for approximately five seconds.\r\nthen in unison, the four sets of lights, streaked north in a very, very fast speed, then out of my vision, or line of sight.\r\nafter fourty seconds, i then observed two planes that seemed as though they were flying in the same direction that the objects were traveling.  these planes were about fifty feet of altitude apart and about one hundred feet away from each other longitudinal.  the planes had normal plane characteristics, such as a straight flight path, blinking lights, etc.\r\nthis is the second time i have observed this particular object, at approximately the same time, three weeks prior, so i was pleased to see it re-appear and have at least my co-worker observe the last set of lights spiral then streak off.  \r\nthis sighting did scare me a lot, as it was closer than the first sighting, and it does defy what i \"know to exist\".  no plane or any object that i have seen ever in my life has
