i was stressed out and had a drink, one drink.  i finally was going to be and all of the sudden i could not move in my bed i was physically frozen.  then a light came on outside on the patio and the large brass platter above my bed was shaking and buzzing like a speaker.  i had the curtain closed on the patio doors so all i saw was a bright light.  then all of the sudden there 6 grey aliens standing around my bed. they seemed to be like a hologram projection of them.  they said to me i was a leader and that they would help me in the future or i would help them in any case there would be more contact. then they dissipated and the platter was still buzzing as they went away and the light lifted slowly at first then fast they platter buzzed for quite a few minutes till it faded away as they left.\r\n\r\ni remember being on their ships in what seemed like dreams several times before that with them sticking probes into my side and things like that i never felt threatened.  i started craving protein and my health improved noticeably.\r\n\r\nthen i seemed to have a relationship with them when i would pray with my native pipe they would come and show up face to face in dreams and say hi.\r\n\r\nwhen something major was going on like my cabin burned down in minnesota they came face to face again.  \r\n\r\ni was involved with native american spiritual ceremonies and pursuing virtues as a spiritual path.  i think telepathic greys use and pursue virtues because if you know what the other guy is thinking you have to also high technology requires virtues.\r\n\r\ni have two fantastic children i got thru ceremony bridge and keegan they greys came to me one day in a dream and said to me \"how do you like your genetically engineered children\" they are amazing beautiful emotionally well balanced straight a kids. the leaders of tomorrow.\r\n\r\nthen i had a whopper vision dream well it seemed very real for sure not a dream.   i over came a bunch of shamanic obstacles in a dream call them fears challenges or whatever, dream work if you will.  then all of the sudden i was on a ship.  in a bed room there were other young people there. you were allowed one possession a guitar skateboard whatever.  you could picture your room any way you wanted it and it was like a holograph it would appear in that form pretty cool. \r\n\r\nthen i was invited on to the bridge of the ship. you cold see thru the windows the stars passing by. there were several greys standing at control panels in front of the windows.  there was a captains chair and in it was the queen alien if you will.  she was noticeably bigger than the other ones.  she said come here and i sat on her lap. she said to me \"you must of gone thru quite a lot to get this far\".  \"put you thoughts into the swirling orb of rainbows.  there was rainbow ball of energy floating in the room that controlled the ship and the future.  so i put my thoughts into the orb.  then she said \"i love you \" and i was

the river yare, and having sat down on the seat over looking the river situated south of bland road, norwich, norfolk, uk, we were commenting on the fighter jets roaring above our heads at great height. they looked very small when out of the white clouds. i said they were not playing war games but chasing a ufo radar contact for i knew from previous experiences how to tell the difference. we watched a fighter plane go into a great pulled about fluffy white cloud that was unlike the other clouds and i said to my son to watch for a ufo to come out of the other end of it. there was a short gap between that cloud and the next and as we watched it a craft of huge size materialized within the gap. it was not moving but just hovering. it was in shape hard to describe as it seemed that the outer edge was not so visible but it was long like a cigar and light metallic green in colour with two bars or rails running along ether side underneath that shone a brighter metallic green. after around ten seconds or so it dematerialized and a jet fighter came out of the cloud, which was tiny like a fly in comparison to the ufo. we could hear the jets after burners and see them at times going extremely fast, then slow right down and turn as if trying to find it once again. i got the impression that the ufo was kind of playing games with them. the time of the sighting was 14:20 and the craft was almost overhead and slightly to the east. i have watched something like this now three times from or near my home, and over the twenty years i have lived here i have seen a good few sightings. once one has seen them it becomes habit to keep an eye on the sky and to learn how to look. i am sure the raf would just say what they always say, that they were just playing war games or practicing. however all three times i have seen these happenings it was over built up areas and the flying was frantic. i���m afraid that i did not have the time or togetherness to get my phone out

sightings/visitations of ufo related instances. a couple of years ago when i still lived in humboldt county, northern ca, i randomly had a string of dreams that were all different variations of me looking up in the sky, seeing a black ufo looking object and then i become shocked/overwhelmed with sleep paralysis.(a frozen like state where i'm aware of my surroundings, yet paralyzed without mobility and with total fear.) to say the least, the first time it happened, maybe 2ish in the morning, i looked up saw a black object, shimmering with multiple layers of metallic blackness and im struck with paralysis, my eyes in the dream become closed, my body is fetal up and i hear a booming jet engine like humming resonating in the backroom. the noise had a metallic sound almost like i was in a different room at this time. all i remember after that moment was pleading to myself, in my head, yelling please don't hurt me, please don't hurt me, please don't hurt me. i then slowly drifted asleep, like you would if you were tranquilized only to wake up in my bed clinching to my girlfriend in fear, waking her frantically telling her my experience. she was so confused that it really didn't impact her much, so i layed scared to go back to sleep. i had 2 different dreams like this one in different variations, i wont go too much into detail so i can carry onto my real-life sightings that all occurred within a 2-3 month period. but the second dream was of a cigar ufo in the distance that ended up flashing 3 consecutive lights, starting from right, middle, then left and then i was again put into paralysis, but that time much slower, not as instantaneous as the first time, and to this day i still have dreams where ufos are in the sky and they basically haunt me, but moving on. \r\n\r\nim outside one night taking my dog out to go do his business, and it was right when i got home from work, still wearing shirt and tie and all. as i take him to my side yard, i lean on my trucks front end, lean up and look at the sky. (im a huge star gazer, i can gaze for hours!) and this night struck me because it was so amazingly clear, a truly crisp night to stare at stars. as i stare in delight because its not overcast for once, i notice something catch my eye, moving from right to left. at first i thought i saw a flock of birds, because they come quite often overhead. so as a take a second glance my eyes focus on a perfect equilateral triangle that was cloaked/almost invisible, with the tip pointing to the left zooming across the sky. and the crazy part about it is that the only reason i noticed the object was because the triangle was blacker than the nights sky. the sky seemed like it was a greyish bluish black tint, and this thing was full on blacked out. i basically saw a black silhouette, with no lights and no sound. (the second time i saw this same exact triangle on a different night maybe a few weeks later, the black triangle, same shape and color, moving in a slightly different direction had 3 lights on each tip of the black triangle. and the third and last time i saw this exact same craft, on a different night soon after, the black triangle had no lights on the tips, but it had a faint but distinguishable light was emanating from within and showed through multiple vents that lined the bottom of the triangle. it was the fist time it wasn't completely cloaked!) these sightings all spooked the hell out of me, but also awakened me to the total awesomeness of the unknown that lurks in our deep space. one other notable sighting i saw, which was my first sighting and it happened maybe months before these black triangle sighting, it was my very first sighting that i couldn't explain. it was basically a star looking object that moved like a satellite, but was much bigger. as it moved across the sky and i gained notice, it blinks, then disappeared, and reappeared more to the right as it stayed in a consistent motion. it blink and disappeared a second time, then the third time it reappeared it flashed a light, that lit of a small blip in the sky, but it was 25-50 times bigger than the initial star like light. my last sighting was where i live now, in the bay area in ca. i was out, taking my dog out, again lol, and i looked up and saw 4 stars all in unison, spread out like a boomerang, moving slowly over my apt complex. it moved slow and looked almost cartoony. it makes me gasp in shock and smile in fear every time. i hope it stays positive and doesn't escalate, but so far it been benign and feels like a type of spiritual awakening to the truth.\r\n\r\ni do fear the dreams where i now fear looking up because of the paralysis that comes with it, but a part of me thinks that it may be some sort of message or even an invitation to open my brain further. maybe all i'm supposed to do is let go and accept the paralysis. i've read stuff and have practiced astral projections and o.B.E.S. maybe that's why i'm having these experiences. i don't know. but if anyone else has had similar experiences. please share them with me, i would love to hear your story.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Window(s),  Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":56555,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.8043612,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05242014-0009","longitude":-124.1558129,"occurred":1325440860000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1400932440000,"summary":"First multiple dreams of ufo induced sleep paralysis, then multiple sightings of a cloaked black triangle zooming over my house at night, once when summoned. still have constant dreams of ufo sightings","tags":["triangle","ufo"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"95501","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":873,"locationName":"Eureka, California","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:158753"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"New Rochelle","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Laying in bed, bright white light filled room, woke me up.Thaught helicopter was hovering outside window.Knew that was impossible too many trees outside window. at the time i was lighting director at school, so i know about light entensity and distance, then the light turned red from window. it saturated the room like a fog. then i sat up on the side of the bed. looking at this red light that filled the room.Something was not right i know this was no ordnary light.\r\nsuddenly the door to my room started to open slowly, about 3/4. then three aliens stood there.Two short ones 4 ft each, another 5 ft between them.I said to my self.. oh aliens.. i wasent afraid except i was not expecting them.They stood there for a moment then the larger one started moving her fingers to instruct the other two.I just knew the larger one was female.She was the boss.\r\n  now i just started remembering this like 20 years ago. im 54 now. i was a teenager at the time.So then the nurse i found out later said they wanted to take me in ther craft and examine me.( non talking )i said where is your space ship ans she replied back there.

other alien ( the doctor came in, she was affraid of this guy.He took my left arm and started to stick some big !! needle in it.Then i started to scream, they i became restrained, i think they put some big ass probe up my nose, it was long too.And hurt beyond any pain i could tell the doctor was pissed off, like he had enough of these stupid humans screaming and doing the job in general. i ve herd that these greys have no imotion but they do, this guy got really mad at me for screaming and calling the nurse to help me, she split afraid of the doctor and was somewhere in the backround, he was pulling and sticking me harder and harder everytime i yelled and screamed.. like take that !!You stupid human\r\n finally he threw down my arm in discust like working on a car engine and nothing is going right to fix it..He gave up !! this doctor was powerful and you could feel the energy he admitted, it almost made you feel sick being neer him.The next thing i remember i was wandering around the table from a distance maybe 10 feet, they were working on another person now. i yelled for my friend the nurse and she appeared from the darkness, i went to grab her like a baby to his mommy.. and six of the alien workers on the operating table put down there tools to come and get me, like a animal got loose. i went over to the nurse and hugged her, they just stoped.. in there tracks an stared at me holding on to my friend the nurse.They were startled as though they had never seed a human hug a grey, it really suprised them and they kind of looked at each other,she put her hand around my head and said its ok, the doctors went right back to work like nothing happened,she left me alone for a few minutes and i walked around. not one of the doctors paid any attention to me, like i was one of the family.Ok so then i said to the nurse what about my ride.She braught me into a room with one guy, like working on an old telegraph bord plugging in wires to different holes.She said he was very busy but would ask\r\n  the next thing i knew we were up around 10000 ft looking strait down like the bottom of the craft was transparent, the entire landscape was lit as if it were daylight( it was 3 or 4 at night )crystal clear..Next thing i knew i was sitting up in bed, i went to sleep and forgot about it for what 30 years.Sounds wild right..I sware thats the truth !!","distance":"101-500

or anything like that, so i did a really bad job filling out the thing for a report..\r\n\r\nthis happened a couple of hours ago.. it was nighttime.. the street lights pollute the sky a little bit.. i was outside listening to coast to coast am waiting for the meteor shower.. i was looking for meteors, and that's when i saw this disk shape object \"glide\" by in the sky.. it just, glided, so smoothly.. it was nuts.. \r\n\r\nit was obviously a solid object.. \r\n\r\n\r\ni guess you could say that it was a disk.. i say disk and circle, because i don't think that there is a big difference? it didn't look like it had a room sticking out of the top of it. and, there were no windows or anything that i could see..\r\n but it was thick.\r\n\r\n\r\nthis was my first ufo experience ever! it looked like a metallic color, a dirty, dark, metallic color, but it wasn't reflective.. not that i could tell anyway.. it wasn't as big as i expected a ufo to be.. it wasn't huge or anything..\r\n\r\n it was about as high as if you would stack two normal sized trees on top of one another facing up. that's about how high it was.. \r\n\r\nit flew over one of the buildings here, and a couple of trees next to the buildings, and of course there were power lines around.. i am not crazy! this is the most \"real\" thing that i have ever seen!.. it looked so 3d, too.. it looked so real yet it 'seemed' \"unreal\".. it's hard to explain, i was in shock..Shock. i had a great view of it, too..\r\n\r\nit went by in a perfectly straight line.. smoothly.\r\n\r\n i could tell that it was \"thick\" it was not really \"flat\".. i had a huge panic attack after i saw it.. when i saw it at first. i just kind of sat there and stared..\r\n\r\n i guess that i saw it for a few seconds, but those seconds seemed like minutes when it happened.. it did not shoot across the sky like a shooting star. it moved slower than that, but it was still fast.. it was slow enough for me to realize that it was thick, and a dark dirty metallic color, i guess.. it was obvious in the sky... \r\n\r\nit stood out like a sore thumb. there was no sound. no lights. it was very smooth. i just sat there and stared until it disappeared into the distance. as soon as it was gone i grabbed my lawn chair and went to the front door as fast as i could.. i had a panic attack for like an hour.. i was trembling, shaking.. i just can't believe it..\r\n\r\n i have never seen a ufo until now... i was actually afraid to post this.. i was debating about it for a while. that's why i am not going to give out my name or exact location.. i still need to process this.. i am not going back outside to see the shower.. screw that! i have attached a picture/description of what i saw.. i can't draw, though, lol. but hopefully you

left her house at midnight. taking the 91 freeway home, my friend drove and i rested my head on the window of the passenger seat and fell asleep. i was awakened by a voice that said to look out the window. i thought it was my friend speaking to me. i said \"what?\" she said,\"i didn't say anything.\" confused by what i heard, i turned my head to look, and i saw a red ball outside my window. it looked to me to be about the size of a tennis ball or somewhat larger. i thought it was a reflection coming from something in the car or possibly a power pole reflector light, or one of those poles with reflectors on them, as there was a light plane airport in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nafter scanning the area, i saw there were no power poles and none for planes either. examining the inside of the car, there was no reflections coming from anything. i asked my friend to speed up... the ball stayed with us. i asked her to slow down, the ball was still there. she thought i was crazy and asked me what i was doing. she didn't see the ball at first. i asked her to pull over on the shoulder. she did. we got out of the car and the ball was about 30 feet away from us...Not moving. she asked me what it was. i had no idea. we got back in the car and this time...I drove. i pulled out into the slow lane and drove on for a minute or two. i looked again and saw the ball was now gone. i decided it had to be a reflection from something i just didn't notice at the moment. \r\n\r\nafter about ten minutes, i saw what i thought was a car coming straight for us in the oncoming lane. looking at it, i decided it was just glare from night driving. i thought it was oncoming traffic, coming around the bend by the mountains and it just looked like it was in my lane. saturday night traffic was heavy, and i tried to change lanes to avoid an accident, just in case i was wrong and it was heading straight for us. i couldn't change without hitting someone else. there was traffic on both sides of me, in front of me and behind. if i slammed on the brakes, there would be a rear-end collision and the people behind me could get killed, so i took my foot off the gas and the brake altogether. \r\n\r\n i braced for a head-on collision. i reached over to put my arm in front of my friend to try to shield her and raised my legs up to the steering wheel, hoping the wheel wouldn't crush my chest. closing my eyes, i knew we were going to probably get badly hurt or killed. after a few seconds of waiting for the crash, nothing happened. i opened my eyes and saw that the car in my lane wasn't a car at all. it was in front and above my car. i saw clearly it was a air craft unlike anything i had ever seen. \r\n\r\nit was huge. at least 2 football fields in length or more. the front of it was a horseshue shape with a blueish, purpleish hue around it. it looked like an enormous bumper like you would see on a bumper car at the fairgrounds. it was that shape and the hue around it was moving, pulsing. i leaned forward towards the dash and looked out the window, to see it clearer and so did my friend. glancing into the rearview mirror, i saw there was no one on the freeway. no one. not in front or behind or to the side of me. mysteriously, what was seconds before a crowded freeway, all three lanes were empty except for me. i opened the door and got out. there was no sound, not one. quiet. this craft glided over my car silently. i watched it glide down the freeway until it was gone. \r\n\r\nfor some reason, i began to feel panic. i was frightened out of my mind. i stepped on the gas and sped home. when i got there, i looked at the horizon from my balcony. i wondered why it looked like the sun was coming up, as i left the bbq at midnight and lived not an hour away. i looked at the clock. it was five thirty in the morning. i was momentarily confused by that, but then, never gave it another thought. my friend and i drew what we saw on napkins. the images were identical. \r\n\r\nthe next morning, i woke up sick. so was my friend. she was depressed and cried all day. she said she didn't know what was wrong with her. she was confused and miserable. i told her i was sick too, and that was not like either of us. \r\n\r\ntwo neighbors came to visit. i told them what happened the night before. they thought it would be great fun to go to the same place, again, that night. i was scared and didnt want to go, but i gave in and we went. we left after dinner. at weir canyon road on the 91 freeway, we saw at least fifty cars hugging the shoulder up against the mountains. eveyone was out of their cars and watching the sky. we did the same thing. it was about eight at night, and the sky was full of red balls, darting in and out, from side to side, up and down, thousands of them. they were chasing each other. all of a sudden, a huge white light snapped on from high in the sky and the whole crowd gasped. it snapped on and snapped off several times, just like a lightbulb the size of an football arena.  \r\n\r\nwe watched this light show for about an hour and then i drove all over riverside that night, looking for anything that would tell me what that was. asking at a gas station, a helicopter, a huge one, completely white; looking like a twelve passenger helicopter, no markings, blacked out windows except for the pilots window, came over the freeway and almost down on top of my car. the wind from the blades was blowing dust and debree into my eyes. march airforce base was close by, and i figured it was from there. it left and went down the freeway. i could see the pilot. he had what looked like a military helmet and goggles on. i knew something was terribly wrong. somehow i just knew they had followed me to the gas station at the bottom of the freeway at weir canyon road. we were all scared and decided to leave right away and go home.\r\n\r\nalmost immediately, i was not able to walk normally. my neck was stiff and i couldnt straighten my head. my walking gait was like i was under the influence of something. i couldnt concentrate. my eyes burned and my tastebuds no longer worked. i could taste nothing. the company i worked for which made computer printers, called me into the office and asked me if i had a  drinking problem as i was stumbling around the plant. \r\n\r\ni knew i couldn't tell them i saw a ufo and now i something was wrong with me. they fired me over time, saying i needed alcohol treatment. when i told them i didnt drink at all and never used drugs, they didnt believe me. i lost my job. as a result, i lost my apartment, my car, everything i had in life. i could no longer remember how to drive or do the work i had done for years. i had major panic attacks daily and nightmares.  \r\n\r\nit took three years of massive medications and doctors visits to begin to walk normally and to be able to think again. i am ok now, and have attended college and am the senior rabbi of temple beth sinai in hemet california, yet, even now, i have to think carefully how to start my car and at times, i have no memory of where i am. i have lived in hemet for years and know this town like the back of my hand, but still get lost anyway. at times, nothing looks familiar to me and i dont know where i am. during these times, i have learned to not panic. i just sit quietly and calm down. in a few minutes, it passes and i'm alright again.  \r\n\r\nit was at least five years later, when recalling this incident to a group of friends that i realized that when the craft went over my car, i had not shut off the engine, i had just put it in park, yet, i had to start it when i got back in the car. i realized at that moment i had the radio on that night, but when i left, it wasn't on. i realized i had no memory of many things that obviously  happened that night. \r\n\r\nsince then, i have been obsessed with ufo's. i have watched every documentary made on the subject, trying to find anything that was like what i saw that night. i am driven by it. i've been everywhere trying to find an answer. area 51, rachel neveda, everywhere. i've talked to everyone and anyone who has seen something they can't explain. i have tried to find anyone who was out on the freeway that night with no success. i have no pictures or video to send you. in 1975, i had no such gagets. \r\n\r\nthis incident took three years out of my life with no explainable illness that the doctors could find except one...They said my autonomic nervous system was blown out by something. they asked me where i had been and what i had been doing. i could not tell them what really happened for fear they would send me to a hospital for the mentally handicapped. i have been urged by close friends to have regression therapy and have considered it, but the idea of it frightens me beyond belief, for reasons unknown to me. i'm afraid of what might be there. i don't know why i'm afraid, i just am. \r\n\r\ni'm looking for some kind of help, someone who can explain this to me, give me some answers, to hopefully end this obsession with ufo's.   \r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet,

progressively became chronic to the point we both had to start using a nebulizer machine to help us breathe.  as i thought about this more and more it dawned on me that i had seen the same looking sphere 6 months prior to this sighting.  it was in january the same year, and was traveling in the same easterly direction only north of us.  it was at night because it was dark, but i don't recall the time.  i was upstairs in my room sleeping and for some reason i woke up and went to my sliding doors to look outside.  i could see it pretty well back then because my trees weren't as tall as they are now.  i told my husband the next morning and he asked me, \"who ya going to tell?\"  ","distance":"21-100

behavior. the high altitude ones commonly appear to dive in and out of the atmosphere, you will see them flying by at a high rate(much faster than planes, satellites, or any other \"known\" craft. the flight characteristics are incredible. there is little light pollution where i live, and at over 5000ft altitude we have a near perfect view of the sky, we see many meteors, there is a lot of airplane traffic, so its busy up there and you can see everything. i have noticed many anomalies over the years here, i have always been highly intrigued. these last few months have been night after night with these things. the most significant experience happen about a week ago. slow moving, venus sized object, couldn't have been more than a mile up, felt closer. moving almost directly above me, i have never felt fear in any of my experiences, but this began to unnerve me. out of some uncomfortable feeling i raised my hand and began to wave to it. at this point it flared up to roughly the size of a full moon, i couldn't tell if it was a beam directed at me or what because i almost fell down in fear. i still get that feeling right now as i write this. nothing else came about, it moved off as silently and slowly as it came. i won't go into more detail here, but there is more to tell, and show if you want to check this out. i can promise within a few hours or days, i can show anyone what i'm talking about.

then one of the hikers said under a breath \"did you see the strange \"scaffold\" in the sky? we had observed it as we parked our car?\" the hikers vehicle is photographed early in the sequence... this is all the info i have on this subject. but if you have seen this object please drop me a message i just would like to know... that besides me and the other 3 individuals we're not alone in seeing this amazing sight!","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":56533,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.64413,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05232014-0011","longitude":-122.87239,"occurred":1400414700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,   A","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1400881974000,"summary":"Photographed 78 sequenced photos from slr 2 lenses very strange object floating in clouds before sunrise","tags":["photo","floating"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/56533_submitter_file1__DSC6745Edit.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/56533_submitter_file2__DSC6747.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/56533_submitter_file3__DSC6758.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/56533_submitter_file4__DSC6778.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/56533_submitter_file5__DSC6779Edit.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/56533_submitter_file6__DSC6808.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/56533_submitter_file7__UNTOUCHEDRAW.mp4","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/56533_submitter_file8__ENHANCEDCROPPED.mp4"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"93099","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":5,"locationName":"Simi Winery, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:158774"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82751,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1071}
