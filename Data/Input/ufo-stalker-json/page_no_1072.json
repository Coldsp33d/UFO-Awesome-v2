cigarette. there was a bright star in the sky and my wife jokingly said \"hey, theres uranus.\" we then noticed that the star seemed to be moving slightly. it looked like it was jumping around. as we were looking in the sky we saw a flash off in the distance to our right. we noticed an object, that at first glance appeared to be an airplane. as we watched it we noticed that its movements were nothing like an airplane. it appeared weightless and had red and white blinking lights that flashed randomly. we stood in amazement trying to make sense of what it was. the more we watched the object the more we realized this was definitely not a plane. then we noticed small lights that really seemed to be stars until you looked very closely at them. there was a group of four that made a constellation like a rhombus. each one them very vaguely blinked between red, red-orange, white, and moved around randomly. you had to watch these with a close eye or you might never notice anything weird. they also seemed to be letting out little strakes from them and what looked like smaller orbs flying around them, almost like when someone shows you a diagram of an atom. we saw another object that looked like a plane at first. then we saw another. as we looked around the sky there must have been 6 or 7 in the air at one time. all at various altitudes. a couple of them would be still and just hover while others would move across the sky. there was one that flew lower than the rest of them and i really thought it might have been a plane just by the way the lights were blinking. but it was big and oddly enough i could not make out a distinct shape of any of these objects. as we were looking in amazement my wife and i then saw a huge white flare shoot across the sky. it looked like it could have been a firework. it was much too ow to be shooting star. i could see a very opaque white light surrounded by a more transparent glow around it. it had a tail as it streaked across the sky and it looked like energy or liquid light was flying off of it. we got a little freaked out at this point because it seemed to be so close. all the activity with the \"plane\" type lights still continued. it seemed like they were just going back and forth through the sky in no real hurry or effort. sometimes the lights on them would be red and sometimes they would be white. sometimes the craft would be lit up brighter than any star in the sky and some of them would not. the blinking always seemed random and sometimes absolutely frantic. this went on for about two hours and activity seemed to slow down. the crafts seemed to dwindle in numbers and sighting them became less often. the four star-like objects i mentioned earlier had dispersed and separated and were now further apart. this is when i started looking closer at all the stars and it seemed like there were about 10-12 stars in the sky that appeared to be stars but definitely were not. i am sure of this i watched them move around. there movement was subtle. it seemed like they were jumping around like the way a kid would point a laser pointer on the wall. they would, i don't know, \"phase-out\" then reappear in a different place but in the same general area. anybody that glanced in the sky would have seen stars. you had to really watch these to catch there movements. i even stared at actual stars just to make sure my eyes were not playing tricks on me and sure enough they were not. i had called my mom around 12:15am or so to see if she could see anything were she was at. at first she didnt believe me and as she looked she saw the activity as well. i watched the star-like objects until close to 1:00am until i was just too tired to watch anymore. i came inside and got ready to for bed and before i went to lay down i checked outside. this was maybe 20-25 minutes later and all those moving stars were gone.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

touched the rock and was given a vision.  i've never had visions, i'm not mentally ill and not even interested in this and certainly won't talk about it.  i've been married to a narcotics detective twenty years with two teenage boys.  i'm not a sceptic or a believer to this point.  when i touched this rock within  30 seconds i was given thousands of years of history of how \"aliens\" were here many thousand years ago and what they are doing.  i was given information that a planet knew many thousand years ago their planets sun would die.  they wanted to make a new home.  they found our planet they found out conditions were comparable to them.  they have decided they didn't want to do the necessary things that need done to make the planet functional for them.  they showed pictures of different species to develop the planet they experimented with.  they showed me the help they have given along the way.  they need certain things mined built and ready for them.  they have given certain scientists and others knowledge the way it was given to me.  they gave us religion so we work together because ants work well together, bees work well together but they had to make us more advanced to get us to work together, religion.  they have given us the ability to understand how to process dna but only the knowledge to use it minimally.  they gave us fear of criminals and criminal elements so eventually the world will have every humans dna filed from birth.  they are able to read which of the humans by that they will keep when they come.  i'm not religious per say but the rapture as we understand it is somewhat true but based on our genes.  almost like whatever people they need to further them will be used.  they have astronauts kind of like we do that intervene if necessary, but it would have taken them too many resources to prepare our planet, that's why we are here and they give us motivations to go in the direction they want.  they need mercury gold other metals.  they need computers much more sophisticated than what we have, we are laying their groundwork.  they will live in harmony with us to the best of their ability when they come,but not everyone will benefit the society.  that's why we have been given dna knowledge.  i can't write everything i was shown it would take forever.  but the information was given to me in thirty seconds.  i don't know why me, i'm nobody just a mother disabled with lupus.  i spent 8 years in army reserves as supply specialist ages ago.  there is absolutely nothing extraordinary about me.  the light was a v shape the size of a small plane.  the beam that came down was like a laser beam and i could do nothing but walk to where it shone and touch it.  it didn't hurt it felt like nothing, but in the 30 seconds i was there i was given 3 lifetimes of information.  it was specific it was visual and i retained it.  i don't want to ever tell anyone this because they will think i'm nuts.  i would think they were nuts.  but i thought someone should have this knowledge,nd your the only people on the yahoo i could see to tell.  it's not like i can call the president and tell him.\r\nanyway i wish there was a way i could give you all the things i learned, but i'm a busy mom and don't want to be responsible for this information, i really just want to forget it but my brain keeps putting it back no matter what else i try to think about.  so i'm hoping i told you it will be over.  a lot of the information i was given i don't even understand. but cave people were not the first people.  we have been started over on more than one occasion.  they have to be careful we have enough information to advance the planet where they want it but not too much where we blow our planet up and ruin it.  they are walking a tightrope of sorts and not even as 'll them always agree and we are a work in progress.\r\nthank you for taking this information, hopefully it's not mine anymore.\r\ndenise","distance":"20 Feet or

brighter and brighter until one light totally fuse in to another one and they became only 3 lights instead. then i told my neighbor that i was going to get my cellphone next to my front door and when i turned around they just disappear in the thin air. normally we see lots of plains specially at night time we are in fly path from oia .Our apartment complex see and hear lots of plains day and night some fly by very close because they are big plains , i guess they come lower in order to land at the airport . but this was very different, i accepted from the moment we notice them that it was a ufo sighting because i seeing before a few months ago the lights in oviedo as i was driving near the oviedo mall in the evening. if there ever any doubt that we are not along in this universe to me question have being answer and this time with an extra witness. i am glad to know that people are more willingly to accept this phenomenon .Personally i had an experience in new rochelle ny in 1994,

was in high school in sacramento, ca, i used to climb on the roof of my house everynight for a period of about a month and watch the sky.  i was interested in ufos and had the idea that i could signal them. i had a strong lantern flashlight and i would shine it upward in the sky. i would sweep the sky and flash the light on and off for a period of two to four hours. \r\n\r\none night i just noticed a white light in the sky. at first i thought it was an airplane but i didn't hear any noise. it slowly moved in my direction in a fluttery motion, in a a wavy path. the light got increasing brighter as it got closer. it stopped directly over me and was stationary for a few seconds or so then took off straight up like a light turning off. i thought i heard a click sound when it did that. i guess it leveled off because i saw it as a pinpoint of light (like a star) for a few seconds moving around before it disappeared. i can't estimate the size but from my vantage point, it was the size of a penny held at arms length. it was circular with fuzzy edges. \r\n\r\ni was grounded for a month so watching the sky at night was something to pass the time. from watching the sky everynight, i was able to tell which lights in the sky were satellites and which were aircraft. this was definitely neither. i had a camera but i was afraid if i took my eyes off the object to reach for the camera, that it would gone. my feelings during the experience were concerned and scared, then wonder. the experience was very surreal and it seemed like time slowed down. i lived at the time in neighborhood near the sacramento zoo. i never went up on the roof after this. i did not report this at the time.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then

closed down gym to an unopened location about 30 miles away (going from an urban environment to a completely rural one).  we had finished the moving a little before 11 pm, but we were using the gym owner's car and trailer.  when we returned it, i discovered that i had lost my car keys sometime in the 5 or 6 hours that we had been moving stuff.  we asked the gym owner if we could take off the trailer, pay him for gas, and go to look for my keys.  he agreed and we drove all the way back to the rural area, stopping at any place that we had been while moving equipment.  after looking around and driving for a bit (using our phones as flashlights), we couldn't find anything so we started to drive back.  the gym owner said i could drive his car home since it was so late, but i had to drop off my two friends first. coming back out of the rural area, maybe 5 or 10 miles from the mall, one of my friends exclaimed \"oh sh*t, i just saw a ufo!\" we all kind of chuckled and he said \"no, seriously\" but my other friend and myself thought he was joking around.  we drove past the mall and then down past the grocery store to drop off my first friend (not the one who had claimed to see anything).  something was burning, probably some building somewhere, but it smelled like smoke.  it was also fairly foggy on top of it being a little smoky. we dropped off my first friend in his neighborhood and did a u-turn to go back up past the mall and get on the highway (to drop off the second friend and for me to go home).  after we passed the grocery store, it didn't smell like smoke anymore and there wasn't any fog. all of our car windows were down and it was a slightly chilly night (at least for florida).  there were absolutely no cars on the road except for us, and you could see headlights a couple miles ahead.  i was driving a bit slower (10 or 20 miles under the limit) when my second friend proclaimed again \"there's a ufo!\" i slowed down a bit and jolted my head over , and sure enough saw something black blur across the sky.  we both still kind of laughed it off because it could've been a big group of bats, or birds, or even a plane from a distance, but we still both watched the skies and i slowed down a bit more.  i had my head turned the same direction as he did and we both saw, right over (or maybe a little behind in the parking lot area) of best buy, two black oval shaped things rise up slowly and clearly.  it was perfectly clear and there wasn't any motion blur.  the sky was already really dark (at this point it was about 12:30), but it was darker than the sky.  you could see two of them and they didn't look connected but one was smaller than the other and they rose at the exactly same time and kept the distance between each other perfectly.  they (or it if it was just one with something attached) started slowly moving to the right of best buy (still over buildings) and keeping perfectly steady, not going up or down, and slightly picking up speed, and then picked up more speed before making a movement in the opposite direction.  we saw it move in the opposite direction (it went up, south slowly, and then north quickly, i know this because my town is on the water and it's pretty easy to tell where south is because of it).  we lost sight of it after it went north quickly because i was still driving the car, albeit slowly, and started to feel a little scared and picked up the pace.  as i sped up we saw what looked like a really strong strobe light at the ground behind it, and then we saw a red blinking light from some cell phone tower (or even an air traffic control tower).  we think the red blinking light is periodic, but the single strobe flash from the ground was weird.  it must have been really strong because it was incredibly bright from where we were.  it was probably behind the best buy or in the parking lot, but we still saw it over the roof and a couple hundred feet over on the road. while we watched it we were both filled with wonder and really interested.  i was still driving but there was no one else on the road and i couldn't stop looking at it.  we discussed checking behind the building but we both felt very eerie and decided to go home.  i dropped my second friend off and drove home, feeling pretty spooked, and nothing else happened past then.  we would have taken photos, but my phone was dead (charger was in my locked car that i had lost the key to), and the friend i was with didn't have his phone.  the two of us that did have our phones (one who wasn't in the car) both didn't have a charge because we had been using the flash as a flashlight to try to find my keys.","distance":"101-500

even think the movie et was a big deal. i wanted nothing to do with it.  the year of 1994 by chance i met a new friend named \"cassie\" (not her true name) through a family member.  during conversations she brought up matter of factually that she was a \"star-person\".  i didn't know what that was so she explained that her being that sired her was not of this earth.  she stated that when she finally confronted her mother about it her mother put her head down on the kitchen table and cried saying she thought it had all been a dream.  naturally i thought at first i was dealing with a delusional person.  but she stayed consistent and never deterred from her nature or claims.  i started noticing her features.  she was small. her skin seemed almost transparent and delicate.  she had a big head and forehead yet tiny nose and tiny chin with thin and delicate lips.  i could see bigger eye sockets around her where her eyes were.  she told me many things i had never had even heard of or conceived of.  she told me of other beings called reptilians and that they were malevolent. she told me of something called greys and that they were benevolent but also in a type of study capacity. she told me of the men in black years before the movies came out.  she told me they were dangerous and that they were to be avoided at all times.  she would sing in a meditative like state and it was unlike anything i've heard.  it was like tinkling instruments and voice and rolled into one and i don't know what language she was singing.  but you wanted to stay in it. she liked to sleep in incubator type conditions.  she made tight sleeping quarters in the closet of her apartment. she eventually bought property in logan county and made a box like shelter from plywood that fit small single size raised pallet on one side which only left the other side with a shelf for supplies. i asked her many questions about the things she knew.  (she has vast unsurpassed knowledge that i wanted to but couldn't even fathom)  she told me that our human minds couldn't handle it.  it would be like crossing a threshold or going on the other side of a rainbow and our minds would go insane.  i also know that top government officials detained her at some point in her life wanting to know about the things she knew about and how.  she was my friend and i've never met anyone like her before or since.  \r\n\r\none afternoon my family member came by with my friend in attendance and asked me to go for a ride just to get out and get a break from the house and my young children.  it was a beautiful clear day.  blue skies and perfect temperatures.  we rode in a white chrysler le baron convertible with the top down north on i-35 from oklahoma city.  i was in the back seat, my family member was driving, and cassie was in the front passenger seat. we had planned to drive for awhile enjoying the day while stopping to eat and check out local shops.  while on the road cassie states that we had to keep driving since she was being \"drawn\" to a location but she didn't know where.  so we drove north on i-35 until she suddenly said to get off the highway.  we made many turns and asked many times where were we going.  she said she didn't know but would know when we got there.  we ended up on back roads, gravel and dirt.  she finally directed us to little more than a path not worthy to drive on as i remember it was very rough and actually caused some drag and grinding underneath the car.  we thought we were stuck a few times.  this path was in a massive open oklahoma field or farm.  it's the plains.  it was flat and mostly beige and brown topography with a little green.  there were some trees near by but we stopped at a rounded clearing.   cassie got out of the car and started walking towards the clearing.  i got out and stood by the car actually feeling stupid and bored.  i don't know where or how she got it but she handed me a big heavy looking jagged rock thing.  it was a silvery black color.  she told me it was like a magnet and under no circumstances to let go of it or get near the car with it.  i became slightly more alert and followed her instructions though i was perplexed.  my family member stayed by me.  cassie walked back out into the clearing and as she did suddenly out of nowhere this craft type object came  swishing by from my right to left several yards and then it was gone.  it was cigar or comet shaped.  it had a low hum sound barely audible.  at first i thought it glowed and then realized it was a reflection from some type of metallic material i've never seen before.  it was only about 40 ft above my head.  i was in shock.  cassie has just stayed in the clearing kneeling with her head down as this occurred.  i was speechless.   when she came back to the car she told me that she had been \"directed\" to go there because \"they\" wanted us to witness this event.  she told me that she had asked me to hold this huge magnet so that i would not be \"taken up\" with it.  \r\n\r\nafter i went home i couldn't speak or eat for a few days.  still in shock.  i've only tried to tell a few people through the years what i witnessed but am never able to articulate the enormity of it.  and i come across and a fruitcake.   cassie and i continued to stay in contact for about a year after that.  i just accepted who she claimed to be and who she was.   she was kind and gentle.  she was fragile and strong.  she had been hurt too.  deeply.   very wise and very special.   i think of her often still and wish we were still friends.   this incident has made me question everything i was taught to believe, to think, what i think i know and don't know.     i will never forget this for the rest of my life.
