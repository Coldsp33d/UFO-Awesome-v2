this was something of unknown origin; and was seen by all other members of our 10 person group; two of the party saw it up close as it eventually hovered closely over them; about 200 ft by their account and said it was shaped and looked like a bus and had what looked like windows; no noise but the grass moved around them as it hovered.\r\nit's movements and color changes were nothing any physical known object could make, as it took off and stopped at speeds like the snap of a finger traveling great distances and back, up and down and then hovered slowly before moving off at great speed.\r\n\r\ni was in my 40s at the time and recall it as yesterday;

dad driving, mom in the passenger seat. \r\n\r\nmy dad and i had a silly game when driving to and from the base (which we did often): can we get all green lights on the way? he always ensured that we did by slowing and slowing the car, until the stoplight was finally green.\r\n\r\non that night in 1968, we were returning from the club and playing the ���green light��� game. as we approached an intersection in a very remote area between our home and the base, dad slowed and slowed, but the stoplight remained red; oh well. we stopped at the intersection.\r\n\r\na car pulled up next to us to wait at the light. another pulled up behind. there were a couple of storefronts, closed for the night, at that corner. the gas station to our right was open, and servicing customers.\r\n\r\nat once, at the same time, we all exclaimed, ���what is that?��� and rolled down the right side car windows. hovering, or suspended, above the gas station was a large (two story? three story?) metal object, like a blimp tipped on its nose. it had one bright yellow light on top, and one bright white light on the bottom���so bright, that it cast sharp shadows of the gas station attendants on the ground. it looked like nothing we���d ever seen before. it wasn���t a blimp. it wasn���t a balloon. and it just appeared to us, suddenly.\r\n\r\nwe gawked out the window. it hovered quietly. there was a buzzing sound that seemed to be associated with the power lines it was on top of, above the gas station. it was a dull grey. it looked hard-shelled, and heavy, yet weightless. it seemed to be constructed of riveted panels. other than the bright lights on top and bottom, there were no exterior features.\r\n\r\nwe then noticed the other people at the scene. the occupants in the car to our right looked over at us as we pointed and gestured to the object. they didn���t follow our pointing, but just turned away and looked straight ahead. we noticed that the gas station attendants were continuing to pump gas, and didn���t look up. the light finally turned green, and the car behind us politely beeped their horn to let us know it was time to go. we realized: no one could see the object but us. (later it dawned on me that we weren���t able to see it, either���wouldn���t we have noticed such a large object as we pulled near to it in the car?���until all three of us saw it simultaneously once we were beneath it.) \r\n\r\ni remember feeling confusion, excitement, and awe. i wasn���t afraid. \r\n\r\nwe drove through the intersection and immediately pulled to the curb. we all got out of the car to stand on the sidewalk and stare; other cars continued to pass us by. within seconds of getting out of our car, the object lifted straight up without a sound, then drifted quickly away at a 45-degree angle until it was a tiny red dot in the sky. then it was gone.\r\n\r\nwe got back in the car and drove the rest of the way home. in her typical fashion, my mother did the ditsiest possible thing: she called the fire department to report the incident (including the fact that we were returning from the officer���s club). i���m sure whoever took the call just thought she was drunk, and hung up.\r\n\r\nthe next morning we excitedly looked in the sacramento bee for a news report of the object that surely would be on the front page. it wasn���t...Or on the second, or third page either. and we never spoke of it again.\r\n\r\nuntil years later, as an adult in my thirties, i wanted to revisit the incident to see if what i saw really happened the way i remembered it. i spoke to each of my parents, separately, and asked them what they recalled. ���oh yes!��� they said. ���wasn���t that odd?��� and they reported almost exactly what i remembered about it: the shape, the nearness, the color of the lights, and the fact that no one looked up at it but us.\r\n\r\n(i���ve never heard anyone tell a similar story. i feel compelled to report it now, after all these years, since attending some lectures at the 2014 ufo festival in mcminnville, oregon.)","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

related ufo activity. on this particular evening what we observed did not appear to be \"brown mountain lights\" which we had observed in the past. \r\n\r\nfrom wiseman's view, one can see table rock which is separated from the viewer by the linville gorge, a massive gorge often called \"the grand canyon of north carolina.\" i approximate that table rock is 2-3 miles from wiseman's view. i will attach a picture of table rock. \r\n\r\nwe had been watching for the brown mountain lights when we first saw the light. it appeared in or behind the treeline on the lower step of table rock. occasionally, the light would brighten and then dim again. we thought that perhaps a camper or hiker was on the mountain shinning a bright light toward wiseman's view. then the light began to move. it appeared to stay at the same altitude, but moved back and forth within the treeline. at this point we speculated that perhaps it was a helicopter, behind the treeline. still, the light would increase in brightness and then dim, furthering our speculation that it might be the spotlight on a helicopter.\r\n\r\nwe watched this phenomenon for about 45 minutes. it would move back and forth, never going further outward than the treeline. finally the light lifted above the treeline, and slowly, but intently above table rock. then the light appeared to move in our general direction. within 30 seconds the light had moved from its original position above table rock to directly above our heads. it continued on its path until it was well behind us and out of sight. \r\n\r\nthe only aircraft that could move in this fashion would be a helicopter, however this object made no noise. while it is impossible to know the exact size of the object since we lacked a reference, i know that had it been a helicopter it would have been close enough to hear. we attempted to video the light after it had began its move toward us, but the batteries in our equipment had died. while i am certain that i had charged the equipment, human error could explain the equipment. \r\n\r\nalong with a picture of table rock, i will attach a computer sketch of the events i witnessed.

when they notice my attention on them, they approached me and attempted to touch me, at this point i believe i feel asleep.  the very next day, one of the aliens attempted to make a dramatic entrance (traveling through a wall) into my home office and left a physical imprint of their body on the drywall/paint.  it feels like they are in another demission of space and can travel through solid objects.  i attempted to remove the imprint, but i could not.  i have also attempted to photograph and video aliens with my iphone, but it has been difficult because of their transparency.  i know that they are within the recording (because i can see them partially), but i do not have the technology or expertise to make them visible within the recording.  i have attached two of my latest videos so that you can review them.  the aliens cannot be touched by me; however i can sense the presence (coolness of air and outward pressure).  they also create a visual distortion and partial shadow that can be seen.  the aliens have attempted a few times to grab my hand and i can feel the pressure of their grasp.  i also believe they put some type of device on my person. i know that the item was placed into my hands, but do not know the purpose of this device. the aliens cannot verbally communicate with me via speech, but they have attempted to communicate via images that they can generate (dramatically).  i have no fear of their presence and they have no fear of mine.  they appear to just be curious.  i am the only person in my home that can see them and feel their presence.  my

side would hide and the other would try to capture them and put them in \"jail\".  i was hiding behind a large tumble weed when i looked to the east i noticed a very bright light beaming down upon the tops of the eucalyptus trees and the top to the trees were swaying back and forth like they would in the wind. this was approx. 2 hundred yards away to the east. i could vaguely see an object over the top of the trees. i first thought it was a helicopter, but i could not hear any rotor noise. when the object reached the end of the tree row the bright light went out and the object continued in a westerly direction almost directly toward me. it was moving at a slow speed, i would estimate approx. 3-4 miles/hour.  as the object neared me i could hear a whine, like a large generator would make. the object was disc shaped with a dome that had windows with a soft light from the inside.  as it neared me i could look up into the bottom of the object.  the sides sloped up ward to the center to what appeared to be a circular \"porthole\". the object appeared to of some kind of metal material with a \"brushed finish\", but yet very smooth. the exterior also appeared to be of the same material and both were a dark grey, there was no down draft or wind movement from this craft. \r\nas the object moved over head i jumped up and yelled, waiving my arms. at this point the object did not accelerate, but stayed at it's original speed, and direction, but the whine increased to a higher pitch. i watched the object as it continued west for approx 3-5 minutes. when it was about 1 mile away the object suddenly shot up into the sky and within 2 seconds i could not recognize it from the stars. i was probably 10-12 years old at the time and i had no idea or had ever thought about ufos. i really didn't tell many people about my experience. i had no reason, i didn't know much about anything at that age and i just kept it inside me, but to this day i remember the events very clearly.\r\nnow that i'm much older, served in combat in viet nam and spent 32 years as a police officer, i know what i saw on that night was not from this planet. at that time we absolutely no air craft that could do what this craft did and still don't to this day.\r\ni swear that the above is true and correct and reflects the event of that night to the best of my ability.\r\n dayle

a shopping trip. it was about 10pm and we were maybe a mile away from the house. she spotted the object first. i was forced on the road since we were in  the country and animals are everywhere. at first i didn't believe her and kept driving.  but we got super close to it and i stopped the car and shut the lights off. you could see that it was shapes like a typical saucer and from the lights on the outer rim you can tell it was rotation around. it stayed in that spot for over a minute then the light went off and we couldn't see it again. we raced home scared. neither of us had pictures or videos of the thing. we tried to take pictures but when we got home to.Show our dad the pictures they were no longer on our phone. we were standing outside when we were telling my dad about this thing. then my boyfriend pointed out to the field across the street and there was the thing again. it did the same things it did d when we saw it the first time. rotated around with lights on then the lights disappeared and we couldn't see it again. about 15 minutes later we all seen this orb looking thing shoot through the field left to right super fast. it looked like if someone would have a flashlight and run from left to right. but this moved faster then i've seen any human running. my boyfriendand dad went walking over to the field to see if they could see anything and the orb went back to the left side of the field then straight up. after that we didn't see anything again.
