road in pulaski, va.  when i first noticed it, it was traveling ne and vanished below the tree line.  i then saw another light through the same window similar to the first traveling e that disappeared behind the same tree line.  i thought the first light was a plane, although the trajectory looked too steep.  the second light looked more like a roman candle or meteor.  at this point i thought it was someone shooting off some fireworks or a random meteor shower.  i walked out onto my porch and was stunned to see something that was moving almost like a humming bird; it would hover, move in sweeping arcs, dart, and almost loop.  i couldn't tell how far away the object was or how big it was... from my perspective, it appeared to be a small sphere of pulsating white and bluish-white light; the light intensity went from spectacular to nothing.  while i was watching this light, it blinked out and i noticed a bright light from behind the tree line.  this light soon appeared above the tree line as well.  the two were indistinguishable from each other, and at first i thought they were the same object until i saw them both lighted at the same time... one was almost dimmed out and the other was just starting to glow again.  the two lights were never really close to each other, one looked to be further ne than the other.  as i continued to watch them i kept trying to rationalize what i was seeing.  there was no noise that i could hear and this is a fairly rural area... as a matter of fact, during this time, i don't even remember hearing a dog bark.  it looked as if the lights were moving to the ne of my house because the second light that had appeared from behind the trees slowly disappeared behind them again and never reappeared.  the other light that appeared closer to me continued to move in ways that i couldn't explain.  at one point my brain was telling me they could be lightnings bugs.  at this exact moment, the remaining light came toward my house quickly and got so bright it looked like venus.  i actually became a little concerned at that point because i realized this was nothing i could explain.  i called my girlfriend outside and told her to bring my camera.  i shot about 1:30 mins of video before we watched the last light completely disappear to the ne behind the tree line.  i'm still trying to rationalize what i saw; the new river valley airport is sort of in the direction i last saw the lights, but i have never seen anything move like these objects did.  in the video, we talk about them possibly being rc planes, but the lights on these objects got so bright and the way they moved wasn't what i consider normal... it's almost as if these things were swimming thru the air, if that makes any sense.  \r\n\r\nplease let me know if you had any other reports of this.  someone else had to see this.  i wish i had had my camera earlier, but i was afraid to take my eyes of these things.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then

skinned reptilian-like humanoid alien with a normal sized head and long limbs with long fingers and regular-sized all black eyes (no pupils). the creature appeared to be walking from right to left looking at the ground like it was looking for something. the creature was walking in the place where my dad's old barn used to be before it was taken down. there were small trees and old scrap metal and junk in that area when i saw the creature. i stared at the creature for about 15-20 seconds then i quickly closed the curtain, sat down on my couch and stared at the ground in shock/disbelief thinking to myself \"what did i just see\".(unfortunately, i had no camcorders or cameras at that time) a few minutes later, i got the courage to look back out the window but the creature was gone. it affected me so badly that i'm paranoid to this day sleeping with a light on at night. i have nightmares about aliens and sometimes wake up screaming but sometimes i have good dreams about them where we make peace. there are also times when in my dreams i overcome my fear with anger and actually fight with the creatures using super strength and my body's internal chi. i recall one dream where woke up strapped to a surface with aliens all around me and i got so angry that i used my body's chi to explode out of the bonds and beat up the aliens. i am still angry with aliens for what they do to

have read many eye witness reports of these black eyed kids one such report of letting two in the house. \r\nthis is what happened, john mason was sitting in his living room at home when he heard the door bell ring, it wasn't too late so he didn't hesitate to open the door. upon opening it there were two children standing there, he said to the taller one may i help you, they asked if they could come in, that they were lost and my friend needs to use the toilet. the area is a maze of streets and it is very easy to get lost, so he thought nothing of it, they were looking down he thought they were shy. so he let them in, the one who needed to use the toilet just walked in and proceeded up the stairs so he shouted up to the boy its on the right, he said he didn't find this strange because most toilets are upstairs and the child was young so he didn't think anything of it.\r\n\r\nhe told the other one that the phone was down the hall, ���thanks��� he said and he started to walk down the hall, he followed him then john suddenly started to get a real awful feeling like something bad was going to happen, he became very nervous and a bit shaky, the boy stopped at the phone and paused, he asked is ���everything ok?��� he turned to me and looked up and that���s when john saw his eyes, john said he will never get that picture out of my head, i was so scared that i couldn't even scream as i turned to run down the hall the other kid was standing at the end.\r\n\r\njohn said he became very dizzy and struggled to stand up, the boy or thing walked closer to me and said that they had been sent to collect me, i still couldn't bear to look into his face, i pushed away from him and ran into my front room and slammed the door shut, i was in so much shock about what was happening i couldn't think straight, this is something that you don���t expect to happen. after standing against the door for a few minutes or so i finally got the courage to make a run for the back door, i ran to the back of my yard and jumped over the fence not looking back.John had a friend that lived close so he ran to his house, and told him the story. he convinced him to come back with me, when they got there we looked around the whole house but couldn't find them. since this happened he was having nightmares he was dreaming that kids with the black eyes were standing over his bed with there hands stretching to him!\r\n\r\nthere are some trends and themes which have emerged from black eyed children encounters, there are reports of foul odors that lingers following an encounter with the kids. also the black eyed children don't just appear at houses, but have been reported approaching cars, businesses, and even a boat. it is odd how the black eyed children seem to depend on being invited into locations.A black eyed child was actually invited into a car by a child while his mother was in a store shopping! \r\n\r\nafter examining some of the similarities between black eyed children and other paranormal phenomena, black eyed kids seem to resemble the behavior of men in black. there also have been encounters between black eyed kids and children as well as black eyed children and pets. a man in dallas who was visited by the black eyed children had his pit bull charge at them and then run off terrified. \r\n\r\nthere is a recurring theme of black eyed children encounters and that is how they seem to exert some kind of hypnotic control over the witnesses, perhaps in an attempt to force them to invite them inside, these 'children' may simply be projections used by entities that feed off of fear. \r\n\r\nthese black eyed children witnesses are considered 'victims'. we learned how victims of black eyed children encounters often have recurring nightmares or prolonged stress as a result of their experience. this leads us to realize how difficult it is to study the black eyed kid phenomena, since it almost entirely relies on witness encounters. one case in london where a man encountered a pair of black eyed kids, turned around, and a third kid suddenly appeared are they interdimensional entities? \r\n\r\none woman who began having memories of encountering the black eyed kids and underwent hypnosis to see if her memories were real or not. this leads us to believe the theories that the black eyed children are actually some kind of alien entity, since they appear to follow certain 'rules'. this leads to us reflecting on the possibility that these black eyed children are actually positive agents of change.\r\n\r\nthere is much more research to do on the black eyed children there are many more investigative reports to look at,more an more everyday, could these black eyed children be smaller versions of men in black in training? as i say we need much more research into the subject of black eyed children!","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Path then
