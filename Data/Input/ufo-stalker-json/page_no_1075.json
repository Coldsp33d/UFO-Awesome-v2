porch into my yard with my dog to allow her to do her business.  i noticed an immensely bright orange/red glowing ball coming across the sky from north to south.  this object did not make any sound at all as it traversed the sky.  i immediately ran inside the house leaving the dog inside and having my wife come back outside with me.  the object was still traveling south in the sky.  i was then able to capture this object on video using my cellphone.  as i was recording this object it changed direction to travel east.  while this object was traveling east, it also seemed to diminish in intensity to the point that it appeared as a flame that is extinguished.  but, before it completely stopped glowing, it seemed to flicker on and off at least 3 times with each not having the intensity of glow that it did prior to the direction change and ascension.  it was approximately 40 seconds after this object disappeared that my wife called my attention to a second object identical to the first following the same flight line across the sky.  i once again started to video this object as the first and told my wife to retrieve our son's telescope.  she went into the house and retrieved the telescope and brought it outside to me but i was unable to get the object into focus.  by this time, the object made the same directional change to the east while ascending.  this object did not seem to diminish in the same manner as the first as it ascended higher in the sky, nor did it flicker.  this second object just seemed to vanish at a certain point while ascending higher into the sky. after we witnessed this event, i spotted an airplane over our house roof and i videotaped the airplane to show the contrast between it and the unidentified objects we observed and i videotaped.  the plane was clearly distinguishable with its blinking lights.  the unkown objects never blinked and had an intensity unlike any airplane known to us. \r\n\r\nthis encounter is especially unnerving as well as being of major interest to my wife and i. we would very much like to know just what these objects that we had observed are.  to note, this is the second of such sightings of the same phenomenon my wife and i have observed. last summer (june 2013) while riding our motorcycle back from the supermarket, we had seen 5 of the same intensely orange/red/yellow fireballs approx. 2 miles east of our home where we saw the two last evening.  we pulled off of the road along with a few other vehicles and we watched as these five objects headed east with various speeds.  the five then at different times made very sudden and erratic direction changes that culminated with them all eventually ascending while traveling southeast.  all five objects one at a time seemed to extinguish their glow once ascending high into the sky with some abruptly extinguishing their glow and others seemingly flickering out or just fading out.  these five objects were also silent during this event.  there was also an easily identified airplane flying west of these 5 objects on that particular night.

home on state route 78 traveling in an easterly direction. the radio was on and both windows were down about 3-4\", the sky was very dark that night. we had just passed under the overpass for the new highway that was not yet open or operational at the time. suddenly i caught a quick glimpse of lights flying in a straight line across the highway in a nw direction at an very low altitude. i looked at my daughter and said \"did you see that?\" she replied with wide eyes \"yeah\" i asked \"what was that?\" all she said was \"i don't know\". i then leaned forward looking out my windshield waiting for a break in the tree cover so that maybe i might catch another glimpse of it and confirm in my mind that it was completely explainable. i got to that break but it was too late no lights, but now i am alert and watching. and suddenly the same formation of lights crossed the highway again traveling in the same nw path as the first set of lights. they were set in a triangle pattern, three large lights all set at the points and all red in color, a fourth pulsating white light set halfway and slightly forward of the two back lights, it appeared that there could have been more lights along the back edge or they could have been reflections of the red point lights, i can't be sure which it was. the distance between the lights led me to believe that the object was as large if not larger than a commercial aircraft, i do feel like it was one solid craft. i got a good look at the second set of lights and every hair on my body stood on end, i could not make out any craft edges or shape. the ufo was flying so low and i never heard any noise, i am honestly unsure if there was any radio interference, i don't remember being able to even hear the radio at that moment. my daughter was very shaken

were sitting out by the fire we made, at eleven pm to midnight. i kept looking at the sky, hoping to see a spacecraft. looking back on it now, i'm pretty sure i've seen plenty spacecraft before, i just didn't know what they were at the time. anyways, i was looking up at the sky, and of course my step mom and my dad were looking at the fire while this happened, but i see something flying through the sky. at first i'm thinking it's an airplane, but then i noticed that first of all, it was flying much faster than an airplane, and second of all it looked nothing like one. then i was thinking: shooting star? nope, shooting stars fly much faster than that. but i noticed it when it was about north east of me in the sky, and was able to watch it until it disappeared behind trees to the west of where i was at the time. during the process i just felt like \"oh, this is normal, it happens\". mainly because i've been changing my mindset to recognize spacecraft as everyday objects. also for some reason, i couldn't feel excited while looking at it. i kind of felt like there was something trying to make me look away from it. afterwards i got kind of excited though and asked my parents if they believed in ufos, and they said \"no\" in their own ways. then i told them i just saw one fly by and they told me it was an airplane; no, i told them, it was flying too fast and looked nothing like one. they told me it was a shooting star; no, it was not that fast. it was a comet; i didn't say this next part because i didn't want to argue over it, but i was thinking \"yea, because comets fly sideways all the time. *sarcasm*\". plus, it was too close to be a comet; comets are comets because they are meteors that fly by outside of the earth's atmosphere. it also was not a meteorite because like i said, they don't fly sideways. not that i know of anyways. it looked either rectangular, or it was circular in the middle with a rectangular aura? not sure. all the ufo did was fly across the

inspect and i realized there were 4-5 very bright orange lights radiating if not menting. i stood there for about 2 minutes whaching. they hovered stationary, i thought at first it was mars but there were multiples and this was way bigger. all of the orbs began to kove in the same direction, maintaining the same distance and doing the same movements. i ran up the stairs got my friend told here to hurry and get out here. by the time me and her got back outside which took 15 seconds tops, all the orbs dissapered. the last light was fading out as i headed back outside. but these lights were so bright no way should they have been out of sight within that time frame. i know what planes and copters look like and flares for that matter. these lights moved together and almost seemed to follow the main lights lead systematically.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with

scrutinise posts coming to our forum. at the said time i decided to get some fresh air at the window in my room as i am a smoker. as i pushed open the window i leaned on the sill and just generally looked around. as i turned to my left (to the south east) i noticed this said phenomena motionless in the sky. this item was of a circular nature of jagged pulsating orange light in a frequency of approximately three to four seconds. i dismissed this as to be of a laser origin as we have a yearly air show and many lasers are used in a display in an evening party type atmosphere. i was of the opinion that this could be from someone trying out a new type of display; however the air show was months away. \r\nafter approximately five minutes this light began to fade; as this light was fading i noticed that it was a beautiful clear star lit night/morning. i am no laser expert but it struck me as odd as a laser needs something to project on, example a cloud or a smoke generated via a smoke machine, however, with today���s technology i don���t know what can be achieved.\r\n\r\nthe following night/morning at approximately the same hour i witnessed the exact same phenomena only this time the colour was electric blue. once again the sky was clear of clouds; this light was a copycat of the previous night. i have a video camera which was at hand and decided to record this phenomena, however it was set to auto focus and i am aware that the camera would not operate correctly so i was trying to set the camera to manual focus but annoyingly i fumbled too long; i eventually returned to the window however the light was fading so i missed this opportunity to capture footage.\r\n\r\nalso just as a matter of interest; many���many years ago (approximately 1997)  my wife and i witnessed a star sized white object (on a clear night) moving toward us from the east at quite some speed and at a great height possibly thirty to forty thousand feet. this object came to a complete stop for a second or two then at impossible speed just flew to the north.\r\n\r\nwe reside in the north east of the uk in-between newcastle and sunderland in washington new town tyne/wear.\r\n\r\ni hope these experiences are of some use to you. i am not a sky watcher and these experiences were by mere chance.If you would like any further information i will be more than happy to oblige.\r\n\r\nthank you\r\n\r\nmr j e

(non-smoking apartment community). i always check out the sky and where the different planets and stars are or cloud watch. i saw one star flickering red-orange like mars but i know mars should not be in the northern sky now.(mars was southwest) i took out my phone and turned on the google sky map to see what it was (maybe an m class). as i went to point the phone in the direction of the object, it got brighter, flashed red and zoomed off with a wide bright red fire trail; it reminded me of star trek when a ship would zoom off and leave a trail of \"fire\". it took me by surprise. at first i thought, a plane maybe for the air show. but it was fast, no sound, took seconds to disappear and was stationary until it zoomed. \r\nit was not a normal jet. there were other planes high up and regular distance for approach to austin at that same time frame; two were low enough to see there white and red flashing lights going south to austin. there were 5 others in that same time frame of 9-10 pm going south but much higher in altitude so, just looked like a moving white light. this did not have the characteristics of the normal area planes. it was not like a chopper. it was fast. i am slow with the phone camera so no pic. but it was faster than i could have been. it was interesting that this one seemed like a star at first. it was much closer but i do not measure distances well,so i guess about 3 football fields up and 2 football field to the north of where i was standing.\r\n\r\ndo you ever want to hear about encounters from the 1960-70's - i have had two and time lapse.
