that is a disaster waiting to happen. the object was not using lights of any kind, it truly seemed that the lights from the city were reflecting off of it, causing it to be greatly reflective until it moved beyond their reach. at the moment that the light no longer reflected off of the object, it was still visible but only by looking next to the object, as you would a distant and dim star. when the object became difficult to observe, it seemed to slow way down and just hang in the air like it was hovering for a few seconds and then resumed moving. no sound was emitted. when first spotted, the

showed a plane that was coming up fast as if to attempt to intercept the other two. \r\n\r\nthese chem trails were strange not only in design but because the closest airport is bangor, and there never been the amount of passenger planes taking off at the same time. \r\n\r\nthe next day at work, i was discussing what i had seen, and a co-worker reported she saw the same and had taken some pictures.

reflecting like 2 mirrors being aimed at us. the objects looked a few miles in the sky and stated to pulsate up and down beside each other.  both objects went straight up until out of sight.  there were about 25 others guys sitting there with me who saw it. it was really the first time that i thought about ufo,  but from that day on i believed in  ufos. the 2 objects just flew straight up until
