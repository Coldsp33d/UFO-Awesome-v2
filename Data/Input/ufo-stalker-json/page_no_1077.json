very windy and of course being a child i decided to fly my kite i remember letting out so much line that i lost site of it through the cloud cover.My mom was yelling from the door to come inside and at that time my line broke i stood there hopeing that i would catch sight of it but i didn't so i went inside. about an hour or two latter the weather settled down a bit but still a little cloudy and somewhat dark out i snuck out to go look for my kite i decided to go north to the tree line were i thought the wind would have taken it at that point i started to feel like something or someone was near like a presence and i then realized there was an eerie silence that's when i looked up and seen a glowing electric like ball emerge from the cloud cover it was decending to the point where it was literally right over our trailer i was frozen and could not move i could not yell out i could not do anything..Suddenly it seemed, it was the next morning! i was in my bed but all i remember was my kite so i got up and of course no one was up yet i went out to the north tree line and it seemed like i knew exactly where it was i walked over to one tree out of about 60 or more went on the other side of it and there it was right then and there i remembered everything that happened the night before but could not remember after seeing the globe walking back to the trailer or going to bed the funny thing was i also woke up with my clothes on from the night before..I am now 43 and have been having health problems mom and my sister too and since then we all have been diagnosed with

south onto fullerton ave from west michigan st. to drop him off. he opened the door to get out, but then we both noticed a glowing red orb in the sky ahead of us, just over the trees, on the left side of the road. the object looked to be at least a few blocks away. \r\ni said, \"what is that?\"\r\nmy friend replied, \"maybe it's just a plane?\"\r\n we both got a peculiar feeling. he closed the door and we drove south down fullerton ave toward the object. luckily, there's an empty field a block away on the south side of blake blvd, adjacent to where we parked the car on fullerton. we turned east at the intersection of fullterton ave and blake blvd and parked the car on the south side of blake blvd, next to the field. when we pulled up we realized the object was closer than we thought and was more or less hovering over the field. we then began observing  a decent sized object that looked like a ball of fire in the sky. \r\nmy friend and i agree that we observed the following:\r\nit flickered somewhat like a candle and was bright orange. the object was very low to the ground and looked to be well below the cloud ceiling at 1k-3k. the sky was completely overcast at the time. the object we observed did not have wings, a tail, any visible means of propulsion, any cylindrical shapes, right of way lights, strobe lights, a propellor, jet engines, etc. the object was not an airplane, helicopter, ultra-light aircraft, etc. it didn't resemble any known aircraft. the only light coming from the object was an overwhelming red/orange/amber glow that flickered and didn't appear to be attached to anything, but was the object itself. the object wasn't blowing around in the wind, like a chinese lantern, but seemed to be hovering around very slowly, under it's own control. the wind speed at the time was 7 mph from east to west. the object didn't make a sound; it was completely silent the entire time we observed it. as we started walking toward the object, it appeared to be hovering northeast, in a straight line. however, my friend says the object was flying southesat in a straight line. we demonstrated to each other that we both knew which direction north was from where we were. we don't know how to reconcile the difference in direction, but agree the object was hovering in straight lines. i estimated it's angle of elevation to be 40-45 degrees at the time. it remained at a near constant angle of elevation. twice or three times during the time we observed it, it appeared to stop and remain stationary for short periods of time. \r\ni turned on my cell phone camera and began running toward the object to take pictures. my friend stayed closer to the car and continued observing. we watched the object flicker for a short time, getting brighter and dimmer while hovering around. i snapped two pictures. they're both timestamped at 9:57 pm. the object appears in both the shots, though the lighting is poor. after i took the pictures, the object appeard to move in a short straight line and got dimmer. when it did, my friend and i simultaneously got a distinct feeling the object was going to disappear, though he and i hadn't said anything. the object then remained stationary, got incrementally dimmer and faded out. \r\nlater on, at 11:30pm, i had driven back to kalamazoo and to work for the night. we hadn't had a chance to talk about what we'd seen, as i didn't want to be late for work at 11:00pm. my friend and i got online and started taking about it. in discussing what we'd seen, my friend said, \r\n \"it was weird when i knew it was going to disappear.\"\r\ni agreed with him. i felt the same thing. then we realized we'd had that feeling at the same time, as if we'd had the same thought or feeling \"together\" somehow. we agree

(approximately jul1981). i was driving my 1979 dodge omni 024 into the nw corner of dows, ia when i noticed an unusual object just north of the football field. it was stationary and it was emitting various flashes of light or flame. i thought it was a balloon and my mother agreed. i drove to a gravel road intersection and turned the car around in order to face the object from a sw direction (angled towards the north side of the football field. i shut the engine off and my mother and i got out of the car to observe the object. it was a disk-like object with a center end all around. a cone-shaped top and bottom was seen and various lights and flames were \"shooting off\" the bottom side of the object. i told my mother that a balloon does not look like the object and no sound was heard. i told my mother to get in the car and that we would drive north along the west side of the football field (on old highway 72) and get closer. we were driving approxmately 10 miles per hour with the windows open. we could not hear anything from the object. when i got to the point where the object was almost directly east of the car the object immediately moved from a stationary position to approximately 5 miles to the nw direction (by the horizon). no noise occurred and i have never seen anything move so quickly with no noise. i was very surprised that no sonic boom occurred, any rush of air or vacuum. i pulled the car onto the shoulder and watched the object in the northern horizon for another 30 seconds and then it disappeared. i have discussed this with some fellow engineers and it appears that the propulsion system was anti-gravitational with some ability to control the effects of acceleration/deceleration.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
