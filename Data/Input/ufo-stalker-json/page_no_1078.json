northeast in the sky but further ahead of the last location i saw it.  this time the when the object appeared it stayed visible for about 10 seconds and then disappeared. we observed the sky for another 10 minutes or so and the object never re-appeared.  the object was shaped like an oval and it appeared to be solid and then transparent like.  i want to add that the sky was free from clouds

started to see a amber reddish orange light then i saw 2 they were coming from the south east and like they were climbing up the tree but as they got closer i can see they were as high as the tree top they were further away when i first saw them so i walked to the front of the car i saw 4 amber reddish orange lights you know how planes or jets fly in a arrow formation like 2 close together in the front and 2 further apart in the back well they were backwards 2 orbs were far apart and 2 behind those close together i saw them come over the big tree right towards me i was at the front of the car getting scared and the closer they came the more i got more scared so i ran in the side yard where we have a 10x20 cover over another car i i was still watching but i was out from the cover just enough to still see them so i was stupid i flashed my flashlight at them then they stopped still in formation so i ran in the house and upstairs and woke my mother and brother up we went to he loft window and the orbs broke formation and went north but stopped over the woman's house next door and a little higher up we all were scared they were in different spots but close to each other then one went up higher and flickered out then a lower one did he same thing we watched them for 15 min out the loft window the 2 came back on and went south east so we ran to my mothers window which looks south and one was moving fast and the one that followed was slower the faster one was like over a trail that goes to a creek it stopped and the slower one wen near it and started to go east then stop more where the creek is we saw both drop sparks and looked like molten metal then the one closer to us it looked like it dropped a pod it was shaped like a grain of rice it was coming down real slow the one further away dropped a pod but it went down like i would say 5 feet from it then stopped and wen horizontally to the other pod then went down together then the orbs took off we went to see the other 2 but they were climbing high but still over the house next door and over my house it lasted around a half hour from he time i firs saw them behind the big tree to he time they dropped the pods and then took off these things scare the hell out of my mother and brother i felt so scared but the first time since i been seeing these orbs i been told im crazy and need help by many people and what

cat the object. that's when i reallised i was looking at an alien ship. i put the cat down and staird at it for a few minutes, it was 3-4 ft. above the house and probably 30 ft. away. it one light that would brighten up the ones around it as it would rotate around the ship and made no sound or movement the hole time. after a few minutes i ran inside and told my parents, brother, and sister's to come see the space ship outside, they told me they where coming so i went back outside to see if it was still there. the ship never moved. i stude in the drive way just looking at it for a few more minutes, when no one came out i went back in to tell them again to come see the space ship and again they said they where coming to see, so i ran back outside. luckily the ship was still there when i went back out. threw the holl time the ship did not move at all, just the one light going round and around. after a few more minutes still no one came out. so i went back in the house for a third time and again my parents said they where on there way out to see, so i went back outside but this time there was no space ship. it was gone and i was the only one who new it was there.

do.\r\n\r\n\r\nto start with i'm in alaska and this was captured on a very cold night 18 degrees with snow on the ground.\r\n\r\ni probably need to draw you a picture of the layout of my house, but i'll try to convey it here.\r\n\r\nthere is a 40 foot motor home in the front and i think you can see it in the clip.  this house is on a lake and\r\n\r\nthere is no where for anyone to go except the local people that live back here as the road dead ends here.\r\n\r\n\r\nso reflection from lights is not possible.  the electric company has a work yard across the street from my house, but you \r\n\r\ncan not see it when my motor home was parked here.  the cameras were put in by adt and are fixed and can not move.\r\n\r\n\r\nyou can see one bright object that comes from around the corner of my house and heads straight towards the camera and \r\n\r\nthen just goes down what looks like the street but you can't see much after it goes by.    but, i slowed down the clip and\r\n\r\ndiscovered that there were many orbs that night going straight back and forth across the yard and driveway and they were\r\n\r\nof various sizes and density.   first thing is to have an open mind as i had to when looking at this clip.   the clip has not been \r\n\r\nmodified in any way shape or form.  it's as real as it gets and it kind of scared me but i still live here today.\r\n\r\n\r\nanother strange thing that happens in the winter, especially this past winter here is that there was a ground vibration here\r\n\r\nthat only happened at night.  you could just feel it on the couch but really could feel it in bed.  this was very strange as this\r\n\r\nhouse sits on a concrete slab foundation.   i also had a strange thing happen to me here in alaska when i was a child.  i'm 65 now.\r\n\r\nit was before the earth quake of 1964 here.  i was fishing on the russian river here and saw a strange round object in the\r\n\r\nclouds but never told anyone.  also what i saw as a big orange brown spear i will submit this clip to start with on the site as i also joined your site.\r\n\r\n\r\nbtw:  all the orbs you see will be moving in a straight line without any deviation as far as i could tell in course.  please have\r\n\r\nsomeone that knows what they are doing look at this clip as i'm sure something strange is going on here.\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks for your time and i'm glad that you have this thing going.\r\n\r\n\r\ni will upload  that clip tonight as it's on a different computer than this one. \r\n\r\n\r\n[name

maricopa, headed to the i-10. between approx. mm183 and mm184, i noticed a floating rectangle, with blurred edges, over the northern end of south mountain. it was moving south towards the towers. it looked unusual, so i pulled off to the brim of the road and used my binoculars to get a better look. sky was clear, air was hazy and it was breezy with gusts. the object was a grey/lead color and was floating and moving slowly, at what appeared, south along the rim of the mountain ridge. while i was trying to figure out what it may be, it began descend to the point where i thought it might crash into the south mountain towers. it appeared to have been slightly east of the towers but inside the park area. after the descent, it ascended slightly. at this point, i got a feel for the size of the object. it appeared to be as tall as the towers and it's length, end to end, expanded the 3/4 the visual width of the all the towers next to each other. my thoughts went from, blimp?, no, not round...Parachutist?...No, too big...Banner being pulled by an airplane? no, too big and no small plane pulling it...Ok it is unidentifiable at this point. my binoculars got me a little closer to the object but not as close as they needed to be. after the object reached the end of the s.M. south ridge, it began to move east through wild horse pass towards phoenix. it was getting further away but i could see where it was joined by a white/shiny small orb to the upper left corner of the object. the rectangle changed into a vertical cigar shape and both it and the orb disappeared. i got back in my car and continued to the i-10, then east towards the 17, then to greenway rd. i kept looking e/se to see if i could spot the objects again but there was nothing more. there may have been one other witness. when i was pulling my car back onto the 347, i noticed a car pulled off to the brim just in front of my car, that i had not noticed when i first stopped. there was no one standing outside the

commercial planes. my son lives in rome and he also witnessed this via my pointing out where to look in the sky for the object. he told me at first he thought it was a star until it moved. i am truly

weather, and playing with my dog i noticed a solid sphere or orb hovering over the ocean at a guesstimate of 500+ ft.  \r\n\r\nit was a clear day with a few clouds, in late afternoon. the sun was toward the west and reflected off the orb's left/northwesterly side causing a whitish glare. \r\n\r\nthe opposite south/easterly side, away from the sun, appeared to be dark grey and smooth - though i did not have binoculars to verify its surface.\r\n\r\ni watched this thing hover for a good 20 to 40 seconds before i called my wife to come take a look at it.  when she came out of the house i asked her. \"what do you think that is?\"   a planet? she asked.  the moon?\r\n\r\nit did look like a planet but was much too big to be a planet. it appeared to me to be maybe 15 to 25 feet in diameter but is very difficult to gauge in a blue sky.\r\n\r\nas we were watching it, my dog attempted to give me her ball by poking it into my crotch which cause our attention to divert from the object for no
