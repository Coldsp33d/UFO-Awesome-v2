satellites often. this wasn't a satellite or a an identifiable aircraft.  i've been to many air shows and i'm familiar with military and commercial aircraft, as a remote interest.\r\n\r\nin my left peripheral, i noticed a loan single slow-strobing light slowly ascending at about an 85 degree trajectory. its lone dull white light would gradually fade on and off in roughly 2 second intervals.  it did this the entire time i watched it ascend out of sight and into the clear black night/stars, which was a little over a minute.\r\n\r\nthe light was larger than stars while it was low in altitude but shrank as it ascended into the stars.    \r\n\r\nonce i realized it wan't a plane, or a satellite i called my wife's attention to it and we watched it ascend together for probably 30 to 40 seconds before it became too high to further see with the naked eye and disappeared among the stars.\r\n\r\nmy wife then went inside. i stayed out staring up in wonder.  as soon as my wife went inside. a bright blue streak (electric looking in nature or like the blue color of a welding arc) \r\n\r\nit lit up left to right and shot across the entire sky in front of me, and over the south shore/ocean.  it was only a split second. it startled me and caused me to gasp and call for my wife to come back out but she didn't hear me and then it was gone.  i want to say i heard a noise but i'm not sure i could describe it.\r\n\r\nit was so bright blue, and straight. its ends just stopped unlike lightning. it had to be at least a 1/4 mile or longer. perfectly straight blue streak with no breaks in it.  like a fluorescent light tube across the sky. \r\n\r\nit appeared and was gone within 2 seconds. this wasn't lightning. i've seen lots of lightning. there was no lightning in the area that night.  the night was a clear summer night.\r\n\r\nthanks","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

my attention out of the corner of my eye to the right.  i looked up toward the large window over the living room windows and saw what appeared to be a fire ball.  i got up and went to the windows.  it was traveling south to north, heading towards my location at a steady speed.  it was not windy out.  \r\n\tit was a glowing red circle or orb, it did not emit smoke, it did not leave a tail.  i just stood watching it come closer and closer and was mesmerized by what it was so much so that i didn���t want to stop watching it to get my cell to take a video.  it made no sound.  it was approx. one story above the one story houses.  at it���s closest point to me, approx. 30 feet from me, it appeared to be between the size of a basket ball to a 3 foot circle which means it would have been larger in person.  it went between my house and the neighbors house at a steady speed.  i ran to the north side of the house and watched it continue north, it had already appeared on the north side of the houses and was traveling faster than i ran.  i did not feel threatened by this object at this point in time.  it appeared to be a red swirling ball of glowing gaseous liquid, but it was traveling at a constant speed and at a constant distance above the earth.  it appeared to be searching for something, or perhaps observing stuff.  i watched it disappear out of sight.  \r\n\ti was hoping to see others, so i grabbed my phone, used the bathroom, and turned off the house alarm so i could go outside if i saw another one.  i went back and forth from the north to the south sides of the house looking out the windows to see if there were others.  then at about 11:03 pm, i saw what appeared to be the same red glowing orb traveling from the north back south along the same exact path.  i activated my cell phone video but it���s shaky and the object appeared so small on the video compared to what i saw with my eyes.  all of a sudden i got an eery feeling because it seemed to be coming right at me and slowing down.  i decided to go outside to see it i could get a better video of it.  at this point, i am concerned as to not only what it is, buy why is it heading back toward me? as i walk outside and hold my cell up the object started traveling north away from me again.  at this point i am spooked.  i didn���t want to go outside, but feeling no threat and hearing no sound from the object i thought i could just get a video of it as it went over me.  however, as i hold up my cell phone, the object starts rapidly traveling north again.  \r\n\ti feel that it saw me and didn���t want to be taped.  the second video does not even show the object, despite my eyes seeing it.  during this time, there were no small planes in the area, but after watching it disappear out of sight the second time, i saw a small plane in the distance by the vero beach airport.  i saw planes over the house earlier in the evening, they never fly that low, and i can always hear them.\r\n\ti have 2 videos and have taken still pictures from the first video. i have also taken a video from the same window of a plane flying over for comparison.\r\ni wish to remain anonymous due to my being a professional person who deals with the public in this area and area south of here.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

strange feeling, almost like before you are in a panic state. i heard something heavy on the roof above me, the tiles where making noise as it moved. i was not sure what to make of the noise. i thought it could be an owl or hawk possibly given the area i live in. it did not feel right though. as i started paying more attention. i noticed that my room was getting darker and darker, this made no sense to me, it was 3am how could my room possibly be getting darker. almost immediately this feeling of dread and extreme discomfort started taking over me, i told myself this is enough. you are tired, this is just your mind playing games. so i turned over in my bed to face the wall. the intensity in the room could be cut with a knife. i could not shake this over baring feeling like i was not alone in my room. some how i manage to fall asleep and i wish i hadn't. i start to wake up again. this time its different, i feel extremely groggy, the feeling you get when you are waking up from anesthesia. i can hear voices but i am not coherent enough to make out the sound. i am trying to open my eyes to see anything but nothing is happening, i am blind. my next thought is to try to move, i cant. i am stuck to what feels like a table. what struck me though is i felt no straps or ties. during my attempt to move i noticed the voices stop. i hear heavy steps coming from my back right shoulder. before i can do anything else something very strong grabs me by the jaw and top of my head and forces my mouth shut. the pressure was so great i thought my teeth were going to crack. i hear a loud pop, my first and last thought was this thing just shattered my teeth and jaw, i noticed a chock like foamy taste in my mouth before i black out. when i awake the next day. i feel absolutely horrible. my face feels like it took a pummeling. my body was in shock and i proceed to puke. when i am in the bathroom, to my amazement, there is not a single mark or scratch on my body despite the

never told anyone, due to being called crazy and such, so this is my first time writing my story so bare with me =)\r\n\r\nit was about 1 am on a really clear night in the valley and my girlfriend and i had a couple glasses of wine and relaxed in the backyard on some blankets looking up at the stars. my girlfriend falls asleep and annoyingly i am wide awake. i am on my back looking straight up and for some reason i keep finding myself looking at a particular set of stars in a triangle shape. they didn't seem any different than any other star in the sky. but for some reason i lay there scanning the sky while wide awake and keep finding myself scanning back to those 3 stars. i have been following mufon for years now and its a habbit of mine to always keep an eye on the sky, just incase, and still nothing was different about these 3 stars but i was almost compelled to watch them. i finally doze off for maybe an hour and i wake to my eyes being fixed once again on them and i can't stop thinking them. at least an hour goes by and im watcing planes go by and playing with my cat and i suddenly get a strange burst of emotion and feel again compelled to look at those stars. i was happy. it felt crazy strange but i starting smiling and feeling a ton of joy and as i watched them, the star on the bottom right starts to drift to the right. i moved slow but not in a straight line. it would move upwards and then downwards but never and jolts of movement. i followed it through the sky for about 45 seconds and it never changed shape. just looked like a star. i was nearly in tears by the time i lost it over my house. \r\nthe more i think about it i feel that whatever entity that was in control of the object wanted me to see it. its hard to explain the feeling i had when i was

right down the street at about the only location we realy know about there. someone used to spook us when we walked by that house as a kid. the aliens seem to remind us recently of things that we had thought of and forgot. they help you to remember the scary things so you can forget them because when we originally thought of them we forgot without thinking of it and becoming unscared of it. it was something scary and they helped us remember it so we wouldn't be scared no more so we can put it out of our minds. \r\nso, the helicopter flew real real low by the house someone told us on the  phone day before yesterday. it had happened the day before and they had just got a real real weird phone call about 15 minutes before we called. it had real real weird static on the line they said and they hung up. it wasn't usual and hadn't happened ever before. don't know what color the helicopter was or much on how the call sounded. they said the helicopter flew real real low and the call was real real weird though. they said it was an airlift because of a car crash. they said it landed down the street first - flew weird though. the car crash idea was probably just something they thought of to make sense of it. it surely wasn't one and at first they just said that it was a real weird helicopter flying strange and landed. they didn't mention a car crash. didn't mention the main road. they mentioned a weird flying helicopter is what it was. and nothing of any cars or anything like that- just that it had landed. so the other story of the car wreck and air-lift was not realy what it was. \r\nwe thought of a helicopter that flew by here low recently and voices said they'd make one fly low there, too. they said it'd be the hells angles outlaw motorcycle gang- just like flew by here many times very low outside our window. that is how they do death threats- they are a mafia organization. so, then the voices said aliens fly by and land down street in helicopter and you just think of an air lift due to a car crash would be why they'd land like that. helicopters landed down the street here before, too. but the voices said landing there and aliens or mafia and that they knew a car wreck would happen or they would cause it to happen. realy, it may have been aliens or else the hell's angel's mafia organization maybe - perhaps possessed by aliens and landed there. don't know what it looked like or what the occupant's looked like. it landed so that is unusual. the call was weird- at same time the mafia calls there daily which would be when we woke up the day before. they call and tell lies on the phone because that is mafia activity. they lie on the phone and tell them the same things we said the day before at the same time we said them the day before. it is meant to make them trust them- sound familiar to the person so they trust a stranger. the hell's angel's do lot's of murders for money and that is what that is. they work with other mafia organizations, too such as georgia mafias which is what some of them are out there. so, the aliens called the next day, too and did weird noises on the phone. static maybe copying that song by the band who did 'love shack' because we thought of that song other day, too. maybe aliens put the song in our mind. b-52's is the band name. channel z song- maybe we used to think the song was ufo's or something related to it like ufo's contating you telepatically. the aliens may have reminded us of that idea that we'd never have remembered otherwise. don't know if we ever thought that realy. or we used to think tv's were weird or something- like the film poltergeist. the voices maybe were helping us forget soemthign that scared us though by reminding us that we thought of it and forgot it before we calmed down over it. so we could remember it and forget it. so they landed and just basically also annoying us with voices and scaring us. it was a helicopter, but it maybe was aliens and it landed- don't know if it was black. rape is associated with a ufo landing spot where an alien was sighted in the vicinity. it landed and one was sighted apparently at least. if it was the mafia or not we don't know, but that itself is ufo related because it's alien related because aliens have something to do with a gang that kills thousands of innocent people every year - mostly in the southern us. they work with other mafia organizations, too though a whole lot- we know because we have seen them. and they are international, too a-lot we know because we have seen that, too. we'll have to ask about the color of the helicopter and what the occupant/s looked like. \r\nthey abdolutely did not at first say it was a car crash and air-lift via helicopter. they said it flew by real real low! it had landed down the street! and all you could figure out is why they'd do that would be an air-lift to the hospital from a car crash maybe on the main road. why else would it be there? is it legal to land personal helicopters wherever you want like that? in a residential neighborhood and flying that low- they said it was terribly low. we've seen low planes before because we have seen ufo's before and aliens flying low. this was even lower apparently. \r\nreal real weird static on the phone the next day and they hung up the phone they said. so it's not normal and it does not even sound like a prank call. i have got calls from et's before and here we have stopped answering the phone. the alien/s called maybe just to freak us out seems like and they may have been ordered to phone us up from time to time like it's their job by a top alien. we heard a voice saying they'd be a weird call and there was- with static real weird on it- and it was. the day before we had tried to call out there and they were on the phone to the mafia. the mafia calls and lies and tells them things we said day before at the same time they call there the next day. it's to gain trust and they had called and were on the phone lieing to them out there to make them think they have something in common with them- to sound familiar so they will put their guard down and trust them when they shouldn't. so calling people like that would cause et's to get there because the mafia is doing very violent type of thing by doing that. et's being evil have something to do with it. so there's the mafia and also we don't usually call out there and we recalled that. aliens maybe wanted to remind us of that and how bad it was coz they hate us out there of course. we had to call though because there was important business needed done and you can't do it in 2 minutes once a week here in town realy. we had to do things about buying groceries, clothes and everything and we had to call. they maybe wanted to remind us - did we get mad and freak out and say we weren't calling and to remind us to calm down over whatever we maybe thought on that whole thing if we heard voices on it or whatever. \r\ni heard about it via the voices 1st, they saw it and surely many others saw it there in the town. aliens could fly a helicopter and even abduct people or animals onto them and make people think it was an air-lift.","distance":"20 Feet or

getting dark at this time of year. . as i was passing the lake i noticed this craft just hovering about 20/25feet above the lake water. so i stop to watch it. at first i thought that it was a hot air balloon. then i realized no sound and no flames. it was dark in color; triangle in shape; then the lights came on; i noticed it had 3round dome shape with blueish glow lights coming from them; each was apprx. 3to5foot in diameter and appx 1to2foot thick at it's center peak of the dome underneath the craft. and a smaller dome in the center with that being a white glow.  on top it saw only one greyish/white glow dome apprx 10plus feet in diameter with a high dome. it was just hovering their. then one of the bottom dome lights went brighter blueish/green light and it seem like it was taken in water. it moved very slowly and never a sound was made. i would say that that the thickness of the craft would be around 10/15feet and the sides 50/80feet in length..The brighter light went back to it's orginal color. then it started to move very slowly up; when it got little higher than the trees it started slowly turning away from me; over the trees as it got higher; made acouple small turns; then it started to point it's nose up; the in a blink if not quicker it was gone. i felt a strong breeze right after. then i notice in the far distance just a steady white speck of light moving fast in a northern direction; then from a straight line it took what it look like a right angle direction then gone. then i went to my daughters. it seemed like a short time but when i got to my daughters house; hours had passed it was almost 9:45pm. my daughter asked me what took me so long..I told her what i saw at the lake.  but then 3days later at my house; it was late midnight/one am. i took my dog outside to do what she needed to do. she started to act funny going in circles (like chasein' her tail) and looking up in the night sky. when i looked up; their was that triangle craft again. about 75/100feet above me. now whether it was the same craft from the lake i don't know. but i really feel deep down it's safe to say that it was. it was in total darkness; all i could see was the outline of it against the night sky. then suddenly from the center dome a whiteish/blue light shined down upon me. then the nexts thing i was inside my house and it was 3:15am. i felt lost;beside myself;little sore this time under my arms;but all in all wondered if or when they'd comeback and this time let me see and remember all...\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

amazed at the quick movement and how it flew from east to west in a matter of seconds then stopped in mid-air. i remember asking my boyfriend at the time, what is that? we watched it for several minutes so it seemed. it hoovered, it flew to the east within seconds, then it went up within seconds, then back down hoovering in the sky at each direction it flew. then within a second it vanished, ascending, we didn't see it anymore. my boyfriend said \"that was a ufo\" and i totally agree to this day. a helicopter doesn't travel at speeds like that. if i could estimate the total length it flew in a second i would say 30 to 50 miles, then stopped in mid-air. of course people think your nuts when you tell them this, but you know i don't care. we know what we saw that clear night long ago. and to this day i know it wasn't a helicopter, airplane or search light. i've tried looking in the bible for similiar things because i want answers too. i really do not remember the feelings i had when i
