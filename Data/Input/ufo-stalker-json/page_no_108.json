States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"In this last august, i drove thru prineville to go to an outdoor festival event called the oregon eclipse festival. while i drove thru prineville, i noticed a strange looking building on my left side that looked military. there was something strange about how it looked. it was big, rectangular and grey with no markings on the outside. but the outside of it was totally lit up with exterior lights. i thought it might be a military base. at the festival, i saw a ufo on early sunday morning and figured it might have to do with that strange building i saw in prineville, since the festival was physically near prineville. \r\n\r\ni decided to return to prineville to investigate the building. on october 28th, i drove to prineville. around 11:00pm, i drove past prineville airport. at first, i thought it could be the airport. it was not. i drove past it and first saw a sign for \"national guard armory\" right before the strange-looking grey buildings. i figured the buildings must belong to the national guard. \r\n\r\ni drove to my hotel, got my key then drove back up to the ochoco waypoint lookout. i thought it might be locked but it was open. seemed like the best place to spot a possible ufo as it was high in elevation. i drove up the road and parked at the top. i waited there for anything to happen. i had my video camera ready for digital filming. around midnight, an older truck drives up and i two young guys park and hang out, talking about teenage stuff. i sat in the darkness under the pavilion and waited for them to leave. \r\n\r\nafter about 20-25minutes, they got back in their truck and left the lookout and drove down the hill. after they left, i enjoyed the view and took a couple videos clips of the city lights below and of the grey buildings which i thought were the national guard. the moon was low on the horizon so i got some good video of the moon next to the grey buildings.\r\n\r\naround 1am on october 29th, while i was walking around looking at the sky, i spotted a flickering/flashing light in the sky. i got very excited and started recording on my digital video camera. i could not believe i was seeing a ufo in the city i thought they would be in. i was in shock. the light was flashing a bright red-blue color, in a random fashion. it was almost starlike but much brighter, about twice as bright as the stars in the sky. also saw some greenish light and some silvery light too. it was almost eye level, only a couple degrees higher than my position on that lookout. when i zoomed in, it appeared that the light was spinning somehow. the light would dim then brighten and dim again randomly. but there seemed to be a sort of pattern to it too. i also noticed early on that the light seemed to be affecting a street light i think, as there was this orange glow near the ground glowing brighter and dimmer. i caught it on digital film as the ground light glowed brighter then eventually went out completely. i had trouble using the focus on my simple video camera, so some of this part is blurry. i sat the video camera down as the light hovered in the distance, just left of some street lights. i used the street lights as a reference point to show the ufo movement over time. i sat my video camera down on a wall and used my wallet to prop it up so i could get a good view of the ufo. i narrated the video with my observations. after about 10-15 minutes, i heard a car coming up the road. it had new, whitish led headlights. it drove up to the look-out, drove around the roundabout up there and then drove back down the road. i was at my camera recording, and completely froze when this happened. i thought i was in trouble. i didnt get a look of the car, all i know is that it had white led headlights, likely a newer car. this made me slightly paranoid.\r\n\r\nabout 30 more minutes go by, and i am getting cold. i head to my car, and start it up then realize that i flashed my headlights at the building. i got paranoid when this happened and quickly turn off my car. i head back to my video camera that is still recording, and i am there for about 10 more minutes. i hear another car come up the road. it has newer led headlights again. it comes around the road again and i get real paranoid but i look at the car. its a newer model white sedan car with white headlights. no logos or markings. looked like a woman was in the car. hard to tell thou. the car drives around the roundabout and again heads back down the road. this makes me really paranoid but i am determined to get more footage. i continued to film.\r\n\r\nabout 25 minutes pass and i head to my car again. my memory card was getting low on space, but i wanted to use all of it here at the lookout for this ufo. at this point, i was getting cold again and needed to warm up. the ufo was still hovering in the distance. i could tell it was moving around slightly, like fluttering almost, but always came back to a hover. it was slowly moving away from its original place. the flashing red-blue light kept going the whole time. i was in my car when i heard a large truck driving up. now i got really paranoid. i jumped out of my car, and tried to quickly run over to my video camera. but as i made it to the middle median in the middle of the roundabout road, the truck drove around and cut off my path. it was driving kinda fast for the road which you should drive slower due to the sharp turns. i stopped in the middle of the median area and let the truck past so i could get to my video camera, which i thought would be stolen at this point. i walk across the street, thinking the truck would keep driving. the truck stops in the middle of the road, puts it in reverse and cuts my path off again, almost hitting me at around 5 mph. i freeze in the middle of the road. i get a good look at his truck. its a newer truck with a metal rack thing behind the cab. it looks like a flat bed type truck. its white in color. no logos or markings. it also had those newer led headlights. i looked at the guy in the truck, he just looks at me. we look at each other for a long couple seconds then he slowly drives away. truck has a strong, deep tone to its engine. \r\n\r\nat this point, i got a strong feeling that the guy in the truck was trying to intimate me and scare me off. and it worked. i got very paranoid and decided it was time for me to leave. if this was a government truck, i had to get out of there before i got into trouble looking at this ufo. i walked over to my camera, and stopped the recording. i got my stuff, went to my car and waited a bit to see if that truck was gone, then started my car and drove back to my hotel room. on the drive there, i got real paranoid that i was being followed. it seemed like i wasnt, but during the entire morning, i could not sleep as i thought about what just happened to me.\r\n\r\nsadly, i did not get this situation with the truck on video, i think my video camera had some kind of error or something. also, i later found out that those strange buildings were actually the facebook data center. but i have a feeling that might be a front. i believe that facebook might have a partnership with the national guard in some way. i also researched the location where i saw the ufo. it was almost directly over the apple data center. i think there must be some kind of military connection to the apple data center and/or facebook data center.\r\n\r\ni included video of the facebook data center and a panorama prineville from the lookout as reference of my location.\r\n\r\ni also saw other things that night, near sunrise, which i will make another \r\nseparate report for.\r\n\r\nnote: i recorded 7 clips totaling about 1 hour and 20 minutes of footage, but when i tried to upload them, my browser crashed after hours of uploading. each video clip is very large, therefore i am only uploading the first video clip for practical purposes.","distance":"101-500

a pasture next to it. the neighborhood was shaped like a figure-8, with houses dotted inside the “boxes” of the figure, and outside of it. my house was located in one of the boxes, and i had a good view of the road behind me, to one side of me, and of course, in front of my house.\r\n\r\na little before dusk one day, i happened to look outside my living room window. my gaze fell upon the road behind me, and a purple-white light caught my attention. the road in question had a slope, and i thought it odd that this orb of light neither increased in speed nor bobbed up and down to match the gait of a person walking. \r\n\r\nas i watched this light, it travelled at a consistent speed (5-10 mph) down the road, and turned the corner. puzzled, i switched my vantage point to my office window, where i could then see the light travel from the side of the “figure-8” road. now that i’m older and look back at this, i can’t believe i did this, but i decided to go outside for a closer look. my house had its own sidewalk, and the exterior walls of the office shielded me from view. as i watched from my new perch, the orb continued to slowly travel toward my stretch of road. \r\n\r\nfeeling a little uneasy, but still skeptical, i decided to hide behind a baby pine tree (great hiding spot lol) on the side of my driveway. the orb was continuing on its path toward my house. now, the ditches along the houses were fairly deep. my brother and i, long with my friends, would regularly jump our bikes over them. a person on foot would need to take a pretty hefty step over it, possibly even a small leap. \r\n\r\nthe light must have noticed me, because it approached my new vantage point and simply glided over the ditch towards me. after it was within about 15 feet of me, i totally noped out of there! my back yard had a chain link fence, and i did this awesome mario styled wall jump over it (i’m kind of short and my fence was about 5 feet tall. in hindsight, i’m pretty stoked about this move.) \r\n\r\ni’m really not sure what happened to the orb after that. i went outside with my parents to look for it (they noticed i was pretty freaked out), but we couldn’t find it. \r\n\r\ni really wish i could witness it again to see if my reaction would be different. it would be nice to know what the thing was. the light was very bright, but seemed contained, unlike a headlight. it also had a glow around where the more comcentrated light was.

my brother my 2 sisters and a few friends spent a lot of time investigating the pill boxes left over from ww2 on the north downs, one particular one which had since been covered up was one we visited on a regular basis. \r\non one very sunny day we were there messing about.\r\nbaring in mind on a good day you could see the south downs and gatwick airport from the view point and on this day we could see both. therefore we could see planes landing and taking off (but as specks on the horizon)\r\nas our view was to the south, gatwick was on our left in the distance.\r\nat some point someone and i cannot remember who pointed out a bright light at about 45 degrees from our view point. we all assumed this was a plane coming into gatwick but heading straight towards us before it turned towards the airport as it looked as though it was a plane head on reflecting of the sun which would have been either above or directly behind at this time of day in the summer.\r\nhowever it didn’t turn it didn’t get bigger or smaller it just stayed exactly where it was so a natural curiosity grew for us all. \r\nin all honesty i cannot say for how long it stayed there but it must have been 5 minutes at least.\r\nthen within a blink of the eye it shot straight up and out of sight leaving a trace behind it.\r\nalthough this happened years ago and i’ve no evidence ive spoken to those that were there since and they all remember the event.\r\nbaring in mind i was all of 13yrs old at the time it to this day is one of my most vivid memories of my youth and although i’m a believer in the fact there is other things out there now before this time my only thought or aliens and ufos at this time was from things like star trek of which i’d never had any interest in.\r\ni don’t expect an investigation as i have no physical evidence but after all this time i needed to report it as it’s something that has always been in my memory but i’ve never spoken about as people look at you like your mad when you do.\r\nsince this point, and i don’t want to sound like i’m a crazy person but i’ve got and odd lump on the back of my left forearm that is neither soft or hard causes no pain but is not usual.\r\ni have attached a picture of this is of any

moment i saw these objects about 10, they appeared to be falling burning pieces of debris from space at first, they glowed bright gold as if the sun was illuminating them but then more grey and red objects shaped like somewhat flattened globes appeared and some bright lights could be seen clustered high overhead barely visible. the objects continue to approach and descend together rapidly and i thought to grab the camera and start video and photographic record. the objects moved quickly to the north about 2 miles before they were almost overhead and they started to glow gold and all disappeared together. i have two pics that show a red object near a gold top shaped object and you see the red object disappearing in the next frame. the sighting lasted about 1 or 2 minutes. then about 1 minute later another solitary object similar also appeared and disappeared in the same area but as i said a few minutes later however with no sparkles of light, it just vanished as it got to

at one point it appeared to wobble or slightly deviate from its path but that could have been caused by it being temporarily obscured by tree branches. the whole event lasted no more than 3.5 seconds and the light traveled from east to west before being lost to sight. as we were leaving our street i noticed that there appeared to be a smaller plane of the type we're accustomed to seeing in the sky. this plane had its blinking lights on and was located a bit further to the south of the unknown object's trajectory.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

the sky was and how beautiful the stars were. my wife then pointed to what she thought was a star. i am an eagle scout so i have star gazed many nights when i was younger. i told her it wasnt a star because it was a white with a blue tint radiating from the edges. it appeared to hover with what looked like a harmonic vibration. i immediately told her it was not a star and to not look away from it. as we looked at it we were frozen. absolutely frozen. i asked her \"does it feel like it is with you?\" she said it did. as we conitnued to watch i told her to not be scared. as soon as i said \"that is a ufo!\" it went from a hover to extremely fast arc flight path then stopped instantly. it then took a straight line flight path up and to the east. i have saw fighter jets scramble over the house under the speed of sound but fast, and that is no where near as fast as this. this object flew at what appeared to be 10,000 mph. instant stop and instant start with zero noise. my wife after it left ran into the house. we could have witnessed it for 3 minutes to 20 minutes. we dont know. we were lost in awe. a couple weeks went by and my brother came into town. my wife and i hesitated but we told him of the encounter. we talked about it for about an hour. we then walked outside. i immediately felt the same energy with me. i didnt have to look around for it. i walked around my house and knowingly looked straight up at it. i told him to not look away. he then saw a zig zag pattern followed by an up and away flight pattern at the same extreme speeds. again no noise. he was scared to death also and said he felt it as well. the speed it travels looks like it is close to the speed of a comet crossing the sky. the shooting stars that you barely get a glimpse of. this has impacted me. every time i think about it i goosebump all over instantly. i would love to talk with someone who could may explain more.

aviation.Being a qualified commercial pilot.I have an app called flight radar 24 which i occasionally scroll through to identify aircraft types. but noticed and object very high up.Based on the app and the airliner height of approx 35,000 i would say this a little higher.I noticed it because it did not move but was bright.Partly from the reflection of the sun glare radiating from it.And i noticed  a bright white light pulsed.Occasionally from one end.It seemed cylindrical but tapered in the middle.It started to move after a minute or so.It looked like it was tumbling.Then it stopped.Then moved slowly off to the right. the flashing white light appeared not to be consistent but random.It then stopped for a few minutes before moving away slowly into the sun. that's where i lost it. it was very high.I attempted to film it with my smart phone but due to its distance from me, keeping  the phone steady when filming was very hard.I did film it for a while but the results were a little disappointing. i also took a picture. i became very excited at seeing this as it was very unusual.A colleague thought thought it could be the space lab? but i ascertained that that would follow a gravitational orbit.Its movements did not suggest anything related to that.I lost sight when it moved further south into the higher cirrus cloud and direct sunlight.\r\nit also bares a striking similarity to a video posted on the swansea ufo network a couple of weeks before.Although it appeared to be moving all the time.It was not.It was difficult to hold the phone still due to the

a craft that looked like a triangle without the bottom line had lights up and down both sides and wherever we went it went with us. my children were now starting to get scared. i explained to them as best i could that if they took us we would be together and i would protect them. yeah sure i would. what do you say to three scared kids. i knew they weren't going to leave us and i drove back home. we went back into the house and waited hugged together on the sofa. soon my husband walked thru the door and the kids ran screaming and crying to their dad. he had no idea what was happening. i explained as best i could. i'm sure my husband thought i had finally lost it. he turned on the television and there it all was.  they told about two large orange balls that officers on both sides of the river had seen. washington lies on one side of the river and oregon lies on the other side. they both heard the wind and high pitch noise and the balls split in half and went down into the river. they came back up and the two halves went back together and were gone. they had to believe two police officers. i knew then that i was not crazy. the kids told their dad about the space ship that had followed us everywhere. the television station asked if anyone had any contact or saw these things to contact them. i called and they said so many had called they were going to do a show on it. when l went for the show there were a lot of people there. the air force had men there. the man from the air force interviewed us all. i told him what had happened. he said we could not tell it to the public because we would panic the nation. i told him l didn't care because people needed to know. then he showed me a book that said project bluebook on it. inside where pictures of aliens and space crafts. the real thing.  well as you might guess that show never aired. they threatened everyone in their own way. after that you never heard anything again about what happened. for many years after when a big windstorm happened i was terrified. whenever  heard a siren of ant kind i would get scared. it took along time to get over it all. i have seen a lot over the years, but l just keep it to myself. what good does it do to tell anyone anyway. that was a lot of years ago and now people see a lot and do tell about it. we all know they are out t can here and just waiting till they can peacefully come and meet with us. it won't be that much longer.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":87780,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.5301622,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11032017-0006","longitude":-122.6665615,"occurred":353694600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oregon","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1509714186000,"summary":"Not like most,,they came to my house.","tags":["sound","triangle","lights","contact"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":1509832137706,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":true,"hail":false,"maxtempm":16,"maxtempi":60,"maxvism":32,"maxvisi":20,"meantempm":8,"meantempi":46,"meanvism":17,"meanvisi":11,"mintempm":0,"mintempi":32,"minvism":1,"minvisi":0,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":true,"hail":false,"maxtempm":16,"maxtempi":60,"maxvism":32,"maxvisi":20,"meantempm":8,"meantempi":46,"meanvism":17,"meanvisi":11,"mintempm":0,"mintempi":32,"minvism":1,"minvisi":0,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":13379,"locationName":"Portland, Oregon","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:11986"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Buckeye Lake","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I went to the town of buckeye lake to take pictures of the lake and enjoy the sunset.I was there about 45 mins walking around taking many pictures facing west towards columbus. i didn't notice the object at first until i was reviewing my pictures and noticed what looked like the moon on the left side of the picture about halfway up in the southwest sky. i zoomed in the picture to see what it was and had no idea what i was looking at. at that point it was long gone. i looked in the other pictures i took and didn't see it in any of them. i decided to ask you. i'm sure it's nothing but has me rather curious.
