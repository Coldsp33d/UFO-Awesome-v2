States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"In the summer month of 1978 (june or july), myself and three friends were cardboard sliding down a grassy hill near my house. we were all 11 to 12 at the time and we were having a great time. it was a warm, clear, sunny day and there were no clouds or airplanes in the area. as we slid down the hill, about halfway down there was a wire fence that would stop us from sliding all the way down the hill. the four of us were sitting at the fence, talking after another trip down the hill when one of us, i believe it was mike, looked up in the sky and said, \"whoa, check that out.\" we looked up to where he was pointing and saw the most unbelievable thing i've ever experienced. a massive fireball was in the sky above our heads. it was probably the size of two football fields in length and the width of one football field. it was huge and about 1000 feet above us. the flames seemed to be continually generating, not burning out, but continuing to burn as if there was an endless supply of fuel. it reminded me of a huge explosion fireball. unbelievable. \r\n\r\nwe stared at the fireball, exclaiming how unreal it looked, wondering if planes had collided in mid-flight. it couldn't have been because there was no explosion and the fireball was silent and void of any falling debris. after about five minutes the real fireworks began. from each end of the fireball came elliptical-shaped flying objects. they were shiny, looking like stainless steel material. they didn't have wings and were shaped like eggs. they shot across the sky in opposite directions, disappearing over the opposite horizons in a matter of seconds, yet they made no sound. i have since worked on several engineering projects on military bases and i have seen fighter jets take off and fly across the sky at high speeds. these two elliptical ufo's were way faster than any of these fighter planes and with the fighter jets, they always make loud roars as they tear across the sky. these ufo's made no sound whatsoever. we stared for the next couple minutes, wondering if the ufo's would come back, also watching the huge fireball, burning as bright as it had when we first saw it. after a couple minutes we saw both ufo's approaching from the north, flying close to each other as they sped across the sky, when they both suddenly made 90-degree turns in opposite directions, one to the west and one to the east. they then made several more directional changes, doing things that no airplane or helicopter could ever do, at speeds that defied modern avionics. left turns, turns straight up or straight down, all while traveling at high speeds and all turns were made on a dime - almost right angle turns and change of directions. we couldn't believe what we were seeing. this mid-air aerial acrobatics continued for the next 5 minutes before the two ufo's once again disappeared over opposite horizons, one north and the other south. \r\n\r\nit was another five minutes before we saw them again. just as we thought they were gone, they reappeared and came straight at each other in a high-speed game of chicken. as they got close enough to crash into each other they both turn 180 degrees and shot off away from each other. we assumed they were going to disappear over the horizons again, but they both shot back toward each other and got close to each other, hovering about 500 feet away from the massive fireball. and then the most unbelievable part of this story happened. it was all unbelievable to this point, but then one of the ufo's emitted a light beam toward the other ufo. it was like the one shot a bright white bolt of electricity at the other. it was a direct hit and the other ufo went from shiny like stainless steel to a dull grey, as if it had lights earlier that had just been turned off. and then we stood in disbelief as the ufo that had just been shot with the bolt of light, fell from the sky, straight down, disappearing over the mountains to our west. the other ufo then flashed four white lights, in a circular sequence and then it shot straight up, disappearing in the blink of an eye. it was there and then gone in less than a second. unreal. we all screamed in disbelief, unable to process what our young minds had just witnessed. \r\n\r\nwhen then turned our attention to the fireball, hoping to see more ufo's flying out of it, but what happened next was the fireball began to fade. this fireball that seemed to have an endless supply of fuel earlier was now burning out. it took about five minutes before the massive fireball was completely gone and the experience was over. i swear to my god in heaven this story is all true. i have often thought of hiking to the area in the mountains where the one ufo went down, but for some reason i have never gone. i would like to someday, but i'm sure there is private property issues and living in sonoma county a person needs to be careful about hiking in the hills on their own. (marijuana growers). \r\n\r\nwe had one of my friend's mother call to see if there were any air shows or other training things going on that day, and she said they told her there were no aircraft in the area. i can't confirm if she actually called anyone or not, but i know what i saw that day. i have only told a few people about this over the years, for fear of being laughed at or called a liar, but i would sit for a lie-detector test anytime and would pass. this really happened.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

and had never before seen one personally. so naturally at first we all thought maybe it was a helicopter with a search light hovering over the tree line. we had never seen this before either so we all thought it was just a little odd. so we kept our eye on it for a bit and we noticed it was moving very fast then slowing to a hover. i noticed the light it was emitting was like no other light i have ever seen in my life. i have seen many different types of aircraft since i have a background in the u.S. military. i have never seen an aircraft make those kind's of movements to then come to an immediate stop then completely change direction. the light we all watched that the craft was emitting made distinct pointed edges in the light, as if i were looking through a dirty windshield. the light also had distinct color, like a blend of yellow, white, and orange. this continued on for over an hour, the aircraft was sort of floating around and changing direction on a dime. we were so enamored with this whole event, it felt like we didn't blink for the whole hour an a half we watched this thing kind of just hang around. the whole time we were waiting for the craft to kind of dart off or disappear in front of our eyes like we have seen on other ufo video's. but the sun started to come up and it just slowly started to blend in with the rising dawn. i am shocked i witnessed this event. but pleased to see it for myself.\r\n\r\n \r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"01:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

a sphere or orb, white and semi translucent. the object appeared no bigger than a soccer ball. the shape was very clean, not distorted, a perfect orb or spherical shape. i first assumed the object to be a plastic bag or seagull but the object stopped in midair in what appeared to be 15 ��� 25 mph winds heading south by south east. the object was at an altitude higher than a six story building but lower than the aircraft taking off at the nearby san jose airport. several commercial aircraft, 2 or 3 mostly 737s were visible during this time. the object moved in an erratic behavior dropping 50 ��� 60 ft and then climbing vertical another 50 ��� 60 ft. the object moved right to left in a 50 yard area and then suddenly headed south and vertical in an upward motion at a speed much faster than the surrounding aircraft, birds, or insects that i observed. another way to characterize the speed, i have worked closely with f-18 hornets and have never seen them capable of travelling at this speed. i doubted my observation several times thinking it could be a plastic bag, a bird, a drone, an insect, or even a piece of flying pollen. none of the above items match the flight characteristics that this odd craft showed as it seemed intelligently controlled, capable of stopping and moving about in any direction, at any speed despite the winds. there were no visible clouds, no light shining on the windows of the building that i observed the object through. i have never seen anything like it. there was no visible propulsion system, jet intake, propellers, or anything that would indicate the power source this craft used to move about. if i had not been staring where i was at that exact moment i never would have seen it.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

it was. but i couldn't. i went on down to the store and the brother was drinking a soda leaning against his car. when i got out of the car he ask me what happened. he said he had been waiting for 15

this, read all before judging.\r\n\r\nthe reason i am writing, as i have seen many ufo's, is because i watch all the ufo shows, hanger 1, files, ect. as i am a fan of space and what is out there.  i believe that there is life out in the universe, and aliens have been here, and still are around today.  i was watching a show on the germans in ww 2, about the rockets.  the part about the german rocket engineers coming here after the war, namely werner van braun.  my dad worked with him.  my dad said he worked for chrysler missile.  he did, and i have pics somewhere with van brawn and my dad working on blueprints of some rockets. my dads name and credentials can be seen on a follow up.\r\n\r\nmy dad was employed by the us gov, i believe now, black opps, and the tacom and atac were his cover.  he would get phone calls in the middle of the night, and i would hear him say \" i'm not going to 51 tonight\" and then a few minutes later he would leave the house for weeks. my dad was always going to cape canaveral, houston, montgomery al., and always flying to nevada.  sometimes he would take mom and me for a vacation, but when we got there he was never around.  mom said dad was working.\r\n\r\nmy dads brothers also worked for the us gov, very secret, there was also a man named martin van braun, not sure if that's right name.  i overheard at a family christmas party, that the race to the moon was not to be the russians there, but to beat the russians to the crash site on the moon. ?????  something was on the moon before us. many items came back from the apollo missions besides rocks !! lots of crazy stories between my dad and his brothers when they thought the \"kids\" were asleep.\r\n\r\ni asked my dad a couple of times if there were ufo's, he just looked at me and smiled.  he did once say the reason of allot of \"sightings\" around military bases and nuclear power plants was for our \"own\" protection. aliens didn't need to refuel, they were wacthing for mistakes and to make sure we didn't blow up the planet. aliens don't want nukes in space.\r\n\r\nfrom everything i have heard, i believe aliens and ufo's have always been around.  i do not think they would harm us on purpose, just the opposite.\r\n\r\nvan braun told my dad once that he had \"special help\" with the v2 rocket and the yaw problems. have you ever seen picture of a redstone rocket with atlas boosters???  i have a pic maybe.  my dad didn't want nukes on redstones, so \"they\" came up with the polaris rocket.\r\n\r\nhey i am sure you get lots of crazies stories.  i just thought you should know some of this, just file this, or contact me if you want.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"12:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":56252,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.3233943,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05142014-0001","longitude":-85.5928443,"occurred":-320014800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,

when suddenly one of them pointed out something weird in the storm that was approaching our area. i looked up and observed what looked like oval lights flying around erratically among the clouds. this was at night so their lighting (if that's what it's called) was more noticeable. when i first saw it, i just thought it was the lightning that was flashing fairly frequently among the storm. but i quickly dismissed this upon further observation due to the circular/oval shape of the lights. i then wondered if it was the dj's lights somehow shining up into the sky, again this was also quickly dismissed due to the dj being at a completely different angle and being inside of a garage. i wish i had a more complete and clear description of the objects, but i was being distracted quite often at the time (being 18, the women talking to me took first priority) however, i was able to notice a couple things. first, they were oval in shape and were lit up. second, there was around 4 total objects observed, but they weren't all always together at one given time, with some fading out and coming back later. thirdly, they seemed to be flying in some sort of circular formation, sticking together for the most part. as far as how i felt, i wasn't worried or anything that's for sure. this is probably the 5th or 6th time i've witnessed a ufo out here in mid missouri in the past couple years and this was just another one i happened to see. i merely observed the objects and did not attempt to pursue them. however after some time, it appeared as if the storm changed directions, sparing the party of a rainstorm and causing me and my friends to lose sight of the objects. we all just went back to the party and didn't think twice about them. however, i was just watching your tv show hangar 1: the ufo files and it reminded me of the incident and i decided to report it. if i get any further sightings out here in mid missouri i will make sure to report them as well.","distance":"Over One

down the intracoastal waterway. we discussed the orange orbs i had reported to mufon a few weeks ago, so naturally our eyes were on the sky. the first sighting was about 9pm..I,.My sister, brother in law, wife and daughter all witnessed seeing them. there were the three orange orbs appearing higher in the sky than the last time we saw them...About 60 degrees. this time they were only there for a few seconds...Not long enough for me to get the camera and grab a shot of them. the next time we saw them it was at 10:03 pm. again we all saw them, three orange orbs...Very bright and just a little lower in the sky. this time they stayed for around 5 seconds. again not long enough to snap a photo. we were amazed by seeing them twice. on the way back to the marina i had my daughter keep the camera on the sky. we were all busy talking when she screamed and pointed....We did not get tonsee what she saw. she described it as the same type of orange orb, just one this time. in approximately the same position as the last sighting but with one big difference. she said it appeared as all of the others did but instead of just disappearing as the others did, this one flew straight down very fast but leaving no trail like a tail you would see from a shooting star. no trail as it disappeared behind the trees on the horizon. she was freaking out just as bad as she did two weeks ago when we first saw the orbs. no further incidents on the way back to the marina. i do plan on taking the boat out more often to look for them, as you can see most hall of the island from where we were at

times a day. it was around four o'clock pm . it was a clear day no clouds. i had walked over to a pic nic  table and sat down. my dog is a small dog she is a yorkie. so because i live in the country , i watch for red tail hawks , and owls. that day i was watching some turkey vouchers. they were using the heat raisers to get way up there. there were 4 or 5 very high up. i could watch them with just my eye sight , but at times i would loose them for a few seconds, so i went in the house and got a pair of  binoculars. 7x 50 i think. i went back to the pic nic table and started watching them again. it was at this time that up above the birds that i was watching. that i saw the first one the bird was in the fram of view in the binoculars and up above the bird was a silver round ball , i am just guessing but to me it would be the size of a small cars hood. it moved in any direction it wanted to . it would stop then go again and just hang there in the air. \r\n this got me on my feet and i walked to the east in my yard , i wanted to see it better . like the birds i would loose it for a second and then find it again. i pulled back the field of view to see where it had gone it was at this time i saw them all. at one time i could see 7 of them, all moving in and around each other . some would go out side of where the others where and then come back. at times i could count 9 but i am not sure because when some of them were moving out side the group they were going away from me and i would lose sight of them. silver balls , like the sun was reflecting off them , so i would say that they were metal, or polished metal. there may have had a line around the center of the shape but i am not sure if that is the right way to explain that. it was a thin dark line at the center , and i only saw that on one or two of them , and it was for a very short time , it was when they would move , i would think that i could see this line just as they were starting to move from a hovering stop. to me it seemed like they were playing all most. just getting close to each other and then going away from each other , staying in an area the size of a football field in the air. at this time my phone gave me an alert. and like a light bulb , i thought try to take a pic of them , and so i did . i took two pics of the sky where they are at , i could see them with the naked eye but not in the phone , it was to bright to see the screen on the phone so i placed the phone in zoom and snaped to pics. i am sending them both. you have to zoom the pics to see what i saw . but the photo's do not do what i saw justice. in the photo without the moon in it. in the bottom right corner is the clearest i have . it looks dark in the photo, but i will say what i saw was all silver balls , i don't know why that one looks darker . some just look like silver balls off in the distance . i wish the photos came out better so anyone could look at them and see what i saw. \r\n i have lived in nebraska and saw military things that were not out yet. like the square smoke jet, i saw that jet years before it was out.\r\n  this was not like that. this scared me and got me excited at the same time . i have never seen anything like this that moved so fast so easy. \r\n in fact i would call my self a  non believer in u.F.O 's before this .\r\nnow i can say that i have seen something that i can not
