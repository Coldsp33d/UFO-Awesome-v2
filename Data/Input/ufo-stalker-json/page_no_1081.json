a few miles from town we noticed a white light framed in the rd but 30 to 50 ft above the tallest trees, we new that there was no light or structure there & said what's that helacopter doing there above the rd? then the front white light went off & the back two came on, it was only then when we could see it was a triangle with rounded corners, & was jet black just sitting there in broad daylight. by then we were comeing up on it quick & were kinda freaking out a bit, my buddy almost took a quick left at the church to avoid going under it, but i grabbed the wheel & held it strait, i wanted to see just what this thing was but new it was nothing i could recognize, as we were about to drive under it, it started spinning in place slowly & drifting to the right over the rd we now turned on to go home. i had my window down & jumped on the door frame & sat on the door half in half out, staring up at this black triangle & could not belive my eyes, it made no sound what so ever, i could hear lawn mowers 4 yards away but not this thing right above my head, i felt like i was shot with adrinilen, my heart was pounding & i'm screaming at my buddy & banging on the roof of the car, saying i can't belive were seeing this! it's a real ufo!! i got a great look at it, we seemed to have disturbed it by driving under it somehow but it didn't care, it just started slowly rotating in place & casualy snaking it's way over the houses & back of the cematary, headed northwest & slowly drifted out of site. i had never even herd of a triangular ufo before & it was yrs later that i saw on tv a show called ufo's over i'll, where a bunch of cops were chasing a triangle the size of a football field up around st louis millstad lebanon & shillow. as i watched the date was the same day as our siting only ours was small 9/9/9 i think it linked up with the bigger one later that night. allso the craft i saw, was a dead ringer for the rendelshem bentwatters woodbridge craft, only i couldn't see the top of mine, to me it only looked about 2 ft thick & flat, but i just saw it from the bottom. all i can say is this was not one of ours & if it was we got it from them, there is no doubt in my mind, what so ever, that what i saw that day was not from this earth. one word kept coming to my mind, it's perffact it's perffact. i wish the gov would just come clean already & stop lieing to us, we have the rite to know that we are not alone. but it's quite a big bite to chew, everything i thought i knew, was turned upside down that day,& now i see things very differently & not a day has gone by that i don't think of what & who's really out there.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

air port in eugene and there were no flares launched/dropped. there is no one up @ oakridge air port to do that. eugene air port told me they launched no flares on that date. i would classify this

had a strong urge to go outside so i did and looked at the sky as soon as i did i see this light orb falling from the sky and is hidden by trees after viewing for 5-20mins. i start thinking to myself i'm i really seeing this. i wait to see if i will see it again and sure enough i do heading towards the direction i first noticed it. \r\nwhen i first saw it i thought it was a normal star then seeing as it moved as if it was being controlled i knew it wasnt a star!! it moved slowly from the top of the sky to the bottom then few mins later flew from the bottom of the sky back to the top. during this whole time i was some what frozen.  i wasnt scared at all but i had an overwhelming feeling that i'm no bigger then an ant. i lost sight of this orb as it flew past the stars....This is not the first time ive seen these things. ive seen them at least 6times all in my neighborhood over the past year or so. ive seen 3-4 of them hanging in the sky then just vanish then appear then take off at a high rate of speed. ive seen them just slowly flying across the sky multiple occasions. i tried telling friends family etc. no one cares. it doesnt matter how many times i see them i still get the same frozen feeling and feeling very small. after it flew away i sat on the ground outside my room and just sat there for 30mins. these orbs are up there and there watching!!!!!","distance":"101-500
