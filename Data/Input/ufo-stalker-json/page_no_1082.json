kept getting the feeling to open my eyes as i sat in a little phone booth sized alcove next to the dc drive panel. when i opened them this red alien head peaked out from the corner of the panel at me. i was unafraid because i have seen things far more incredible than this. i said ok, lets see what happens next. next he side stepped out in front of me in full view kinda with a lilting step quite humorous i thought. i looked at him and said \" if you can show up like this here then you already know who i am, what im doing in here, and what i stand for\"  then i found myself standing up close enough to shake hands with him and i told him before you leave id like to ask you for a favor. i dont know if this can be done or should be done but if you could do something to throw a wet blanket on the ridicule i recieve here id appreciate it. with that he dissappeared. \r\n the very next night i went back into that room hoping to see him again because after such experiences like this you think of other things you'd like to ask of them. i got an instant feeling to go outside. so i did and there sat my number one ridiculer eric arniel. i grabbed a chair setting there and went over to him and said hi eric and he said hello whats up? as i sat down i said eric you'd better strap your seat belt on because something incredible is about to happen, (as i said this im asking myself huh? it is? why are you saying this) eric then said \" what? like some of your alien bullshit?\" i said to eric,\" can you see that red star?\" as i pointed to it, and eric leaned over and said \" yea\" and that was the last thing eric said for about ten minutes because that red star immediately began coming straight for us and as it came it changed its colors from red thru every color of the rainbow in order, until it was about 30 feet to 40 feet above us brilliant white, i looked at eric and his jaw was hanging open. then after hovering there for a few minutes it went backwards once again going thru the colors of the rainbow in order until it hit green then it went out like someone had flipped a switch and it was gone. the night sky was perfectly clear. \r\n eric never again ridiculed me and eric got to see things very incredible that i did because of my meditation practices and seeking of the truth.

but a large one, it was slowly moving south east . it looked very strange and different then anything normal  so i yelled to my wife who looked out the window and saw it and ran back to get my binoculars . as she was gone it was about to go over the mountain beside our home but !!!!! it was not that high up even though it looked high and far it was closer and lower then i first thought because it was over the trees but on my side of the mountain and it was about half way up the mountain as my wife came back it was starting to vanish in the tree line then vanished behind the trees . my wife came out and was a bit freaked out and we talked about it and figured it must have been a large chinese balloon ( not sure what they are called )and it ran out of heat and crashed into the trees,at which  my wife reentered the house and i went to finish mowing the grass by our pool  all of the sudden my wife comes running out and is waving her arms trying to get my attention ! well it ascended again from behind the trees and continued se again we watched it for a very short time then it blinked out, it just vanished . a few seconds later it reappeared but much further se then it was before, it now seemed to be moving to the left and right slowly  all of the sudden moving nw back towards our home and once again  blinked out,  reappeared once again closer towards our home but a bit n this time and as we watched it, it seemed to vanish but with a sort of  streak as if it moved away at such high speed it left a trail of lite behind it, again  heading se  we got a  bit of video of it ,that  my wife took !!  i can say it was no more then 120 yards away at the closest point and it was weird because it looked further away then it was colors changing slightly on it but i could not make out the structure behind the lights .All that i could say was that it looked square or rectangular with a redish glow  it was silent and fluid in its movement, and it lowered itself behind trees and was there for a few minutes , its unknown to me whether it touched ground or not.  the video is on an i phone and will have to be sent to an email  ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

raymond area down 102 through chester heading towards derry. i saw it above the road close to the big tower with the red light on it. it was dusk and i could see this object pretty clearly.  it looked like a series of over grown ping pong balls that were the size of a tennis ball.  they were strung together via a link of rods and looked similar to an over grown version of a model that a chemist would make. they looked like all one piece. they had a faint glow. the reason it struck my curiosity was because instead of just falling from the sky, it was just floating down gently as if catching a breeze.  there were other cars in front and back of me that most likely saw it too.  i kind of blew it off because i thought that maybe it was a weather testing thing that the state or federal govt. was using.  later that night (some time between 12am and 2 am) i drove by the same area where the object was floating down towards and i saw an unusually bright pulsing light.  i don't know if it was related but i travel that road often and have never seen it before in my over 20 years of traveling that route.  the light was so bright that it lit up the street like day time.  i was afraid to drive up the side road to see what it was.  i continued down 102 and spoke to the police officer who was on duty that night, he was sitting in his cruiser near chester center.  i told him of it and he seemed very disinterested.  he stated that there is always a light near that tower.  actually, he was right...It is a small red light, but this was a giant white pulsating light.  i don't think he investigated it.  i am not sure.  a few days later i was driving route 102 again.  i decided to cut thru the side road to the tower and see if i could see anything.  i was across from the field where the incident occurred and saw a neighbor  out in the yard.  i told him of the situation and he stated he didn't see any big light.","distance":"21-100

when i noticed a stationary star like object descend at incredible speeds to who knows where. with the speed this object had descended, i had no doubt in my mind it was et in nature. i was not at first amazed since i had seen 5 different types of ariel phenomena prior to the incident. it was then that we all saw a star like object just appear out of thin air, yes thin air, and begin a straight flight path. we quickly noticed that the object did not have any blinkers or distinctive man made traits to it whatsoever. the object then started to change densities and momentarily vanished, only to reappear again further from where originally spotted. the reason i know it had changed densities is because when it disappeared, i was still able to see it clearly through my 3rd eye even though my friends had believed to loose sight of it.(no this is no joke, i have been training myself to see higher frequency like anomalies for the past couple of years). we would then see this object appear and disappear, flying in a straight path, and began to notice more star like objects fill up the sky.At first the emotion i felt was, instinctively fear. but when i stopped allowing myself to fear what i did not know, i immediately felt a warm feeling of love entering my body.  from the time period of 1-4 am (eastern time) we had seen about 4-5 different aerial phenomena occurring. it was only when night had ended and day was starting that we did not see any more star like objects in the sky. this has just been one encounter witnessed by my friends and i, and can assure much more to come

object in the low northeastern sky.  it was dark amber or red in color.  i thought it was mars at first because it's been very noticeable in the sky lately.  but i realized it wasn't quite in the right spot to be mars, and this object seemed to be close.  then this orb started dropping multiple slightly smaller orbs.  it was dropping them continuously for what seemed like a minute or two?  they were the same color.  they were dropping straight down as if falling to the ground, but i can't tell if they actually landed because they were too far in the distance.  as they fell lower, they got dimmer.  one car was driving down my street and i started pointing up at the sky, but i don't think the person noticed me.  the main orb stopped dropping the smaller orbs, and it slowly got dimmer and smaller till i could barely see it at all.  it moved upwards.  then it's light came back and dropped a few more smaller orbs that did exactly the same as before.  then the main orb got dim again, and it appeared to be moving away in distance slowly getting more dim until i could no longer see it.

i cam downstairs and the dog was panting really really hard and confused. my mom had said the dog was just laying there unresponsive with her tounge out and she was calling the dogs name but she wasnt doing anything. when she pants that means she has to use the bathroom. im not sure if this part had any connection at all. she said she never saw the dog like this before and it scared her that she was having some sort of stroke or something.\r\n\r\ni took the dog out in my backyard, i am in the middle of the city in cleveland ohio. it was about 1220am midnight. we just cut down a giant tree in our backyard 2 days ago so i have a great view of the sky. everyday i take my dog out i often record or look at the stars. as my dog was sniffing around i looked in the sky and saw a beam of light\r\n\r\nfor a split second i thought bottle rocket but this was huge and made no noise. it glowed from nothing to glowing up so bright that you could see either fog or the clouds around it. i also thought maybe shooting star but it was going fast. it was not falling either it shot like a laser beam. i also thought of dragonfly right away by the way it moved, but it went straight it didnt flutter. the back end of it seemed like tiny wings like a dragon fly that was reverse but the wings werent very big. it appeared and glowed like a firework almost and then immediately the glow went out and it dissapeared but was huge. it was like a long rectangle similar to the kind in the game tetris except this was just glowing. i could not see any sort of detail like any sort of windows it was just a long glowing perfect long rectangle and it was very fast 2 to 3 seconds it appeared and dissapeared like the speed of light. matter of fact the way a lightning bolt appears and dissapears would be a similar explanation but this was a perfect object and alot faster.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:04","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings,

in the wildwoods. we had gotten home after work and were hanging out in the campground's open field at about 1:00 am. i was the first to see the objects flying patterns in the sky and after watching them for a brief time i asked my wife to describe what she saw and was certain that she was seeing the exact happenings that i was. hundreds of starlike objects in one formation flew intricate military like flight patterns from horizon to horizon, they flew in perfect synchronization changing direction and speed. after a few minutes of us both describing to each other what we were watching the objects separated into multiple groups and flew different patterns in quadrants each group was still in perfect synch with their group. then they reunited into one formation and zoomed away beyond our visibility. at first i thought it could be a laser light show since it was the jersey shore 4th of july week. but after realizing how clear the sky was and the intricacy of the maneuvers they flew we knew that what were witnessing was awesomely beyond anything we had ever seen and would be impossible for the technology of 1975.
