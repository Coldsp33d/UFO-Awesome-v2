i think i'm seeing a ufo! wow!\" right when i said this, it brightened to white, and as if it had heard me, the white light seemed to roll around and point directly down at me, like a spotlight, becoming intensely bright for about one second. then, it returned to the still bright, but dimmer white, then back to the blue it started as, continuing in the northerly direction.  all this while, i am narrating what i was seeing to my caller, starting to tell him i was going out to my driveway to catch it coming from behind the treetop it had just went behind, when my phone startled me by going beep! beep! beep! beep! and died! i nearly fell over things trying to keep focused on the expected trajectory of the object as i went to my driveway, but the object seemed to have disappeared. i stood and searched the sky carefully, but it was not where it should have been, nor was it anywhere to be seen. i went inside to put my phone on the charger and to call back my friend on my cellphone, when my dead phone rang!  it was my friend commenting that we had gotten disconnected.  i checked the battery level on the cordless, which had moments before read deader than a doorknob, to find that it was now showing a perfectly good charge. previous experience said this should not be. i have no explanation for why it died during this sighting, and magically revived without recharging. also, i have a comparison for what i saw- it was very similar to footage i had seen of ufo's at gilliland ranch.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":56165,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":47.74888933917404,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05112014-0013","longitude":-122.28428468862809,"occurred":1399783500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1399858858000,"summary":"Blue sattelite-like object suddenly flashes brilliant white for 1 sec then back to blue","tags":["flash"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"98125","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Seattle, Washington","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:164766"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Okanagan centre ","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Daytime 4:30 pm approx.  stepped out of backdoor of house,it was a nice day to be outside, enjoying the view looking upward to east hillside ,sky,it was holding in the air not to high up over the horse pastures. quickly into house,called other person to come look at this' 'we're both outside looking at sort of dull color burnt-umber~metal? first thought from me was ,thought it was the basket of a hot-balloon 'without the hot-air balloon top,it looked squarish at higher alt. though as it descended lower the shape obvious not square was rectangular with curved-sides with one window. curved window slight angle . it was in east sunny light from west, descent continued 'not to ground  .Object (not like a hover motion) holding very steady in air of sky, it turned slightly yet holding in sky' one could look into window into the interior of object ,no sun glint on window absolutely ,no reflected light on window at this moment , two beings are in the interior ,they did not seem to know  two humans were looking , as the object [pod~ pop can shaped~ ] sightly turned ,one of the grays looked our way, the grays arm motioned with movement to the other gray, the other gray briefly glanced our way .  i said to other person \"they're looking at us\" ,quickly got into house ,for camera ,for  as the gray motioned it's arm to the other  gray,the vessel-pod-object-yes ufo ', was ascending  very steadily upward to higher alt. where it started to change . not physically but energy field ~ first whitish , then 3 horizontal color bands. all within pinch of time ,transitional phase ~?Perhaps vessel has to get higher up ,air density or air temp colder~ . away 3 bands of color and invisible to human eye .   the fiji 5x  did catch something ,looks roundish ,small for it is high up in sky .   some one helped put it on dvd ,still trying to figure out this computer.  the other person it is up to them ,person did briefly talk about the shape/forms =under part - base of object .  grey plane  june6 2010 not regular for the airport pre noon approx.  radar  if radar detects hot air ballons or just the basket part of hot air balloon, then it is possible.  ps. i had my disclosure' having eyes looking back at one another ,from another species ,it is rough ,prefer the well known species .

pack things up and noticed an very bright red/orange light hovering high above us near a the top of a hill by us. we started talking and came to the conclusion it was mars. then i started to noticed it was moving almost swaying like a helicopter would if it was flying still. one of my friends also noticed the weird movement. at one point it almost seemed like it split into two then went back to one large light. we were very spooked because we were in the middle of nowhere and had no cellphone reception. the object would sit still for a while then i would notice it sway and move from right to left and then back into place. there was a lot of us going back in forth with each other about what it was. me and one friend thought it was a ufo the other fiend was not convinced it was anything. as we started to leave i noticed a bunch of bi antennas to our right. i later google mapped what they were and discovered it was a company called teleport la and called them asking what they did. the man over the phone explained they receive transmissions from satellites and transfer the transmission to radio/tv/etc. seeing these huge antennas started to freak me out so i loaded a clip for my rifle just in case something was about to happen. as i finished and we got into the car to leave. my cellphone died. we drove off as fast as we could down a small dark dirt road before we even got 200 feet away my friend in the back seat yelled \" dude it's gone \". i thought he was lying so i stopped and we all got out to check. the bright light was gone.  we sped off and got out of there as fast as we could. when we got on the road i saw march air force base was right off the freeway. very odd. also when i turned my phone back on the time said 4:30pm this was at 7:33 at night and i know my phone had the correct time before it shut off. this was a very cool experience in my opinion and really hope to experience it again. regardless if it was a drone or military aircraft we still did see a ufo.

a plane or sattalite it never dropped below the horizon instead it stayed a course straight into space judging by the angle it approached and left. i followed it for the entire duration and then some. as it left away from me it went from white to a dim glowing orange at its rear once it left sight about 20 seconds later there was two flashed of lights like lightning seen from a great distance within a minute there were two rumbles of thunder in sequence with the lightning flashes. my theory is they used the explosions to ride the shock waves in space. i am a person of reason i never

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At about 2206 est, i was standing on the second floor deck on the back of my town home watching the stars when i spotted a large, pulsating multi-colored light to the west-south west, about 245 to 250 degrees by compass. from my vantage point, the light was stationary and appeared to be hovering just above tree-top level, west of i-270 toward point of rocks and harper's ferry. the light itself was about three or four times larger than a star, but smaller than the moon, and was circular or orb shaped; it was flashing what appeared to be red, blue, white and green-colored lights. i was likely too far distant to hear any sounds from the craft, even if it was emitting them. though i realized some of the flashing colors are similar to aircraft navigation lights, the strange, rapid, pulsating quality of the lights, combined with the apparent low altitude and size of the object led me to signal a nearby neighbor, who was fiddling on his phone below me on the street. we are not unaccustomed to state police helicopter landings and searches in our area; i also figured the light might be some firework or perhaps a transformer exploding. \r\nwhile trying to direct my neighbor around the corner of his town house block, so that he could observe what i was seeing, i tried turning on my camera, which i luckily still had in my back pocket. as i struggled to guide my neighbor to a good vantage point, since his ground-level view was still obstructed by some houses across the street, i finally was able to get my camera to turn on. i snapped a few photos, most of which didn't turn out well, and then captured a brief, albeit extremely shaky video on my phone(the craft did not move, only my hands.) throughout this period, the object seemed to remain stationary, hovering and flashing. after taking these photos, i continued to work on my neighbor who was still in the wrong position. as he finally began moving in the right direction to get a clear view of the object, the pulsating from the light faded and by the time my neighbor saw it, it had 'shrunk' down to a single white light. as it did, it began moving southward, parallel to i-270, it appeared, just above tree level. i subsequently ran down to street level, since my view was now blocked, joining my neighbor at the corner to watch the craft as it cruised off the south. \r\nafter it disappeared from our view, we were joined shortly thereafter by  two other neighbors, who were disturbed by my shouting. another small white light flying the same flight path (north to south parallel to i-270), flew along the tops of the some distant trees at about the same speed as the other craft. there was no flashing, pulsating or abnormal size with this light, however, it seemed to be a regular aircraft.\r\ni submitted a foia report to the faa, asking for radar data from the area at around that time. it may very well have been a plane or helicopter whose lights were distorted by the weather. i've seen a lot of aircraft, though nothing quite like that.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

barely recall it sufficiently to what happened, but my little brother and i saw three unidentified flying objects (ufo) flying across the sky! disk shaped and slightly orange they slighted wobbled around as they moved across the sky. immediately i gasped in surprise, my brother and i stood straight up. \r\nover the next few days, i could not let it go. i had seen ufos, i was sure of it! therefore later i researched similar sightings. loads of people have seen what i had seen. on the web there were many pictures similar to what i had seen. this amazed me, making me surer that what i had seen was real. \r\n\r\nrecap: they moved/ wobbled across the sky, slightly orange, bigger then the stars, lost sight as for they disappeared after about 15 seconds, and they were very

we make trips like this every once in a while. while we were walking around we saw something on the horizon maybe 4.5 to 5.5 miles off of the shore. it was at about 1000 ft when i first saw it, i thought it was an airplane heading towards us- hence the left side being lighted green and the right side being lighted red with a white light on top of it. suddenly it took off up to somewhere around 7-8000 feet. it hovered there for a few seconds then it slowly lowered down to sea level and appeared to disappear. it appeared as though it entered the water, i thought about the other possibility being that it quickly flew over the horizon away from us but i find that much less likely. the object obviously appeared to be bending light around it and had a vibrating like appearance to it making it appear fuzzy. it made a very distinctive noise however not engine noise that you would expect from a manmade object- it was the sound of the air moving around the object almost like the sound of a large plane gliding without engines, i fly large rc airplanes that are electric and the sound that they make when they glide very fast is smiler to the sound that this object was giving off. the object was very easy to see and clearly identifiable if one were to look in the right direction. i told my friend natalie who was holding my ipad to record it. it was very easy to see in person, but on the video playback it is very hard to make out. i honestly feel as though it used some kind of technology that made it hard to record or see during playback. im a pilot and strange airplanes, fighter jets, flares, chaff and all of those things i am accustomed to seeing, however this was nothing like anything i've seen before as far as its behavior goes. if you would like, call me if you want the video, you can barely make out an object that is a bluish color and it appears to be faintly flashing. the video would need to be optimize if you'd want actual footage of the object it was recorded on an ipad. when the ipad tries to look up a little bit, that is when the objects ascends upward, don't mistake the light posts for it.","distance":"Over One

from what was then beaver college in glenside. i noticed the object because it was dark out and i was looking out the window and it had lights. i thought- that's no airplane. \r\nthe object was very clear. it was well below the cloud cover, it had a top that was sort of a disk with a bottom attached like a \"cup on a saucer\" up side down. the bottom part was revolving slowly around, and had a row of medium sized lights on it that were revolving around. the lights were sort of amber in color, the whole object lit up a bit by them to a pale gold or copper color. the object proceeded in a straight path very slowly over a large shopping mall. it may have stopped and hovered, but i don't remember for sure. \r\ni felt certain i was looking at a ufo. i was excited and awed. i spoke to my friends on the bus about it, and they all looked and saw it, commenting how strange it was, then resumed socializing with each other. one or two other kids i didn't know well continued to watch it

light gray cloud cover. it was shaped like a snake and was segmented proportionally. it's head was shaped like marvin the martians craft (only description ii could think of). it's movement was that of a snake but in the sky. after it had left my sight i heard a sound far to the west that chilled me to the bone. it sounded like the jake brake of a semi truck but way louder and slower, getting lower in tone until i could only feel it. after this i looked above my neighbors house and saw 2 clouds hovering there (they seemed a distance of 50-75 feet at first) the one on the left was shaped like a generic dinosaur skeleton but with a singular horn on its head, and it was staring into the face of an alien shaped cloud that was staring right back. after i had started at them for a minute or so the alien shaped one started coming straight at me (this was when i realized the clouds were only 25 feet or so away)  i ran straight back into my garage and the cloud was maybe 7 feet away in my neighbors yard.  at first the clouds were carved as if someone had gone up there and had done it by hand.  seeingthe craftsmanship of it gave me goosebumps (expecially the prehistoric skeleton looking one how i could see through the spots where there was no bone). when the alien shaped cloud descended it got way smaller and lost its shape. after i had layed in bed i kept hearing movement in my house (too much to be the cats) and got strange sensations in random parts of my body. i have felt very paranoid since the incident.

from our hot tub and watch planes, satellites, the iss, shooting starts, etc.  \r\ntonight my wife was looking out window at neighbors��� house (checking security as they were away). called me to the window as she noticed a bright object toward (but above) the horizon that ���looked weird���.  \r\ni saw the object and it was the only light object in the sky.  bright.  no stars or clouds visible (dusk).  very apparent twinkling effect that did not match anything we have ever observed.  \r\ngot a pair of binoculars. we turned out the house lights and stood in an open doorway for an unobstructed view.  the object was obviously hovering.  to us it was positioned adjacent to the edge of a branch on a pine tree and never moved from that position.\r\nit had varying light colors showing.  the effect to both of us was that lights were rotating around the object yet appeared somewhat random in the color effect.  it displayed a strobe-like flash but of a much longer flash duration than strobes seen on an aircraft.  this is what gave it the twinkling effect (at a distance).  it was not similar to a strobe light bar because the flash duration was too long.\r\nthe lights tended to prevent us seeing any other portion of the craft but there appeared to be a shape above the lights, but not much larger than the circumference of the lights.\r\nthe impression i got was that it could have been a helicopter hovering and someone trying to make it look like a ufo by using some very bright and unique lighting technology.\r\nduration was about 15 minutes.  as time went on it did get dimmer to the point that it was not longer visible.  as the object itself started to fade out the stars were beginning to be seen.  \r\nimportant to note that it never moved.  even if it was going straight away from us we would have been able to tell over that 20 minute period.  it just stayed in the same spot almost touching that same tree branch.  if you have one more person who could position it just as exactly you could probably triangulate the approximate position and altitude.\r\nfrom our position we often see the medical helicopter from the nearby hospital as it takes off and flies towards the valley (phoenix metro area).  we usually lose sight of it as it drops towards the horizon and below the mountains, thus blocking our view.\r\ndistance.  if it were to be the same size as the medical helicopters we watch than i would estimate the distance as 3 miles.  i had the impression that the distance was much further and that the craft was much larger than a medical helicopter.  distance as much as 20-45 miles.  if it were 45 miles it would be visible to residents of fountain hills and people at saguaro lake.  if so, then you will have other reporting the vent.\r\ni started writing this at about 2010 while my wife gave me updated reports.  i listed to the radio scanner and it was quiet with no activity.\r\ni would like to note that i have flown as a passenger in small fixed and rotary wing aircraft at night so i am also somewhat familiar with time/distance traveled as well as how aircraft appear at night, and at what distance they can be seen from.\r\ngood luck, hope this helps.\r\n\r\nif you want to contact please make the initial one by email.  tnx!\r\n","distance":"Over One

black object emerging from the mountains between the foothills and the peaks.I first thought it was a helicopter but as the object grew larger i then thought it was an airplane. after about 1 minute i noticed the object was ascending straight up very fast then i noticed a small orb around the object when it began to go up the orb reflected downward and when the object flew downward as if falling out of the sky the orb would shift upward like something was propelling it or some sort of propulsion system. i felt as if my eyes were playing tricks on me or i was going crazy. i changed angles to verify it was not something on the window like a bug. after 10 minutes i verified it could not be a bird because of the straight up and straight down movement and maneuvers it was making. also because of the speed at which it was moving. determining the distance of the object and how quickly it came from behind the foothills. i told myself to grab my camera phone which is a 21 megapixel samsung galaxy 5 and zoomed as far as possible to focus on the object. at that time it began hovering as if it were not moving in thin air but sitting there. then it ascended at a point where it was over the mountain peak line within seconds. after the first video i took. i went to see if i could get a witness at work to verify what i was seeing. when i returned the object was over the treetops just floating. i also noticed the object flickering or pulsating. as i withdrew my camera phone to take more footage the object shot directly left (south) within the blink of a second. that's when i knew that this was not anything normal. you can see in the 2nd video that the object is far more south of its previous location and once again. elevating quickly and dropping quickly. i am on the 8th floor and the object was much larger then it appears on the camera maybe it was further then i thought or maybe the camera thru the window wasn't as effective. the object seems to be a black dot in the video but from eye sight it was as large as a penny at several miles away. after the 2nd video i watched for about 2-5 more minutes before the object lowered just above the treetops then shot upward disappearing. my memory was full at the time so i was unable to continue taping the object. i look out this window towards the mountains 5 days a week for the past 2 years and have never seen anything like it. about 15 minutes after the object disappeared a black helicopter went by the area in front of the mountains and headed north. several minutes later another went by in the same direction and flight path. they were nowhere near as fast as the object. i also saw a green (possibly news helicopter) fly by a few more minutes after the large black helicopters.","distance":"Over One

3, maybe 4yrs old either shortly before or after my parents divorced and my father left so maybe, possibly i am delusional or crazy, i don't know. we lived in massilon, oh in projects on the corner of stuhldrier & wales rd in or right around 1978-1980. i have had multiple \"strange, odd or different experiences a lot throughout my life which a lot i'm unable to explain or describe. my life has been from that point on & after very different which i simply just attributed or attribute as i got older to my father leaving or something and never spoke much if anything at all about it to anyone or at least a very few select people and i don't & can't remember who they'd be today. that 1st experience i remember is still very clear but somewhat faded. i watched it move or fly from the south > north, no memory of speed it was moving. it just came very fast from the n simply stopped over an apt building, house,  neighborhood, i don't know where. that said, please review my \"short description\". what made me first notice, never forget nor forgotten was the instant stopping and hovering over ???, than i remember my mom calling for me and i remember being sort of mesmerized and nothing after that moment besides the memory of wondering what the hell i seen.....My whole life. along with everything (info) that has been exploited in the recent years since, and since my accident & brush with death in '01, experiences throughout my life, some small (little significance)as well as or along with some bigger ones (profound, some very profound) slowly & a little at a time brought me to a conclusion that i saw something unknown to the majority of people & i feel determined and obligated to people to see and/or know /understand what is & has been going on for a very very long time. most think i'm crazy or something which i completely understand 110% but why people can't or don't see what is and has been happening is literally & seriously making me feel like i might lose control or my composure or something maybe. please believe & understand me (or not) i am very sure of what i've seen, know & stated but extremely confused yet i know something very few in this entire world could even begin to wrap their mind around, i know  critical & crucial information or secrets that have been deliberately suppressed or withheld from the mass population yet it's in our face everyday (i feel anyway). if i get a response i only hope that you are a very understanding, patient, compassionate, etc type of \"real\" person, if not i guess i am about to live \"v the final battle\" scenario which i never seen btw but have an understanding of what it's about. i have seen \"things\" with friends that seen with me (we followed with a telescope), a few years back as well as a couple others that have been completely diluted and/or plain ignorant & they didn't, couldn't or wouldn't allow themselves to see or believe what i was trying to show them & kept finding \"logical\" explanations. i need to know some truth, i know i'm not crazy! believe, listen, help me or not, i sort of don't care anymore but i have to figure this out and keep anyone and/or everyone i can safe by knowing the truth.\r\nbryan             ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path then
