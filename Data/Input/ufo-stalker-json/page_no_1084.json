(i have seen the crescent face in both directions - west and south). when i first saw it, i really thought it was the moon shining through my window- remember this was late at night. however, it was shining so brightly like our sun does on a very sunny day, it got my attention very quickly. below it in a secondary position, much lower in elevation and at a different angle, was a huge bright shining orange circle. i saw the orange circle through my neighbor's fence in my backyard. i had my husband go outside on our back deck to see this bright orange appearing circle, also.  as i tried to get a photo of it, it would not allow me to capture it's bright orange color. it actually came out white, every time; i couldn't get it to appear like i was seeing it. the bright circle was huge and very very bright orange in color.\r\n\r\nbecause of the photos i have taken,  especially in recent months, i have come to the opinion,  these orbs are taking pictures of many things such as buildings, airports and yes, even vehicles. i have the pictures to prove it. in my photo submission i have included several for mufon to view and access. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

south. i always look up at the stars , moon, etc. for anomalies. it was clear, about 65 degrees, and the moon was a bright half moon. i am always looking at the night sky in hopes of observing a ufo. i never seen one in my life. i am a ufo buff. \r\n\r\n    i happened to be looking straight ahead to take a drag of my cigarette. i was very calm and peaceful. i was relaxed and not thinking of ufo's. all of a sudden, out of the corner of my right eye, a bright light seem to catch my attention. i looked right and there was the moon, but directly in it's sight path there was 2 basketball sized objects that were yellow, orange. the objects were not behind the moon, they were on my side of the moon. they were moving east headed almost over my house. they were about 10 inches apart from where i was sitting in my distance. they were following the same direction, but different paths. they were one in front and one behind, above and one below. \r\n\r\n    the very first thing i did was jump out of my chair to get my girlfriend robin, who just went to bed. i realized i better check again to see if i really seen this, as it was \"unbelievable\". i turned and stopped moving, i looked up and i was witnessing something i never thought i would see. those lights moving like a air vehicle. there appeared to be more going on about them. it was very busy in the area they were in. i estimated their speed to see if i had enough time to get robin. she was about 20 feet away in bed. first i thought don't go. then i thought i want someone else to see it to prove what i'm seeing. what made me leave was thinking robin may never see this in her life, so i went to get her. i screamed get up and come out. i ran back quick and they were gone. it was only seconds. she was on the porch looking while i ran off to check the sky over the house from the driveway. gone. i made a mistake, but i wanted to share it.\r\n\r\n    my opinion is they suddenly appear in the moon area of the sky, as i had just looked away from that direction, then they appeared suddenly. all i know is i'm still excited and intend on watching every night for a couple hours. i believe they are there, one must be vigilant to see them. \r\n\r\n    there seemed to be an odd thing about it. when you see a plane go by, you can feel how it is \"working\" to travel like that. these things, seem to move like they were floating. they were moving fast, but like floating in the air..","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

after watching a movie, i stepped outside of my house and walked west toward my garden.  i have a nightly chore that i was tending to.  that was the hand-rotating of my solar panels to face the morning easterly sun-rise.  there is a fixed mercury-arc lamp on a telephone pole near where my solar system sits on a trailer.  i rotated one bank or panels, and as i'm apt to do, i glanced up at the sky.  my house sits in the middle of a seven-acre pasture in the middle of a 300 acre farm.  when i looked up, i was immediately stunned to see a large, round (from my perspective) object directly over my head.  it was emanating bright blue/white lights outward around its outer edge, and had red lights interspersed unevenly between the bright blue-while lights.  the object was slowly rotating, and almost immediately began moving slowly (about as fast as i can run) westwardly over my garden, and the tree-line beyond.  there are two tree-lines... the first is wild-hardwood (oak, cedar, etc.)  40 feet beyond that a cultivated pine thicket with pine trees (lob-lolly) that are nearly adult (tall).  it wasn't until the object had moved over the second tree-line that i realized i should try to video, or snap a picture of what i was seeing.  i ran as fast as i could into the house, grabbed my iphone, ran back outside to my previous location, and could still see the object moving slowly away.  the lights were so bright that it made a glow beneath it moving over the pine thicket.  by the time i \"logged\" into my iphone, and launched the camera app, the object had moved beyond my line of sight, and i no longer could perceive the \"glow.\"  as it moved away from overhead... to the west, i did see that it had a curvature on top (a dome if you will).  the surface appeared dark, but again had these stunningly crisp and clear, bright lights around the edge.  at times the lights (red and bluish-white) seemed to cross over each other around the edge.  sort of \"dancing\" around the edge of the circular/domed object.  this light dance appeared to be independent of the crafts slow rotation.  again, not a single sound could be heard, which surprised me.  in fact, it seemed like there was not even the normal \"natural\" frog/cricket/bird cacophony that i'm used to hearing constantly.  i never felt scared or threatened at anytime during this encounter.  in fact the only unusual \"feeling\" i had was a heightened sense of awareness.  i was truly shocked, breathless, amazed and in a way hypnotically fixated on the object when i first saw it.  i have seen things i could not explain before (meteor-like objects that make 90 degree turns... glowing orbs around fredericksburg, tx near enchanted rock... and a few other things)... but i have always felt that i didn't know what i had seen after the fact.  this is different.  i'm sure i saw a craft that is nothing like any technology that i'm aware of from my understanding of physics and current human technology.  the impressions that overwhelmingly remain with me regarding what i saw last night are: 1).  absolute silence, 2). super crisp/clear/bright lights that strangely emanated from around the edge of the circular (bottom-up perspective) craft... and that the lights didn't appear to be coming from fixed points on the edge of the craft, 3). the object rotated slowly, and moved slowly away... without sound, 4). i believe the object was relatively close 300-600 feet over-head at the beginning of the encounter, then perhaps 1000 yards or less when it vanished from my view.  i truly wish i had been able to capture some proof of what i saw, to share.  but i must say... this changes my view of reality.  i am sure, as a human can be, that what i saw was not a human-created object.  please feel free to contact me if you have further questions.  i tried to be as detailed in my above account, while being cautious not to misrepresent what i saw.  sincerely, d.P.","distance":"101-500

when i noticed an orb of light in the sky that suddenly flew up on us with incredible speed. as i kept driving we noticed the orb was actually following us so we stopped in the middle of the road to check it out. the orb was moving across the sky and when i stopped my vehicle the orb also stopped and hovered in place, then i hit the gas a little bit and when i did the ufo also began to move and then i came to a stop again, and so did this orb of light.  me and my girlfriend were both freaking out by this point because we know there is no way for an airplane to just stop in place and hover, and this thing was following us. this craft also had no sound to it.  so anyway my girlfriend was freaking out begging me to take her home and at this point i was a little freaked out so i turned my car around and started heading home and as soon as i did i could see the object in my side mirror it suddenly turned into three balls of light (bright white) all side by side ( i believe on the same craft) and it flew up on us again, me and my girlfriend both started to freak out but i decided to turn the car around to get a better look. when i turned around the craft stopped coming towards us and hovered in place and was now again one ball of light. i drove towards it and it began to move away from us. i again stopped in the road and the orb also stopped. i told my girlfriend \"it is following us watch when i stop it will stop.\" i stopped the vehicle and the orb also stopped and hovered there. i said \"now when i hit the gas it is also going to accelerate.\" so i hit the gas hard and got to about 30 mph. this orb immediately matched our speed as soon as i hit the gas. i said, \"watch it is going to stop when we do.\" i slammed on the brakes hard and came to a dead stop. so did the orb. my girlfriend absolutely lost it then and was almost crying. my girlfriend begged me to take her home and so we left. she was scared and i didn't want anything to happen to us so i drove us home. the object followed us the whole way and seemed to dissapear once we got in my drive way. we both were freaking out. i was absolutely fascinated by the fact we could have just made contact with aliens or some kind of super advanced technology. while this was happening i pulled out my iphone and tryed to record a video. even though the object was pretty close, my camera made it look as if it was miles away. shitty ass iphone.. i was pissed, i filmed for a few seconds and turned my phone off realizing i couldn't get a clear enough video. i have attached my video below, you can see the orb of light blinking in the sky but that's all you can see. i went out and purchased a 300 camcorder with night mode and 1080p recording so if this happens again i can document the whole thing. this is not a lie or a joke, this really happened and me and my girlfriend are both in shock over what we experienced. this was in noblesville indiana on cherry tree road started at 12:50 and we got home at 1:05. i checked the time because i thought we were going to get abducted and i made my girlfriend and i put our seatbelts on so we couldn't be... this was insane and my mind is blown!  idk what to think about what happened but it has affected me and it's all i can think about since that night. we have not told anyone else about this because we know we will just be called crazy. that's why i'm reporting it here, i'm also hoping there was someone else who witnessed this and reports it also.

getting ready to move we backed out of my driveway and headed northwest about a half mile i saw something shinning up in the sky as i looked on i said to him look what is that ?And knowing him as a kind of a skeptic he said it looks to me like an airplane with the sun shinning off of it and then i said its not an airplane because if it was it would be going a lot faster then it is and i added it don't have any wings and is way to low and it looked like it was almost hovering it was going so slow we turned right on state road 81 going about another half mole we turned left on what we call drycreek rd. the name of the road is something else i really cant think of the name of that road rite now but anyway we went on that road for about three more miles and then we turned right on the road that his trailer was it was less then a half mile to where it was at we pulled in the driveway got out and started getting our tools out  i looked up and said to him look man there it is again and i asked him what the hell is that thing he said i don't know i said to him look it dosent have any wings and look how slow it is going we did not hear a sound at all it was so low if it was making any noise we could have heard it we both looked at the thing for about three or four minutes he didn't seem to be very interested in it but i was i kept looking at it it was very shiny metallic craft i know that it was not a blimp a plane or balloon  or nothing like i have ever seen before it just fascinated me i saw what looked like little windows at the top of it and maby like some kind of vents on  and what looked like an antana or something i really couldn't see close enough to know for sure i could see that it had rounded sides well it was shaped like a capsule i wish i would have kept watching it but we had work to do so i take a couple of steps and grab a big floor jack and pulled it over to where i was going to use it. it probably took me less then a minute to do so . and then i looked back up to where i saw the thing at and it was gone i looked everywhere for it in the sky but it was simply gone it was like it just vanished it was just gone it had to have left at a very fast speed i didn't know what it was then and i don't know what it is now it kinda freaked me out ya know its been bothering me because i could not identify it so to me it was a true ufo. i would guess its size at about at least a hundred feet or even longer .I kinda thought that it mite be the government at first but then i felt it was not from this earth i just couldn't believe we saw this thing in browed daylite it was a solid object it did what it did and then it was gone. i think it mite have been following the river or something like that.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:20:28","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,

the steps i noticed what appeared to be a silent convoy of about 9 to 10 ships about 800 to 1000 feet (estimated) passing by overhead, completely silent and in a perfect v formation with one ship in the front. the objects had no lights on but appeared to be a very light brown/gold/copper in color with what seemed to be a reflective glow around each of them. at first i thought they might be birds- but in the short seconds i caught them flying overhead, i noticed one seemed to disappear then reappear, and i also noticed that one or two of them flipped themselves around once in a circle while still staying in the formation. also the crafts appeared very defined- it was difficult to make out a definitive shape, but i was able to make out that they were some kind of vessels with lines indicating either beveled edges or some kind of pattern. i would estimate they were moving at a speed of about 150 miles an hour or more, it's hard to estimate exactly but they were moving extremely fast. i had dropped my laundry to try and follow them and saw that they were heading south towards inglewood/south central. by the time i pulled out my phone to video it, it was too late and the objects were headed over the horizon past my line of sight. a neighbor was outside asking how i was doing and i told him what i had just seen and he laughed as if i was insane. i don't know if it's related, but my phone froze when i got inside and tried to call/message people. about a minute later, a helicopter flew south overhead in the same direction- there was no way it would've been able to catch them though.\r\n\r\nafter, i was in a state of disbelief and a little ticked off at myself that i wasn't able to get more details and make a film of it in time. it happened so fast that the only way anyone else would've seen it was if they happened to look up at just the right time. i feel that the total silence and absence of any noise, along with the reflecting surface and perfect motion i witnessed from the objects indicates it may be something we humans would not be capable of making....","distance":"501 Feet - 1

continueing and i am glad that i have kept a journal since 2007. my mom also syas that the aliens have been coming to me since i was a baby. this information i was not aware of until recently. preceeding these events strange things have begun to happen before the events. lights turning on and off on their own. electrical appliances not working and then working. dog very restless and have even experienced hearing things fall over and not been able to find the source. on the 3/5/2014 i woke when my dog gave one bark and went quiete. i have never heard him bark like that and not carry on. it was thenthat i heard a humming noise out side. i got up and looked out my bedroom window but saw nothing. i then went into the lounge and looked out that window and saw nothing. here is where the problem comes in. i don't remembver going back to bed. i began to dream that i unlocked the security gate and the front door and went into the garden because i suddenly saw a huge glowing butterfly. first it glowed yellow, then luminious green and then luminious blue. it was about the same size as my two hands next to each other. then as i edged towards it it came and landed on my left arm. it made its way up and around the back of my neck. for a minute i grew afraid because i could not see it. then it crawled down my right arm and settled on my right thumb. i watched it attach its two black feelers on its head around my thumb and then it inserted its backside into my hand. i could feel everything and it was the most unpleasant feeling, i could feel the pressure. suddenly it was gone. when i woke the next morning i was shocked to know that i did not remember going back to bed and the worst thing is i actually felt ill where as the night before i had been fine. i had a terrible head ache and the left side of my body, especially around my neck and temple was very sore. i spent the entire day taking pain killers but nothing seemed toi help. the reason why i have posted this is because going back ocver my journal this is not the first time that i have dream't of strange surgical procedures and i have dreamt of the greys before as well. usually the next day after these dreams i wake up feeling sick and detached from the worls. in the 1990's i recall been abducted and i still remember seen the inside of a ufo. the walls were just light and switches and i remember not been able to move. i recall seen a brown claw like hand with only four fingers holding an injection type thing and all i remember is saying no before i blacked out. i have no idea what happened after that. i have finally decided that i now need to get to the bottom of this and would appreciate it if some one could help me find an investigator in durban south africa that i can get in touch with. it is quite obvious that it is still going on and i would like to know why. my daughter who is seven is to frightened to sleep in her own room because she says that a black man with huge black eyes comes to visit her at night and he hurts her. she does not know anything about my experiences and this frightens me.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"02:10:05","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":56125,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-29.8586804,"location":null,"logNumber":"ZA-05092014-0012","longitude":31.0218404,"occurred":1399112280000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"KwaZulu-Natal","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1399638309000,"summary":"Dog

constitutional, which faces west, when i noticed an extremely bright blue orb hovering above the tree tops and houses to the southwest of my position.\r\n\r\nthe orb was between 15 to 20 degrees in elevation from the ground, and was at least 5 to 6 times or more the apparent size of jupiter, or the around size of a pea held at arms length.\r\ni was viewing it above the tops of houses and between two large trees without foliage, which are located on a street directly behind my home. the night was unusually clear and cool, and the crescent moon and jupiter were clearly visible at roughly 40 degrees of elevation. the sun had just set below the horizon 15 to 20 minutes or more before, and there was still a faint orange/purple glow visible from the sunset on the horizon, but stars were also visible along with the crescent moon and jupiter.\r\n\r\nthe orb itself was extremely bright by any lighting standards, and colored an beautiful blue color like the color of an absolutely clear blue sky during daylight hours, only a slightly darker shade.\r\n\r\nwhen i first spotted the orb, it was hovering stationary in the sky. i immediately called my 20 year old daughter to the back door to verify the sighting for me, and also to verify the color of the craft, which she did.\r\nthe craft, which i had no doubt it absolutely was a craft of some type, then flew slowly in a northerly direction for 5 to 10 miles at about a small aircrafts speed, then immediately reversed direction without stopping and backtracked it's own course to arrive at it's exact starting point, stopped, and again hovered. the craft then ascended downward in a zigzag course in less that three seconds, stopped, rose vertically to it's starting point in less that 2 seconds, then stopped and hovered.\r\nall during the crafts hovering and maneuvering, the craft wobbled very slightly, for lack of a better term, even when it was stationary, and it never varied in brightness.\r\ni then ran into my house to retrieve my video camera, which was coincidentally on the floor next to the back door (i had to take it out the battery's needed to be charged for an upcoming trip), and then i ran back out the door, turned on my camera, and started filming. unfortunately, the camera's autofocus was on, and the camera would not focus on the object, so i took my eyes away from the still hovering orb to shut off the autofocus.\r\nby the time i looked back up, a matter of 1 to 2 seconds, the orb had disappeared.\r\n\r\nthere were also other aircraft in the air that night, but they were flying extremely high or distant from my position, and there may have been some other small aircraft or helicopter flying from south to north during that time as well.\r\n\r\nabout 5 minutes later, while i was online at the mufon web site filling out a sighting report, the power supply on my tower computer, which is near my back door, started smoking and smelling bad, and my computer completely died. the power supply's main inductor had completely melted inside the shielded enclosure on the circuit board, without blowing any fuses or tripping my expensive power strips circuit breaker or surge protector. i meticulously maintain my computers, being an electrical technician, and when i took the power supply apart to inspect what had burned out and why, i could find no explanation for the electrical malfunction.\r\n\r\nthe night before (sunday may 4th) i witnessed a large completely red orb with a blue/white strobe at it's tail end fly from south to north on the same flight path that the blue orb had flown, but this one flew further north, and sort of like a helicopter would. it then came to a dead stop, shut off the blue/white strobe light, and ascended straight up into the air so high it disappeared into the starry background. the orb's speed was like watching an elevator go straight up into space.\r\nthis is the second time i have spotted a red colored craft ascend in such a manner in my area, the first time being much closer to my position, but never ever a blue colored orb, especially one so large.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
