the sky.  after about 15 minutes of big dipper locating, i mentioned to wife that it looked like there was a bond fire way down the beach west of us.  as we both looked at it, it appeared to be moving and started coming towards us.  we had our yorkie with us and were letting her run around without a leash so we decided we better put the leash on her because we thought it maybe the coastal police (orange headlight) on patrol.  as it continued towards us, it looked like it was hovering just above the surf, then when it got within a football field it ascended like a chinese lantern and appeared to burn out as it ascended, then we could barely see a skeleton of it as if it were a large ember.\r\n\r\nwe rationalized that it was a chinese sky lantern but couldn't figure how it could hover just off the groung up the beach towards us for a long distance, then ascend?\r\n\r\nafter about 30 minutes, we experienced the first event of the orange orbs that were about 500 feet over the water and about a mile off the coast.  they had the color of a jack o lantern and the approximate size of a pea held at arms link.\r\n\r\nat first only one orb appeared (like someone turned on a light) and hovered for a few seconds, then went out.  couple seconds later, it came on again but about a quarter of a mile left of the area where we saw first one.  then 3 came on all at once together and hovered for about 5 seconds.  after these went out, we noticed what looked like tiny white stars flashing intermittently in a tight group.  we watched the flickering stars fade away and didn't see anything for another 10 minutes.  this time, we saw the grouped white flickering first and said, \"here they come again\"...And sure enough we saw the same orange orbs comenon again and hover for a few seconds multiple times.\r\n\r\nthis happened numerous times over the course of about an hour. the most we saw at one time was 5.\r\n\r\nwe finally decided to go get the cell phone and call 911 to report it about 10:45 pm.  while i was on the phone with the dispatcher, one more appeared and i said, \"look honey, there's another one\"!\r\n\r\nwe sat there for another 45 minutes waiting for the police and never saw another thing, not even the police.

and clear. approx. 75 degrees with no wind. unlimited visibility. as we stood together between some trees i noticed a \"bird\" almost directly overhead. it appeared from overhead a 30\" tree canopy from the e. it moved in various sharp angles to a hover, and then back and forth between sharp angular turns to hover over and over for about 15 seconds. we all watched it. after approx. 15 seconds the \"bird\" moved off back to the e direction over the tree top it appeared from. the \"bird\" resembled the size of a large raven. it was black. it had a segmented body. the body was that of a long tappered elipse with a round head with a long pointed \"beak\". the \"wings\" resembled that of a dragonfly and it moved about like a hummingbird. we discussed what it might have been and i said a hummingbird, because i have seen them before and they darted about like that but knew that they are quite small at close range and this was no bird because of it's size, structure, and movement. i am a skilled observer. as soon as it moved away back to the e over the tree top <and dissapeared>, immediately at the exact same elevation and area of the sky appeared from over the tree top an off white colored object from the e. it looked round at first. it seemed to be at a very high altitude and it moved at constant speed and direction like that of a high altitude commercial jet. there were about 30 degrees of overhead visibility inbetween the trees. i called it out and my son eventualy picked it up just before it disappeared over the treeline to the west. the elipse was slightly egg shaped, the point was at the front. the edges were clealy defined. there were no lights on it or reflections. i checked the weather conditons the next day with the nws and the winds were light about 5 mph

the truck total. object first appeared due east while traveling north from bakersfield, but before fresno. three occupants of the car were panicking so we could not stop to watch, but the object seemed to stay with us. the highway was busy, moving a little slow that night, though traffic never fully stopped. nobody else seemed to pull over, and i don't believe the ufo was to blame for the traffic.\r\n\r\ni was not the first person to spot the ufo. a passenger commented that there was a suspicious plane in the sky, and i looked around until i spotted it to the east from the passenger side, telling them after a few moments that the maneuvers it had been doing as i had watched it were not indicative of an airplane, and that it was a ufo.\r\n\r\ntriangle was a black triangular shape in the sky, with three white lights on the bottom of the craft. as it flew over the highway, it blocked starlight, and it spun horizontally clockwise at roughly 1 rotation per 2 seconds, roughly.\r\n\r\ncontinued to spin as it crossed back over the highway and began to descend towards the orchard next to us, moving with us perpendicular to the highway. object would then rise and repeat the same maneuver, dipping towards the highway. came visibly close to a farmhouse in one orchard, perceived to be less than 200 feet away at one point when crossing over us, and the farmhouse. from the closest observation i had, the ufo was roughly 150 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n\r\non some occasions it made sharp right turns, or fully reverse movement with only slight deceleration. it would maintain altitude when doing these maneuvers.\r\n\r\nmotions appeared to be deliberate or for a test flight, as the object was moving fluidly and seemed to be bringing it low across the fields, and then ascending, repeating the action (descending/ascending while rotating) for roughly 20-25 minutes until it slowly ascended and then began to accelerate west-northwest. \r\n\r\nacceleration was not instantaneous, though it eventually reached incredible speeds heading away from us (growing smaller rapidly) before growing too small in the sky to see over the course of roughly 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nattempted to take photos with a phone, but the images couldn't capture the three lights or shape of the object, which was quite dim (not much brighter than the brightest star in the sky at the time, despite light pollution from nearby cars in moderate traffic.)\r\n\r\nother passengers in the car were getting very spooked (teenage girls aged 16-18) and were growing more nervous when talking to one-another about the 'what would happen if(s)' should things progress beyond a sighting, as the object would hover quite close over the highway and i asked about pulling over.\r\n\r\ni remained calm and watched the ufo for the entirety of the flight. it was only out of my field of vision a few times during the entire encounter, when it went behind the car to the south-east for a full minute.\r\n\r\nthe driver was focusing on the traffic, as the night had been particularly hectic with at least two drunk drivers threatening the road. she caught a few glimpses of the object, but was more worried about driving.\r\n\r\nwe talked about the ufo for a long time after the event that night, as there was still a few hours of driving needed to get home.\r\n\r\ni have included a paint sketch of the relative observed size(s) of the object in the sky.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

whitewater, wi and heading towards jeffferson. about two miles outside of whitewater i noticed something huge in the sky. it had a redish blinking light and also a white blinking light. i pointed it out to my wife and she said it was probably two planes flying really close together. i told her to take a closer look. it was pretty dark at this point but i could see that it was on huge object. she looked closer and realized that too.\r\n\r\nmy wife, who isn't a believer in ufo's said we should follow it because she was completely at a loss of words for what it was we were looking at. we followed it for about 45 minutes to an hour. occasionally it would have one reddish light and three white lights. it moved slowly sometimes coming close to the ground, not much higher than the treetops. at one point we lost sight of it and as we came over a hill i saw it again, at first i didn't think it was the object. i thought it was maybe a large billboard with lights on it, then i realized we were in the middle of nowhere and there wouldn't be any billboards around. i stopped the vehicle and noticed that it was still moving, but was pretty close to us. we watched it and changed directions and altitude numerous times.\r\n\r\ni got out of the vehicle to try to get video of it, but unfortunately all i had was my samsung galaxy s4 to shoot video of it. the video is not very good and for some reason you could only see the reddish light in the video, and not any of the white lights. i got back in the vehicle to follow it some more but by this time it had flown quite far from us and we lost sight of it.\r\n\r\na mile or two later we saw it again and it was much higher in the sky. not too far from it we noticed another light in the sky. this was a white twinkling light. it would twinkle a few times and then there would be no light coming from it for a second or two, then it would twinkle again for a few seconds and then go dark again. we watched this object in the sky for a few moments noticing that it would decend at a rapid speed for short distances. we could still see it in the sky at approximately 9:30 as we were heading back home.\r\n\r\ni honestly have no idea what we saw. the first craft we saw was huge, much bigger than any plane i have ever seen. it also moved slow for quite a while at low altitudes. there are a few small airports close by, but there is no way anything this large would be able to land or take off from them. my wife and i are puzzled by what we saw and followed around for almost an hour.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

disappeared one it broke from its previous flight path and started rapidly descending, ascending, and turning in such a way that i have never seen a human pilot be capable of doing. soon enough it had what appeared to be a fighter jet trailing it around, but this only lasted a few minutes before the jet flew away from the object. the object flew around in its circular pattern for around forty minutes, with the jet trailing it only once it broke from its flight path. it kept flying erratically for another 15-20 minutes before it disappeared back into the general area i originally saw it from. my grandmother also came out to see the object, but only through a window, and she has finally asked me to send a report in to someone we hope may know about this strange occurence. any help is

remember they are the size of apartment buildings in the air 30ft above our heads barely moving. when we could not see them anymore we released chris m was not out in the road with us. we found him hiding in the back of the van scared out of his mind. that was 34 years ago and i will never forget it. i know that changed my life for ever. sometimes i think that maybe i was under a spell of even abducted because it seemed to be such a long time we watched this event and had some difficulty with time frames between the three of us?","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:20:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),  Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":56047,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.0096951,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05062014-0020","longitude":-96.1939087,"occurred":330844560000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Minnesota","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1399413159000,"summary":"Four total ufo's. two at a time all in twenty minute time frame.
