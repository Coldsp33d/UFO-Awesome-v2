many encounters i have clears memories of only parts of three of the encounters. the following is a description of what i do remember of those three encounters.\r\nnumber one: (1970) i was 10 years old\r\ni was living in geata, italy. my father was career navy. we lived there for five years.\r\none night i woke up to find several strange creatures standing around my bed and doing i do not know what to me. the beings themselves did not really scare me, i was not being harmed. what did scare me was that when they communicated the words were not heard by my ears but would just be understood as sound in my head. i was told that they were preparing me for future visits. i got up from the bed left the room and went across the hall to the door of my parent���s room. i told them what was going on. they told me i was having a bad dream and to go back to bed. i went back to my room. after a few more minutes i was ���told��� by the beings that they intended me no harm and that because they could tell i was afraid they would be leaving but that they would return.    \r\n\r\nfor twenty years after that night i had no further memories of their returning. i did though have many days when i would awake in the mornings and feel tired. i had a strange feeling that i had not slept much that night and that something had happened, i felt somehow violated but could not put my finger on why. as strange as it sounds i could not even force myself to dwell on the feelings. i could only recall things like trying to scream but nothing would come out, wanting to run but being paralyzed. i could not recall why i wanted to scream or run.\r\nnumber two: (1992) i was about 30 years old\r\nby this time i had come to realize that i was being visited by something at times but could recall very little about the visits. that all changed one night after a visit in a hotel in bandung, indonesia. i became aware one night that i was on a vessel of some kind, being escorted down a hall way by two beings that i was familiar with. i could tell by the curvature of the hall that the vessel was round. there was a door every so often on my right side but they were closed. if they had been open they would have been exterior doors. \r\ni finally got to a point to where there was a door on the left, it was open. across from that door was another exterior door. sitting next to the exterior door was a slightly chunky brunette woman who was without clothes. i tried to ask her to help me but as usual nothing would come out. she gave me a look that showed she also wanted help but could offer none.  \r\ni was escorted through the door on the left, into an examination room. in that room there was an examination table perpendicular to the door with two beings standing with their backs to us. they were standing at the foot end of the table. across from them, on the other side of the table, facing them was a tall being. i knew him to be the one in charge. on the same side of the table as the tall one but with her back to me was another being who i knew to be female and i was very familiar with her. i got on the table.\r\nthe tall male then communicated by saying hello and telling me to not worry that i had nothing to fear. he then went on to say ���you remember cela, she has be there every time we have visited you���. at that time a few things happened all at once. she turned around. one of the two beings now on my right at the foot of the table said ���she is there every time because having someone familiar there makes them easier to control���. she stepped towards me saying ���tonight we are going to do sex things, you like that.��� i then reached up with my left hand and grabbed her around her skinny neck. i squeezed as tight and as hard as i could, i had her good, she was in trouble.\r\nthen simultaneously the tall one asked ���how has this happened, i thought we had control of him���. the two others responded ���i don���t know, we did have control of him; we thought we had control of him���. then for some reason my hand just opened up and released her. the tall one then grabbed her to keep her from falling, she was hurt bad. the tall one then said ���return him; return them all���. it turned out there was seven of us.     \r\nthe next thing i recall was standing behind some bushes as one of us was returned to their place. i do not remember how they were returned but i do remember my own returning.\r\ni was staying in a building separate from the main hotel. at the front door of my building was small entrance way. to the left was stairs heading up to my level. to the right was a karaoke bar. the two beings escorting me stepped through the entrance way as a lady who worked at the karaoke bar stepped into the entrance way. she just kind of went blank and stood there. as i stepped on to the stairs heading up to the level of my room she kind of like unfroze and looked at me. it was obvious that she was confused. i think to her i had just appeared there. i kept walking up the stairs, she stood there confused.\r\nmy two escorts and i made our way to my room. the next thing i knew i woke up in my bed with a great since of accomplishment! i could remember most of what happened the night before. i felt like ���wow i got her���!\r\nafter that night i had years where i felt they were no longer visiting me. then i became aware that i was wrong. they were still coming but they had a new trick.\r\nit became clear over the next several years that they were still visiting me but now they caused me to interlock my fingers, try as i might i could not pull my hands apart.\r\nnumber three: (2009) i was about 48\r\nthe last memory i have of them coming to visit was four or five years ago now. on this occasion i found myself outside my parent���s house in alabama with several beings around me. their craft was sitting next to the woods; i was sitting on the tailgate of my truck, with my fingers interlocked. my dog was there and unfazed by the beings. i was told that they would no longer be visiting me and they were there to remove something that allowed them to find me. i was told they were giving me some kind of information and was told that when the time came i would know how to use this information. i have no memory of what this information was.      \r\nthat is my story.\r\ni would like help in remembering more, but i don���t know how to go about finding that help.\r\ni am not looking for any help with paying for any help i could get in retrieving memories. i just want to be pointed in the direction to find that help.\r\n","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Unknown,N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":56005,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.3229614,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05042014-0015","longitude":-86.897198,"occurred":974102400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alabama","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1399257054000,"summary":"Abductions","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":4920,"locationName":"Alabama","triangle":false,"type":"UFO

my parking lot around 10 p.M.On the date specified in eureka, ca where i was living at the time. i was in my car and shut off the engine and lights and heard a helicopter hovering in the distance. i looked up over my apt.(duplex) and saw what appeared to be a black helicopter hovering in the background about 200 feet above the ground with one pilot inside because the cockpit light was on. it hovered for only a few minutes as if it was looking around and then flew off. the night was very dark and there was no moonlight. a minute or two later i was getting ready to leave my car thinking it was only a police copter checking the area and all of a sudden there appeared what seemed to me like another helicopter only about 50 feet over the apt. interior lights came on and i could see what appeared to be a round dome like what you would see on the under side of a blimp, but it was larger than anything i have ever seen on a blimp even at close range. the windows were fairly large and opaque colored, sort of with a translucsent sheen. inside i saw this figure standing that looked like a large human. it had very broad shoulders, big arms and what appeared to be a fairly large head. i couldn't make out any other features because of the opaque windows with a metal-like sheen. the being appeared to move (walk) around the cockpit almost robotic-like adjusting different controls which i could not see. the craft hovered silently over the apt. with no movement, no outside lights and absolutely no noise as i discovered when i opened my side window. it didn't move, however there was no wind blowing either. i felt very apprehensive and decided not to get out. i sure had never seen a blimp like this, however i could not see the shape or size of the craft because there was very little light in the parking lot and no moonlight and the craft itself had no exterior lights. the being inside did not appear to be hostile, just curious.  i thought for a minute and decided to communicate with it by flashing my car headlights on and off in a random manner, something that i remembered from the movie,\"close encounters of a third kind\". as i did so, its outside lights came on and flashed back at me in the same pattern and sequence that i was using. the lights were white and very bright curving and encomposing the bottom front of the craft just below what appeared to be a curving disk.  we did this for a few minutes and remembered that i smiled a little. i shut my lights off and it did so almost immediately after. a few seconds later it shut off its interior lights and everything was pitch black again. i could hear no sound what so ever if the craft flew away or just disappeared. also, there were no other people around as witnesses because most of the people are asleep there at that time as attested to by the fact that no other house or apt. lights were on then. i still think about the incident to this day and often wonder if it was all just a joke and it was really just a black blimp of some kind. however, i know that i sure didn't sleep well that night! in the past there have been several sightings around the eureka area only of strange objects hovering or landing from various people in the area including yurok and hupa native americans. i don't know if these people are even around there anymore.

Unknown","city":"Sunrise","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Before i relate my experience of this past tuesday, april 29 2014, i must tell you my background. i am currently an \"airline pilot\" with  34 years of flying experience, and over 28 years as an airline pilot flying all types of aircraft under far part 135 and far part 121. i am currently based in fort lauderdale, fl, (kfll) with a major airline flying as a captain on the airbus 319/320/321. i am typed in the b1900, b737, dc9/md80, and a320. i have ailine experience flying all over the world.\r\n\r\nthis event took place very close to fort lauderdale airport. i have been flying to (kfll) since 1996 and i am very familiar with the area, the airport traffic flow, the airspace restrictions and the final approach sequence for landing including the approx. areas of the final approach fix for the normal landing on runway 10l (left).\r\n\r\nsuffice to say, i know where airplanes should be and i know where they  should not be if they have no intention of  landing in kfll on runway 10l.\r\nthis object i saw was obviously not landing on 10l and should not have been in the final approach corrider. \r\n\r\ni approximate the object/orb/light to have been about 1500-2000 ft. between the final approach fix novae and pionn.These gps fixes are noted on the ils 10l approach plate for kfll.  that would place it approximately 8-10 miles due west of kfll on the 270 deg radial. \r\n\r\nmy family and i, along with many thousands of bruce springsteen fans had just begun leaving the completed concert held at the bb&t center on panther parkway, sunrise, fl. as we were coming out the front doors with thousands of fans, i noticed a group of people pointing and staring in the southern sky. i looked up to see what they were watching and saw the following:\r\n\r\na extremely bright, pulsating round white light appeared to be slowly moving north toward the arena. i immediately assumed in was an aircraft on base leg getting ready to make a right turn to land at kfll. the landing light, or what i though was a landing light was extremely bright. thinking back it really was to bright to be an aircraft but i figured it could be.\r\n\r\nit started pulsating from bright white to pulsating blue to red to back to blue, etc. it slowed and i thought it had begun a turn to the east to set up for landing but it appeared to stop in mid-air. the bright light then changed to a star pattern like design but the best i can describe it... is apppeared to be like a bright blue asterik just like this *. at least 3, maybe 4 but i believe 3...Crossed lines of bright blue crossed lines....Steady....Not moving...Stationary. \r\n\r\nbefore the asterik design appeared, i kept trying to dismiss this event as first..  a jet aircraft inbound to kfll from the south. but no noise could be heard and the landing lights were too bright for a jet. then when it appeared to stop in mid-air i figured it to be a helicopter. but still no noise. then when the star-asterik (*) pattern appeared, i assumed maybe it to be a helicopter with advertising on the skids...But no written message or ad appeared, just the bright asterik design.\r\n\r\nseconds later the asterik immage disappeared but a small white orb/light stayed. it then made two or three extremely fast, zig-zag flight maneuvers that i have never seen any wordly flying aircraft make. it then suddenly  stopped... and and then shot straight up out of sight and an extreme rate of speed that i can not explain not have i ever seen an aircraft or helicopter do before.\r\n\r\nthis whole incident only last about 1 minute from the time i saw other people watching something to the time it shot upwards to the stars and disappeared.\r\n\r\ni tried to see if the object was still around but the crowd was sort of moving me along as i was in the way of the mass of fans leaving the front doors of the concert. as i walked to my car, tree tops in the parking lot began to obstruct my view and my  family and i had become separated. i made my way back to the car and watched the sky for a few minutes and did not see anything else. my 16 year old son witnessed basically the same phenomina i saw. \r\n\r\ni wish i had thought to film this with my phone but it happened so fast that had i got my phone out of my pocket, waited for it to turn on, frame, focus in dark sky, etc. i am sure i would have missed the event but i feel reluctant now that i did not at least try.\r\n\r\nthe weather that evening was clear skies. no clouds that i can recall, visibility was good to excellent, temp. in the low 80's. i could not make out any shape of the object. only the bright pulsating light that changed colors and shape as described above.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with

phones to take pictures and record when we notice that two more were side by side so then the they past and then we see three more in the sky it seemed a little more like a formation but then one starts headwind in our direction then suddenly does a tight spin then returns to its path with the other two lights a few seconds later a the last one passes by and then you don't see any more about a few minutes go by and a black helicopter is hovering around like it's searching for something and then a jet flys by at a real steady speed

there is a hill where we saw something hovering. as we got closer it became much bigger . it was hovering just offside our road extremely low to the ground and when we got up too it our car was almost underneath it. we turnd the car off and jumped out and stood almost directly underneath it just staring up . it was around 5 am, we live in the countryside and there was no noise to be heard at all. pure silence. as we looked at it , it seemed to make a jumbo 747 look like a baby plane in comparison. it was a dark or black triangle and had 3 white rectangular panels of light under it so from where we looked at it , there was one rectangle above and two underneath all horizontal. the light was all evenly bright, no fluttering or movement of it. we stared at it for about 15 minutes looking at eachother like now what. then very suddnely it changed direction and zipped of diagonally to the east and dissappeard within seconds and without a sound. my husband still refuses to think it could be from another planet but he cannot refuse to admit what he saw. however 2 nights prior to this sighting i got up in the middle of the night to get a glass of water. when i went to the kitchen window i saw an object off to the east with colored lights (red, yellow, green) and it was doing manouvers like movine up , down, to the side and stopping each time. i could not see that well so went to get my binoculars. i could see much better but it was at quite a distance. i observed this strange movement until it dissapeard. i feel lucky to have witnessed these events. whether alien or earthly they were a sight to see.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional

bright lights in a triangle formation in the sky. mind you it is cloudy out...No stars and no moon. so i point it out to my co-work who proceeded to say \"what the f... is that?\" i say \"i don't know but that's not an airplane.\" as we are slowly driving forward. then we see two more lights side by side following behind. one would speed up then slow down. then another and another light all fly in a speed i don't normally associate with any type of plane. and i know planes my partner is a aircraft mechanic / inspector. anyway my friend turned on to the main road at which time the lights kept coming some would follow the others for a distance then shoot off in another direction. while some would seem disappear in their very spot. he and i were discussing what it could be and all i could keep saying is this isn't right this just isn't right. he's freaked out but we keep driving until we reach a round about at which time we turn north and pull over. we sit there and watch one, two, a pair, one, one, and so on. we sat there for at least 10 minutes. they just kept coming but my friend started stressing and kept saying \"i've got to turn around now\" and i kept saying just wait a minute but he turned around headed back to round about at which time we could still see some coming as we turned right for about 2 minutes until trees disrupted our view as he was driving. i think i was much more excited than my friend. i think it scared him a lot.  by the way there was other people driving so maybe they saw something too.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

a pair of small binoculars and a smartphone to observe. when magnified you could see distinct white, blue and red lites, sometimes together, sometimes alone. no noise. appeared to be far away. watched for 1/2 hour. rechecked 1/2 hr after that, it was gone.\r\n\r\n2nd nite, saw same set of pulsing lites, stationary same location in sky.\r\neventually faded from site..Going away from us? smaller, dimmer....Gone\r\n\r\n3rd. had two friends come and witness the same pulsating lites, same spot in sky to the west. friend brought huge binoculars! and a very good sony digital camera with 24 x 60 zoom. got some nice pix with different color lites together, separate, white orb, fuzzy edges. stayed in same place for an hour. all the while planes and a helicopter passing overhead. an hour later we saw 2 lites to the north, same colors, pulsation hovering etc. appeared at times to have a small white lite (orb?) going back and forth between the two larger lites. a little later a triangular lite with surrounding lites marking it's shape. tilted on an angle. to the left of the two pulsationg lites! watched for at least 1/2 an hour.\r\n\r\nwe'll report if this occurs a 4th nite in a
