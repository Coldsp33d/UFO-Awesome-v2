i apologize for the length but it was the most miraculous experience of my life, i felt the details needed to be shared. \r\n\r\nplease note: this was written and submitted the very night it happened when everything was still fresh in my head\r\n\r\n11-29-2012:\r\n\r\ni was sitting in my basement (i have a ranch style house-normal floor and downstairs but no up stairs) with my dad and my mom came down yelling at him about a fight they had earlier. it turned into a big screaming mess between the three of us so i stormed out my basement door to my backyard to get some fresh air.  went back inside for a minute and while i was looking out my basement window i noticed these flying lights behind a tree but stopped paying attention quickly because the fight started again so again i stormed outside. i went and sat and faced the tree i saw the bright lights coming from. i'd actually been keeping my eye on that tree the past few nights because i noticed a lot of lights coming from behind the tree recently but assumed it was a busy plane area or something...But at the same time, i like aliens, so in the back of my mind i was always questioning \"could that be a ufo??\" but of course, it was always a plane. tonight though the lights were really bright and there were a lot of them. when i first saw it i assumed maybe it was a helicopter search but again, in the back of my mind i secretly hoped it would be ufo's. that's why when a pair of the flying lights started coming towards me i thought i was going insane. \r\n\r\nremember, i'm out here alone. my parents are inside fighting still and i know that because i can hear them. for some reason i didn't pay much attention to the light that was coming towards my direction. i was still riled up from what had been going on inside seconds ago then come out to these flying lights headed in my direction? i think it was so much of a shocker that i didn't really realize it was actually happening. for a minute, i genuinely thought i was just going crazy and seeing things so i didn't pay attention to it because i didn't want to think i was crazy! i was also trying to get my dog to stop biting my pants so i had completely looked away from the lights. i heard a boy yell for his dog to come in and wondered if it was because they saw the lights too. the next time i looked up at what i had convinced myself was an illusion, it was flying over my house and that was the last time i saw it.\r\n\r\n i turned around to face my back yard again and saw another pair of the same lights coming towards me again.  at this point i started paying attention.  i started getting frustrated actually. i didn't know what was going on and what these were and if they were even actual things or my just imagination. and my dog was still biting my pants. i studied the lights and wondered if it was men working on the telephone poles. or some neighbor who went over the top and got moving christmas lights.  as i was watching it more lights from different areas started popping up from what seems like literally no where. unfortunately, i really can not give too much description to what any of them look like. i was just trying to figure out what was going on. at this point i could spin in a circle and see one in every direction. if they didn't have lights i wouldn't have seen them. it was very dark and some of them were weaving in and out of my trees as well as my neighbors trees. one looked very huge, bigger than any of them, and black and robot type that seemed to take up the entire sky. \r\n\r\ni can describe one of them for sure though. it was in the shape of a boomerang/triangle. \r\nit was white with green and blue lights and maybe red but i don't think so. it had a black dome on top. it was definitely the prettiest one i could point out. i was standing in my fenced-in pool area of my backyard and it looked like the ufo was in either my non-fenced-in backyard area or in my neighbors backyard. regardless, it was close, maybe 100 feet away. i feel like others got within 100 feet of me as well but they were never stopped, they just came to cut through my back yard and went over my house, and carried on. but since this one was stopped and the only one i could really see, (its whole surface was lighten up with lights - mostly white with blue and green circle shaped lights) i focused all my attention to it because trying to take it all in was obviously not happening. it was only landed for a short period of time. 15 seconds? then began to lift itself, flying  straight up into the air. once it got to a certain height, (just above the height of my house) it started accelerating forward instead of upwards. \r\n\r\ni turned to face my house, the direction where all the ufo's had been headed. i noticed how big and full and beautiful the moon was. it was the biggest i have ever seen the moon be, almost the size of my house it seemed. i think the last ufo i saw was the same as the first. it had the same lights and seemed like an old pick up truck mixed with a old fashioned car that was orange with purple. it looked as if it were maybe metallic? it seemed very futuristic and while it flew it left a light blue  trail like a plane does but it lasted a much shorter time than planes do.  i wondered if any of my other neighbors had been watching any of this too. i also wondered what the hell i just experienced, if it was even real or not. too bad my only other whiteness was my dog who was still biting my pants.\r\n\r\ncurrent day: for the past year and a half i still have flashbacks to that experience and expect to probably for the rest of my life. since this day, i have had the weird feeling of being watched when i'm alone at night but i might just be being paranoid!!!! i would really love some possible answers if you can seem to find any. thank you so much for your time.\r\n-jenna \r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Window(s),  Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":55968,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.523309651046866,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05022014-0027","longitude":-83.30667904756612,"occurred":1354176000000,"potentialRelations":[44245],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1399086606000,"summary":"Over 10 ufo's spotted at together over a year ago..Still looking to share my story and get some answers!!!!!!","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"48301","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":519,"locationName":"Bloomfield Hills, Michigan","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:167819"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover), Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Espa√±ola","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was approximately 10am and i was driving north towards espanola from santa fe when i first saw this unusual craft with a small emissions tail/trail. truthfully this would be the first time i've ever seen exhaust coming out of a celestial aircraft in my over 200 plus sightings from 2010 to the present, and hundreds before. i'm a bit suspicious because of that fact, that it even is celestial in nature. they don't usually leave exhaust but be that as it may, that morning i saw the ubiquitous chem trails in front of me up in the sky, and something in them.\r\n\r\nat first i saw a very faint con trail and/or glow up where the chem trails were when all of a sudden i saw a small cylindrical, with an offset dome on top, type craft appear, and go across the sky up amongst the trails. at first it went in one direction, east to west and then, exactly as i saw it go one way, i saw it go the opposite direction, west to east. each time there was a faint glow as if it were somewhat cloaked cept the contrail and then it would appear.\r\n\r\nthe reason why i say i'm a bit suspicious is because . .. well, this is new mexico after all; los alamos, las cruces, white sands notwithstanding roswell, so a new type of military craft that sprays deadly chemicals on unsuspecting citizens could explain it. however after hundreds of sightings, you kind of get the feel on how celestial crafts operate and move and navigate. i believe it is exactly what i saw. i can provide sketches as well.\r\n\r\nwhen the \"big guns\" in aircraft came out and continued to spray their chem trails with a vengeance, seems that's when the \"small craft\" disappeared. is there some connection one to the other?

communicated with the being , they told me things and events are suppose to happen. my thought to them why not reveal themselves now, they told me that humanity is immature, hostile, and not to tell no one because no one would believe this happened. they said to me that in the near future they will be back for me because i know how to communicate with them. i lost sight of the object going west in front of my house i use to live towards wayne and pennsylvania. from that time on it has affected my mental and physical health in many ways, full of anxiety, stress, and depression,anemic in the 1980's from it also. when i worked for a company in the 1980's, around september 1986, a co worker mentioned that his aunt seen a ufo at forty fort , pa too. then i said i seen the same thing, and that your aunt is not crazy. ever since then i experience i have been not right since, it haunts me. the trauma from time to time brings out the situation, medication is not helping since 1991, had ulcers in the 1980's,and i also read alot thinking i am missing something. when a major came to take the report questions asked where the shape, did i ever see \"star wars\", and \"close encounters of the third kinds\", i said no. i did not watch much tv, busy studying and school. he mentioned to keep it quiet because of national security.","distance":"20 Feet or

friday or saturday night. i am a town police officer and have worked overnight for four years. i drove to the out skirts of the village to get out and stretch my legs for a brief moment at the same location i always do. i don't know why, but something made me turn and look up. i did so. i then saw a bright green pulsing orb like craft hovering approx 50 degrees above the horizon line. i did not feel any type of fear. i felt safe and intrigued. i stood there for about ten minutes and observed the object. it continued to pulse consistently for the entire encounter. as i observed the object moved slowly to the right, back to the left and back to the right. it did this briefly, stopped and repeated this motion. i was so astonished by what i was witnessing that i called a friend on the phone who is not a police officer, and stood there talking with them on the phone as i observed. they were equally amazed. the object did not leave me, i left it. i now regret getting in the car and driving away. i wished i would have stayed and tried to communicate. i realized this about 15 minutes later and returned to the site, but the object had moved on. i have many times since returned to that area hoping to see it/them again but have yet to. i have always had an open mind to such things as i was raised by an open minded mother. myself and my older brothers discuss such things openly with one another. it is my experience that i have also been part in abduction. what i can recall of these interactions is peaceful and respectful. at no time have i felt threatened or \"captured\". my mother feels alike as abduction and other paranormal activity have been a regular part of her life, as well as her mother. my experiences seem to center more around abduction and less around other types or paranormal activity. in my experience, i have had embryonic samples taken from me. i was told \"these are going to be used to make babies\". i have also been part in de-sensitization activities where it seems as though we were working on reducing the \"fear factor\" that occurs in many of these encounters. on other occasions i have been shown holographic examples of magnetic engines, which may be used for short distance bursts in travel. i am not certain of their function; as it is only a fragmented memory recall. regardless these interactions in my experience have been peaceful, and dare i say rather enjoyable. it is my personal opinion that i consider the specific beings i have had encounters with to be of a non-threatening nature. i do call them my friends. as i did not feel coerced nor kidnapped. these beings were \"greys\". this is one persons perspective. form your own. i cannot say whether or not these beings were the ones operating the green orb like craft described above. i would be happy to speak with mufon further and in more detail on this subject or any of the above. please feel free to contact me via email and cell phone.\r\n\r\nthank

business. i was at national training center (ntc) ft erwin, cal. majave desert @ april to july 2002. myself and one other was alone about a week in desolate position in desert. one night as we lay on our cot out in the open under the bright stars we watched for shooting stars and passing sattelites also iridium flares. it was about ten o'clock pm, we then noticed a light like that of a star. the light was different we both noticed it at the same time. we began talking about it, we even jokingly scoffed that it was a ufo. the light was getting brighter, it was not moving. we had time to discuss what it may be, we had time for discussion the entire event took maybe 7 minutes. the light was getting brighter by the second then suddenly it was so bright i looked at my friend and he looked at me and \"it lit up our faces!\" we was suddenly shocked, scared even, my adrenaline kicked in. \r\n\r\nthe light then began to dim at about the same rate as it brightened minutes before. i got up when we no longer could see the light at all and went to our radio, i could hear different units reporting to our headquarters about seeing what we saw. we discussed what we seen and both agreed we saw a super novea or maybe a beam of light from a pulsar. my question is did we indeed see a known or undiscovered super novea event? below is a little more info about our training before we went to iraq in 2004. \r\n\r\nthe largest movement of military equipment in the state since the tennessee maneuvers of world war ii began on 26 april 2002 at fort campbell, ky. tennessee's largest national guard combat force, the 278th armored cavalry regiment, undertook it's greatest training challenge on 01 june 2002 at the national training center (ntc) in fort irwin, california. but first the 5,000 plus members of the regiment shipped everything from m-1 abrams tanks and blackhawk helicopters to individual helmets and computers to this remote training area in southern california. the national training center (ntc) is the premier training center for the united states army. it is located in the heart of the mohave desert, and is the most realistic combat training scenario in the world. it's harsh environment and excellent opposing force soldiers test the endurance, knowledge, and resourcefulness of both active duty and reserve component forces. tennessee's equipment constituted more than 585 rail cars being shipped from 5 different locations beginning on 26 april and continuing during the month of may. \r\n\r\ni sent this same letter to cornell university.  they wrote back \"maybe it was a balloon\"! \r\n\r\ni have spent years  thinking about this event also studying astronomy and watching iridium flares. this was no flare!","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

2,000 ft. and it was very large, bigger than a golfball held at arm's length. i remarked about this to my husband, but he was driving and could not see the craft. there was a very large light on the front of the object, which was a circular shape with curved edges, and an indentation inside the circle, then a bulging center. the light was a soft, glowing blue/white color, with it being darker on the outside rim and lighter on the inside. it was so dull that i would not have noticed it had i not been looking at the small plane just prior to seeing this object. as we drove, i followed the object as it flew over head, almost directly, but slightly to the south of our position and continued on.  i then lost sight of it due to traffic and lights. this has to be the strangest ufo i've ever seen or heard of, even though i do quite a few ufo investigations.  there was no sound and we had no residual effects, except i wonder what it could have been.

looked up in the sky and saw 3 disk shaped objects moving slowly through the sky. at first they looked liked stars because i have blurred vision but i knew they couldn't be planets or stars because i could see no other stars on a clear night. i was able to see, by squinting, that it looked like a black circle surrounded in roughly 10 lights on the outer rim of the disk. my girlfriend confirmed what i believed i saw. they all spun slowly and moved independently of each other. one stayed in the distance, barely visible, to the south of me. one other started close to me and moved to the west. the last one traveled from the south toward me and turned to the east directly at me when i was waving my arms around. it then started making erratic movements that didn't seem to make any sense for a ship to be making in my opinion. it looked almost alive. some movements seemed to be in right angles but it still appeared to be moving fairly slowly from my vantage point. i couldn't believe i could see it so clearly. they didn't seem to be trying to hide themselves at all. i thought it was incredible. it then turned off it's lights and i could see the actual object. it looked like it had a bell top but was difficult to fully make out. i couldn't tell if it changed shapes. after about a minute or so it turned the lights back on. at that point it turned back into what looked to be a black disk again and continued moving side to side toward me. i think that it saw me and may have been making signals because i can see no other reason it would continue moving in these directions. why i believe this is because it ultimately didn't go very far at all until 5 am when i lost sight of it and the other two, as they disappeared off to the west and one to the south west of me.(i live just to the east of the willamette river in milwaukie, or. btw...) before they left though, the one that looked like it saw me continued making the erratic movements including bouncing up and down and started to go a little faster. definitely the the craziest thing i've ever seen in my life. i have no doubt that this technology was extraterrestrial. hopefully other people saw what my girlfriend and i saw and can possibly confirm and give further details i may have missed. unfortunately i have no video or photos. my camera wasn't good enough to see it in the dark. thank you for reading","distance":"Over
