hazy white lights chasing each other in a perfect circle, going through whatever clouds were there, and then meeting up in the middle of the circle and then going back into the circle formation.  looked like they were playing ring around the rosie, but at a fast pace.  i looked at the time and it was 7:55 pm.  i kept sight of it until i got onto i-294 and then couldn't look up because traffic was pretty busy on i-294. got off on my exit to head home. i was at a light on 107th pulaski in chicago heading north and looked up and a bit to my left (west), and there they were - the lights chasing each other in a perfect circle in and out of the clouds and meeting in the middle, bouncing back out to the circle - once again. i believe it was about 8:20 pm. during both sightings, i did not see any beams of light beneath it going to the ground as one might see with a spotlight or advertising lights; no storms or lightning in area. i know other people saw this as well, as i saw people looking from their cars in that direction. perhaps they may report it as well. it wasn't the first time i've witnessed this phenomenon.  i saw this at least two other times, once with my son. sure

very bright stars next to each other and stationary in the sky. these starlike objects were a good bit brighter than venus. i obviously have never seen 2 stars that were this bright and postioned right next to each other. these objects were not blinking or changing color from there white star-like appearance. i vewed them for about one minute. after 1 full minute, both stars started to dim slowly untill i could not see them anymore. from the time they were at full brightness untill they could not be seen anymore took about 30 seconds. while they were dimming, they remained in there same position in the sky ... i have never in my life seen anything like this before. these 2 objects looked to be in outerspace (such as you would see a star or venus) ... in my opinion, they were not at

noise from the canyon.\r\n\r\nwhat caught my eye was the object was twinkling extremely bright randomly  changing colors through most of the color spectrum. it also seemed to be much closer than other stars.\r\n\r\nat that point i grabbed my camera (nikon d5200 w/nikkor 55-300mm lens mounted on tripod) and set it up in my driveway pointed due east approximately 10 degrees above the horizon and video recorded about 5 minutes worth of footage until my battery died.  during the recording, the object seemed to move with earths orbit, but about half way through the video i noticed it made a slight direction change to the south just prior to moving out of the field of view of my camera (i did not adjust the tripod once i started recording).\r\n\r\nwith limited time, i wasn't able to view the video for a few days.  once i did see the video, i was amazed with what i captured.  this object seemed to be within the earths atmosphere after view a freeze frame.  what also made me believe

like a tight cluster of flashing red lights hovering toward the north of my location.  i estimate the lights were no more then 1/4 mile away at an altitude of 500 to 1000'.  the cluster of lights appeared to be part of one aircraft.  i did not notice any white or green lights which are normally associated with helicopters or airplanes.  \r\nthe strangest part of my observation was when the lights quickly moved from left to right in a straight line.  the lights kept moving left to right, hover for a second, and then move back right to left and hover.  it did this very quickly and would come to a hover each time.  the lights were not moving in racetrack pattern which is a very common pattern for a helicopter but a straight line. i kept saying to myself \"how can these lights do this\".  it just didn't look normal for a helicopter to do this kind of flight. \r\nhere's where it gets really weird.  after the lights had gone back and forth in this straight pattern a couple of times they disappeared only to reappear a short distance away.  the lights would appear to hover and then disappear.  one second later they would reappear a short distance away.  the lights did this three times before rapidly descending below the horizon.  i believe the object was leaving the area by moving away from my location as the lights became smaller and faded in brightness.
