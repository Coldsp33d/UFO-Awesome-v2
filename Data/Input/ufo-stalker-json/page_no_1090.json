was just a bright light and at first i thought it was a cell tower light that wasnt blinking but at the same time it was awful bright and bigger than any cell tower light i have ever seen....But we kept goin and we almost got to the 4 way of 136 and 341 and by this time it was bigger and same brightness and i mentioned it to my hubby he said \"yea that is weird i wonder what that is?\" we joked about it being a ufo or something... it was like hovering over lookout mnt and by that time i knew it wasnt a cell tower and there wasnt anything around it.  we kept trying to think of possible things it could have been...It looked like a mini sun but it was white as snow like the kind u see when u weld with no helment..So we turned and kept heading to my grandmothers and you can see the mnt for my grandmothers back yard and it was still there! and it was just hovering!! so i went and layed my son down in the playpen its still early and wasnt time for him to be up when my husband said \"its gone!\" we didnt see where it went but it was gone completely gone.....Later i got to thinking about the only reason i am reporting this... my family lives next door to my grandmothers 160 acre cattle farm..It was my childhood home...And due to it being country we camped alot in the back yard in the summer..I was like 15 or 16 and my sis was 14 or 15 and one night my sister woke me up and made me get out of the tent and we never told anyone about it, but it looked just like that bright light my husband and i saw the other day...But that time it was bigger and it was over my grandfathers barn and followed the treeline and then diappeared as quick as that one did!!! there was no noise and the cows were not making any noise or anything there was a slight wind i remember but my sister and i never told anyone about that...(now i have told my husband )and now since i have seen this light 2 times i wanted to find someone to tell it to and find out what is goin on.","distance":"Over One

outside so the sky was still light clear blue and all you could see is the blue sky. i felt this strange sensation of looking up into the sky and in the meantime i observed this really bright object that seemed very out of place since im very familiar with the sky and star location it seemed a bit odd but as i was about to come in i noticed a lot of little small like flashing orbs ejecting or coming in to close range of that brighter object, so i if that was not strange enough lots of more orbs coming in from the se direction started coming in to close range of this much bigger object.\r\nso of course ran in grabbed my binoculars and camera trying to see what was this strange object ejecting little like bright orbs that were fling in all sorts of direction with no path, some stopping and hovering and some cont. in a path but dimming the lights and some turning off completely so this was weird since i know of no aircraft to do such thing never the less moving very oddly stopping making sharp turns and like if waiting for a sigh from some other object. i really got scared when i started taking pictures this intelligent objects moved in for a closer look especially the big bright one and dimming its lights while it came in for closer observation of what it might be. i since that night have felt as if i'm being watched or observer or could just be plain paranoia i cant explain it. on 4-23-14 at around 4:15 4:30am i looked outside my bedroom window and to my right and there was a cigar shaped object just in mid air i say like about 10-15 feet off the ground, then my husband had got up to use the restroom and in coming back into the room he turns on light and the cigar shaped object disappears without noise. \r\nthe next day i went out about the same time i have noticed this objects\r\nand the same thing happens little bright orbs coming out of underneath this big bright like object and going in different path or directions and some hovering. \r\nit was until this morning about like 3:30 4:am i started having the same sensation that something was like hovering up close by my house and sure enough take a look out the living room window and this big bight object since i turned the lights off to go to bed started decending form the sky like a leaf falling to ground and dimming its lights as it did this, so i quickly run and turn the lights on this object starting going back up but still with the light dimmed. i also observed another object a lot higher than the brighter one side with this object i feel like its one craft object but transparent to a point to look like a star and confuse the public but as i said its very weird its been like 2 weeks and this intelligent objects moving in odd and stopping and hovering for long periods of time are cont. to appear. \r\n\r\nall i want is for someone with the experience in this area to please have someone come out and take a look at this very highly active area of unknown flying objects that are scaring me. as for my family thinks im going in sane. im sending what i have captured but would like to remain anonymous please.

paulding it was light out and all the stars/planet(s) that were visible were no longer visible; the object still remained just as brilliantly lite up. when i stopped, i couldn't hear any sounds of a

it had light in the corners and because it was in the sky, i couldnt estimate its size or speed but i could defenetly say it was flying toword my dirction beacuse it was growing.It was a little higher than the horizen. a minute passed and the objected multiplied. as if a clown parted from it and continued getting closer alongside the first object. after a minute the seconed object clowned itself just like the first one. now they where three. than the first one disapeared but the two clowns continued to get closer. the the second (the first clown) disapeared and than again the

Republic","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":" i'm not sure where to start. there is quite alot of information that even i have a hard time accepting. i'll try to start from the beginning. i see alot of people that have had clear memories with vivid details, and most have been happening for years. mine comes in bits and pieces and just started recently. \r\n\r\n i would say the whole thing started happening a few months ago. i woke up really startled one morning from some really crazy dreams. i'm a vet who's been deployed, and most of my dreams have to do with previous happenings there. that's why this one really shook me up. i can't remember everything about it, but i remember really clearly seeing a smokey filled doorway with a greyish being staring at me. i've seen pictures of \"greys\" but this one had a wider head with a blue tint to it. there were others there too, but i dont remember them well. it was as if they were showing themselves to me. i usually would have been really frightened by this, but i almost felt as if that was being repressed somehow. the dream ended with me cruising first person above a canal with trees canopied over it. that was it. i woke up really shaken.\r\n\r\n after that night, my girlfriend had these huge bruises all over the back of her leg. she has been complaining alot about her eye bothering her in the morning too. like it hurts to even wash her face. i don't think the bruise could have been from me kicking her or bumping into something, because she would clearly wake up with the size that this bruise covers. \r\n \r\nmy most vivid dream happened about 2 weeks ago. i woke up in that same room, i knew it was that same room from the first initial dream. i was terrified, i looked around and saw a few greyish beings staring at me almost with discontent. i was frozen, but awake for a few seconds (in the dream). one of the beings on the right looked right into my eyes and i was asleep again. a feeling like when you're about to go under surgery right after they inject the anesthesia. \r\n \r\n at night i always feel as if something is watching me. i think of it as straight out of a horror movie when i go to check my other rooms. it runs through my head when i see some dummy going to check behind a door where jason or freddy is hiding. nevertheless something does a really good job at making me think somethings there. we have a dog, and i figured the dog would be alerted to this as well. he's not. i'm not a great sleeper. i've had sleeping problems since i've been out of the service. late at night i watch my dog, which usually sleeps through the whole night, get up and walk around. just looking, not barking, standing in the same place everynight and then coming back to lay down.  \r\n\r\n i've been waking up, when i do sleep, with horrible pains in my ankle. last night i dreamt of my old squad with me, around the same street where i grew up. our platoon sergeant made me and two others take off our shirts while he poked me in the back to get skin samples off me. i could almost feel the prick in my dreams. i don't know what to make of it. either that, or i'm in denial. i'm not sure if i want this to be true, or to chalk it up to bad dreams and coincidences. \r\n\r\n \r\n about 2 days ago i was going to take a shower, lifted up my shirt and found this reddish/purple scar on my stomach. the dreams come and go, i don't have them every night. all i can really be sure of are these bruises and scars are real and i have no way to explain them. the presence i feel at night sometimes is almost too much to handle. a grown man scared of space aliens is not something i can bring up having a beer with my friends, or relatives for that matter. i'm even uncomfortable writing this, but i have to do something about it. \r\n\r\n-- i was also given a few tips to draw what i've seen and to log the dreams like a journal. i've done this and that's what you're reading.--\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"03:00:00","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":55897,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":50.0755381,"location":null,"logNumber":"CZ-04302014-0010","longitude":14.4378005,"occurred":1386674580000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Hlavní
