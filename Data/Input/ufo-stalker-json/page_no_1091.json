graveyard\". i was about 10 years old and my cousin (the other witness) was about 14. my aunt had called the others inside and me and my cousin were on the opposite end of the cemetery from the mobile home still walking back. he was about 20 to 30 feet from me. i had stopped and was waiting on him as he walked toward me. i was facing south. suddenly he put his hand up pointing at the sky and said \"what's that, look !\" i turned around to look north in the direction of his point and saw a large circular disc coming toward us and it went almost over our heads. it was about 100 feet of the ground and about 25 to 50 feet in diameter. it was a light gray color and had the letters \"usaf\" on the bottom of it on one side and an alpha numeric (letters and numbers) on the other side. at the time it happened i did not know what these letters meant (i was only around 10 years old). i said \"it's a flying saucer\". after it flew by us it stopped in mid air, hovered for a few seconds and descended to land on the other side of wooded area south of the cemetery. it made an electric humming noise with a slow pulse and a air rushing noise. not like a heavy jet noise but, it may have hade jet air. after it landed me and my cousin ran over to the fence of the woods and stopped. we could see 2 dark silhouettes get out of it and then saw a red light. one of them appeared to be holding a red light. my cousin went over the fence and thru the woods. i stayed put. he came back, covered in mud, and said it was 2 men in \"jump suits\". they didn't see him. we went inside and told my aunt and she said we was crazy. she didn't think it possible. i wrote the letters \"usaf\" on a piece of paper and said that was written on it. she still did not believe it. she would not let us go back and look. we then got her to let us go to my grandmother's house just up the long driveway from there. my father, uncle and some older cousins were playing a late night card game with the tv on in the next room. we told them about it and they didn't believe it. then, after about a half hour maybe we heard a loud sound outside. we said \"that must be it\" and one of them ran outside. he came back in and said it's just a helicopter. early the next morning we ran outside of the trailer to go see if it was still there. in front of the cemetery gate was the town marshal blocking the entrance and two air force trucks in the cemetery. at the end of the cemetery was a air force helicopter. the marshal told us that the helicopter had engine trouble and had to be repaired. the thing is that the craft we saw was not a helicopter. it was circular planeform disc and had the letters \"usaf\" in big bold black letters on it's bottom. the helicopter was air force blue with the letters \"u.S. air force\" on it's side. obviously, not the same craft. i know now what the letters mean and this sighting caused me to join the air force when i was 18. it is my opinion that this was connected to something like project silverbug or maybe even was silverbug being relocated. i believe it landed and needed a repair and that the helicopter came from grissom afb to fix it and the pilots may have seen us and that's why they kept the helicopter there as a cover story.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Insignia","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path

limited ground lights. there were two blue white lights, arranged like headlights but much larger, floating slowly out of the canyon and into the valley, at about 300 ft. elevation, and maybe 300 yds. away, seeming to follow the road. the lights blinked occasionally, there were no port/starboard lights or strobes. i was thinking maybe it was a heliocopter, so i turned off the engine of my car, but there was no discernible noise, other than wind. it was very, very windy. the lights moved closer, and i would estimate that they moved at about 10-15 mph. they stayed parallel and in the same plane. i pulled out my binocculars (which i keep in the car for observing my cattle, etc.), but couldn't make out any shape or profile. as the lights passed behind my house, i reversed the car and decided to follow it. the lights proceeded to the south-southeast slowly, and when i pulled out of our driveway, i was parallel to it, and pulled into the road to pursue it. it was to the east of my location, still moving very slowly and very low, over the hills. i kept my speed at about 25 mph, thinking that i could intercept it out on the highway. and i thought to myself, \"and then what?\" and began to be a little intimidated. \r\n    after i had traveled about .30 mile on the dirt road, the lights veered directly east and disappeared behind a low hill. i have lived here for 30 yrs. and figured out about where i might intercept it, so i went to the highway (nm hwy 78) and proceeded east for about 4.5 miles, but didn't see it any longer. i drove up to a higher vantage point, but didn't see it anywhere.\r\ni felt very nervous suddenly and started to tremble. i had had another \"encounter\" in 1992, but this time, i feel a lot more intimidated, and though the curiosity and desire to pursue is there, i am quite uncomfortable. i am very tired, but not sure i can sleep tonight. as curious as i am, i wish this hadn't happened. i hope all my cows are there in the morning....","distance":"501

fireball go quickly across the sky from east to west. the time was between 9 pm and 11 pm the sun had just set and there was still some evening glow to the sky. it was at an angle of descent of about 25 to 40 degrees. it was increasing in light intensity and then then blew apart into multiple pieces. it was moving in my estimate 500 to 2,500 mph. it looked like it was about 2 miles distance to it north of town. from my view in southeast of town, it exploded over north west of town. this took about 2 seconds. it was obviously on fire. it left a long fire and smoke trail behind it which took about 1 minute or so to dissipate. after the explosion some of it continued going straight and burnt up but, some of it fell downward in a cannonball like trajectory. it did not look like any of it remained from burning. my first thought was that a plane just came burning down from the sky and exploded, but after taking a minute to relax i think it was probably a space rock. i later noticed it on the news that a sonic shock wave hit kokomo and that another report was made to the police of a plane crash. although, i could see a darker area in the flames it was impossible to tell what was on fire.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

restaurant in tempe, az, eating dinner when we both noticed a series of 7 pulsating orange and red orbs rising from the northern horizon, traveling almost directly south and following single file, somewhere around .5 miles equidistant from one another.  as they traveled south, they slowly gained altitude, and passed maybe 1 mile east of us before ascending into the clouds and disappearing. there was a brief pause of perhaps 1 minute, then another series of 7 orbs appeared from the same point on the horizon as the ones before. they followed the exact same path, staying equidistant from one another almost the entire time, until 2 orbs deviated from the path and went east and west just before ascending into the clouds in the same area as the ones before. there was another pause of about 1 minute, before one last orb, pulsating orange and red, rose from the same place, but seemed to go straight upward, then just before reaching cloud cover, it changed direction immediately and began moving southward. it ascended into the clouds in the same place about 1 mile east and just a little south of us that the others had.\r\nall of the objects had a uniform, pulsating orange and red glow. they did not seem to have any distinguishable craft shape, it was like the lights were the entire object or the entire craft was glowing. they all seemed to have an orb shape with no distinguishable features.\r\nthere was an older british couple sitting behind us that also noticed the orbs from the beginning. the gentleman initially dismissed them as floating lanterns, but didn't mention that theory after the 2nd series of lights had appeared. after they had all disappeared, he looked at his wife and said, \"well, i think we just saw our first ufo's\".\r\ni had seen one of the exact same orbs in the winter of 2012 and had been absolutely befuddled by what i had seen, so i was ecstatic to have had the opportunity to not only see another one, but 15 of them, and also with 3 other people. i filmed the end of both events, although the cell phone video doesn't do the real thing justice (the videos are on my old phone, and i can find them if requested).\r\noverall, i felt, and the 3 other witnesses felt that there was no readily apparent explanation for what we saw. it/they were clearly not a helicopter, airplane, or blimp, which we see plenty of, due to our proximity to the phoenix airport. since the sightings, i've kept my eye on the skies, hoping for a repeat performance, but sadly, there's been nothing. i feel more frustration more than anything, in the sense that i have been unable to find any answers, but i'm grateful i got to see something that has made me ask so many questions.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

were coming back from late night work coming from hinton ab on hwy 16 coming towards edson, ab where it happened about 4 kilometers before town of marlobo heading east.\r\nwhile driving i noticed on the north side of the highway green and red lights\r\nlow with in treeline, it was 1:45 am and it was very dark, the trees are bare no leaves as this is early spring here so i thought it was low flying airplane as they carry the green and red light,\r\ni thought i've seen an airplane flying low on the horizon through the trees.\r\nas i was getting closer i noticed these lights were not moving and they \r\nappeared bigger, it was nothing of significance to us as we thought it was perhaps some sort of tower...\r\nfinally we passed the small grove of trees and were able to have the direct visual on these lights, we've seen red, green, blue / purple light blinking sort of pulsating around quite fast,\r\nthere was also a light at the bottom like a dome light rotating a beam of white/ yellow light illuminating ground and trees.\r\nwe stopped the truck and parked on the shoulder looking at this thing and wondering what are we seeing, we got out of the truck to snap some photos with our cell phones,\r\nthe truck was put on park idling with radio playing - local hinton music radio station, we were in front of that thing with in 400 ft distance as it was just above the trees across the highway\r\nright in front of us, it was very dark and the lights it was projecting were very bright sort of blinding us, we tried to catch this object on the camera but you could not see it in the lcd display.\r\ni snapped 2 pictures without flash to see if i could capture something as i was looking through the pics my friend yelled that the object moved to the right abruptly,\r\ni set up my cell phone on vide record mode and recorded the event, i finally could see the object if i zoomed on it all the way although this object was 300-400 ft in front of us\r\nfairly large maybe 6 cars wide, i could hardly see it on my cell phone cam. i recorded about a minute of video, and we honestly got a bit freaked out , but i wanted to see it move,\r\nso we stayed a bit longer and i noticed that the object drifted slowly to the left, i then thought that maybe that thing is projecting the lights maybe i should use cell cam flash\r\nto signal a couple flashes as a form of communication , i got my phone again i snapped once and nothing happened, but when i sent the next flash that thing suddenly made a high pitch 2 tone sound\r\nlasting for maybe 7 seconds, we got afraid a bit so we jumped back in the truck and decided it was time to go..., what we noticed inside the cab was a static noise of the radio,\r\nwhere we pulled over to investigate the object, we were listening to hinton music station , now there  was nothing but static noise, upon that we realized we just\r\nseen ufo wich interacted with the truck's radio, we took off rather fast leaving that thing behind , it did not attempt to follow us or either left, it just sat there over the trees.\r\nwe were quite disturbed, it was mine and my co-workers first time witnessing ufo event especially that close , we talked about that all the way to edmonton,\r\nwe stopped in edson to have a look at the photos and to our surprise we hardly had any photos on the phones..., i shot 4 pictures in total made  about a minute long video\r\nall i have on my phone is one picture and 8 seconds video, my friend shot over 6 photos, his phone did not record a single photo.\r\nthis by far was the weirdest and most interesting experience i have ever had.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then
