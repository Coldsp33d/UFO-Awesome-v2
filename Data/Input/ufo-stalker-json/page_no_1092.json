not ufo���s in general terms.  in fact when i first viewed them i didn���t think anything was unusual, until my brain rejected the obvious, and focused on the absurd.  i must also first explain that i hail from a family of pilots both private and military, so i am no stranger to all sorts of air-crafts.\r\n\r\nit was a clear beautiful sunny day in august.  i had just left medford oregon and was heading home to rogue river.  i was traveling on the side road that parallels interstate 5.  i was approaching gold hill where my brother lived.  i was alone with no other cars around me.  it was then that i spotted two jet fighters traveling in wingman formation.  so what, i have lived on and around military bases, and to me they are not that exciting any more.  i did wonder why they were there as i didn���t know of any bases in that location.  i then became confused as to why they were traveling so low, slow and soundless.  my windows were open and the radio off, so i should have at least heard them.  it was then that i got the shock of my life.  they had no wings.  \r\n\r\nnow most would tell me that i was looking at choppers on whisper mode, but there were no blades of any kind.  the speed they were moving at was so slow that if i had speeded up i might have been able to pass them.  of course i am now traveling at 15 miles an hour as i can���t believe what i am looking at.  i finally reached my brother���s home but alas it was not there, and i was left to watch them finally disappear in the direction of the pacific ocean.  \r\n\r\ni tell myself that the military was

over great south bay the size n speed puzzled me. the object was heading west but as soon as i used binoculars it began to come towards me. i became slightly nervous and even more curious.Now the light appeared to be a pulsating orb orange yellowish and getting bigger!As my heart rate increased i actually became unnerved and wondered what is it and why is it coming at me.The speed was maybe 45mph? i was dumbfounded\"what the hell is this?\"i ran outside to my front yard and hovering silently overhead was a black triangle the size of yankee stadium with 3 bright beams of light emitting from each corner coming together as one right at me!Silent! the outer rim of craft had rectangular lights blinking on and off like a wheel within a wheel-ezekiel's craft?Mesmerized and frozen in place i watched with and without binoculars and observed a dark grey/black metallic surface with no noticeable plates or rivets. i believe there were silhouetted figures behind window/porthole structures. childlike/kin?Then after hovering silently the craft ascended slowly at first but then accelerated to supersonic speeds,no sonic boom contrail or sounds at all and headed nw. i believe to have some missing time,felt like 8 mins but watch said over 20. the visions and nightmares have been a constant part of my life since. even moved to california although i feel it was overall a positive experience i'm unable to live my life as i had previously.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with

was growing up.  we lived in an extremely rural area with no neighbors for miles.  this incident was during the day and did not frighten or traumatize me.  i was playing on my tire swing and the next memory i have is standing (rather than on my swing) looking directly above the tree and being \"locked\" in eye contact with what i knew was a female through a window.  this window was one of several on a metallic craft.  the sheen of it looked somewhat like stainless steel and was not really reflective.  it made no noise, went from a hover to a very slow glide and then it was gone.  i ran inside and  told my mother that i had seen an airplane that was so low, i could see the people inside the windows.  up to this point in life, my brother and i had only seen airplanes in detail on tv, so when we saw planes in the sky we would try to make out the wings etc.\r\n\r\ni also remember the following episodes in different places when i was young:\r\n\r\nat the above mentioned home, me, my mom, dad and brother were outside at twilight sitting in lawn chairs discussing the silk worms in the tree we were sitting next to.   i remember noticing a twinkling light coming towards us and when i turned to my parents to show it to them they had been \"switched off\" (again).  no further memory.\r\n\r\nalso in the above house i have a memory of waking up to standing outside our house staring up at the sky at colored lights that were going away.  i calmly went back into the house and got into my bed.  kind of odd for a four year old that would not even spend the night at her cousin's house because she had never been outside of arm's reach of her mother.\r\n\r\ni received a small \"l\" shaped scar on my left index finger while someone placed a square shaped \"washer\" against my skin.  no bleeding or pain.  i have no idea where we were living at the time and no memory of the surroundings during this event.  i haven't heard from him in years, but i believe that my brother has a matching scar on the same finger.\r\n\r\ni have a very brief memory of a very tall, blonde man that was accompanied by a female.  i remember it was outside, windy and the entire landscape was sand.  the memory is of him setting me down (on my feet), giving me a \"last look\" and turning around to walk in the same direction as the female.  in about 15 feet they stepped inside what i can only describe as looking like a sand dune.  sand dune as a description came much later in life.  at the time i was too young to verbally identify anything other than the \"people\" and the sand.  i believe that they were both dressed in white as i have always referred to him in my mind as \"that white man\".  i don't know where we were living when this happened, but i think i was toddler age at this time.  for the record, we never lived near the desert or the ocean.  my first time even seeing the ocean was when i was 13.  i have still never been to the desert and i am 44.\r\n\r\nwhen we lived lived in kincaid illinois (again pre-kindergarten) i can remember a toy flying saucer coming into our house and switching everyone \"off\".  this upset me but before i had time to react, the memory ends and begins again with me frantically trying to tell my mom that she and everyone else fell asleep while standing up.  she tried to reassure me, and promised she didn't go to sleep but this only upset me more because i knew she had and this meant it was something she couldn't \"fix\".  \r\n\r\nthere are more, but they are very hard to articulate.","distance":"20 Feet or

name of the main road out of town towards kenosha) when i noticed a long ship, that was a straight line with a bright white light on each end and one in the middle. i didn't think much of it at first, although i did continue looking at it because it didn't resemble a plane in shape (a straight line like a cigar or something) and the lights looked different. i began to really pay attention when i turned off hwy 50 onto the side road that lead to my subdivision (i can't recall the county road but it leads to tuscany-the subdivision i was living in at the time). the craft was originally headed parallel to the highway traveling in the direction towards kenosha and away from lake geneva as i was, but when i turned 90 degrees onto the side road, the craft changed direction 90 degrees as well. i took note because aircraft don't turn 90 degrees like that. the aircraft seemed to follow me change in direction, and to be descending to lower altitudes and getting closer. i remember slowing down to basically a crawl in my vehicle to watch the craft, and as crazy as this may sound, the next thing i remember is coming to standing outside my car, behind the rear bumper, driver's side door was open, no recollection of getting out of the car, and now the large ship i had seen before is gone and there is a much smaller triangle sized ship hovering maybe 20 feet at most over the road and maybe 20 feet away horizontally. it was completely silent, a white light on each corner of the triangle and an orange or yellow light (it's been 16 years-hard to remember everything). i freaked out and jumped in my car and took up as fast as i could. looking back in my rear and side view mirrors, the triangle craft was gone, but the large cigar type crafted i had previously viewed (but that was nowhere in sight while i observed the triangle craft) was on back up in the sky and was again traveling parallel to my car. i make another 90 turn into my subdivision of the side road and the craft did so as well. i made another 90 degree turn off the first road in my subdivision onto the second one (the one on which i lived-sienna circle) and again the craft changed direction with me. i ran into side as fast as i could. upon entering the house, i looked out every window i could in each direction and saw neither ship. i proceeded to write down the entire event and (eventually) fell asleep. the next morning my girlfriend stopped by before school as she typically did and as soon as i woke up i excitedly started to tell her of the previous nights event. she told me to calm down and that i had been dreaming-reminding me i just woke up. i told her i wasn't dreaming it-to look on my dresser where i had written it all down. that was that until maybe 6 months later i was in kenosha at a friends house. he was late returning and i began to worry about him and was looking out his back door towards the main road anxiously awaiting his return. that is when i noticed a small triangle craft (exactly like the one i saw before) hovering maybe 20 feet off the ground, not making a sound, and coming slowly-very slowly-towards the house. it flew across the back yard straight towards me and i called the other woman there who was there to come look and she too saw it in amazement. we watched it for a few minutes as it slowly approached the house, flew over it barely over the rooftop and proceeded across the street. upon being direction above the house across the street, it changed direction 90 degrees and slowly hovered over all the houses on the opposite side of the street until it was out of sight. i kept this mostly to myself for the last 16 years because (a) i have no proof and (b) most people don't believe you or don't care. after seeing report after report and pic after pic of similar triangle ships, i figured i'd go ahead report mine too for whatever it's worth. thanks","distance":"21-100 Feet,
