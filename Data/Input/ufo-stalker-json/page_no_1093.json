States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This occurred more than thirty years ago, but a hanger 1 episode that i watched was similar enough to inspire me to send this.\r\n\r\n  at the time this occurred i and my family lived in a very old farm house (built pre-civil war)directly across from huron county landfill. the house did not have air conditioning, and i had screens in the bedroom windows.    \r\n  my wife at that time (ex-wife now)worked at a fast food place that had late night drive through and she was not home when i experienced the ufo. i have two sons who have been 3 years old and nearly 5 years old at that time.  we had a dog at that time, ruffy, kind of a black lab mix mutt, that was not confined. \r\n  the bedroom i was asleep in was on the first floor. i was awakened by ruffy persistently growling outside close to the bedroom window. eventually, i got up and went outside to see what the heck she was growling at.  we lived on the north side of townline 131, and the landfill was directly across from us on the south side of the road.\r\n  the house only had 1 door, and that was near the back of the house, so when i went outside i would be approaching ruffy's position from behind her.  i remember walking up to her and quietly saying something like \"what you growling at girl?\" i remember getting a tail wag as an acknowledgement, but her focus was still toward the landfill. at this point, we were at the southeast corner of the house.\r\n  i walked on out into the front yard, but ruffy would not come with me.  she remained at the southeast corner of the house. i stared into the landfill for a while, but i didn't hear or see a thing (i can't remember if it was a moonless night, or overcast, but it was pretty dark).  i finally decided she must be growling at a deer or something and turned to go back into the house. it was at that point that i heard the roar.\r\n  i turned back toward the landfill and there right in front of me was an object.  it was dark enough that i could not make out an actual shape, but there were three distinct lights.\r\n  the property (i still own it) has a frontage of about 150 feet.  the two red lights were somewhat farther apart then that, with the white light centered between the red ones but about 50 feet or so higher in the air.\r\n  i would estimate the red lights to be about 80 feet off the ground...Just above treetop level.  i was probably no more then 300 feet away.\r\n  the roar did not continue, and the object just moved away south until i could no longer see it.\r\n  that was all that i saw and experienced. we used to have military planes out of...Perrysburg, i think...That would fly over the area from time to time, and i think i might have chalked up what i saw to one of those if it wasn't for subsequent events.\r\n  the next night, my ex-wife was again working the late shift.  when she arrived home the object was hovering over the area between where our house is and where the landfill office/weigh scale is located. to my knowledge, to this day she won't talk about it.  my youngest son (now 34) said he asked her about it once and she just said \"i don't want to talk about it\".\r\n  the same week, maybe two day later, the youngest son (about 3 and a half years old at the time) was talking about a face looking in their bedroom window. i remember logging it in my mind at the time because of when he mentioned it, and the closeness in time to my and my ex-wife's ufo experiences. \r\n  and now there is more to add.  yesterday (4/26/2014) my youngest son and i were driving to the columbus airport to pick up his older brother who was returning from japan, and i brought up the hanger 1 series and how something i saw on it was eerily similar to what i had experienced, and i wondered if he remembered...\r\n  at that point he interrupted me and said \"the face in the window! i sure do, it's as clear in my mind as if it was yesterday.\" he then went on to describe what he saw.  he said it was brown and looked like a mummy face...Like a mummy looks like when you remove the coverings.\r\n  as we drove and talked, we both wondered if wayne (his older brother) had ever experienced anything. after we picked him up at the airport and were on our way back, we related to him what we had been discussing.\r\n  wayne too had had an 'event' that was clear in his mind.  he said that he just thought it was a very vivid dream...But he swears there was a time that he thought there was something in their room (an apelike creature), and that it took craig and went out the window then jumped over the landfill fence.\r\n  again...Maybe just a dream, but i have one more thing to add. when the kids were young they were notorious for not going to sleep when they were supposed to.  they were supposed to be in bed one night, and i was still awake downstairs when i heard footsteps upstairs. i remember thinking to myself \"are those dang kids still up?\". so i quietly went up the stairs so i could catch them and give them heck.  when i got upstairs they were sound asleep in their beds. my grandmother said it was probably squirrels, but darn it, i know what squirrels sound like when they are in a house and what i heard was. not. squirrels. i also cannot recall when this occurred in relation to the other events that i've put down. i don't know if it was before or after. i don't think it was too close to the same time because i didn't associate it with the ufo, and it was only wayne telling me about his \"vivid memory\" that made me wonder.\r\n\r\n   that's pretty much it.  i don't think there is much of anything to investigate.  the house burned down some years back, and i rent the property out now to a guy who has a trailer on it.  the landfill is still there, but operates as a transfer station now.\r\n\r\n   i see the next question on this form is number of witnesses.  i am going to just put 1, because i was by myself when i experienced it. but did it subsequently become 2 or 3 or 4? i don't know and i probably never will.","distance":"101-500

our (my) lives changed. prior to that date, i was a die-hard skeptic, i will admit. however, this isn't about all of that. it's about this 1 event.\r\n\r\ndue to strange happenings, we installed outdoor night vision surveillance cameras. one points south, down middle of our horse barn. other points north, toward the street. i haven't paid much attention to the monitor screen which sits in our kitchen when friday, april 18, after putting my daughter to bed, i walked past the camera monitor & something caught my eye. i stopped to look and first saw a large, white \"thing\"- hovering above the ground in our yard. sort of like a flag pole with a flag but upside down. first i thought maybe a trash bag was blowing around. then i realized the wind isn't blowing hard enough for that to occur plus it was hovering, blowing around in 1 spot. as i stared it flew up in air, over my horse trailer and down toward ground and out of view. i sat there a minute, trying to digest when i saw a thin light beam bouncing around the horse trailer. it then went above horse trailer, twirled around a bit, then back down. it was moving all around the trailer but only in camera view if that makes sense. suddenly, 2 perfectly round white lights came into camera view in sky above trailer. one was just above the other. then, they parted ways, each going in a different direction (east and west). they came back together and danced around a bit. i could clearly see that the beam was coming from 1 of those lights. the beam, by the way, wasn't solid. it was solid then skipped some space then solid- so forth. it was perfectly straight, like a pole yet had some dead space here and there. i quickly took out my cell phone and began to video the monitor. then i stopped taking video to go outside and see what it was. there was nothing there! i ran back inside and it was still visible on monitor. i record again. i go back outside- nothing there. i go back in and it's gone.\r\n\r\nthis may sound like nothing to you, but with all i've been through & experienced lately, it was extremely upsetting to me. i filed a report with the national ufo reporting center in wa. that guy was extremely rude and inappropriate. i know what i'm seeing, feeling, hearing, sensing, dreaming & catching on video & photo. i see it, hear it, feel it, & to be honest, communicate with it. i am a contributing member of society. i work hard every day. i'm raising 3 children and am a good mom. we own 2 homes and i run 2 businesses- 1 being a nonprofit. i'm college educated. the way i was treated by the national center is absolutely ridiculous. i have a heck of a story over the past few months. thank goodness i have the photos and video to prove it. i used to think people involved in this stuff had to be weird. i guess the jokes on me. that's ok though. i am on a mission to figure all this out- to get answers. i'm not looking for attention by any means. i have plenty already. more than i want to put it blunt. i just want to understand what's going on without my or my family name being plastered everywhere. \r\n\r\ni apologize for going off on a tangent. it's been tough. we've been frightened and frustrated and tired of getting the runaround because no one wants to think what i have is real. i welcome any professional to test our photos or video. i can assure you it hasn't been tampered with.

outside so the sky was still light clear blue and all you could see is the blue sky. i felt this strange sensation of looking up into the sky and in the meantime i observed this really bright object that seemed very out of place since im very familiar with the sky and star location it seemed a bit odd but as i was about to come in i noticed a lot of little small like flashing orbs ejecting or coming in to close range of that brighter object, so i if that was not strange enough lots of more orbs coming in from the se direction started coming in to close range of this much bigger object.\r\nso of course ran in grabbed my binoculars and camera trying to see what was this strange object ejecting little like bright orbs that were fling in all sorts of direction with no path, some stopping and hovering and some cont. in a path but dimming the lights and some turning off completely so this was weird since i know of no aircraft to do such thing never the less moving very oddly stopping making sharp turns and like if waiting for a sigh from some other object. i really got scared when i started taking pictures this intelligent objects moved in for a closer look especially the big bright one and dimming its lights while it came in for closer observation of what it might be. i since that night have felt as if i'm being watched or observer or could just be plain paranoia i cant explain it. on 4-23-14 at around 4:15 4:30am i looked outside my bedroom window and to my right and there was a cigar shaped object just in mid air i say like about 10-15 feet off the ground, then my husband had got up to use the restroom and in coming back into the room he turns on light and the cigar shaped object disappears without noise. \r\nthe next day i went out about the same time i have noticed this objects\r\nand the same thing happens little bright orbs coming out of underneath this big bright like object and going in different path or directions and some hovering. \r\nit was until this morning about like 3:30 4:am i started having the same sensation that something was like hovering up close by my house and sure enough take a look out the living room window and this big bight object since i turned the lights off to go to bed started decending form the sky like a leaf falling to ground and dimming its lights as it did this, so i quickly run and turn the lights on this object starting going back up but still with the light dimmed. i also observed another object a lot higher than the brighter one side with this object i feel like its one craft object but transparent to a point to look like a star and confuse the public but as i said its very weird its been like 2 weeks and this intelligent objects moving in odd and stopping and hovering for long periods of time are cont. to appear. \r\n\r\nall i want is for someone with the experience in this area to please have someone come out and take a look at this very highly active area of unknown flying objects that are scaring me. as for my family thinks im going in sane. im sending what i have captured but would like to remain anonymous please.

our home in queen creek. we were on our way to flagstaff and sedona talking about all the things to do. something had caught my eye at my 1 o'clock, when i looked up i saw a giant x with one large white dome looking light coming from the center and small red lights going down each part of the four wings. it was less than 300 feet from is and moving very slow, maybe 10mph. i yelled wtf is that!!! and started slowing the car, it was massive in size, about 100 yards from corner to corner, enough to block out light. we watched for about 3-4 minutes before it accelerated, turned vertical and split into 4 different pieces that took a linear formation in the sky. when we got on the 60 west freeway, we saw another hovering above a residential area parallel to the freeway, cars were pulled over observing it, i was going about 30 mph an hour in the fast lane while my daughter was trying to get a picture. the craft accelerated fast and disappeared in seconds heading the south east direction. lastly, miles later, we observed another fly above us. still low an altitude, moving very quickly back towards the direction of the last one. all 3 were identical, all x shaped and clearly visible.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path then

on the 23/24 april 2014 we had clear and crisp conditions and the milky way was as clear as it can be in a suburban area in johannesburg, south africa. at around 21h00 i observed an object appear very suddenly (almost as if ejected)from the general area of the belt of orion (orion being more or less directly above). it's triangular / v shape was apparent only due to the thin v-shaped whisps of cloud engulfing it's \"flanks\". the \"inside borders\" of the clouds were straight and clearly defined. the \"craft\" appeared to be quite low and sped directly across the sky, disappearing behind the tree line in my garden in a northerly direction. it's altitude, speed and direction were constant. there was absolutely no sound. we often see odd \"behaviour\" at night, but this particular sighting had me in a state. my mom was walking the dog and i know she saw it too. she was initially very distressed and now refuses to discuss it. i went outside again an hour or so later and looked up to see the exact same occurence, as if the \"video\" had been looped. within seconds thereafter, a solid triangular  craft with light blue lights on each corner appeared from the same area and followed the same flight path. this craft was very different to the first 2. it was very clearly defined and obviously solid, flew at a much higher altitude and seemed to be somewhat faster than the first lot.I have seen this craft before on a cloudy night (about 2 months ago). two things i feel are noteworthy: - 1. after each of the 3 craft flew over, an aeroplane happened to fly over and 2. a dark helicopter with searchlights circled the sky above.\r\nin closing, i have thus far never bothered posting any of the numerous sightings i've experienced, but i feel it is high time we south africans start talking about and sharing these experiences. i am convinced that reporting such events will greatly contribute towards a growing movement of consciousness and awakening!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

came two jets , that's when the object was gone, my sister said the object went straight up , i didn't see it disappear , i was watching the jets , then my mom called the air force base to see what it was , and they said we never called and they didn't no anything about it !! i never talked about it cause i thought it was a dream till one day we were talking about dreams we had and i told my dream that was not a dream i guess , i remember it as it was yesterday in the air ,our stories differ , like my sister said the piper cub came second the jets were first , that don't seem rt , but who knows

back down and lit up a cigarette, then i looked to the northwest and there it was, i was like wow what in the heck is that! note there was no one around all were sleeping, just hear the wind and flash
