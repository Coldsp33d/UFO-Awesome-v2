rapidly. it was still quite bright and then it simply faded out. i found it strange that it was totally silent and had a pinkish glow to it. very interesting! it didn't appear to be anything like the

the battle, we laid in the tent and went to sleep.  before that, we saw two parallel \"stars,\"the two brightest lights in the night sky.  they moved up, then down, then up, then down again, and never appeared again. then, we went to sleep. around one am, something woke me up. it wasn't a noise though. usually secadas are buzzing like crazy, but now they stopped. i looked at my watch and it was one am.  it seemed liked 20 seconds, but it was hours that passed according to my watch. the craft was orange, with three dark lights in the shape of a triangle, but the lights themselves were circular. around the lights emitted a rainbow colored translucent light.  it was bigger than almost anything i've ever seen. it was much higher than the tree tops, but lower than a plane.  then, it stopped hovering and moved  north, stopped in midair and went south. in less than a second it hit the horizon and was gone. i don't know why i didn't immediately report it; maybe i was scared; i don't know. what i know is that i do want peace on the topic, clearance of mind. i also regret not writing down what i saw right away, but i remember it better than yesterday. i also woke one of my friends, and he saw it too. i said we should just go to sleep and discuss it in the morning. neither of us mentioned it that night. the next day, i asked him what he saw, and he described it to the mark, i couldn't have just dreamed it up. now, years later, i decided to come forward with my story. what i saw that night was beyond our technology, or at least the technology that the government lets us know about. i feel privileged to have seen what i did, but scared at what it may have been. i need answers, one way or another.\r\n

now!\" i jumped up and we both witnessed the object for about 5-10 more seconds. girlfriend saw it for 4-5 more seconds than me.\r\n\r\nthe object had no lights, made no sound, but caught your eye because it was much darker than the night sky, a dark grey/black, huge, and bizarre looking! giant curving appendages protruding from a cylindrical/rectangular center space. each appendage had a distinct orb/sphere/fist on it's end. the orb's diameter was about twice the width of the appendage.\r\n\r\n  it was large, low, and close. less than a few blocks away it seemed flying directly down college/287-south. i'd say no more than 500-feet high? hard for me to judge.\r\n\r\nwhen i first noticed it i had no idea what the object was. as the details of it's shape took focus i immediately felt chills down my spine and goosebumps all over because it just looked unnatural. my brain was in shock. i still have no idea what it was but we have taken to referring to it as the \"giant flying octopus\"\r\n\r\nit did not stray in altitude up or down. it did not change it's path or speed in the slightest. that was part of how strange it was. it just hovered moving very quickly in a southern direction. the appendages definitely moved. \r\n\r\nwe were both moved to a very intense state of awareness, something very primal feeling. we were scared. we had just seen something that we had no words for. no objects that came close to being a comparison in our heads were available. you feel vulnerable, curious, intensely awake/aware. it's a strange feeling to see something that your brain says, \"that isn't supposed to exist\" in response to.\r\n\r\nimmediately after seeing it and initially oohh'ing and ahh'ing we went inside, tore two pieces of paper out of her notebook and drew what we saw on opposite sides of the room to compare what we think we saw.\r\n\r\nwe lost sight of the object as it went past the wall of our porch/apartment.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

below the normal cloud line about where a helicopter would typically fly. i tried to dismiss it as an incoming plane since i live within a couple miles of oia. but you could definitely tell that it was no plane or any earthen aircraft. then it began to move. not like any flying object i have ever seen move before. it was as if it could distort gravity around it and move in any direction it wanted. not just up, down, left, right, side to side, horizontal, but directions i can't even describe. it changed in elevation just as rapidly, every move was in an instant. it moved like it was an object suspended in a glass of water and someone was swirling the water around in a circular motion. it's 5:49am now and it's gone.  i didn't see it leave. but now the moon is out right where the aircraft was and it was not there a few minutes ago. \r\nafter i noticed the way it moved, as if it was just observing everything, i had an overwhelming sense of being watched or stared at. it did even come closer towards my direction. i really wouldn't have given it much thought or even reported this sighting had i not seen it once before, and i believe even another time before that. i don't know what it is, if it's a government drone or an extra terrestrial aircraft... i just can't say. but it sure does give me the creeps. i had to watch it from inside once i noticed it getting closer. i'd really like to know if anyone else in my area has seen the same thing or if it has been reported elsewhere. whatever it is, it was definitely intelligent, and very technologically advanced to fly in such a fashion. i await it's return.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":55782,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.5449255,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04262014-0003","longitude":-81.3693865,"occurred":1398513600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1398517311000,"summary":"Re-occuring ufo sighting, oject looks like it's observing the area","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"32806","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Orlando, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:169768"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Coshocton","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"While traveling westbound on st rt 36 coming into coshocton in september 2008, my wife and i were riding our motorcycles home. it was a beautiful fall day and as i rounded a gentle curve surrounded by a hill i noticed 3 identically shaped clouds in the sky. i thought that was really neat as they were also in a perfect triangle formation and stationary. i looked to see if they possibly came from a local power plant stack located to the south of the clouds so i could judge if the wind pushed them north and found nothing emitting from their stack but steam that quickly dissipated. the little wisp of wind there was came from the west i noticed also while observing the steam. when i looked back to the area above the trees on the horizon of the hill.. the clouds were gone! from the angle i was at these 3 clouds were each the size of a cantaloupe at arms length, so for them to just disappear with no trace in just a few seconds was unexplainable. i was stopped at a traffic light a half mile from the point where i saw them and there was not a cloud in the sky anywhere. i felt almost shaky and was glad that we caught the red light so i could take a few seconds to reclaim myself. i found myself looking in the sky trying to find them again with no luck. i spent the rest of our 40 mile trip home looking into the sky and never saw another cloud in any direction of the sky the rest of the trip. when we got home i asked my wife if she noticed anything odd in coshocton and explained what and where i saw this and she was concentrating on maintaining her lane and saw nothing. i have only told a few people of this and thought this forum might be a place to offer what i experienced.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I am only doing this to find out if anyone has ever had a similar experience. i still believe it was a dream most likely but i will say this, it was the most real dream i have ever had in my entire life.  to the point i still struggle with the question of was it a dream or not.\r\n\r\nit was a warm spring night.  it was between  12.30 am and 1:30am i was waiting for a call from a friend i met online.  i was in fact bored and tired of waiting so i laid straight back on my bed.  legs over the side because i wanted to be able to hop right up and get the call.  \r\n\r\nnext thing i remember was my window rattling which startled me but i sat right up.  it's like i knew because in my head i heard come to the door, you will not be harmed.   the funny part is i can control my dreams and if it happened in a dream i wouldn't go to that door without a bazooka.  but i did go, willingly.  i remember getting up, walking out my door and down the hallway to the dining room where i turned to face the dining room door that leads to the deck.\r\n\r\nat this point i heard in my head, come to the door.  i felt very apprehensive here and hesitated so the voice said come to the door you won't be harmed.  so i walked to the door.  at this point i heard unlock the door.  well i hesitated and looked to my left a bit and up just a little.  i'm 4 ft 10 and disabled.  i'd put this creature at 5ft.  anyway, i saw something looking at me.  with your typical large black eyes that seem to be able to somehow penetrate you.  i looked back to the door and heard unlock the door, you won't be harmed again.  i reached for the lock but stopped and said fine but i remember everything.  you don't take my memories, you let me remember.  i didn't hear a no or yes, just come out but i felt like he understood me.    so i unlocked the door and went out.  \r\n\r\nonce out, we started across the deck but 3 feet and i stopped and looked at the being.  it was about 5 ft, large black eyes with large head, skinny body but he thing that struck me at the time was the  grayish white body.  it wasn't the typical gray i'd always read about.  anyway, i asked if i could touch him.  so he held out his arm, very thin.  my bones are thin and his arm may have been more thin than even mine.  i also noted it had arm hair like us but that unlike human hair that is soft and lays flat, it had very stiff hair that stood straight up.  it's skin was smooth but sort of bumpy, like a lizards might feel like?  it didn't look like a lizard though.   it had feet, legs, arms and hands.  i think it had only 4 fingers but i don't remember.  \r\n\r\nso we started walking again, this time it rested his hand on my arm but i felt like it was more to assert more control.  maybe to avoid more delays who knows.  we walked to the end od the deck ramp then down a grassy slope off to the right.  at the bottom i looked up and saw the outline of a very dark craft that i only aw because the moon which was mostly behind clouds barely lit up an outline of the craft.  it was not the typical triangle i'd read about either.  it had 3 lights.  one toward each side and one in the center.  i only remember the one in the center which was blue, pulsating a bit.  a blue beam, a crystalline clear blue beam came down about 3 ft around.  i noted that it didn't glow or radiate light outward like well, any normal light might.  instead it seemed to cut through the night.  i heard a voice say step in the center.  i did and then heard just as i was thinking how cool the light was, don't touch the light and keep your hands at your sides.\r\n\r\nthen i went up.  it got fuzzy there quick.  i remember turning to see the same being standing to the left of a chair and behind him a screen.  i saw my home, then in a flash, the earth.  i then looked to my right and saw to the far right, the wall which looked like a liquid silvery material, essentially melt away from right to left, revealing an examination room.  trust me i've been in a ton of hospitals i know what they look like.  from there i started walking toward it not remotely afraid.  i've been experimented on my whole life by human doctors lol i really didn't care.   the next thing i know i was waking up in my bed, laying flat, covers over me and it was 3.30 am.\r\n\r\ni'm certain it was a dream but some nagging question like why do i remember this dream so clearly.  why do i remember walking barefoot down the hall and outside.  more odd why was that literally the only dream i have ever had where i could even see my feet or feel my legs and why do i remember using my cane when in my entire life, i have never had a dream where i used a cane, ever.","distance":"21-100

in the wooded country like area. we were out side for a few hours and about to retire for the night when i asked him to stay outside with me for just a few more minutes. we were south facing, but looking south west when we heard this roaring \"swwwoooshh\" coming from the south east. at first it just appeared to be the biggest meteor we've ever seen. it illuminated our entire house enough to cast shadows on the ground!. it was as if someone turned a spot light on us! it seemed to be closer to us rather than the other meteors that we had been watching fly by in the outer atmosphere. this \"meteor\" and its tail took up the entire sky from east to west and it was extremely loud and startling and felt like it was \"right over our heads!'. an ultra violet tube like beam came out of the tip of the meteor going straight \"up\" and to the \"right\" making what appeared to be a perfect right angle (an upside down \"l\" shape). as this beam shot up and out of the meteor making this right angle it then began to make what looked like 3 explosions (no sound)  of light, the first being white/ultra violet, then light pink, then lavender and it was gone. it looked like it imploded into itself, or as if someone suck it up through a straw until every drop of its illuminating light dissipated. it completely disappeared out of the sky. it lasted probably no longer than 30 seconds, perhaps even 20. we weren't counting. this event that we saw was quick, although it has burned an impression into our minds. like a tiny video playing over and over again. its been a few months now and i still have not come across anything like this in my research. other than one snippet of information i heard recently while listening to a carol romaine podcast with dan willis as her guest. dan quickly mentions being at a conference and meeting an 80 year old woman who described seeing exactly what i saw in her back yard, only she would see these \"things\" repeatedly. dan apparently went to her house and witnessed one of these experiences with her! dan concludes that statement with a chuckle and states \"..But thats a whole other story!\" then moves onto other topics of ufos. i emailed him through facebook, but have not heard back, yet. i am still trying to figure out what that beam of light was and why or how or what made that beautiful tye-dye..Firework-like..Triple explosion of pastel colored lights in the sky above us.  in my opinion, this was much more than just an exploding meteor. to answer question 5: ....At first i was in awe! i've never seen anything like that in my life. after we heard it rushing through the sky, my boyfriend and i were watching it with our jaws on the floor and simultaneously we both let out the same two long drawn out words \" ooooohhhhh sssshhhhiiiiiittttttt!\". those were the only too words we said while watching this happen. when it was \"gone\", the first thought that popped into my head was \"time travelers!\" and we laughed at my silly comment and thought \"dang, i've watched too many scifi movies!\". we were both stunned & amazed & a little bewildered because we didn't know what that was we had seen. over all, it was beautiful, exciting, joyous, peaceful and a lovely experience.  we hope to witness another one! since this experience we have become avid sky watchers. we try to spend at least 1 hour sky gazing every

notice what i thought to be a plane flying directly overhead and thought, 'that plane is really up there' because the brightness of it was not like i'm used to seeing. it just seemed really far away. then i noticed another light in front of it that seemed to be 'leading' it or 'towing' it. i said, 'what the...?' and my husband and best friend looked to see what i was looking at. we watched it for a few minutes, as it headed southeast. it seemed to be traveling in a very purposeful manner, not wavering, not changing direction in any way. it then disappeared - not into the horizon like you would expect a plane to do, but just disappeared as if it were traveling up. there were no sounds, the lights did not blink, they were both solid white - the one behind brighter than the other. i'm pretty sure planes don't tow each other mid-air. and we know what satellites look like and what meteors look like. this was definitely something other than a satellite or meteor. this is my second sighting (the first one was completely different, seeming to be a satellite but abruptly changing direction twice) since we moved into this town home in august 2013. i did not get any video - i doubt it would have shown up with such little light anyway. wondering if we're not the only ones to have seen

just returned from a trip and i had picked them up at the airport there. at the time of the sighting, we were traveling east on nm 380 headed towards carrizozo new mexico with an intended destination of alamogordo new mexico. at approximately 0135-0140 hours, my daughter in law noticed lights in the night sky and mentioned them asking her husband what they were.  i didn't see them initially but was able to after we came around a bend and could see over the terrain.\r\n\r\ni pulled the car over to the side of the road and initially we were watching the lights from inside the car. i took a few pictures and then began making a video on my cell phone. \r\n\r\nthere were 4 lights initially that appeared much closer and much brighter than the stars or any ambient lighting. the lights seemed to descend slowly and also formed in to a triangle shape. \r\n\r\nafter a few minutes of observing these initial lights, a set of 4 more appeared. they were higher in elevation and also decended slowly. after about 4 minutes or so, my phone quit recording. \r\n\r\nthere were aircraft in the area. we saw at least two that were in very close proximity to the lights. one flew \"between\" the two sets of lights, and one flew towards the higher set but then turned abruptly and reversed course. \r\n\r\ni found the sightings pretty intriguing. initially i thought that they may have been aircraft flares but the movement in to triangular shapes negates that thought to a degree. flares that i am familiar with are free falling, parachute suspended, and unguided. \r\n\r\nit was interesting to watch them for as long as we did. eventually we lost sight of them over the horizon/behind a hill on the side of the road, but none the less, very intriguing! \r\n\r\nattached are a few phot's we took along with a video that is about 4 minutes long. the quality is fair for the video, but the photo's are a bit grainy and fuzzy due to my unsteady hands.
