was just 20-30 minutes after the sun had set and as i was sitting on the co driver's seat i noticed a red light not far from (judging by the relative distance as i was seeing the lights of a house behind it). after telling my friend to slow down the car so we could see better, he pointed out that he can't cause other people had already parked on that part of the highway (and there is nothing there like a food stop or toilet). after about 100 meters we stopped and we were the closest witness to the lights about 50-100 meters from us. we were still in the car just before a bridge which was 50-70 meters high and this red light was actually 3, which we noticed after getting closer. we could clearly see them hovering at a very close distance from us and we knew it wasn't anything man-made because the closest power line was on the bridge that we were on and below the \"3 lights\" was nothing but trees.After about 4-5 minutes one of these 3 lights stared flickering with a standard pace until 1 second before it vanished the second one started flickering too and one second before that one vanishing too, the last one started flickering until it disappeared completely, never to be seen again that night. the time between the starting of the flickering until it vanished completely was about a minute. after returning home and telling my brother he told me that two (2) days ago the exact same sighting took place about 20 kilometers from the place i witnessed it and he showed me a video footage of the previous sighting. after watching it i realized it was exactly what i saw !

a ufo?\" they both replied excitedly \"i don't know, we were just talking about that!\" i told them if they had a camera phone to please take a picture of it. the one woman did hold up her phone, i don't know if she was able to photograph it. they both were clueless as to what it was, as was i. mind you, these are strangers so i wasn't about to intrude on their afternoon family outing, as exciting as this was. i mentioned as i walked away for them to please make a mufon report.\r\n\r\ni finished my walk back to my car to see this object descend a little further into the treetops and away out of my sight. i started my car as fast as i could and made my way down the steep hill to the main road (mckean ave) aka the 837. when i reached the street and out of the park the object was no where to be found. i wasn't expecting to see it as it was already 1-2 miles from me way ontop of the hill near the town of monongahela.\r\n\r\ni have no idea what this was. i've never seen anything before it in my life. i can say that i didn't expect to see such a \"boxy\" shape. it definitely appeared to have sharp corner edges to it. not aerodynamic at all. the object for sure changed shape. not into another shape, just got thinner, then big again. the object did not appear to be blowing with the wind. i do not believe this object to have been a balloon, conventional aircraft, blimp, or kite. it was not wobbling. it was solid, steady and appeared to be under intelligent control. i have yet to look into any new missing persons reports in this area. i have not seen any other reports on this sighting yet either. i hope those ladies make their reports and really hoping one got a photo.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:06:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":55751,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.2050365,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04242014-0021","longitude":-79.9198603,"occurred":1398118500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1398396869000,"summary":"3 witnesses to a daylight sighting of a huge black rectangle ufo at treetop level pennsylvania","tags":["ufo","light"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":3,"locationName":"Monongahela, Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:169828"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Hatboro","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On april 4th i was driving at 35 mph on byberry rd in hatboro pa. an odd shape caught my eye. i saw what appeared to be a bird gliding toward me from ahead. it did not flap, was totally still but moving rapidly toward my car along the side of the road, 15 feet up?

it was highly reflective like polished aluminum, not chrome. this went on for roughly 15-20 minutes and suddenly the object vanished right before my eyes. it didn't fly away, it went from sitting there to vanished, in an instant. my first reaction was to stare at where it was last located in complete disbelief. i struggled to comprehend how something could just vanish without a trace of any kind. well, once this happened i immediately jumped to the conclusion that i had seen a ufo. being a small kid in the 1960's, i was always fascinated with science and especially the space program. i had never seen an object or craft like this and haven't seen anything like it since. i have attached a re-creation i illustrated in photoshop to try and give you a better idea of what i witnessed. i am a graphic designer by trade, so i employed my experience with this software;

stick like.\r\ni could see very long fingers on the hands.  it was approx 20ft from a cow that it appeared to be watching.  i wanted a better look and started to move toward the door to get my

walking...Very smooth quick long strides almost gliding with leg & knee movement.  it was greyish brown and blended perfectly with trees.\r\nas i saw it enter the treeline...It paused and looked back over the pasture toward me, i then went to go get my binoculars since i could not see that far very well.  when i got back with them i scanned the treeline where i last saw it and saw it just peeking

short in front of that being was another giant shiny black stone or what reminded me of the monolith from 2001 space odeyssy.(sp)  i remember thinking why am i here? and one of the beings answered ...She doesn't hear/speak to us anymore. she turned to me and said i can with you. note this was said telepathically.  then they put me on the floor with her she showed me the black stone/screen i could see colored lights on it and was finely marked with a grid pattern on it.  she told/asked me about a decision she was about to make that would affect the earth for a very long time.  i cannot remember the decision now, but i remember it was either moral or ethical and had longterm affects for us.  i know i answered in more moral way, but cannot remember exactly.  she then touched/pointed

stopped at the local target store to pick up a prescription. at approximately 8:20 p.M. as i was walking from the vehicle to the store i happen to notice a really bright light low in the eastern sky. my initial thought was why would a commercial airliner be coming in straight from the east and why is it so low. when commercial flights approach from the east the flight pattern is to the south of here and considerably higher. as i watched the light i realized it wasn't an airliner. the entire light was pulsating with no flashing lights and it wasn't getting any closer or further away from me. within approximately 30 seconds of watching the light a second light appeared to the right, south, of the first light. it too was pulsating and didn't appear to be moving. within approximately another 30 seconds a third pulsating light appeared to the left, north, of the first light.\r\n\r\n\r\nkeeping an eye on the lights i went back to my vehicle and got my camera. i have a nikon d5000 dslr with a 70 to 300mm zoom lens. all three lights blinked out one-by-one before i could get the camera ready. i continued to wait and watch and sure enough one of the light's blinked back on again. this light did appear to be moving up and to the right. i was able to take a few photos of the light before it blink out.  i watched for awhile longer and saw no more lights so i put the camera away and went into the store.\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen i came back out of the store there were no more lights in the sky but i got the camera and waited for awhile and sure enough at approximately 8:47 p.M. the light blinked back on again. i tried some different settings on the camera and some of the shutter speeds were to slow and the images blurred. a second light blinked on again to the right, south, of the first light. then the first light blinked out. the second light started moving to the right, south, and i was able to capture a few seconds of video of it as it went behind the store. i had placed the camera on the roof of my vehicle in an attempt to get as clear and steady a video as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen i got home i viewed the photos on my computer and noticed on the photos that were blurred the blurring caused several more lights to appear in the photo that were not visible to my naked eye.\r\n\r\n\r\nthroughout my life i have had several encounters with ufos and unexplained lights but this was the first time i was able to captured photos and video.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

who has worked with the nfl, the lacrosse industry, and a couple of the major wire services for years. i have followed and appreciated your work as well for years. i know my gear, and know what i see. in this case, i never did see with my naked eye an object in the sky  but my camera did. this object occurred and was solid. \r\n\r\ni have unaltered pictures of said object that defy explanation. the object appears mathematically elliptical because it's sideways and has a heat/energy/gravitational field/aura/whatever around it in pictures ten minutes apart. these images prove it is not a lens, bug, light, dust, etc... it is opaque, has highlights, and moves all over the place.\r\n\r\nwhat i know with these images that i am attaching to you is that something that was not a frisbee, bug on my lens or camera sensor, a mouthguard, a bird, a plane, malaysian flight 370 or superman was flying around at exceptionally hight speed(s) and is nothing like i have ever seen or not seen or not seen before.\r\n\r\nwhat my camera saw that i never saw, highly observant as i am, was something solid that was quite far away and moving extremely fast. my guess is over 40.000 mph given that i was shooting at 1/800th of a second coupled with the level to which the object was out of focus.\r\n\r\ni was using a 24mm lens at f7.1. anything within miles would have been sharp/in focus given the physical characteristics of the lens. for something that size to have been visible in my frame and out of focus, it had to have been huge. \r\n\r\ni am baffled. little if anything escapes my attention when i shoot, yet i never saw this. i am a nationally recognized photographer and have credentials. seeing stuff is my job. i never saw this, yet it flew into my frame(s) at least three times.\r\n\r\ni thank you in advance for your thoughts and expertise - my folder of images is attached. notice how far and fast the object moves between frame #4 and #6. it's wild stuff. i'm perplexed and hope you have some ideas as to what was out there. something was.\r\n\r\nthanks, larry french\r\n\r\ncell: 443
