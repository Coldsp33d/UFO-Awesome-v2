starlike object moving from west to east. it was about as high as an airplane would be that is ascending from kci, so it wasn't at such a high altitude that it could be considered a satellite.  it was most definitely lower than that.  i quickly called my mother outside and pointed the object out to her.  there were no discernible flashing lights, and normally, no matter the altitude, we would have been able to hear the engine if it were an airplane, but there was absolutely no noise.  it wasn't a completely straight path.  it seemed to be wobbling around a little bit.  just before it was about to be out of our line of sight, it dimmed out and disappeared.  we saw why - an airplane was in close proximity, coming from the southeast heading northwest, and a minute later crossed the path of where the starlike object would have been.  this is the second time this week i have seen this.  i saw the exact same kind of object fly in a similar direction on monday this week at approximately the same time. i felt a little elated because just before i saw the object on monday i had thought to myself that i needed a clearer sign of what these starlike objects were that i have been seeing and wanted to be positive that my eyes weren't playing tricks on me.  to me, i don't think it could have been any clearer.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":55729,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.25148467874599,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04232014-0025","longitude":-94.93121650093997,"occurred":1398312900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1398318560000,"summary":"Flew

this who might listen, but so far, out of over 200 emails and hand written letters i have had no success. to continue; after i arrived at the base i had been assigned to i was met at the airport by two gentlemen in suites who drove me the base. i was put up in the tdy barracks for what they told me was going to be an overnight stay and there would be a sargent come to pick me up in the mourning. i arrived on a monday night at around 2330, the next mourning the alarm clock went off at 0500, i had not set it. it was wednesday. again, i would love to go into detail but not on an open line. here

west side of michigan around lake lelanau and suttons bay...Took lots of photos with a hand-held, pocket-style, panasonic hd \"point-and-shoot\" collapsible lens...And proceeded to \"color enhance\" my photos using photoshop.\r\n \r\nas i was also adjusting the \"brightness level\"...I noticed something bizarre off in the distance of the lake...And cannot explain just what appears to be either \"coming out of\"...Or \"plunging into\" the water.\r\n \r\ni am stymied...Due to the fact that i didn't see anything with the naked eye when i shot this...As well as the fact that there is something rather \"rectangular\" just out in front of the object...Yet hollow in nature.\r\n \r\ngiven mufon���s experience at deducing \"truly unidentifiable, ergo, a ufo/uso\" versus \"this can be explained\" phenomena ... can anyone shed some light as to what this might be?\r\n \r\ni took numerous other photos with some birds flying...And quite frankly, given the great distance that this one photo in which the object appears to be from shore...Plus the fact that it is not a \"plunging pelican\", a ���crane������.Nor clearly is it any bird ... i am at a loss to explain.\r\n \r\nthere were no local light-weight planes around, no one sky-diving into the waters, no large sailboats cruising��� only occasional motor boats, and, in short, nothing out of the ordinary that one could either reasonably \"hear\" ...Or \"see\" with the naked eye.  \r\n\r\nthe only phenomena the proceeding day were very, very thick clouds and fog that didn't lift until late in the day.. and it was a very humid day.  \r\n\r\naugust 29, 2013 (the day this photo was taken) was mostly ���unremarkable��� from a weather stand-point ���and/or incident standpoint.  i saw nothing with the naked eye during the week i was driving with a friend in michigan when visiting.  \r\n\r\nnobody saw anything out of the ordinary; i only discovered the ���object��� in the picture... in december���when i zoomed in with my

have no rational explanation that would preclude a uso.   i am a former tool designer as well as an artist...And my forte is \"details\"...To a tolerance of \"plus or minus\" .005 inches!\r\n \r\ni would appreciate finding out if anyone in michigan has seen anything like this���either with their eyes as it happened���or���on a photo viewed after-the-fact (similar to my photo and to the phenomenon in britain where the little gal on the hill had some ���alien figure��� behind her on one of three exposures ���but not the other two when the ���film��� was developed).  \r\n \r\ni have included the \"original\" digital snapshot...As well as two more \"color enhanced jpeg's with arrows\" that were photoshop'd...Noting the very darkest one still doesn't give me a clue...But does give

shower on monday night. we were feeling mildly bored as this was not the peak hour to watch, but we were had to get to bed soon. \r\n     the objects moved very rapidly across the sky from west to east in the span of less than 20 seconds. they were just south of the big dipper, which was to our left in our field of view. they appeared into view almost straight up and continued until going out of sight behind the trees. \r\n     the objects were both almost exactly identical. i can remember them looking roughly like upside-down triangles(flat side leading with point as tail) with blue glow, but my wife insists she saw them as more pentagon shaped with orange-ish overall glow. they stayed very close with one following the other, but the one following had to make a small correction to keep in formation. they made no sound. \r\n     we both had time to question each other what we were seeing and noticed that if they were planes at that altitude, they surely would have been making some kind of sound, as we are accustomed to planes overhead due to the airport just outside town. we only felt mildly stunned and excited at witnessing something unexplainable, and the objects showed no obvious interest in us.\r\n     if these things were the size of known aircraft, they could not have been very high in the air and should have made some kind of sound. they moved much more quickly than any aircraft we know of as they covered the entire half of sky in less than 15 seconds.

developing sub-division. looking up has always fascinated me and still does so. what i saw was about 500 ft. overhead, not a sound. what caught my eye was the colors going in a circle from red to blue to yellow, i can not be sure if a white light was in the colors or not. it moved very very slowly in a straight direction.\r\n\r\nthere is another oddity i saw in the late night skies while living in mackville ky during the time that pres. bush shut down all air traffic due t0 the 911 attacks. first you need to understand that the skies above me was a jetline highway heading to either the louisville intl. airport or the lexington airport. there wasn't a night that there wasn't a line of jets overhead. this particular night i was taking a leak off the front pourch a saw a trio of lights in a triangle pattern moving slowly in the distance. what i didn't observe was any blinking or flashing lights that is assoiated with aircraft. suddenly the foremost point of light moved ahead of the other two lights about approx. 200 or so feet or 5-10 secs. then either it had slowed or the other two sped up to reaquire the triangle formation i first saw. now you can take this with a grain of
