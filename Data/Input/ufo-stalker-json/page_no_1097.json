recruit mess at the naval training center in san diego, ca along with approximately one thousand other recruits in the regiment one january morning in 1972. we were waiting for the doors to open for breakfast. the way we lined up we faced san diego bay. we could not see the bay from where we stood, but it was somewhere in front of us, th view blocked by military buildings and other natural obstructions.\r\n\r\nas a recruit petty officer 1st class (rpo1)i was maintaining the 2nd platoon of my company, which was standing at-ease in formation; chilly twenty-something not-quite-sailors hungry and waking up for another day of routine marching, barracks inspections and calisthenics. while at-ease, there is no talking but sailors in ranks are free to move one leg around as long as the other leg remains in formation.\r\n\r\nas i surveyed my platoon i heard one of my fellow recruits (name withheld) mumbling something about the man in the moon. i admonished him about not talking in ranks, but he continued to mumble. i admonished him again and he spoke out loud, \"there's no man in the moon.\"\r\n\r\nthinking he was trying to be funny i walked up to face him and to warn him one last time about not talking while in ranks, but he was insistent about there being \"no man in the moon!\"\r\n\r\nby this time other recruits were starting to focus their attention on the conversation going on between us when i decided to humor him by looking up at the moon as i thought of something clever and threatening to say to him. that is when i realized that he was, in fact, correct. there appeared to be a full moon, but there was no moonlike definition. instead, the moon's surface seemed to shimmer with a sort of glowing iridescence that seemed to radiate from it in a bluish-white, slow undulation that was rather beautiful to observe. the \"full moon\" was almost overhead; possibly at an 80 to 88 degrees angle up from the horizon.\r\n\r\nupon seeing what he was seeing i remarked, \"you're right. there is no man in the moon.\"\r\n\r\nalmost as if on cue what we thought was a full moon suddenly seemed to rotate in a way which now showed it to be some type of saucer shaped object. when it rotated on what could only be described as it's x-axis it took on the shape of a cigar, but it did not stop there. it continued to rotate along that x-axis a few times before it began moving in somnabulistic fashion in various patterns in the sky. it made a few rather abrupt forward movements to the north and even performed a sharp right angle turn in mid flight without slowing down. some of its maneuvers reminded me of lissajous patterns one might display on an oscilloscope, except what we saw was a physical object in the sky and not an electrically generated beam of electrons projected by a cathode ray tube.\r\n\r\nthis incredible aeronautic display went on for a few minutes. you can guess that it caused quite a stir through the ranks. by any example we all had fallen out of formation and standing at-ease gave way to chaos. suddenly, the object seemed to move many miles out to sea past san diego bay in the blink of an eye. i cannot say how far it movd, but it had to be at least 10 to 20 miles at least. it stopped and hovered momentarily and then seemed to dim out into nothing, but i believe this is just how it was perceived from our vantage point. i believe it moved away from us so rapidly that it looked like it dimmed and went out, but it actually flew away from us at an incredible speed.\r\n\r\nwithin seconds after the object disappeared our company commanders and the regiment commanderers showed up and restored order. i forgot to mention that just prior to the ufo incident they mustered to a meeting which left me and the other recruit petty officers in charge of the platoons.\r\n\r\nquickly reminding us that we were out of ranks and while threatening to impose maximum disciplinary tactics upon us if we did not compose ourselves, the officers ordered us to explain why we were out of ranks.\r\n\r\neach company commander, upon hearing from their platoon leaders what caused the ruckus, proceeded to order us to not repeat what we saw to anyone at any time under penalty of courts martial, and they were very serious.\r\n\r\ni still do not know if what we saw was extraterrestrial or if it was something human-made, but whatever it was it was the most incredible, beautiful and aerodynamically adept flying object i have ever seen. i hate to use this adjective, because it is overused, but what we witnessed was awesome.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

southwest i could see the cacti and sage brush that were common polace to that region i also noticed some other types of flora that looked like a type of yucca plant there was also a mib there along with a little girl that was about 3 or 4 yrs old all of  sudden 4 columns that looked like they were made of steel came out of the ground id say the height of these columns were about 15 ft or so next there was this rectangular ship that came out of the sky and made a piin point landing on the columns thats when the mib started taking measurements looked like he had a tape measure like contractors

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Let me begin by saying i am an avid amateur astronomer. i am college educated. i have been \"watching the skies\" for over 30 years, and have never seen anything i could call a ufo. i have a very solid understanding of the motion of the moon, planets and stars, or should i say, our view of the night sky as the earth rotates and our view into space changes. i have seen countless satellites, and understand that regardless of their altitude above the earth, when we can see them they are \"high\" enough that they are simply reflecting the sun's light, making them visible to our location on the planet. i know that when directly overhead they will appear to move in straight lines and that if they remain visible long enough, they can sometimes appear to slowly \"bend\" their flight path, and that this is simply what we see as they orbit the earth. a true satellite will never make any noise (how and why would it?) and will simply appear to be an un-blinking, moving \"star\". i can very easily tell the difference between an airplane, helicopter or satellite. from our location on the far western suburbs of st.Louis, we often see (and hear, as they rapidly decrease speed and lower altitude} airplanes as they line up to land at lambert int'l airport. flights headed out of lambert headed to points west are also easily recognizable as they have not yet reached cruising altitude. of course we also see many flights flying at much higher altitudes as they criss-cross the country. the random helicopter in the area is always accompanied by the tell-tale noise of that type of craft. every commercial plane and helicopter i have ever seen at night has either had blinking lights and/or emitted sound. i have very detailed knowledge of military aircraft and during the day, if flying at a low enough altitude, can easily tell the exact type of nearly anything flying overhead. all that being said, i am by no means any type of \"expert\" and understand that occasionally there's going to be something overhead that will make me scratch my head. so on to this morning's events and why i felt compelled to share my story; at just after 03:30 i stepped outside to get a glimpse of the lyrid meteor shower. this morning was the peak of this annual april meteor shower, and even though the waning moon and my general location did little to help my viewing, i never miss a meteor shower when my schedule allows it. the radiant of this meteor shower appears to originate from the constellation lyra(hence the name lyrid meteor shower) and is easily found by the bright star vega this time of year. vega and the rest of lyra rise in the northeast around 22:00 (10p.M.) so by the time i was outside at just after 03:30 the constellation is nearly directly overhead. i planned on watching for about an hour, and as i just mentioned the radiant of the shower is nearly directly overhead, so to be as comfortable as possible i grabbed a sleeping bag and a few pillows and laid on top of our pop-up camper, parked in our driveway. i had been watching the shower for around 20 minutes (sure of the time because i had just glanced at my cell phone to note how long i had been viewing the shower) this meteor shower was very uneventful. i had only witnessed 2 or 3 very faint meteors in the time i had been watching, but continued to watch in the small hopes i might see a burst in activity or perhaps a fireball meteor. very small chance at any of that happening, but over the years i've learned to be patient and occasionally, you're rewarded with a nice surprise. very shortly after checking the time, i witnessed what appeared to be a satellite moving from the northeast to the southwest. my eyes were adjusted to the dark by now and i very quickly picked up the object and immediately identified it. i thought \"hmm, well at least there's something to watch\" and began to track it. there were no clouds, and besides the light pollution from the moon and my surroundings on the edge of a major metropolitan area (both sources predominantly coming from the east) my view of the \"satellite\" and its course were clear. just after breaking 90 degrees (directly overhead) the object made a very abrupt turn to the east for 2 or 3 degrees, then continued on a now due-south course. my thinking now changed from \"ho-hum, a satellite\" to \"what the hell did i just see?!\" i was amazed. i have never seen what was clearly an object in space make such a maneuver! (side note-no sound at all- what you would expect from a satellite) the object now continued on its due-south track for a few more degrees across the sky as my mind raced wildly trying to come up with a rational explanation. little did i know things were about to get very, very strange. at this time i feel the need to preface the rest of what happened by telling you i have 20/20 vision and i was not under the influence of any drugs or alcohol. seriously. now the object comes to a complete stop and another, fainter object seems to emerge from it, very rapidly circling the first object. then both objects disappear and then re-emerge close to their original spot, yet clearly in a new position. remember there are no clouds, and these objects are still quite high in the sky, very far from the horizon. i know how clouds and/or trees can make an object appear to \"dance\" or \"disappear\" and \"re-appear\". please remember i've been watching the skies for astronomical reasons for a long time. it gets even stranger and i actually begin to get frightened. i continue to watch, even saw a bright meteor or two in my field of view, but never took my eyes off the \"dancing satellites.\" now an odd, thin cloud-like mist appears around the objects and i start thinking seriously about heading inside. my mind still racing for a logical explanation. i found the best wording for the mist in describing the event on your site: aura. this weird, aura, cloud-like mist is surrounding these objects as they disappear, re-appear, revolve around one another and dance wildly in the sky, yet only moving a degree or so in the sky. no clouds anywhere in view. no logical explanation. flying. unidentied. objects. by the very definition-ufo's. as my heart races and i become seriously concerned, (seriously? i'm an educated, life-long sky watcher that can identify 90 percent of every star in the sky and i'm afraid? what the hell is going on???!!!) the brighter object appears to absorb the fainter object and both disappear and then bam! the aura-mist disappears and i wonder if my wife has poisoned dinner and it's just now taking effect. i try to watch to see if anything else super-strange happens or if the music from close encounters might start up, but decide to call it a night. i tried to grasp what i had just witnessed, my mind and heart having a race to see who is quicker, came inside, googling like a mad man to see if anyone else had seen the same thing (twitter? facebook? anyone???) and decided, for the first time, i had witnessed something truly unexplainable. period. i have no proof. nothing. just my story. please let me know if i saw swamp gas reflecting the light from not yet risen venus or a high-altitude weather balloon.

lights in a triangle pattern. it was totally silent and seemed to flow smoothly through the sky. at first it looked like it had a solid black triangle base (i think there were 7 lights but i'm not

things.When i entered my backyard to get inside an orange orb came up from behind the trees.\r\n\r\n(ascended from 10ft off the ground to 30 ft in air. around 50 ft away flying out from behind the trees like it was waiting.)\r\n\r\nits gaining altitude. moving in an aerial manner, almost arch-like, at me. the first several seconds i look at it, its amazing, immediately knowing this was unlike anything i had ever seen before. then i realize its gaining speed and descending straight towards my direction. i became extremely panicked and bolted inside at a \"run for your life\" speed.\r\n\r\nupon entering my home my family was playing around with each other,obviously oblivious to was i had just experienced. but i felt so shaken up i just tried to say nothing and alarm no one. because i felt as though if anyone looked out with curiosity something very bad was going to happen. after about 10 minutes inside i'm telling myself \"its gone\" why would it stick around. i felt like the orb had left and enough time went by that an object moving at that speed would be at least several miles away by now. \r\n\r\n(roughly 15 minutes later)\r\n\r\nme and my girlfriend at the time, went downstairs to my room. i couldn't handle not telling her so i did. she without a second thought ran over to the window. im talking her away from it. \"babe please! come on its gone, exc.\" but she was already looking out the window.\r\ni stood on the far side of the room saying \"katie? katie, whats up?\" i walk over and peered out behind her shoulder and there it was the orb. hovering on the other side of the lake, 400 ft or less. almost the instant it saw me it shot towards me at a speed i have never seen.\r\n\r\ni have no memories after that besides a mental snapshot of jumping or something into my bathroom with both feet in the air as though i was literally jumping away from the orb.\r\nthen me and her wake up the next day as though nothing had ever happened.\r\n\r\nover the next month or so i would steadily regain memory of that event, although that block of missing time remains just that, and i have no memory of anything after it shooting towards me.\r\n\r\n(it was at a completely different direction than where it was originally. i originally saw it east, moving west, towards my position. now it was 500 or so ft. south, moving north, towards my position.)\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile,

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"The night was april 14th 2014 and it was the first blood moon of the blood moon tetrads. i was aware the eclipse would be at 10:53 pm so went outside with my telescope and ipad and iphone. went out to my balcony where normally i look out west for a good ocean view. that day the moon was over my house south and up in the sky about 60 degrees above the horizon. made about 15 videos within first hour of watching. realizing the actual eclipse was not at the time i thought it would be i ended up watching and making much more videos than i thought i would.  the video with the footage i captured was 2 minutes and 22 seconds long and had the brightest glows coming from left and right side of blood moon. i also filmed simultaneously an iphone video next to ipad with not capturing the ufo. the evidence is best captured by the ipad. i found that immediately before eclipse by slowing down the video and listening, there is a specific noise that resembles vibrations in an energy fluctuation that happen as the moon disappears on video. the moon at that time was near the middle of the screen while there was a simultaneous difficulty keeping perfectly focused on the moon and not moving. i noticed the noise when i slowed down the video. as the moon disappeared i had my eyes fixed on the sky, it was very clear for san diego that night i had not seen any object move through the sky in over an hour of being out there. as the moon reappeared i saw at the exact time a burst of light streak out from the moon being larger than the moon the instant i saw it and 3 times the length. it seemed to roll and bend then disappear in a total time of a second to a second and half. before i responded audibly, i thought it was a comet or fireball. quickly changing my mind because my better than 20/15 vision told me the object changed shape seeming to back up in the sky and then roll before disappearing in the distance of 2 inches in the sky. my reaction on the video is \"what the f*** was that?\" followed by heavy breathing and few other noises before finally turning off video about a minute after seeing object. object was white with faint grey white like particles as extreme shape stretched and had grey mist like when disintegrating from largest and longest on video reanimated starship form as it jumps into a wall of white light that appears as cut in sky, pulls in starship like object and never illuminates past the wall of light cut in sky. only thing that passes wall of light is particles that seemed to trail the object from the instant it was viewable showing a clear linear path from the moon as it appears. the first time it appeared it is the starship form then it stretches and distorts like it does at the end, almost opening what seems to be the portal but suddenly retracts back into starship form before becoming much smaller going backwards towards the moon again and stopping the size and shape of the moon in view . then it morphs into original starship form again more solid looking than ever it stays in the sky not moving. image is clearest at this point with a very distinct shape that was repeated earlier. when it starts to move forward for last time it is after a short delay a light wall resembling a cut in the sky illuminates. as the starship moves forward towards the wall of light it dematerializes into the wall of light, where no ambient light passes. the entire time the solid ambient illuminated starship and morphing pattern was bright and an obvious light source in the sky. only trailing particles pass the wall of light.  these are the same particles that faintly are seen as a line behind object in sky and passing through wall of light as it disappears. the close up of a frame of this final particle trail and leftover empty space gap where the wall of light was is incredible, this was where the particles faded into nothing and everything in view was gone. looks as if the light was cut right out of the sky. after the event i was shaken but cool (after the heavy breathing and gulps) because it was not first weird thing i have seen. i was excited to check ipad for footage of what was in the sky after finding the evidence was captured on video i have not been able to stop thinking of incident and analyzing it in many ways. it���s on my mind a lot.  i continued to make videos for an hour after the ufo event. none of the preceding or post event videos showed anything of significance and only included parts of the phases of the blood moon.  i was outside from 10:45 pm - 1:00 am 4/15/2014. i believe to the best of my knowledge the actual time was 11:58 pm pacific time on 4/14/2014 when the phenomenon occurred 1 minute 13 seconds into the 2 minute and 22 second recorded ipad video. when eclipse of blood moon was first seen.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:02","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Patterned Surface,  Appendage(s),  Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

(i'm comparing the flight path to the tree line behind my house and the adjacent street, and the tree height of my neighbors house @ 60-70 ft, if you calculate 80ft width per lot, it's a pretty good estimate). note i filmed from my patio, then walked to the back left of my yard to capture all i could. you can  hear my a/c unit and i95 in the background. as it passes directly overhead, i didn't hear any additional noise? that's when i stopped filming and my sons friend saw it 30 seconds later. he stated that when he saw it the 2 lights were almost verticle. one on top of the other...\r\n\r\nbeing religious people, they weren't about to look into it, beyond being spooked.\r\n\r\nbeing that i captured it with an iphone and it was night...I would love for you to wash it out and tell me what you can see. i don't have the proper software to do the job. sorry for the 3 clips, but my phone can send it in 1 shot.\r\n\r\nattached is another video. just a blue light in the night sky...I caught  the second appearance of this blue light in a matter of minutes, although i don't hear the whining of an rc engine... i believe this to be an rc helicopter, or something of the sort. the first sighting- it went vertical- moved to the right- then to the left- then vertical- then horizontal. i could understand the immediate reaction of \"it's a flare\" but the actions of the light just before i picked upy phone would beg to differ...I captured this one on the second go around. you tell me!\r\n\r\ni would just like a clear edit of my videos. thanks","distance":"101-500
