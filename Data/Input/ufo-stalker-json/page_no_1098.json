(as i recall at the time this was so very high and in the northern area of calif.)  all of a sudden a large obect, sphere or round, appeared.  as i watched small ones came to the ship and otheres were leaving , coming and going.  of course, i had no idea how many or if the same ones.  now a second object (lge) appeared to the east of the lge one.  couldn't tell if it was the same size or just farther away;however, the same objects were coming and going to it also then a few started going between the two lge spheres.  during this time i did get extremely interested in what was going on and asked my cousin to watch, which she glanced up and started the flying fish thing again.  i then asked anyone on board to look and none responded!!!!The journey ended and we were back on the beach never to see the ufo again.   however, here is another event i experienced, but in alaska in  about 2002\r\n\r\nmy daughter and i had just brought our boat from seldovia to homer, docked it and started up the highway to anchorage. it was dark so must have been around eight pm. driving after anchor point on a straight away toward ninilchick (the ocean on my left or west of us) a crimson straight line shot across the highway about a foot or two off the ground traveled to the east , my radio went out, then the car stopped.After, what i thought to be a couple minutes, i tried to start the car , she took right off and away we went until out of the corner of my left eye i could see this same beam of light approaching again from the west.  same thing, radio out and car went dead, tried to start - nothing. after a \"couple minutes\" i started the car right up and got to a motel in soldotna at about midnight.  the trip should have taken us two hours but it took four plus hrs. to get there.  my mind was only on getting some rest not on what happened. just like it never happened or i forgot it.  later my daughter mentioned she wondered why the 2 hr trip took over 4 hrs..I couldn't reply to that.\r\nyears later she told me she thought we had been taken????\r\n\r\nat the time of my sighing of ufos i was 20 yrs old and this second experience i was at least 65.  i am now 77 and wanted to write this down.

exposure containing star trails. upon zooming in the object was disc shaped and appeared in only a handful of exposures and then disappeared. during an exposure a jet of some kind was flying at a very high altitude in the vicinity of the area. upon importing the raw photos into lightroom and zooming in even further the object moves in one frame and then disappears entirely.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:52","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":55634,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.815950930979476,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04212014-0003","longitude":-112.09590995134992,"occurred":1398011940000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1398067403000,"summary":"I

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My wife and i went to dinner in the neighboring town of spearfish, sd.  as we were leaving the restaurant and getting into our truck, my wife said \"what was that?\".  i asked her what she meant and she asked \"didn't you hear that?\", which i hadn't, i had already shut my door.  i asked her what it sounded like and she described it as a boom-boom sound.  i didn't think much of it and we decided to drive home to lead via us hwy 14a, which is a scenic route through spearfish canyon in the black hills.  it was approximately 7:20pm and the skies were crystal-clear.  spearfish canyon is very winding and has high canyon walls on either side making for a limited field of view most of the time, but as we rounded a corner, i looked up and saw this bizarre smoke trail in the sky to the west.  i drove on a little ways looking for a better view and a place to pull off of the road.  the photos i took with my cell-phone camera are better than i expected considering it was the first time i ever used it.  the two trail were visually close enough and on the same trajectory to be obviously related.  the upper, or larger of the two was very broad and straight, being slightly denser on the upper and lower edges as though it may have been cylindrical as opposed to appearing flat.  the second, or lower trail was very bright and sharp in appearance and was very obviously created by a spiraling object.  i am fairly certain that what i saw was the smoke trail of something burning up and breaking up on re-entry.  unfortunately i did not see the actual object that created this smoke trail. but in my best estimation i would say that, based on the time it took to completely disperse (about 20 minutes), i missed it by about 5 - 10 minutes.  this would correspond to the time my wife heard the booms.  it appeared to me that whatever left the lower trail was burning, spiraling, and possibly breaking apart because there were intermittent bright spots, not evenly spaced along the trail, that looked like places that trailed small fragments as there were smaller streaks of smoke around these bright spots.  i'm not sure if the photos are good enough to show that much detail, though.  i'm not asserting that this was anything extraterrestrial, but it was very unusual.  i've seen a lot of con-trails and have even seen the \"chain-of-pearls\" type of con-trail here and what i saw today did not resemble a con-trail.  i was fortunate enough to have witnessed the re-entry of skylab when i was a boy, and this looked very similar to the smoke trails it left.  the smoke trails i saw today appeared to be at a lower altitude than that, though.  i'm no trained spotter, but i am an army veteran and former law enforcement officer.  though it's very difficult, if not impossible to judge the altitude and range of the smoke trail, i would take a wild guess at between 20k and 50k feet and maybe 5 to 25 miles distant.  hard to tell not knowing what it was.  anyway, just wanted to pass this along to you guys.  i think it's worth looking into, especially if you've received any other related reports.  i'd bet my paycheck on my opinion that it was an object breaking up in the atmosphere.  maybe space-junk, maybe a large meteor, but definitely not a con-trail.  feel free to call me if you have any questions, and please let me know if you figure out what this was.  thank you.","distance":"Over One
