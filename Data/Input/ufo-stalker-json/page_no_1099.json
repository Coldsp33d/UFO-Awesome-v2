talking to my wife on one side and my kids were about 40 feet away talking. my son says \"dad look at the red lights\", so i walked over and observed a pair of red lights flying together maybe 1/8 mile apart but in formation. there was another identical reddish light lower and maybe a mile behind. the front pair crossed the sky at the speed of a fast plane before one just disappeared. then the one following was gone and finally 15 seconds later the last one disappeared. there was no sound.       we thought they might be airplanes because we live near a small airport but we have seen all lights and know the sounds all the different planes, jets, and helicopters make around here. while talking about what we had saw another two just appeared from nowhere and seemed to be coming in our direction. i saw another one a second later way behind and to the left. the main one in the center got bigger as if it was getting closer still with no sound. i thought to myself we're gonna see it up close and it'll be an airplane, but soon after that it disappeared . we were all like \"what the hell did we just see?\" we talked about it for a while ,maybe five minutes later i was pointing and talking to my son when we both saw a bright white blink of light in the same direction of the first pair we had seen. just a quick blink but very bright kind of like a led light. we were like what the f...?!!! so a total of 6 reddish orange objects.. my wife says more orange... and one weird flash of light where there were no stars or planes.","distance":"Over One

lights that seemed to fit together as part of a larger whole. these component lights, in perfect geometric array, looked like four tic-tac candy pellets lined up side by side, thus making for an overall flat, rectangular unit like a window shade with a few flat slats or louvres, though i did not see a structural border to that implied gestalt. unlike candy pellets, these four components did not project tubular volume; they appeared as very flat sources of bright light. the shorter sides of the rectangular array oriented east to west.\r\n\r\nthis object or event was visible as an intensely bright flash; it was a clean, pulse-like emission of light that did not scatter, as does starlight when traversing our planet���s atmosphere. the pulse lasted for approximately one second. the four lights flashed simultaneously only once, followed by a sharp, brief, pulse of neon blue---the sort seen on bioluminescent plankton--that \"outlined\" or bordered the array. yet the very geometric components and behavior of this object or event seemed to be mechanical or engineered, not a biological life form, at least not as we know we know it.\r\n\r\nas for relative size, i was able to fully cover the relevant patch of sky with the upper quarter of my thumb, with my arm outstretched. \r\n\r\nit seemed to me that this object or event belonged to the deep night sky, as opposed to our atmosphere, as do aircraft and even spaceships shortly after launch. subjectively, it felt that i had unwittingly observed a signal not meant for me to see or utilize, as opposed to the signal from a lighthouse, for example, which any observer clearly feels was put into place for the sake of all observers within its reach, or the lights of flying aircraft, also meant to announce their presence and flight paths.\r\n\r\ni had been engaged in naked-eye, casual observation of constellations and meteors when this sighting took place over a remote bay called bahia salinas, in cabo rojo, puerto rico. it was approximately 10:45 pm and i had been observing the zenith of a very clear night sky, when the object or event flashed right before my eyes.  i am a professionally-trained observer with studies and teaching credentials in visual perception. quick pencil sketch made under dim hotel lamp attached.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Louvres","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":55625,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":18.0866265,"location":null,"logNumber":"PR-04202014-0024","longitude":-67.1457347,"occurred":1397972700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Cabo

porch and watch jets fly over. once before around new years something flew over that i cant explain, and then it happened again on the above mentioned date. at around 9:35 something flew over that i thought might have been a us bomber jet, with different sides of the craft ligthing up and blinking at different times( not a steady blink as seen on other planes), it was followed by what i assume is a military f-16(normal blinking lights). roughly 2-4 minutes later i see what looks like a round or disc shaped object, not blinking just glowing white(just like a star) moving across the sky, well as i look away in other direction i notice 2 planes with blinking lights (assumed military) coming at it from different directin (straight on). the solid lit/star like craft continued going straight then started to do what i would call circles in the air, as if it was waiting for the 2 approaching jets to get closer to it, then it veered left and shot off. leaving no trail or nothing, gone in a blink in an eye, it left faster than a shooting star flashes through the sky. this unknown flying object was completely silent. my 8 month old daughter was asleep when i purposely yelled in my house for my wife to come see it. neither one of us can explain what we saw. i stepped back inside at exactly 9:39. my start time on this event may be off by a few minutes but the end time is exact, as i checked my phone when walking in the door. usually every night around 9:30 i can step outside and watch the lights of the planes flying up above, we can even see the military jets flying over during day light hours as well, i am completely in shock at what i saw, to me it is simply an ufo as i can not explain the solid lit craft that i observed, and i am not so sure the first craft i saw was something that

to the east side of my property.  \r\n\r\nit's ~70 degrees fahrenheit outside and there is not a cloud in the sky, so i had an unobstructed view of it as it passed over.  it appeared mostly dark brown in color, although there was some variation, and i remember thinking at the first second i saw it, wow that's a big hawk.  but i immediately realized it was not as it was very obviously geometrically shaped, traveling at a high rate of speed with a perfectly straight trajectory and with no apparent movement in the craft.  i confess to feeling bewildered as i sat watching it which apparently kept me from picking up the camera i had placed in front of me for photographing ducks in the pond, but i'm not sure i would have had time to pick it up and focus it even if i had the sense to do so at the time.\r\n\r\nthe main thin about it that threw me off was the bizarre sound, or lack of sound.  it literally made a constant whooshing noise, which did not change in frequency as you would expect from something like the doppler effect you hear from a car passing by, but was a constant volume and tone from the moment i heard it until it was over the horizon at which point the sound completely subsided.  it as faint.  if i had been listening to music at low volume i would have never looked up.  it was roughly as loud as the surrounding birds, but obvious enough to take notice.  \r\n\r\nthere was absolutely no noise that you would normally associate with an aircraft.  no turbine noise, no propeller noise, nothing like that at all.  there was only the faint whoosh as it traveled.\r\n\r\ni can recall a few seconds into watching it, really when it flew over my grain silos (which are 70' tall) that i attempted to take survey of its altitude.  i was and continue to have a really difficult time making sense of it's apparent altitude.  i was bewildered at this while i walked from outside to the computer, and now that i've had a moment to reflect i think the reason i was having a hard time establishing perspective is due to the complete lack of noise or contrail, one of which has always accompanied aircraft i've viewed in the sky.  i used to live near a marine base in nc where f-16's and other military craft flew by and the sound was always a good indicator for me of how high they were.  the other thing i had a hard time reasoning through was how fast it was moving.  i was thinking as it passed that it would have had to have been at low altitude to appear to be moving as fast as it was, and for a brief moment i questioned whether it was a remote controlled jet of some kind, but there are definitely no rc planes that look like that, that make no noise and are even close to that fast.  plus i live miles from my closes neighbor and they certainly aren't interested in rc planes.  what i can say is that it had to be at least 4 times higher than my 70' silo, but beyond that i really can't say for sure.  if it was at an altitude of say, 280', which now that i say it sounds very unlikely, i would guess it was traveling at least several hundred miles per hour.  if it was at a higher altitude than that, and traversed the distance it appeared to, then it was really moving fast.\r\n\r\nin terms of size, again, i'd be guessing due to my uncertainty on it's altitude, but the description i selected above is probably the case, that it would have been obstructed by a golf ball at arms length.  if i was begged down to a guess i'd say maybe 30' - 50' in width and roughly that in length.\r\n\r\ni'm at a loss attempting to describe why i can't provide a better explanation of either the features of the aircraft or it's altitude.  the best way i can describe it is that as i was looking up at this thing, i just felt confused.  it's not often that you look at something and flat out can't place it.  in the brief time it was in front of me, my mind was focused on shuffling through first the possibilities as to what it was, and before coming to real resolution on that, it left my line of site while it passed over the silo at which point i started thinking about what altitude it must have been at and then my mind went back to the sound and i tried to focus on the aircraft for any sign of propulsion, and then it was gone.  \r\n\r\nhere's what i know for sure.  i'm an engineer with a solid understanding of how the world around me works, i'm also interested in pretty much anything with an engine, including aircraft.  i've been to the usaf museum at wright patterson as well as other aircraft museums including both nasa installations.  i've seen a b2 up close and it wasn't that.  could it have been an f-117?  maybe???  does an f-117 make zero noise whatsoever?  i haven't seen one in flight, but i doubt it very much.  are they now painted brown?  i don't think so.  aside from that comparison, which i feel would be a bit of a stretch, i've never seen and definitely never heard anything like it before.  i sure would love to know what it was though.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line

planes. i glanced up at the sky through my sunroof and for a split second saw what looked like to me a small box shaped object, 20-30 feet long , 6-10 feet high,(actually looked like the shuttle on the program 'star trek) flash across the sky at a very low altitude (200-300 feet). the vehicle was dark gray, had no wings or windows, did not have any visible exhaust or make a sound.\r\n\r\ni only saw this thing for a nano second as it was going extremely fast! i looked over to my left, towards the san gabriel mountains,to get a better view of this object and it was already gone from sight!\r\n\r\nthis object was flying extremely low to the ground, over a small plane airport. it came from the direction of the pacific ocean and was flying towards the north which would have taken it over the mountains and then the mojave desert. it was flying so fast, it was already gone when i looked to my left to get a better view as it flew by. it was flying faster then any airplane! and, i heard no noise or sound barrier 'crack' as it went by.It was a sheer fluke that i saw it all! it was quite amazing believe me!\r\n\r\nby the way, i was in the air force for six years and am a retired deputy sheriff.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line
