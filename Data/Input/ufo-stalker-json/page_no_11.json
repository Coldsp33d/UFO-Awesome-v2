was a time i was waking up in the middle of the night without any sleepy feeling,just opened my eyes and check the time, always was around 2-4 am. i used to feel a buzz or a little shake, i never saw anything because im very skeptic and i asumed that i was just having a bad dream and get immediately back to sleep.Sometimes we used to joke about ufo hovering town and that i \"felt\" them. but i never took it seriously. until one night. it was close to christmas, in my city thats in summer so we sleep with windows open, an i had a weird dream, that i told to my mother the day after (this was a typical conversation for breakfast because i have sometimes very realistic dreams). this dream was like this: i was sleeping and suddenly a bright light woke me up, coming from outside the window,me half blinded stand up and followed this light.Suddenly i found myself inside an hovering flying saucer where there were 3 more people like me, half confused and asleep. there were 2 drivers of the machine but they looked like us, but with adark blue suit, reminded me as part of a militar gawn.We are moving, travelling up, and i am a little concious so i want to know how this ufo works, its shape is created to fit all needs for a long trip, looks mote like an apartment than a space ship, it has sleeping rooms, eating area, and a big round \"sofa\" in the middle. in the middle of this ufo rheres a kind of hole, and rhete are windows,were we can see we are travelling. the crew tell us to have a look through the window and we are all in awwww, i think to myself i'm lucky to be one of the few people of having the view of the world from outside.I can see the space and the planet earth. we approach to a \"morher ship\" that is more as a big structure in the middle of the sky next to earth, i though myself how people can't see it,or if they use an invisible coat, but i never ask. we dock and big doors are open, and we are welcomed in a room full of screens, and \"people\" watching, like security cameras. this place looks more as a space station. we were welcome by a tall bold woman wih the same blue suit, she looks like us but is taller, she says to us not to be afraid and that we were there only conciously and they wanted to run some tests to understand some human perceptions.All is very peaceful and nobody is scared, we are invited to follow someone to another place that looked like a hotel hall, or a hospital one, with doors on both sides. suddenly we stop in front of a door and a guy ask me to imagine the room inside and how i would like it to be. so i close my eyes and think about a small room with a bed, a night table, a closet, a tv and a window.I thought of a very typical room with no more than needed. they open the door and it was exactly like i thought. i stay in for a while, i look through the window and i see that the building is like a big hotel in a c shape, and in the miidle theres a huge green space as a backyard crossed by cement paths in asterisk shape, and there were many people walking around, maybe 100-200. then i found myself in that area and i'm walking around looking if there's any familiar faces, i only saw one guy that i remembered was my classmate in primary school but i don't remember his name.I say hi and ask him if he knows what are we doing there, he doesn't know, so we just keep walking around. after that i see myself on a beach, a very fake one, as digitally manipulated, the sky shines and is difficult to see, the sand is warm and the water also, what it caught my eye was a huge bridge next to me that starts behind the beach and goes all the way to the horizon. im sitting watching around, we are sittedbon the sand in groups of 3, and theres a truck, kind of military going through the sand, some guys go down and they are in a blue military gawn and they are carrying assault guns.They look humans.One guy goes to a group next to us the other one come to us, he says, \"that would be all\" and touches my shoulder,then i wake up. this dream haunt me until today because a neighbor of mine, few days later, told us she had the same dream.Since then my skepticism has been in doubt if this was real or not. i have seen in other times weird light in the sky but i always thought that might be another reason for them than ufo. thanks for this space to share this information.

for my cigar i saw what i thought was the moon until i quickly realized that it was way too crescent shaped and that the moon is currently visible on the other side of my property. after a couple seconds of watching i noticed a ball of light at the edge of the crescent towards the middle of the object. i called my father who lives a few miles away to see if he could see this \"second moon\" from his house. as he was looking for it, what appeared to be the crescent moon began to recede towards the ball of light. once they fully retracted the ball of light became a much brighter white/yellow. as this was happening my father found the object and reported the same thing. he also saw another object further north that he alerted me to and i was able to witness as well. this object was much further away and had an illuminated crescent with 3 smaller round star like objects behind it. almost like a tail. it best resembled the outline of a horeshoe crab. it was alone in the sky with no visible stars around. it looked to move around slightly and sort of glisten. at this point my dad is freaked out and wants to go inside and calm down. i had also alerted my fiance inside and she saw both objects which terrified her. she thought we were gonna get abducted and was worried for the kids safety. i continued watching and between 1am and 5am i witnessed another 3 crafts that were identical to the second one i saw. it looked like the other 4 were all slowly heading towards the largest/closest crescent shaped object. at 2:45 am the objects looked to have formed a diamond shaped pattern. during this ordeal i honestly thought that eith ww3 was starting and these were some top secret weapons or as crazy as this sounds, but they were crafts from far away. the entire 4 hours i was outside felt like 10 mins. it was freezing outside but i couldn't bring myself to stop watching no matter how numb my hands got. i've never felt such an adrenaline rush. the only reason i stopped watching was because the sky had gotten too light to see them anymore. i'm truly baffled and so are my fiance and father. it was a truly extraordinary experience. i also have 2 videos and 5 pictures. you cam clearly see lights but they were so far away and i only had my phone as a camera. i want to attach the images, videos and sketches but am on my phone and not sure how to do

north of us (watertown). i went out on my porch to look at them, there are various ones that pass over. at this time there were 6 in 2 formations. as they passed, i noticed an airliner flying from the north (across lake ontario)in an easterly direction. it had 2 engines (jet) one under each wing. the sun reflected it, and there were no clouds in the sky where i was watching, and the plane had no contrails.It passed from my view. at that time i saw 4 white discs in a nearly straight line moving southwest. they were not reflecting, they were moving rapidly, they did \"waver\" out of line. i grabbed my binoucurs (sic) 40 power and trained them on the discs, i was only able to see them for a second when they disappeared,i tried to find them with my eyes, but they were gone. i looked back to where i had seen them at first, and there were 2 more at a slightly different direction,i followed them with my eyes, they hadn't gotten as far as the first group, when they disappeared,as i was watching them. i kept looking to see if there were more, when i saw another, this one was going south and it was moving faster than the others,this one went out of sight, didn't disappear abruptly. i continued to scan the skies for a while, but nothing more happened, except my coffee got cold. my first instinct, was that they were, fighter jets or drones, but, there was no sound, and at this time of day it is quiet.There were clouds in the distance,over the lake,but none overhead.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

i first thought was a half-moon until i realized that it was would have been the bottom half of the moon. that is a view that we do not see on this planet. looking closer i saw that it had a silvery surface that seemed to give off it's own light. \r\n\r\njudging from where i was, the object looked as if it was directly over what would be the town of marydel, de, right on the maryland/delaware border. that town is at least 10-13 miles away from dover. \r\n\r\nnext i noticed several small, white lights, (maybe 3 or 4), one of which was pulsating, maneuvering around the large, bowl shaped object. they were moving quite slowly in all directions. they would move in one direction, then stop and suddenly move in another direction. \r\n\r\ni called my adult son outside and we both remarked that it had to be a ufo. we watched it for about 15 minutes total. i even went back inside the house, came back and it was still there. \r\n\r\nthere was absolutely no noise from the objects. this became very obvious when we suddenly could see and hear a helicopter near the objects but could not determine how close it was actually getting. \r\n\r\nwe also witnessed a plane passing by the objects, but at a much greater distance past it. the plane was not anywhere near the objects, just passed by in the same line of sight. i'm certain that the pilots would have seen the objects.\r\n\r\nneither my son nor i saw the objects shoot off, fly away or land. one moment they were there, the next moment i looked up and they were gone. \r\n\r\nboth of us were a bit nervous and confused. after talking about what manmade objects it could have been, we agreed that it did not look like anything we had ever witnessed before.\r\n\r\ni use a flip phone and did not take a picture. my son's phone was upstairs and honestly, neither of us even thought about taking a picture at the time of the incident. \r\n\r\nneither of us mentioned it to our spouses or to each other again until 3/17/18, when my daughter and grandson came to visit. something she said sparked the memory of the event and i talked about it in detail to my wife, daughter and grandson. i still have no idea what it was but would like answers. thank you.

moves very slowly. brighter than any star in the sky at first, sometimes it will hover in the same general area before moving slowly to another spot. it doesn’t flash but strobes very slowly. it reminds me a bit like a lighthouse however it has no timing pattern. most of the time it’s 12-15 seconds between strobes but i’ve seen it hover in the same spot and strobing up to a minute between. i’ve seen it. over the course of a year and it always seems to be in the same general spot, not like a star that moves over time. i’ve watched the sky my whole adult life and have studied flight patterns of jets of all sorts but i’ve never seen anything like this except for a similar red strobe over the ocean in socal in 2015.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:08:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then
