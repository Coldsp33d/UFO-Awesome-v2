cylinder long like a football field 1 mile in altitude during a bright day of summer mid afternoon no clouds on a trip to kickinghorse ski resort before i learned of the existence of this things on ancient aliens. i saw flashing moving lights at night for over 30 minutes with 4 friends in 2000 and saw the same phenomenon on a video on youtube without knowing how to save the video in 2011. in 2002 i saw a rectangle flying at 2 miles over my head,i was with 3 friends in a parking lot perfect blue sky and others around was observing it,it lasted 45 minutes. i also witnessed the chinese rocket body entering the atmosphere in calgary,2015 february. i   have been followed by a light on the highway in 2000 with a friend,when we stopped the light disappeared. we started driving and the light did reappeared. we was on the highway. we took an exit and the light followed to disappear just in front of our eyes. we was completely alone in an area without any lights at 3 a.M. we drove away full speed completely in shock......No time missing or close contact,only followed by a weird light without any noise. aliens don't contact the masses to avoid panic. slowly humans understand

bowling team. i was maybe 9 or 10 years old. if i remeber correctly the name of the bowling alley was northeastern bowl.I grew up in indianapolis all my younger years which means ive see the goodyear blimp alot .It use to fly right over my house as a child every year. so i know what it looks like from every angle. so as i was playing hide and go seek, i looked up to see if my friends were hiding in some trees or possibly on top the building. thats when i noticed the object hovering, moving very slowly like a blimp. if i would have looked up sooner it would have been right over my head .Im going to say around 200 to 500 feet above me. but it was at an angle. moved very slowly like a blimp but it was not a blimp. it zig zagged across the sky and never changed shape. if a blimp zig zags it changes shape depending on the angle that you are viewing it at. so i called my friens in to help me identify the object. most of them were younger than myself.So they didnt know what they were seeing. so i went inside to get an older person to view the objest,they refuse to come outside. they thought we were making the whole thing up. so i ran back outside and watched the object continue to traverse the sky for around 15 to 20 minutes back and forth untill it went over the horizon. the strange thing about it was it had dull yellow lights spinning aroung the outside edge in a very random order. now imagine the goodyear blimp with lights so bright that even when the sun was still up that u couldnt possibly read the scrolling words on the side of it.To me it seemed  like it was trying to mimic a blimp but the lights were so bright it looked fuzzy. now if i was paying money for advertizement on that blimp i would want my money back. because there is no way to read what was spinning around the edges of this thing. the more i thought about the way this thing moved across the sky it made me think that it was looking for something like scanning the ground.And ever since the day i witnessed this i have been searching for something that would at least look like what i saw that day. i havent found and exact match yet anywhere.And im 53 years old now .","distance":"101-500

witnessed a large dark (dull and black in color) triangular shaped object (at first i thought it was a plane) hovering and slowly, slowly rotating in the sky. three red lights, one white. i observed it clearly for 5 minutes, 2 minutes of which i pulled over to the side of the road and stared at it in awe.The three red lights were at the tips of the triangle with one white light that was next to one of the red lights.The lights all flashed, strobe-like in unison.  the underbelly had 4 square-shaped \"panels\", one directly in the middle of the triangle, and one each alongside the straight lines of the triangle. this craft was large, it had to be 200 foot in diameter and was about 250 feet above me. it made no noise at all, and just hovered and slowly rotated. i was headed north on main street, but after this craft started to move, i quickly made a u-turn and started following it. it picked up speed, not super speed, but kind of like it noticed me following it and decided to go faster. it moved in a sw direction over manor hill elementary school in lombard, il. as soon as i approached the nearby park south of the school i lost sight of it because of the trees in the park, and once i was clear of the park, i couldn't see anything in the sky, like it just vanished. i had attempted to use my phone camera/video, but the app froze and wouldn't open.  never did i ever think

are. it seems since you already have my phone number. i would like to ask you to be discreet with the information you have already compiled.   i do not have good health, and had a new heart valve put in last march.  my wife and i are just a middle grandmother and grandfather.  i’m a 100% disabled veteran since 2004.  we are both 65 years of age. please respect that?\r\non aug. 25th, 2017 at approximately 8:30 pm my wife and i were looking forward to getting to a location where we could get settled in for the night. we were riding in our 37 foot diesel pusher at a speed of about 60 miles per hour, slightly downhill, travelling southeast on highway 550, and a few miles south of napeezi, new mexico   \r\nwe had been talking about how the roads had changed 2 lanes to 4 lanes since the last time i had driven.  out of nowhere i saw a light flash in front of me, it had come from my left.  i instinctively looked to my left and i saw 2 creatures setting about 2 foot apart, very bright craft which was at my eye level while setting in the motorhome. \r\ni instantly seemed to take a mind picture of what i was seeing.  at that time we were maybe 80 feet and gaining on their position. my first thought was is this real, the closer we got the more positive i was that what i was seeing was real when i made eye contact. \r\nsome points i saw was;\r\nthe craft did not appear to have a windshield.  \r\nthe panel in behind the creatures gave off a very bright light, as did the floor and ceiling.  it was as bright as a operating room under full lighting. there was as small stem that came up from the floor in front of the creatures. it stood about 40 inches out of the floor. it seemed to support a  small control panel that was thinner the a carton of cigarettes. the guy on my left had his gopher looking hand resting on it.  \r\nthe moment i saw them, the individuals were looking down the road as if looking for something to arrive. there was a truck coming up the hill toward us and about a 1/8th of a mile away. the craft seemed to swing and rotate from the shoulder on the other side to a lane away was at my side and maybe 20 foot away.  once they rotated enough that their faces was 180% to us, he saw us and disappeared.  as we drove on down the hill i looked in my mirrors and side camera and didn’t see anything related to them after that.\r\na description of the creatures we witnessed:\r\nboth individuals had a skin tone about the same as mine, i’m a white male. they had large heads in a upside down teardrop shape, very large black eyes, a small mouth and 2 small holes for a nose. there were holes for the ears but only a nub for ears. very much like the drawing you would see in roswell, accept not green, but green uniforms. the one on the right had a very smooth face. the one on the left appeared to be older with facial lines. the one on my left wrinkled his right side of his mouth when he saw me, but they were talking when we interrupted them.\r\ni made eye contact with the one on my left and looked directly into his large black eye.  his eye was the finest surface i had ever seen.  the eye had no abrasions or scratches , no dust or mucus. .  i noticed  that under the surface of this perfectly clear outer surface of the eye was a grid of many individual eyes, like a fly’s eye’s but much smoother super fine glass surface.\r\ntheir bodies where skinny and were illuminated with a greenish glowing uniform. also there was roll type cuffs  that also glowed, but was a beige. \r\nthey reminded me of stick people. the arms and the torso were slender and about the diameter of a very small child of 6  or 7 years of age. \r\nthe hands reminded me of the shape of gophers. but these creatures are large in height and reach, that hand appeared to me to be a lethal weapon.\r\ntheir torso was long and skinny and appeared to be weak if depended on. but i believe the suit they wear is their body strength.\r\nthe back wall is very hard to explain because i believe however they traveled was behind that wall. the wall was very brightly illuminated.  it appeared to be divided into about 18 inch cubes but wasn’t, it was a flat surface.   the light seemed to be boiling along the edges of each panel in the colors of light greenish, blue, violet.  but the power heaved with its changes it seemed. the back panel was incredibly beautiful and something i’ll never forget it.\r\n\r\nwe could not see the outer body of the craft because we were looking into very bright light. \r\nas for hearing anything i felt i heard them communicating when we approached.  i wear hearing aids and they were stretching like a fax machine.  \r\n\r\ni looked at google maps at the location of thr incident nd found something interesting.  please look at the land above the cliff.  its as if dozer work had been done. i have no idea what the bright object by the road might be.  this could be something natural, but they turned and went somewhere. \r\ni added a drawing someone did that is similar to the creatures we saw.  but the ones we saw did not have the body ma's these do and the ones we say we're wearing uniforms that seemed have the ability to move and protect them.  although they were greenish they had  glow of energy about them.  \r\ni hope you have taken time to consider what i shared with you.  i would like to know what is going on there.  i hope to go back and spend a month or 2 searching for them.  \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

 i replied, “do you know what will happen to our fishing trip, if we report it?  people will bug us for years!”  as far as i know, nobody reported this event in so missouri and decided to finally do it!  this experience changed my life for the better.  i’ve had other amazing experiences since, that i won’t report.  loyalty, means keeping secrets.  i had a 27 year career in the army, ranger, sf, counter terrorism, intel, and emergency management at the national and international level.  i remember the spaceship, like it was yesterday.  it helps to have a photographic memory for images and numbers.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":87720,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.7207772,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10312017-0024","longitude":-93.50566189999999,"occurred":-12370500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1509472792000,"summary":" bright silver saucer, 80 ft wide wi. de and flew right  above us, a 30 min event, then watched it gain speed and leave earth as the sun reflected. off it.","tags":["photo","light","hovering","saucer"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":1509504051974,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":32,"maxtempi":90,"maxvism":24,"maxvisi":15,"meantempm":23,"meantempi":74,"meanvism":23,"meanvisi":14,"mintempm":14,"mintempi":57,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":32,"maxtempi":90,"maxvism":24,"maxvisi":15,"meantempm":23,"meantempi":74,"meanvism":23,"meanvisi":14,"mintempm":14,"mintempi":57,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":17613,"locationName":"Cape Fair, Missouri","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:12190"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Wesley Chapel","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":" i gaze at the stars several times each night. i was looking out the glass door, and noticed a very bright star, low in the sky. the only one that low, just above the tree line. as i'm looking, i wondered, 'did that just move?'. i watched, and, yes, it was moving. sorta hovering, but also moving. in any direction it wanted. it went up, down, did arcs and circles. i went to get an adult to see, but he was asleep. this was just after midnight. my kids were up, ages 11,12,and 13, so i called them. independently, i asked them, 'do you see anything in the sky?' they each remarked on the brightest star, just above the trees. one at a time, they asked me, did that move?

 it was about 1100pm and was traveling east on central ave, at that time was only one lane. noticed object pacing car and wondered what it could be.  it had green and pale yellow lights pulsating in a clockwise direction around the edge. as i turned off central ave to go north it seemed to be far away across a field, as the area was basically all farmland and one small development. once we got to our destination which was a deserted road in the woods we got in the back seat and at that time i looked up out of the rear window i saw the object fly over the car and i began to wonder if it was aliens trying to capture us to put in a zoo on their planet so i took off as fast as i could go through the winding road back to central ave. just as i was coming down the road to the intersection to central ave. i looked out of the right passenger window and saw the object coming.  now all the time before it seemed to be a small object but as it approached the car i realized this thing was huge, probably as big as a football field it covered the whole road. when it got directly over the car it, for about maybe five seconds hovered then began to move away from the car  in a southwesterly direction.  but when it was approaching the car it came from a slightly nw direction. when i got to the stop sign at the intersection to central ave i saw headlights from another car which was a state police officer i got him to stop so i could show him the object but he would not even take time to look, telling me it was probably an airplane circling to land at andrews afb.  but i knew because as i said i was home on leave and was stationed at ft. kobbe in the canal zone which is part of howard afb and i saw all types of military plane, so i knew it was not something from the military.  plus even today there is nothing i have seen that could move like this object which within about five or ten seconds went from a very small object in the sky to the size of a football field. furthermore as it began to move away from the officer and myself it seemed to go into a stealth mode where the object became invisible and all you could see was the lights pulsating.  when the object was directly
