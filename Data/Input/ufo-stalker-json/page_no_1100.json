my terrier was barking at.  it was a glittering metallic object that appeared to be at about 5000 ft altitude.  i thought it was probably a mylar balloon or something similar, and went back into the house.  a few minutes later i went out again and the object was lower and i could see that it was triangular.  i watched it as it descended  very slowly.  the triangle was rotating very slowly in the horizontal plane, but the axis of rotation appeared wrong.  the motion was slow and mechanical with no fluttering or quick movement.  the triangle was not falling; it was descending in what appeared  to be a very deliberate and controlled manner.\r\ni watched for about five minutes until it seemed that the triangle would land in my yard.  i ran into the house when the thing was about 50 feet above me, and waited for the crash.  i looked out the window and didn't see the triangle in my back yard as expected, so i went out again, and saw the triangle moving off to the north at treetop level and at the same very slow speed.\r\nthe object was curved on the underside much like a speedboat bottom.  i never saw the top of it.  the transom at the rear was inset about 4 inches, and that is the only thing i saw that looked like a seam  i saw no rivets either.  it appeared to be a single sheet of polished aluminum or stainless steel.  there was a pointed bright red mast about 5 feet long sticking out of the nose, and attached to it was a bright red triangle that looked like a small pennant.  however, it was rigid and aligned in the horizontal position.  there were no marks or damage visible.  the thing looked pristine and brand new.  overall length including the mast was about 35 or 40 feet.  the width at the widest point was about 12 feet.","distance":"21-100

off at approximately 7:10am. i was in seat 12f, a window seat on the right side of the plane. it was early so the moon was still out even though it was a bright sunny morning. it was a bright, white, full moon. at approximately 7:23 i noticed what i assumed to be a contrail from a plane. the trail was very noticeable because it was black and it was directly in front of the very white moon with blue skies and a few white clouds. my immediate thought was what plane leaves a black trail. as i continued to look at the streak i noticed that it appeared to be moving in relation to the clouds below it. i fly regularly for my job and always choose a window seat. i'm used to observing other planes but this caught my attention and i continued to observe it. originally the streak was perfectly level and the same height as the plane. as i observed, the streak began to angle at approximately 5-10%. it was then that i realized that it wasn't a streak and could possibly be a plane. all of the sudden the front end of the streak pointed straight down in what appeared to be a nose dive. it pointed directly down for about 1-2 seconds before it made an upside down u-turn and headed directly back in the direction that it had been traveling and went into the cloud below it. there is absolutely no way that a traditional airplane could make that tight of a turn. i watched as long as i could but it never came out of the cloud. \r\n\r\ni was purposely the last person to get off of the plane so that i could ask the pilot if they saw it. the pilot had already left the plane but the copilot who was also on the right side of the plane said that he did not see it but wishes that he had. from the front of the plane i believe that they could only see a black streak and were not able to see the streak take a nose dive or reverse direction. the copilot did mention that we flew over wright patterson afb but i can't imagine a military plane being that close to a commercial aircraft and attempting an upside u-turn maneuver even if they could make a tight turn like that.

stretch of road called sr91 which is between st cloud and ft pierce the road is lined with trees and the ground is mostly tall grassy wetlands.\r\n\r\nwhile at the midway point my wife had her head down looking at the pictures on the camera which we had taken at disneyworld. out of the corner of my right eye on the west side of the road i noticed a green glowing ball.  i tried to get my wife's

brakes.  i can only describe the green color as some sort of highlighter radioactive green.  \r\n\r\ni stopped the car and watched it through the front windshield.  it slowly descended below the tree line which was approximately 100 feet off the ground.  i was traveling at 65 mph at the time and i was passing the vehicle.  when i slowed to 20-30mph i was traveling at about the same speed. the sphere appeared to be about 30 feet by 30 feet.  there was no exhaust, smoke or heat signature coming from the sphere. i was approximately 150 ft from the treeline.  i began to get out of my car expecting to see a crash or a ball of fire but nothing happened.  i then had an overwhelming feeling that everything was normal and i was suddenly driving down the road.  i don't recall starting the car or driving.  i asked my wife what she saw and she said she saw nothing. i would like to know what i saw.  is this a naturally occurring phenomena?  i worked for 8 years as a commercial pilot

all.  i looked at it a minute or so then turned my eyes away for just a few seconds and looked back and it was gone.  i went out on deck and looked in all directions and it was gone.....Had it been plane or helicopter i would have seen it moving in a flight direction.  i only took my eyes off of it for maybe 10 seconds or so.  my 1st thought when i saw it was wow that is one bright light.  it appeared to be like looking at a star or plant way out into space.  had the appearance of that as it was solid white with maybe the edges kind of fading or hazy. it could not have been a star or plant as it was a huge bright light so i could tell it was very close above ground under where you would see clouds.  if i was to take my arm and extend out and upward with a closed fist, i could probably see the edges i would say.  that tells me it was extremely close.  it was not round or any particular shape on your questions, it was more like a star shape narrow at the top and wider at bottom, almost triangle but not quite.  first thought was omg that is bright and close.  after looking away and it was gone, was again omg where did it go.  i did not see it anywhere in the sky, it was just there stationary above tree line then 10 or sec after looking away then back it was gone.\r\n\r\ni made a report back in 2013 of something 3 of us witnessed in apprx 2011 of orbs in triangle shapes in

experience because it not only intrigued me but it was not the typical\r\n\" i saw a round flying saucer with blinking lights\" sighting. what happened to me that night was definitely different from any typical ufo sighting i had ever heard of and it was almost unexplainable. i hoped for another day where it would come again while i was not alone so i wouldn't feel so crazy when explaining a huge flying flame right over my head with black gases rolling around in it to people lol i honestly keep it a little hush because it is so bizarre. \r\n\r\nwell tonight, at about 10:20 pm almost exactly a year later, finally, i saw it again and it was moving through the same exact area as i saw it last time, my sisters yard. it was not nearly as close to me as the last one was, therefor it wasn't as large, but the plus side to tonights odd fireball sighting was that my sister and my niece both saw the flying orange flame right along side of me. my skeptical side thought chinese lantern at first due to its size but i quickly changed my mind. we watched it travel through the yard at about the height of the tree line, moving west in a straight line, not up, not down, but mostly straight, much faster than the one i saw last year, it continued a good straight distance then up a little higher to avoid some trees then straight again until it appeared to stop about a mile or two away where it hovered and began slowly changing colors from orange to red to green to a silver/white color while just hovering. seemed to be a little above the tree line at this point and way below the skyline. it remained in that same exact spot for at least 30 minutes. after running to the front and watching it from our street for forever. we got in the car to drive to it and at one point had it in our sight directly in front of our vehicle about half a mile up a country road. as we drove straight towards it we came down a hill and when we got to the top, a second or two later, it was no longer in front of us..Just gone. looked to the right of us, eastwardly, and there it was back in the direction of our house again where we had just left from about another two miles away. almost as if to avoid us. how did it get from in front of our car to 2 miles away in another direction in a matter of 2 seconds?  again, i am so baffled. we all are! and last year, even though my sister and niece experienced the huge white streak across the sky about 20 minutes after my first fireball sighting, i am so very glad that someone else finally saw the orange flame object that i saw last year! i just wish it was closer like it was last year. don't get me wrong... it was still very close but not nearly as close as it came to me last year. but this time my video worked :) and i have a lot of pictures. im thinking it was so close to me last time that it interfered with my cell and it also knocked our cable out. this time, there was a little distance so my phone did not fail!  but the same exact thing happened where it appears much much smaller in video and pictures than what we visually saw. also the shape changes in the video and pictures than what we visually witnessed as well. its so bizarre and i feel like a crazy person when i try to explain it lol a couple pics and the video showed two and three fireballs but we could only see one with our eyes. the shape and movement and all around appearance of what we visually saw is totally different than how it shows up in pics and videos. its a blatant flame like object when you look at it but in the video and pics it shows up as an orange boomarang shaped object and sometimes orb like and even shows up as more than one object in some of the pics and video but visually we could only see one. it is so bizarre but almost identical to my experience last year.

were hanging out, on the park near the esso garage..\r\nit was late after 11 p.\r\n\r\nlooking up at the clear night, having a chat about what life would be like living on another planet, was the chatter at the time, so as we, or i stared into the nights sky, you couldn't help but look at the stars, in doing so, you get to know how the stars look... as i glanced across the skyline i noticed a formation' at first looked like stars, so i began to intensify my view, to my surprise...If you can imagine a triangle with the corner points cut off.... just below each corner two lights making a total of 6 lights' this looked like a star formation... inside the triangle was a circle. an the formation or 'triangle' could only be made out, because of the lights' or what appeared to be stars... again, with this you could make out the black circle inside the triangle.. \r\n\r\ni didn't know what to do' i just felt a rush or buzz as i couldn't take my eyes of it, i told my friend pete' to come an look, i had to get his eyes to travel along my arm to my finger to show him ware to look, an sure enough he sore it, it something that's been with me ever since. i'm not one to brag so i left it as is. well as soon as we saw it' it, only took a fraction of a second to disappear. it didn't go left or right, it went straight up.\r\n\r\nthere is 4 important factors here i would like to
