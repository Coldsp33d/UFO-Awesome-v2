light relatively low-mid on the horizon, that was flickering dramatically many different colors, mainly seemed to be red, blue, white, yellow/orange.  at first i thought it was the star sirius, but was intrigued by it's abnormal seeming brightness and flickering, so i just kept staring at it, standing perfectly still. it was still for a few minutes then started to move to the right very slowly, it was barely noticeable at first, but i was using the tree as guidance and could see that it seemed to be moving. then all of a sudden it went dark, at that point i thought maybe it had been a plane that i was perhaps seeing from behind and that it had just gone off into the distance and was no longer in sight, although that didn't seem to make sense to me.  as i was thinking that the light reappeared in the same spot i last saw it at, still flickering and changing brightness, randomly going dark and then bright again. it moved straight to the right again rather quickly then went dark again, when it reappeared it was to the left of where i had last seen it before it moved to the right quickly. then it went dark again and seemed to be moving to the right again but the trees started to obscure my vision. i wanted to go walk down the street and get a better look, get a better angle, but i had my baby asleep inside sleeping and didn't want to leave him unattended. i stayed out for a few more minutes trying to see it, and either it disappeared or it moved to where i couldn't see it behind the trees/buildings.  i thought maybe it could've been a helicopter, but the brightness/colors of the light and the randomness of the flashing, plus it's odd movements do not comply with my understanding of how one would move. i also stood there and waited in those few minutes to see if a plane or helicopter would come out the other side, passed the trees, in line with where it seemed to be on the horizon, but saw nothing besides a couple other random airplanes that were in the area, but not where i had seen the ufo. so basically it looked very similar to sirius, but brighter with lots of flickering and movement.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line

dirty glass made the pics less than ideal so i went outside on the porch to take them from a similar angle.\r\nit then occurred to me that a photo of the garage in the streetlight might be cool so i moved over a bit to get a better angle. i took one pic and moved the camera very slightly to center the garage door better and took another.\r\ni came inside to copy those pics to my computer when i noticed the odd glowing orb(s) and the fact that it(they) seemed to move a distance of some 40' at about a foot or so off the ground through some rather heavy privet undergrowth in just 18 seconds. i didn't actually see the light(s) at the time i took the pics as i was concentrating on the ���live view��� on the camera monitor for composition.\r\ntoday, april 18, i took a couple of daylight closeups of the areas the light was seen: dsc_0277 and 278. there didn't seem to be any residual evidence, though.\r\ni intend to keep a better eye on the area around my house in the future ��� with

of my new camera when i caught something above me in my peripheral vision.  i first thought it was a white butterfly or balloon.  after a few seconds i eliminated those possibilities as the flight, speed and course direction was invariant.  the object was bright white in color, and round in shape. i watched as it flew and as it stopped abruptly beside another similar object in the sky that was stationary.  the second object may have been moving before i saw it, i didn't notice it until the first object i was following with my eyes stopped beside it.  after a few seconds both objects quickly flew in opposite directions.  i thought it was odd that they did not seem to need to gain speed as one does in an airplane. they seemingly began flying as if they'd not stopped.  i then focused on the second object as it was flying in a direction that i wouldn't have an obstructed view.  i lost sight of that second object when i was distracted by a third object the second object flew near.  this object was round in shape like the first two, but was much higher in the sky and appeared to be much bigger, brighter, and more of a silver 'mirror' type of color rather than white.  it's shape was round, but it seemed to be changing form/shape as it ''drifted' downward. i didn't think at the time that it was drifting laterally, just descending slowly toward the earth/ground.  it began to reveal a 'snake-like' tail.  as it descended it appeared to be getting bigger, brighter, and began developing a longer and longer tail (double tail) as it's shape continued to change. as i watched it drift and morph in shape.  i then saw a fourth object fly across and under it.  this fourth object was smaller, flying at a much higher rate of speed and was farther away than the first two. i looked back to try and focus on the larger drifting object when i noticed a similar 'tail' in the shape of the letter 'c' .  my thought was that there was going to be an object to which it would be attached, but i didn't see one.  i squinted my eyes and noticed two more of these flying objects which were flying in opposite directions of each other.  i lost sight of all of the flying objects for different reasons, my attention diverted time after time by the number of objects, obstruction of objects due to trees, the objects getting to far away to maintain focus, and finally, the brightness of the mid-morning sky.  i tried to snap pictures, but, my camera was new and i did not have a good grasp on its technical aspects at that point. i put the pics on the computer and it was as i expected it would be.  i captured some of them, but the quality was not really there.  i tried adjusting contrast/removing color, etcetera, and it did help see some of the objects that couldn't be seen otherwise, but there is not great clarity. the entire scene lasted for approximately 4-5-6 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional

the craft looked as if it fell a few hundred feet in approximately 1-2 seconds then hovered changed colors, and began an erratic dance like flight pattern where it would rapidly descend hover head west stop on a dime and change direction back to the east, ascend very rapidly then drop below the tree line and even the roof line, and change direction like nothing on earth can -

old, approx 3 am, i awoke in upstairs bedroom at my grandparents home. my bed faced a window on second floor and i don't know why i awaoke but there was a bright light in the room, glowing but not blinding. there were 3 other children sleeping in the room with me, as i looked around and sat up, everyone else was sound asleep and not moving. then outside as i looked through the window i saw orbs of light, red and green i remember clearly about the size of golf balls. they were moving in a circular rotation around eachohter, like orbiting i guess you could describ it and were moving towards the window of my room. i was confused and felt frightened but couldnt scream or cry, i looked for someone to wake up but nobody did.  the orbs of light continued to descend down and closer to the windown and cam e right thru the closed glass and into the room. they stopped and hovered, still rotating in the circular orbiting motion right about me. this experience lasted for a few minutes and then i have no memory. the next morning i didn't speak about it to anyone else. but i couldn't shake the experience, it did not feel like a dream at all. as i was in that same room playing on the floor with another child the window that they came thru the night before was closed and suddenly burst and shattered outwards. neither of us were even close to it, nothing was flung to break it and we sat astonished. we got blamed for breaking that window but to this day i know we did not. i did't tell anyone about what happened the night before. my next experience happened at about 8 to 10 years of age i believe. this time in a neighboring state, 3 entitites, i still can remember them vividly actually appeared in my bedroom in the middle of the night. one on each side of me and one behind me or towards my head. i could only see that on if i lifted my head backwards to see it. the others were one on each side and my bed i felt or maybe just me was raised up above the normal level of the bed. this was the only time i saw the beings, they did not look like the typical et's that are described with big eyes and strange shaped head, they weren't pretty at all and not human for sure. as time passed throughout my lifetime i have had multiple paranormal activity follow me and just recently i have seen crafts hovering and at times on a daily basis. i have been followed by these orbs and i am not crazy. i have time missing on several occassions or have woken with my clothes on backwards or no memory of how i got from one place to another. so much more to tell but this is all just not starting to affect me and i feel intuition and other strange things occuring to my body. the rest i will save to relay to an investigator is one would like to contact me. i would appreciate any reply

1989 about 3 hours before sundown. to my left, to the south, i noticed a falling bright ball of fire dropping straight down, directly over mission bay, perhaps 2 or no more than 3 miles as the crow flies from where we were driving. for a brief moment i thought it might have been a shooting star but it was too light for that. to my surprise, and frankly, my astonishment, it suddenly stopped in mid-air, i estimate not quite a thousand feet above the water.  as it did so, the \"fire\" seemed to collapse into itself, as if it was absorbed by the object. \r\nit then immediately emitted a bright \"explosion\" of light to reveal a dark, solid rectangular looking object that looked to be a little larger than a full size car, after which it hovered in the air for a few moments. \r\nit then began slowly moving horizontally in a north west direction. \r\nall of this happened inside of a span of perhaps 45 to 60 seconds.\r\ni hurried home to get our video camera which took about 4 minutes

house next door to my aunt, -----------, just right up the road from us, we had become fast friends, went rock hounding together a lot), i was 16 years old, was living on the family farm.  we shared a party line with my aunt.  now my former younger brother (and his new wife), will not know about this event because they did not witness the event.\r\n\r\nit was christmas eve, 1978.  it was not long before that christmas of 1978 which --------- wife had died of cancer, yet as long as he rented the old farmhouse from my aunt, he spent every christmas eve and christmas day with us, along with some thanksgivings and sometimes he stayed with us on easter.  i had received a new refracting telescope for that christmas from my parents, i had just installed the 12 mm lens into the focal tubing, and ron had stepped outside to smoke a cigarette.  there were many people inside my home for christmas, as it was for every christmas until christmas of 2005, which by that time most of the family members had passed away.   \r\n\r\nanyway, ------- came running back into the house all excited, and yelled for me to get my new meade refracting telescope and bring it outside!  it was 8:00 pm, est.  when i got outside on the sidewalk, ------- pointed to the northwest, and by our viewpoint if you would imagine the height above the western tree line on the property the object was, plus factor in the distance away, it would have been roughly 12 feet above the western tree line.  unforunately, that western tree line along with much of the forest lands on the family farm were destroyed by hurricane hugo on september 22-23, 1989.   i saw what ------- was so excited about what we were witnessing to the northwest of us, there were absolutely no sounds to be heard, and whatever it was did not move that quickly as far as the naked eye was concerned.  i have heard dead silence many times, so quiet in fact even to hear the snow flakes land on the ground was deafening if you listened close enough.  even then while the snow was falling, with no sounds from any wildlife, cattle, goats, pigs, etc., it was not as quiet as it was that christmas eve of 1978 at 8:00 pm est.  to the naked eye, it appeared as a large yellowish-white circular ball of light, about the size of a ping-pong ball, that did not brighten up nor did it ever dim as it journeyed towards the southwestern skies over the ------------------ of ------------.\r\n\r\ni had already set my telescope up outside on the sidewalk, with that 12 mm lens, and ------- was training the telescope in on it.  he was so excited, and then he grabbed my new christmas flannel shirt so i could view the object through my new meade telescope as well.  it was difficult for me to keep my telescope trained upon the ufo by this time because it had increased in speed as it journeyed from the northwestern skies towards the southwestern skies on that christmas eve of 1978.  what i saw through the eyepiece of the telescope was amazing.  the ufo was oblong in shape, brightly lit up, not in lights mind you, but it just glowed all over.  on the bottom of the ufo i clearly saw (and i have not ever forgotten this), there were 3 very distinctive black rectangular shaped markings, almost flared out on the ends to appear somewhat like a slightly stubby capital letter \"i,\"  which extended nearly all the way across the widest part of the bottom of the ufo.  what those markings represented, or whatever their function was with the operation of the ufo, neither ------- nor myself knew.  we both had saw the same thing, we both saw the same markings on the bottom of the oblong shaped ufo, and we both saw that it had no visible lights, instead the entire body of the ufo seem to glow brightly, as a lightning bug would glow when it flashes to attract a mate (unless it eaten by a bat or some other predator).  lightning bugs are themselves carnivorous, and it took a few years for me to figure that out as a child when i captured them inside a very large mason jar with grass inside thinking they ate plants; was i ever wrong.  i was a young child, and did not know lightning bugs were carnivorous.  \r\n\r\ni kept trying to keep the ufo in view of my eyepiece with my new meade telescope, even with the 12 mm lens because that gave me the widest view possible while viewing through the telescope, but by now it had become impossible to keep up with it.  both ------- and i could not get over just how dead quiet everything was, and the object emitted no sounds what-so-ever.  i stood up, and looked at ------- after he told me to keep trying to track the ufo, and i had to tell him there was no way by that time i could keep up with it.  we both stood there for about 30 more seconds while watching the ufo continue towards the southwest, headed towards the ------------------ of -----------.  all at once the ufo gave off a very bright flash, and in what i have to admit was a 90 degree arching right hand angled rainbow, it sped off and disappeared into what i must admit was outer space.  ------- and i both just stood there looking to the southwest, we would look at each other, ----- eyes and facial expressions were full of excitement, as well mine, and then we both went running back into the house to tell everyone what we had just witnessed.  of course everyone laughed about it, but we were not teased about the encounter.  after that incident, every year since then just right before 8:00 pm est on christmas eve, weather permitting, while i lived in the ----------------------------, and ----------------------, areas, i would go outside and stand there looking towards the northwest and i would scan the skies all the way down through the southwest.  since i have moved from north carolina, to nebraska, i will also scan the northeastern to southeastern skies, weather permitting, starting at 7:00 pm cst.\r\n\r\ni attended ------------------------- that previous 1977-1978 school year, the last year ----------------------------, and ---------------------, had a high school, and my professional life began not after i had graduated from south caldwell high school in 1980.  i went on to college at ------------------------- in august of 1980, and attended ------------------------- off and on until 1984 when i finished my major in forest management technology, but i also had earned several other certifications.  i worked part-time for the north carolina forest service on a part-time basis, usually when needed, from august of 1980 until december of 1993, my name stayed on their contact list when needed until that date.  my duties included: wildfire control anywhere in the continental united states, reforestation projects, some law enforcement, surveys of all kinds, some public relations, smoke spotter, and a smoke chaser, in other words i was a trained observer.  i had to be very observant of my surroundings, and to report accurately.  i was formally let go that december of 1993 because of massive north carolina state budget cuts.  \r\n\r\nit was a good thing i always had my full-time truck driving jobs to fall back on which i started driving trucks in the summer of 1978, on my first real paying job while in high school.  i drove trucks during the other summers of 1979, 1980, during the spring and summer of 1981, spring and summer of 1982, winter-spring-summer of 1983, and i started driving trucks full-time in the late spring of 1984, after i had formally finished my college education at -------------------------, and i had received my associates in applied science degree in 1984, along with the other certifications i had earned along the way during those 4 years i had spent off and on at -------------------------.  \r\n\r\nlater in the spring of 1993, because of the new federal cdl regulations taking effect, and because the drivers license examiners told me i could get my cdl-a license for the same price as what it would have cost me to \"grandfather\" into a cdl-b license.  i went just down the highway from the n.C. drivers license bureau to -------------------------- and i inquired about the professional truck driving program.  i signed up for it, and i had to go get my cdl-a student drivers license the day before i graduated because my license allowed me to drive their big rigs as long as they were empty.  it was a big laugh between myself and the staff there at --------------------------.  i graduated on top of the class because to be honest truck driving had always came naturally to me.  i also earned several other certifications from -------------------------- during that spring course in 1993.  \r\n\r\noverall, i have 24 years experience driving trucks, and i was also a professional truck driver instructor.  part of the job, you must be very aware of everything going on around you at all times because to be bluntly honest a 18 wheeler semi-truck is nothing more than 80,000 pounds of rolling death.  you will always lose if you try to tangle with a large 18 wheeled semi-truck, and no a 18 wheeler semi-truck does not have 18 brakes, it has 10 brakes.  two examples i will provide:  a fully loaded 18 wheeler will take about 100 yards at 55 mph to come to a complete stop without sliding it's tires.  a completely empty 18 wheeler will take about 105 yards to 110 yards at 55 mph to come to a complete stop.\r\n\r\na few years back, while i was married to my second wife, and i was watching a program about ufo's.  the program largely centered around sightings in brazil.  to my astonishment, one of the photos of a ufo was exactly like the one my friend, ------- and myself had witnessed that christmas eve in 1978.  i paused the satellite television program, i was so excited, and i was yelling excitedly for my wife to come into the living room.  i had backed the program up and let it play so that the program would show the picture of the ufo which i had seen back on christmas eve of 1978, so that my wife could see what i had told her about so many times regarding what ------- and i had seen that christmas eve of 1978, the only differences being this photo was snapped during the daytime, the ufo itself was not glowing, and you could clearly see the exact same shaped ufo, with it's bottom turned towards the photographer, with those exact same 3 rectangular shaped sort of stubby \"i\" shaped markings on the bottom of the ufo.  \r\n\r\nwell, i wanted you to know what i had seen that christmas eve of 1978.  every year on that time i go outside, weather permitting, and i will observe the northwestern to southwestern skies for any signs of movement.  now since i have moved from north carolina, to nebraska, i also observe the northeastern to southeastern skies on christmas eve, again weather permitting, starting at 7:00 pm cst.  \r\n\r\nthank you for your time and allowing me to tell you my true story.  i also contacted ufo hunters with my story many years ago, but i received no response.  it would be nice if someone would take me seriously, understand i am a trained observer or at least was, and let me know something...Even if that someone can send me a photo of the ufo i had saw back on christmas eve of 1978, as well on the television program about ufo's some two decades ago while i had directv as my satellite television provider.  \r\n\r\nsincerely yours, ------------\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n ","distance":"Over One

be a square/rectagular object hovering very slowly east to west. it had 4 corners, one held a round green light, the opposite a red  (on each side of it's \"wingspan\") on the front and back it had white lights. it slowly hovered over me as i filmed it in the superstore parking lot at the west edge of the parking lot. it moved from one end of the lot at about 40 kph nearly silent except for a subtle static noise, and took maybe 20-30 seconds to pass over me. it then slowed, seemingly picked up speed and left, then returned within 20 seconds toward me. i subsequently drove my car away.\r\n\r\n\r\nthis happened at the west edge of london, somewhat north west of city center. it appeared as if the object cleared a final residential area pas the river, then turned and came back into town. \r\n\r\n\r\nthe shapes between the four corners of light (from a direct underneath view) were composed of many straight lings, rectangular and square in nature--almost like 6\" thick black rectangle and square walls with varying lengths overlapping each other but each side was almost always (if not always) parallel to the other (making them rectangles and squares). it appeared to be more long from far wing (north) to close wing (south facing wing) than it appeared to be from front (west moving) to back (east moving). the only close comparison would be an underside view of the millenium falcon from star wars, travelling sideways. it was non-symetrical and moved too slowly to be generating lift, and with not even enough sound to be a silent (stealth) helicopter. \r\n\r\ncould be a weather balloon but it changed directions as viewable on film so fast and looked so obscure and indefinable i feel it's highly unlikely. my only other man made explanations are some kind of balloon/blimp device not commonly known (shape seen like what i saw in kitchener recently and in london recently the last 2 years i believe), a drone of some type, or a lowered hanging object dangled by a helicopter or drone of some type.   \r\n\r\nat first the object appeared to be two red lights dimly glowing and hovering stationary, however it was at such a distance the lights were
