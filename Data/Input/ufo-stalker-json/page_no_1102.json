toward my vehicle when i spotted a silver, metallic ball, roughly the size of a quarter held at arm���s length, travelling from north to south, approximately 200 feet off the ground, and at a speed of about 120 mph. it flew at a steady rate and made absolutely no noise. i cannot recall the wind conditions at the time, but i do recall it was clear and sunny that day.\r\n\r\nit took less than 10

could recognize and i knew immediately it was unusual.\r\n\r\ni have been interested in the ufo phenomenon for years but i have never seen one before or since this event. my reaction was strange because i just stood there in the parking lot and watched it go by. i did not have enough time to register what i was seeing and get the attention of other people in the parking lot. after the event, i looked around but oddly enough there was nobody else nearby who may have also seen the object.\r\n\r\ni am not sure why i waited so long to report it. for some reason i just put it off and then

when we saw a huge light over into the field which belonged to the navy seabee base. as we got closer to their house we were trying to figure out what this massive light was with each of us throwing out ideas about night maneuvers by the seabees, but as we listened and watched we heard no helicopters or could we hear men shouting. then someone said it was a fire , but there were no fire engines, men, or anything in that field of grass on the ground which would burn like that, nor was the light flickering or moving as flames would do. as we were discussing what we were seeing it became clear to us that this was a craft of some type and all of us agreed that there was nothing on god's green earth that looked like that. we were whispering at this point and weren't sure why our voices had lowered but there was absolute silence as we stood to watch this eerie light...Pure orange on the bottom and yellow on the top. it was a massive oblong shape and domed on the top.It was probably about fifteen hundred to two thousand feet in width and about five stories high. we were a quarter mile or less away from it and could see quite clearly into the field . we stood to watch for about thirty minutes , but two of the little ones began to get scared for some reason so our friends began to\r\n walk into their house. my brothers turned to walk back to our home about five hundred feet back up the street. i still stood there watching to see if it would begin to rise or do anything. finally i walked back up to our house but i'd return to the front porch to see if i could see it rise into the air but i never did. what was weird is that none of us discussed what we had seen that night...Ever. i will never forget that night though, and now that i'm sixty i wanted to leave this in case someone else by chance had seen something like this.The seabees never even used that land back in those years nor were there any roads back there. the image has stayed in my mind all these years so clearly, the weather was a beautiful clear summer night with not a cloud in the sky. i wanted to let you know too that we only lived about a mile from the beach.I wanted to go into that field so badly the next morning, but the base had a barbed wire fence up with no trespassing signs up and being pretty good kids we never thought about crossing over onto government property. thank you so much for taking my report , and i feel much better knowing it will be on file.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

approximately 30 minutes before sundown. the cloud was such a lovely color that i had actually thought of taking my camcorder out on the back deck to film it for a bit, but decided at the last moment not to do so. after only about 5 seconds after i walked out onto the back deck and looking toward the east at the cloud, a very large black triangular shaped craft suddenly materialized over the cloud and became observable first from the front and then along to the back. it made a complete 90 degree turn instantaneously to the south and just after doing so it dematerialized again from the front to the back. the turn it made was without slowing down at all and it was such a fast turn that the front of the craft was pointed east and then in an instant it was pointed south. the craft was not flat underneath, but rather came down a bit to what i would call a ridge along the entire craft from front to back along the center of the underside. i witnessed a large amount of what i would call superstructure on the top leading up from the sides and appeared to me to be something like large multiple floors for lack of a better word. the rear of the craft was basically flat and i saw that after it turned southward. there was absolutely no noise coming from the craft and it did not disturb the cloud whatsoever even though it appeared to be right above the cloud. i could hardly believe what i had just witnessed and wished so strongly that i had taken the camcorder out with me as i first had thought to do. the biggest thought to hit my mind other than surprise was the shear size of this craft. if i had to estimate the size i would say that it was at least 2500' from side to side and possibly 5000' from front to back. i've never shared this sighting with anyone but my wife and

son about,and to have him come outside to see for himself ,so he did and he wasn't as thrilled as i was but,i was able to share something that i thought was pretty neat with him. at the time i didn't see anything unusual so i went in and went to bed.The next night was saturday night early sunday morning and i went out to let my dog out. the moon was just as bright and the star was still there as bright as the night before except this time the star moved and that freaked me out,i wasn't sure if my mind or eyes were messing with me so i took my phone out of my robe pocket and and was trying to figure out how to use the camera. i went in the house and asked my son to help me take a picture of the star because it moved and i couldn't figure out my camera he took my phone and took a picture from his window and all you could see was his screen and the star, so i took my phone because he had it on the camera and i went outside and started snapping pictures. my son and i looked them over and were amazed at what i had caught on camera so i got a little scared and decided i would stop for the night. on sunday night the 13th of april 2014 into the early morning of monday the 14th of april 2014 i took my dog out and again looked for that star but this time the moon was over to the left of my house and it was just a half moon, but the star was right in front of my house and it was doing all sorts of things so i started taking pictures and then i realized i could do videos from my phone and i did one and stop after a few minutes,then i tried again and i did a second one and stop,but then i saw it breaking up into three parts and i took more pictures and i started video and i got this sphere shape object spinning very fast with something in it and with a sound i have to be able to make it with my mouth in order for you to understand how it sounded. as i was recording it was fairly cold out and as the sphere seemed to get closer i noticed a sense of calm and warmth come over and then the sound seemed as though it was right in my ear and possibly right above me or behind me so i turned around to see if it was in,even though i could see it in front of me i thought maybe there was two. thank goodness there was nothing behind or above me,just in front of me and then i got really afraid and i stopped and went in side. i will not release my video or photos. your company can send someone to talk with me and view what i have and then we can go from there you have my phone number,my e-mail,and my address please contact me i am very afraid and really don't know what to do. thank you for viewing  [name removed/cms/tg]","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with

directly above us, i started getting the chills and i tensed up. all i could get out of my mouth was \"cloaking, cloaking!\" my other two friends started looking up around this time. it started to move and every star that it went in front of another star that it covered was projected on the front of the craft like it didn't want to be seen. it had a cloaking device, as it hovered over the house, it did some type of glitch and the cloaking device that surrounded the whole ship lit up and it appeared to be a greenish blue light, and then it went completely black and took off, and i watched it fly away towards the west coast. when it was flying off i could make out two big weird light looking circles on each side of the boomerang. when it was black it looked like it was something

thomas usvi to atlanta, ga in december of 2013. i hadn���t flown in several years, and being excited to go home and see my family and friends, i was randomly taking video of the clouds and ground. yeah i know ...Korny. bear with me. i didnt��� realize until i got home from my vacation 10 days later and was watching all my videos and reviewing pics that i had captured something that i cannot explain. it is very large and seems to be moving from left to right in the top of the screen. it was at a great distance away...I���d say 20 miles out...And had to have been ���miles��� across to be visible at that distance. i have flown with the navy and all over the us and caribbean for many years. this is simply a huge object. i posted it on facebook to some close friends and several thought it was exceptional. the reason i am sending this to you is that i happened to see a show on h2 (ufo hunters)today[episode original airing 02-04-09] and two different  pilots (a british guy and a french) seemed to have seen the same thing i did. the difference is that his object seemed to emanate light while mine seems to be very black. after watching the video several times i also noticed a flat contrail from the top right of my video that appears to lead right to the object in the distance. this could just be an old jet-contrail that spread out over time, but if so then a jet would have had have passed right by this thing at some point. it is moving very slowly from left to right, then speeds up and crosses the contrail by the end of the video. i have the full length video but i am sure i will only be able to email you this short version. i���ll try both tho. please take a look and tell me what you think.\r\nthanks andy \r\n \r\n\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

bed wrapped up really tightly and i would imagine myself being inside a spaceship which would feel very safe and secure. i would also often dream of floating above my neighbourhood and looking down on the houses below. i had these experiences up till i was about 8.\r\nan incident happened when i was 8 in a bedroom i shared with my 2 older sisters. one of my sisters woke and saw a tall woman with really blond hair standing at the foot of my bed. my sister was really afraid and went to scream but the woman just looked at her and she said she couldn't move or make a noise and either passed out or fell asleep. the same night my oldest sister who would have been about 17 woke and saw the same woman who said to me while i slept \"come on roy its time to go now.\" at this point both my sisters were awake and started to scream. apparently the blonde woman swung around and looked really shocked that the girls had seen her and she just disappeared. my sisters have religiously stood by this event for 45 years. i have no memory of the event. in the same house my father woke to see different coloured lights in my parents room and was that scared he grabbed my mum and wouldn't let her turn round. he would never talk in depth about that experience but was a great believer that life existed in another dimension.\r\nthe most recent event i experienced was in july 2011 when i woke and saw this small being at the bottom of my bed. it looked like a gray, about 4 ft tall black almond eyes a small nose and a slit for a mouth. it had spindly arms and i could only see it to just past its shoulders because of where it was standing closer to my wife's side. i was not surprised to see it nor did i panic. i felt this was a normal event and was very calm. i sat up and focused on the gray which seemed to have 2 small an tenors on its head. he looked at me didn't move his mouth but i felt him say to me. \"its ok just lie down and go back to sleep, your not supposed to see this. everthing is alright.\" i laid down and closed my eyes and went back to sleep.\r\ni have no idea why i was so calm and did as i was asked.\r\nmy wife doesn't like me to talk about it and maybe thinks i was dreaming. i am absolutely sure i wasn't.

turned to the left (west) and saw a bright blue \"large sized star\" object shoot from the tree line up towards the brightest star in the sky in less than one second.\r\n\r\nthe blue light now made a weird irregular box pattern where it went to the right about an inch, down, to the left, up, right, up, down, left, then back to the previous spot at the star.  during this time the light remained the dark blue color.  during this time, we were trying to make sense out of what it is we were looking at.\r\n\r\nnext, the object started to hover but expanded to the size of a dime and was bright blue.  inside the blue led looking light we saw black features and lines on the object.  the color suddenly changed to a green, then to a deep red, then an orangish/yellow, then to an intense bright white.  each color was emitted for roughly 2-3 seconds without flashing.\r\n\r\nafter the series of color changes, the object immediately shrank back down to the star size and returned to a blue dot which moved in the sky.  at this time i realized i was seeing something unique and took out my phone to record a video.  we watched this phenomenon for approximately 45-60 seconds before i recorded the remaining portion of the sighting.\r\n\r\nthe video is 28 seconds and shows the blue star descend towards the tree line, changing color to green, then to white.  it now goes behind the trees to the left, pops back out to the right, increases in size, grows larger and turns white, then goes left into the trees, starts flashing, and then it left.\r\n\r\nwe heard a noise on 3 separate occasions while watching the craft.  at first, i thought the noise was generated from a screen door opening and making a low creaking noise.  however, the slight hum occured just before the object ascended or descended.  during the actual path, the object was quiet.  it was a quick burst of a humming noise that could have easily been talked over.\r\n\r\nthe event did not leave an uncomfortable feeling with either of us the feelign was pretty soothing as we were watching this.  both of us were in complete disbelief of what we noticed that night.  when we saw the object increase in size and begin the color sequence, we both realized that we saw a ufo.  here are a couple other pertinent details:\r\n     1. dallas ft. worth airport 20 miles south of the sighting.\r\n     2. airplanes were making their initial descent in the background\r\n        before and after the event (not during).\r\n     3. it would take an airplane approximately 30 seconds to travel the \r\n        path that this object could cover in less than one second\r\n     4. there are only two rows of streets between the sighting and  \r\n        lewisville lake\r\n     5. lewisville lake is approximately 2,000 feet due west from the house\r\n     6. between the lake and houses are hiking trails \r\n     7. it was clear that the object was flying above the lake\r\n     8. route 35e crosses this lake on a bridge about 5 miles west of the \r\n        spot we were at.  there are no lights from the horizon in that  \r\n

bed. walked into my back yard and looked up at the stars. being in salt lake the stars were a little faded because of light pollution. i was thinking what a beautiful night it would be away from the city. i looked to the east towards the wasatch mountains, through a black walnut tree(no leaves yet) i saw a bright light. slightly red, my first thought was that i was looking at mars...Then i thought that is too far north for mars so i looked slightly south through a box elder tree and saw mars. i looked back at the light while reaching for my phone to find out what star it was, when it began to move, south and east. at about a 40 degree angle to the horizon. slowly at first then faster as it faded to a pinpoint and disappeared. i wasn't sure what i had just seen so i sat there for a few seconds pondering what it could have been when another light appeared and began to move in the same way. this time traveling at about the same speed but in the north easterly direction and about 30 degrees to the horizon doing exactly the same distance across the sky(approximately 5\")maybe the width of a softball held at arms length. the lights faded to a pinpoint then disappeared both times giving me the impression that it was ascending very fast. at first i thought that the light went behind a cloud, but where they both disappeared i could still see stars. the whole sighting lasted about 20 seconds. not enough time to get video or pictures. i watched for about another 5 minutes phone ready for video(enough time to finish my smoke) and didn't see anything more. i pondered what this could have been. i know it was not a meteor, plane, rocket or helicopter. it traveled in a straight line that gave me the impression it was going up at an angle.\r\n\r\nmy background.\r\ni have

and looked up. there were almost no city light, thus, making it very clear to see. called out to my girlfriend (both sober) and i was awe struck. i felt an immediate connection and it came closer. my grandfather and i were airplane buffs - he built his first plane when 17 - it flew. the motions appeared as if you you were watching a bus go east at 35 mph while a juggler walked west while juggling, but w/ perfect symmetry. the object seemed as if it dropped from 20,000' to under 10,000' then went back up and shot off just like in a movie to the ne sky into a thick constellation- if i recall correctly. my girlfriend's father was not even phased. he was was a scientist w/ the u.S. air force. he was like \"yeah\". he almost seemed that he was aware and was considering retiring. two weeks later i was walking into my house and my girlfriend and mother were sitting about 18 feet away from me. as i walked through the door a flash of white light consumed me in 12' to 15' radius. they both saw it. maybe a month or two later while visiting my mother i felt a strange sensation in my head as if my dominant eye was going from right to left. i held my hand over my eye and sure enough, i was now left eye dominant. my left hand became so much more useful but only lasted a couple of weeks. i've never felt comfortable about coming out and i'm not sure i ever will. i would just like answers. \r\n   \r\n   i met w/ a chineese medicine guru who hipnotized me in 2000 while living in los angeles. afterwards i was crying and he said i'd been abducted as a child. i thought it was b.S., however, his story was just like a reoccurring dream i had be\r\ntween the age 3 and 5 where i was in my own house w/ greys doing experiments, but i was never frightened until i woke up, because i couldn't move for minutes and my parents would never wake up. i do remember one time where they would not wake up, but i don't recall anything before that. i'd take a lie detector test in a heart beat. i never felt threatened by these dreams. in fact when i experienced the left eye dominance shift. i felt as if i saw the the universe and felt as if i were levitating, but perhaps not. i saw the davinci man and then almost a tunnel of truths and enlightenment. everything else in the world seems insignificant now. and feel as if i'm waiting to find out something more. please keep my info private. i'm not sure if my ex or her father would come forward. so i don't feel comfortable disclosing that information at this juncture. i would like to talk to a few others that have experienced this who are not full of b.S. conspiracy theorists that have been through the same thing. \r\n\r\n     thank you for listening,\r\n      cope till\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

was taking photos from inside my car of the moon. i noticed to bright objects above the moon but to the east, slowly moving toward the moon. there was a red orb like object above the larger yellowish one, at approximately 45 degrees, however they appeared to be moving toward the moon in unison. i said out loud, \"what are those?\" and my girlfriend said, \"i don't know....Weird.\" i took a few photos with my cell camera as the objects \"drifted\" closer to the moon, the largest one now parallel with the moon.  they began to descend below the moon and then i switched the camera to video and got about ten seconds or so on video before they seemed to completely vanish. i replayed to video to see if i had indeed captured whatever they were and saw that i had. we both stayed for approx. another half an hour watching the eclipse and scanning the skies for any sign of moving objects but saw none. we both kept asking each other what we thought they were and came up with everything from some kind of nasa observation drones, to satellites to extraterrestrial craft. \r\nwe are both still baffled. i ran the photos through the effects program on my camera, and uploaded them to my facebook page, including the video. what i found astounding on the video is the larger \"object\" appears to be pulsating or spinning as there is a definite bright dot that looks to be spinning around the center of the object and disappearing behind the \"craft\" in a clockwise motion.  \r\nphoto 131 is just prior to the objects appearing and 135 is just after they disappeared.\r\nphotos 132 and 133 are the objects, and 134 is the video.\r\ni transferred these directly from my cell camera to my computer. the video appears to be rotated 45 degrees to the left from the actual view. the actual orientation of the objects to the moon are shown in the photos.
