dismissed because it appears to go behind the trees and dim behind clouds. b) an airplane; not entirely dismissed, but inconsistent with other observed air traffic. c) the international space station; still my best guess due to direction of travel and relation to the sun, but i was not able to confirm that the iss was traveling along this path at that time. i have attached a video clip of the object that includes the original video and a zoomed repeat of the same footage. in the original footage the object appears to emerge from behind the clouds about one quarter of the screen from the left and a quarter from the top and is quickly and briefly obscured by a tree, then is clearly seen until it flies out of picture near the top and center of the picture.\r\n\r\ni still have the original file in full on the memory card in the camera. i have not removed the video card from the camera. i just copied the file to my computer and cut the clip from the copied file.\r\n\r\nit is probably an airplane, but that doesn't feel right to me when i see it. perhaps you can confirm that it was an airplane. that would make me feel better. it is just bugging me.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:00:14","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":55496,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.25322854923308,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04162014-0022","longitude":-88.34064604011662,"occurred":1394383140000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1397707246000,"summary":"Dash-cam captured flying object near crystal lake, il.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/55496_submitter_file1__UFO.mpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"60012","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":38,"locationName":"Crystal Lake, Illinois","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:173074"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Ocoee","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"While standing outdoors at the manheim auto auction site in ocoee, florida our crew noticed an unusual ring around the sun. the day was bright and sunny with a few light clouds in the sky.  the ring around the sun was quite large and the outer edge had orange, yellow, and blue rings and the inside of the large ring was darker than the rest of the sky.  we quickly learned that this phenomenon was called a corona.  amazed at the site of this large ring around the sun, which i have never viewed before, i took 14 pictures with my iphone 5.  the time lapses between the pictures was not noted at the time.  but i can remember taking several pictures back to back as quick as i could touch the phone and within seconds during two different times.  being unaware of the object in the photo until the pictures were downloaded onto my desktop computer, when i pulled them up on photo gallery i got goose bumps, and said to myself, \"i believe i just photographed a ufo\".  and after viewing the pictures the object seemed to travel quite far in the short space of time it took to hit the iphone to snap the picture.  the pictures show the object at different points after each photograph was taken.  there seems to be two objects in a photo, one a bright white and one purple.   one picture seems to show an unusual reflection of yellow and purple light from the white ufo.  the objects seem to disappear behind the sun and re-appear to the left of the sun.  the last picture taken showed the white object near the bottom of the sun and the purple object moving down away from the sun with a purple beam in front of it. the pictures are in sequential order and 4 were not included because of limited space.  the last photo, 10th, was actually the last photo taken.  hopefully, a travel path can be determined from the photos.  it would seem probable that more photographs were taken of this corona, hopefully, these are not the only photographs you receive.

fast and clouds do not keep their structure like that when moving. it was weird, like seeing something from a star trek movie were they have a cloaking device on the plane. no sound was coming from

in the entire sky and no wind blowing. i first noticed the object because there was nothing else moving above ground level. i was startled to see this thing, because it was a foreign object floating around in a place where foreign objects aren't supposed to be (in the middle of a chemical plant), so that's why i started paying attention to it. then it fascinated me, because i couldn't figure out what it was or what it was doing, so that's why i kept watching it for the 5 minutes or so until it moved out of sight.\r\n\r\nsaw a perfectly round white object about the size of a volleyball ascending at a height of about 10 feet from behind a building approximately 40 feet in front of me. it ascended slowly to a height of about 40-50 feet while traveling due north. it continued traveling due north for a half-mile or so, then stopped and came back due south until it was directly above me, then went straight up until it diminished to pinprick size and finally disappeared completely.\r\n\r\ni first perceived the object as being circular (flat). but it never seemed to change shape regardless of my perspective of it, so i later changed my perception from circular to spherical. in retrospect, it seemed to have been a round ball of light, which never changed color or brightness in the entire time i watched it.\r\n\r\nmy reactions during the sighting were to move a short distance away from my original vantage point to get a clear view of its movement, look around for any people to witness it with me, and just be shocked at what i was seeing. a couple of people finally came by after it was ascending straight up, and i pointed it out to them. they both said it was probably either a satellite or a weather balloon and didn't think anything about it. after it disappeared, i went inside and told my boss and a coworker what i had seen. then i went to the guard-shack to see if their video cameras had by any chance captured any of this. unfortunately, it hadn't been pointed in the right direction. i mentioned it to a couple of other coworkers over the next few days, mainly hoping to hear that one of them might have seen it as well, but none of them had.\r\n\r\nthat night, i emailed my family & told them about it. i also looked for a website to report it. i wasn't aware of mufon at the time, so reported it to some other site. no clue which one it was, and never had any response from them. i actually regretted doing that later, because i figured it put me on some list of crazy people that need to be monitored.\r\n\r\njust looked back at the emails to my family to come up with the exact date before typing this, so i see it's been 2-1/2 years since this happened. and it's still bothering me, because i have no idea what it was, and i think about it frequently. i used to think all those people seeing ufos were crazy, now i'm mad that i can't get an explanation for what i saw with my own two eyes.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet,

have sat on this 2 part video for over a year mostly out of my own paranoia. after having several of my close friends watch this and pressure me to release it i have decided to do so.. any help that can be given in the analysis of this video would be appreciated. i would also like to apologize for the coarse language from time to time in the videos as my excitement was getting the better of me.","distance":"Over One

please come tell her what was in the sky, when i got there i took the telescope first and was amazed shocked and kind of frightened, because it was nothing of like anything i'd seen before. the first view i had of it, it was so low, and then i could see that it was sorta jerking in a quick direction and then it went up, came down finally and hovered for a long time, it would repeat itself, but one time while watching it, i ask my friend did you see that, it was some energy or light bolted like lightening but fast and very quick.

could be... a jet flying toward us? a volcano erupting? it seemed to be hovering near a mountain range. i quickly grabbed my camera while keeping my eyes on the object. as i watched the screen while trying to focus, i was alarmed by a very clear honeycombed pattern! i was unable to capture that image, but i've never seen anything quite like that. a smaller object then flew from the the larger object, appearing to be headed in our direction.\r\ni continued to stare until we flew out of sight.\r\n\r\ni'll attach a few photos in the order that i took

activity of ufo istarted when moon tourned red. i saw a triangular object moving in weird directions it had one light at tip than another at far end, than at other end was a pulsating light. it was moving up down left right figure 8 very smooth gliding. than noticed to the east of it were about 1 dozen small objects flying around some shooting like flares and others blinking lights, in no order that made any sense or had a pattern, sometimes there were no blinks for a while. the smaller lights at one point got into fornation which it kind of looked like it was preparing to go into a mother ship, it had one light at the top the formation lines in the middle and one light at bottom.  some seemed to be diamond shaped but some seemed to look star like. regarldess. \r\ni watch the sky's often and never saw movement or anything like this before. some of the blinks of lights actually looked like this symbol -= a sold line with 2 dashes. the colors varied on all but the triangular one had stead orange lights in the corners. it took me a while to realize it was one ship or at least i thibk it was because the lights were not akways on the three points of the triangle. at one point of the night the triangle ship had a streak of white light that went from the first point heading towards the middle of ship. however it was only 4 lights but each bar was longer. example: or like these dashes but horizontal kinda like a strobe * - -- --- \r\nthis event happened for about 2 hours fist appearance came again when moon was starting to red and they diapered as soon as the moon was back to full and normal being very bright. i assume tgat is why they left. it was about 6:15-6:39 the event ended. \r\ni've looked for this for a long time and was shocked by so many of them. my phone couldn't pick up the pucks as ufo were to small weird though a couple times though the icon for phone shut me out but my phone dues that from time to time. at first i thought it was a sati might but the movement was not of earth like. after 10 min i grabbed my glasses to verify what i was seeing. in addition about 5:00 the newspaper boy was delivering and he was witnessing this event as well.
