the patio in the backyard drinking coffee.  the sky was clear blue and sunny.  there where 3 jets flying above in different directions and at different altitudes.  it's common for us to view jets as we live not far from the las vegas airport.  as i was looking in the sky towards the west i noticed something really odd.  it was a barrel shaped possibly white metal looking object with bright silver light pulsating around it's perimeter, looking as if it was moving at an incredible fast speed.  the object did not move as a regular jet or plane would move in a horizontal position.  instead it moved in the barrel shape with the narrow part of the barrel at the top facing the sky and the narrow bottom of the barrel facing the earth. when i noticed all the reflective light i turned around to look at the sun which was directly behind me and than looked back at the object to see if perhaps the sun was making it look that way.  what i saw \"clearly\" was the outline shape of a barrel, meaning the top and bottom of the shape where more narrow and the mid-section was wider.  i clearly saw very bright silver-like bright light pulsating all around the perimeter of the object. i sat there for 3-5 minutes observing it to get a clear picture of what i saw committing it to memory.  as it headed in a sw position i watched it until it disappeared into a pinpoint.  it did not look like any aircraft i had ever seen, both in shape and movement.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

a good view of the mersey estuary in iverpool, england. at first i thought it may be a balloon with lights on it but after looking through binoculars i saw it was unlike anything i have ever seen in the sky. \r\n\r\nthe object seemed to have different panels on it with each changing colour from orange, yellow to amber. the onject stood stationary then began to move slowly. after a couple of minutes i got a camera to try and record the event, sadly the photo was taken just as the object few off suddenly. the object was witnessed by someone with me. \r\n\r\nafter first spotting the object i had about 5 mins viewing before it flew off quite suddenly and vanished from view in a second or two. planes do fly over my home area (8 miles from liverpool john lennon airport) but this was not a plane and certainly not a balloon as the wind would have needed to have been hurricane force to move a balloon so fast. \r\n\r\nthe object had multi-coloured lights glowing on the surface and i was convinced it was not any aircraft,baloon and certainly not another 'chinese lantern' which is pretty common and easy to detect. this object seemed quite big, possibly over 100 foot in circumferance. \r\n\r\ni was amazed to see it sit almost stationary, then begin to move very slowly. it was hovering somewhere over the wirral which is over the other side of the river mersey. it flew off towards the direction of wales, which you can see from my flat which takes in the view of liverpool, wales, the river mersey and eastuary. \r\n\r\ni was sober at the time as was my witness. i cannot say that this was alien craft but it seemed to show all the signs of being something that i have no reference point for. i have never seen anything like it and was quite exited as i viewed it.\r\n\r\ni drew a small picture of what i saw, if it helps i can submit this and a photo of the area i spotted the craft. i have also looked online to see if anyone else spotted this strange object. it was not a star, certainly not a firework and due to the way the object floated stationary then flew off faster than planes in the vicinity, i wonder was it picked up by radar from the nearby airport. i am sure others spotted the object and would like to know myself just what it was. \r\n\r\ni hope this report helps. this is an honest testimony of what i saw.\r\n\r\nnote: the photo is taken on a camera which has not had the time or date set on it. i made a careful note of the time the incident occured so ignore the date stamp on the photo which only shows the area were the object was, not the objecft itself (it was too fast!)\r\n\r\nthanks for reading.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with

only had a few and were not drunk) over a bonfire in a field about 200-300 ft behind my house. we decided to go back to my house to grab a pack of cigarettes i forgot. we stood up when all of a sudden as if appearing from nowhere a bright fluorescent red disc (between 15-30ft in diameter approx) with 3 small strips of black which created 3 triangles of red (but it was clearly one object). the craft was directly over head from us just above the treeline. i want to say no more than 30 ft probably lower though. the craft was silent. i want to say that i probably said something like \"what the f***!\" at first but me and my friend stood in silence for what was probably around five minutes. the object just hovered there, unmoving. then just as the craft had appeared it disapeared. my friend says he remembered the thing shooting off but i remember it seemed as though it disappeared as if it opened up a portal where it was hovering and disappeared into it. after it was gone we were both mentally and physically shaken. we ran back to my house pondered what we had seen. after that night we did not talk about it until the summer of 2013. the subject came up and as a way to prove to myself that i had seen a ufo i asked my friend what color the craft was. he said it was without a doubt a bright red. i got goosebumps when he said that. this confirmed my suspicions that had lingered since that night. i knew without a doubt we saw a ufo. since then ive become increasingly interested in researching ufo phenomenon however i have shared this expierience with probably 3 people because it is such an unbelievable tale to most but my friend and i know without a doubt what we saw.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100

friend.  about 10-15 minutes into the flight i looked out to my right out the window (i had a window seat) and i saw what appeared to be the top of a castle protruding through the clouds.   i thought wow that is a tall mountain for us to be seeing it so close from the air.  it looked like a rock ���castleted��� wall that was the edge of a parking lot for an observatory that was paved with small brown rocks.  i saw no cars but it was so convincing i never have dreamed it wasn���t a real parking lot to some mountain top observation point.  i watched this object for 3-4 minutes as we were flying past it.  it wasn���t until later i realized just how big something like that would have had to be to stay in view for nearly five minutes.  the perspective was not on top of it more like maybe 1,000 ��� above it and moving past it like i was at a 45 degreee angle to the walls of this castle.  while i was watching it i turned around in the plane to try and see if anyone else was looking out the window and seeing the same thing.   most people were sleeping and had their windows shut, but one college age girl was also watching it out the window and i said ���do you see that?��� and she replied ���yeah������ kind of like she was also seeing it but thinking something was not quite right.  the thing that makes me really mad is that i had a 3 d camera with me and didn���t use it.  the reason was that it just looked like the top of a national park and completely normal other than the fact that is was staying in view for 3-4 minutes and we were at 25,000+ feet in the air.   so as i was getting off the plane i stopped asked the pilot ���what mountain that was that was out the right side right after we took off?���  he replied ���there���s no mountain up there where we were at and nothing around where we flew that was of any real height���. then he proceeded to chuckle a little at me as i walked off the plane.  now i was really sure that this was really something!  i felt like such a fool for not taking a picture but like i said, i didn���t look abnormal just out of place and huge.  when i got down to baggage claim in st.Louis i saw the college girl explaining what she saw to her mother in a very excited manner.  and now i am kicking myself for not getting her contact info to this day.  so 9 yrs later i had to get this out and documented.  i���ve never heard of any ufo like this before���","distance":"501 Feet - 1
