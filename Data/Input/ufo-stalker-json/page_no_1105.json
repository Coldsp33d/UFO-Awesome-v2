intrigued by all the subjects and am fairly knowledgable compared to your average joe. i'll also add that my father is a retired lt.Col. in the usaf and i grew up on/next to airforce bases my whole life and am familiar with alot of the aircraft that we fly. anyway my experience isn't as dramatic as many out there and i don'thave any pictures/video to go with it or even other witnesses to back it up! lol. i myself am quite skeptical of much of what is out there and it's hard to believe one persons word. that being said, i'm a huge supporter of \"the cause\"- to get the government to divulge everything we the people have a right to know and believe that everyone should do their part to advance this agenda especially those who are fortunate enough to have an experience they believe to be extraterrestrial related. this experience happened to me about 5 yeaars ago in what i believe was january, i have a terrible time remembering when things happened as the years go on. i know it was around christmas/new years (a little after i believe) and was either 2008 or 2009. i worked at the fox run mall in newington nh . i ran the housekeeping department for the whole mall and at this mall we had two large outdoor signs, one at each of the main entrances as you drive in. the signs were roughly 20 feet tall and you  can put whatever combination of the letters on them you want, hece any message. lucky for me the job of changing the messages fell on me and it was done once a week, preferably saturday night so sunday would run the new message. well it was about 1 am in the morning and thiswas my last job befor heading home. the mall closed at 9 with the doors lcking at 10 however it takes awhile to scrub the floors, clean the bathrooms,, etc. then see the other employees finish and start my signs. to put the letters on the sign you used a very long pole with a suction cup on the end that you would use to get the previous letters down then use the suction cup to pick up your new letter and put it up on the board where it would sit in these rims that lined the board. in order to do this you stand at the bottom and you have to lterally look straight up which is why i stated it took place at 90degrees from the horizon. so i had been out there for a half hour or so and was in the process of applying the new letters and looking straight up at the sign but also with the entire sky in my field of vision as well. it was then that i saw three lights enter my view that appeared to be fixed to each other in triangular formation as they did not variate in their positions on the triangle  at all. the apparent \"craft\"  was moving at a great velocity, much greater than say a fighter jet  and traveled in an amazing zig-zag across the entire sky in the scope of maybe 2 seconds. it was unbelievable, the way the \"craft\" would go from one point then change direction in a 45 degree angle to another point then change  direction then  finally one more point where it again changed the direction in the blink of an eye and then out of sight.   it made absolutely no sound and since it was so early in the morning(approx.1:30aam) the silence was even more apparent. had a plane or jet or helicopter been at that distance you woulkd have heard it quite well. the whole experience ,although it happened quickly , was so unnatural and unlike anything i thought was even possible it literally scared me and i was 30 years old, not a little kid. i ran to my car where i monitered the sky for at least 15 -20 minutes , half expecting it to come back , before i returned to finish the job. i was quite shaken for the rest of the evening and finished fairly quickly after that. it was the single most amazing and uybelievable thing i have ever seen. if we have technology that can do that then we truly are centuries ahead of what we think we are capable of and i felt when i saw it  that there was no way that it was of this earth and man-made. i know it' s just another civilian sighting without a whole lot to back it up but i believe every piece gets us a little closer to knowing the truth and you guys are at the front lines of this fight and i admire you for it. go

working on his vintage 1970 vw beetle. both of us having seen ufos in the past, we always kept an eye to the sky. to the east we both happen to notice the classic vapor trial high up in the atmosphere that is usually associated with the alleged \"aurora\" black project; a straight-line vapor trail encircled by donut shaped \"puffs\". we could see the vapor trail being made, but we couldn't see the vehicle that was the source of the trail. the trail was being created very fast. in my opinion the vapor tail was being created 10x faster than any commercial jet contrail. as the trail moved from east to west we noticed a very unusual event. at about 45 degrees above the horizon it appeared as if a literal \"window\" opened in the upper atmosphere just before the vapor trail. this \"window\" opened from a pin-point to a box shape in less than a second, and then whatever was creating the vapor trail exited the \"window\" in the atmosphere and the vapor trail stopped. immediately after the vapor trail exited the window, the window closed in the same way it had opened. the window was open for about 3-4 seconds and while it was open you could see a clear patch of black sky, as though it was the middle of the night... and it was mid-day. after the \"window\" closed my brother-in-law and i looked at each other in amazement and said- \"did you see that?\" and then we both confirmed that we had both seen the same thing- what appeared to be a craft of some sort flying high in the atmosphere, opening a \"window\" in the earth's atmosphere, and then flying through it, with the \"window\" closing after whatever was making the vapor trail left the atmosphere. we came to the conclusion that it had to be some sort of government \"black\" project, and continued working on the old vw. of course we kept looking up the rest of the day... and it was a good thing we did.\r\n\r\n  after sighting the strange vapor trail and \"window\" in the sky, i went inside and got my digital camera. within a few minutes of sighting the vapor trail and \"window\" in the sky we both saw an unusual triangle shaped object which appeared to be several thousand feet at almost 90 degrees above my house. i couldn't distinguish the object's color, but it appeared to be reflective of the sky... almost clear with the exception of what appeared to be white lights on one side of it. i snapped a few shots with my camera; a couple with trees in the foreground for perspective, and then a couple of shots zoomed in on the object. i looked at the screen on the back of my camera to make sure i had photographed the object and when i looked back up at the sky the object was gone. both me and my brother-in-law saw the object. we were both amazed at what we had winessed that day, but being open-minded, we were excited about what we had witnessed.\r\n\r\n  the attached photos are of the triangle object we witnessed above my house. the pictured titled \"unk.Jpg\" is the first one taken with the tree in the foreground for perspective and the white dot in between the clouds is the object. the rest of the photos are zoomed-in

a cigarette on the back porch stoop. while sitting there in my bathrobe enjoying a clear star filled night, out of the west glided into my view a saucer shape craft, approximately 150 feet in diameter, traveling at approximately 5 to 10 mph at tree top level. it was so close; i felt as though i could have hit it with rock. at that point while directly in front of me, it wavered as though to impart some kind of communication, it felt almost like it was a case of waving  hands and at that point it changed direction and headed toward the northeast. as far as the craft description is concerned, it was black on top with a golden/creamy self luminous outpouring of light which had no effect on the surrounding area that i could discern. the top portion of the craft was the blackest of black that i have ever seen. i sat there stunned watching it simply glide behind the trees, then out of site disappearing all the while hoping for some kind of communication. i felt as though it was a tap tap tap on the shoulder, hi bob we���re here!\r\n\r\nand ever since then i have become (awake and aware) and have been able to do self healing on more than one occasion���.. my intire paradigm has

northbound on i-15, just south of mesquite, nv, a few miles.  the moon was bright, in the eastern sky, and visible to us most of the trip.  when we got to this point (maybe 7-10 miles south of mesquite) we noticed a large orange orb-like light low on the assumed horizon directly to our west in the barren desert. at first glance it looked like the moon partially peeking up over a mountain. it had no apparent movement. i initially thought that it was just the moon, until we all realized that the moon was to our east, and completely visible. we observed the light for maybe 5 - 10 seconds, and then it just disappeared, turned off, was gone.  i immediately asked my daughters if they had seen what i just saw, and they both had been watching as well and we were all very shook up by the
