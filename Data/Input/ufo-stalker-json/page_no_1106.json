this is a lot of reading so i do apologies.  i���ve had sightings and a possible abduction since i was a kid and as recent as last fall.  i am not going to put all, just the ones that i deem the strangest.  please also excuse any grammar mistakes.  my father is english major, growing up he always crammed it down my throat. i guess as a form of rebellion, i made it a point not to do great in english.  needless to say, i feel like the dummy now.  \r\n\r\n      when i was about 10 years old my family and i were just walking through the door on 4th of july.  the whole house lit up green and you could clearly tell something went over it.  my father being the way he was then wrote it off as fireworks but, i remember my mother running to the porch and looking everywhere thinking a plane had crashed or something.  after a few minutes of gazing into the woods, she then came in a searched the news for information.  the really odd thing about it though was, the next day not my father, my brother, or my mother had any recollection of it.  \r\n\r\n      when i was seventeen my cousin (justin,) two friends (zach and brandon) and i made a day trip from lake eire to canada.  it was about ten or eleven a clock at night when we crossed the border back into the united states.  now, i want to say the drive is about three and a half hours but, i could be wrong give or take a few.  justin was driving i was sitting behind him.  zach was the passenger and brandon to my right.  when i woke i could see a boat swaying back and forth but could not move or talk just stare.  it then accorded to me a boat can���t be on the road.  i realized it was being pulled by a truck and was finally able to move my eyes.  everyone in the car was just stiff and staring straight ahead with emotionless faces.  somehow justin was still driving.  after about a minute and a half i was able to speak.  ���what happened?���  justin was the next to come out of the ���trance.���  ���i do not remember driving.���  he said in a weird sort of disbelief.  after that all of us came out of it and there we saw the exit for erie.  to all of us though, it was as if we had just crossed the border ten minutes ago.  justin was always the logical type.  he did not believe in anything paranormal.  i remember being kids going to places that were said to be haunted and he was the type to run ahead and hide in the woods to scare you.  he always had an explanation for everything.  however years later just a few months before his death i asked him if he remember this.  instantly i saw him get goosebumps and he said to me.  ���sean, i can explain everything in my life.  that i cannot and it still scares me a bit to this day.���  \r\n\r\n      roughly a year after the erie incident about four of my friends and i took a walk on the montour trail in cecil township pennsylvania.  we did this often at night.  the walk was about a mile and half long.  our ending point was this huge old train bridge that sits about two hundred feet above the water.  on our way back not one of us said a word over half the way.  there was this mesmerizing light right in the center of the sky that i can only best describe as a lantern.  it was so bright and we were all entranced by.  it was almost as if when one of use finally said something about it, the object started to move to our right.  one of my friends and i then ran up a steep hill to see where it was going.  once we got to the top, we saw the ���lantern��� about half mile out over farm land spin and drop.  we then observed another similar looking object coming in from the right.  shaken, we ran down this hill to the rest of the group and quickly got to the car.  zach, whom was with us in erie, lived right up the road from this on a good bit of land.  he once told me of something possibly landing in one of his field and scaring his dogs.  however i cannot speak for him.\r\n\r\n      last september or october i was sitting outside my parents��� house on the outskirts of canonsburg pennsylvania.  my mother who before this day did not believe in anything of this sort was sitting on the porch.  i was in the yard playing guitar when i notice a blinking light in the distant sky.  it was mostly blinking purple by would from time to time go clear.  i had my mom come look and i could tell she was a little confused by it.  after five minutes of sitting still, smaller lights started to come from all directions towards it, and then it was just gone.  about a week after this my grandmother, mom, and i sat on the porch talking.  my mom brought up those lights.  not long after something huge flew over the yard beside the house.  i ran over but there was nothing.  you could not hear it coming or going, just when it was on top of you.  i was still on the side of the house and another one flew right over top of me.  once again, no sound was coming or going, just when it was above you.  when i looked up it was massive, about the size of the house i would say.  i don���t know if it was because it was so big but, it looked like it was only two hundred feet in the air.  i remember thinking it was going to scrape the tree tops.  it was a v.  just like the letter looks.  i could see the dark sky in-between it.  it was really black but it seemed to me to be reflective like something metallic.  as quick as this all started it was over.  my grandmother was really shaken and i remember her describing it as ���it sounded like the world was coming to an end.���  \r\n\r\n      i have seen and experienced some other strange things, but these are the ones that stick out most in my mind.  keep doing what you do.  the world needs more people in it that research this sort of thing.\r\n\r\nwith best regards

wife sees a red shooting star over the eastern horizon.  i did not see it, but i am a big astronomy buff and we were discussing that we were happy we can see the stars more clearly and couldnt wait for a meteor shower so that we could watch from our backyard, which is pretty void of too much light pollution.  \r\n\r\nas we were talking, my wife and i saw a satellite very faintly in the eastern portion of almost directly above us and we talked again about how it was nice to not have too much light out by us.  at that point, she was trying to look to see where the moon was and commented how clear it was (there was a slight haze to the northeast, not anything significant), to which i said, the moon is over behind the top of the house and was sort of out of view.  \r\n\r\ni was facing north-northwest, she was facing southeast.  \r\n\r\ni turned because i was trying to notice if i saw any shooting stars or anything, and that was when i turned to the west and saw a somewhat dim, yet clearly visible unbalanced diamond shaped object, clearly larger than an airplane (we live about 12 miles or so south of cleveland airport and nasa lewis research center, but rarely have planes come over our way as they are typically routed out of the northeast, or takeoff going southwest).  i was somewhat speechless at first because i couldn't believe what i was seeing.  it honestly looked like something out of a science fiction movie that hollywood would come up with.  \r\n\r\nthe shape was almost kite like, but had a mirror-like appearance and had 4 rings almost like a donut shape at each of the tips of the object.  the rings were sort of flickering like when a fluorescent light is just turning on or about to burn out.  it wasnt a pulsing, it was more of a shimmering sort of flickering.  the thing that seemed odd was that the object appeared to be the same color as the sky behind it.  i have grown up near the airport and have seen planes overhead for 35 years and have never seen anything like it.  as it started to dawn on me what i was seeing i yelled for my wife to look but at this point, it was getting farther away to where she could not see it.  i could still see it, but it was faint to begin with but i was still tracking where it was in the sky so i knew where it was.  \r\n\r\nwhile telling her to look for it i turned off the jets on the tub to see if i could hear anything but it was completely silent.  i did notice that the object was not heading towards the airport, but rather, just west of it, as if it didnt even care that the airport was there. \r\n\r\ni stood in the hottub not understanding what it was i just saw for about 10 minutes while my wife was asking me about what it was i saw.  i was speechless.  i have never seen anything like it before in my life.  i drew the basic shape with the rings and such on the fridge to try to explain it to her.  \r\n\r\ni feel like i am your every day john q. public.  i have no reason to embellish or make this up.  i always have an eye on the sky, mainly because of my childhood love of astronomy.  i would love to explain it as a military type craft or something, but it just didnt feel like it was something that i had heard about or seen on tv somewhere.  \r\n\r\ni have no good explanation, and hence, i am here, hoping that someone else in the northern ohio area saw something.

i set up my video camera facing at a 90 degree angle directly up into the sky. when reviewing video at 1/8 speed, i noticed a \"cylindrical\" shaped object move from the bottom of the screen(from the west), and going to the top right(towards the north)...Then following behind it by approximately 5 seconds a second object; which was dark, and shaped much like the object under the baltic sea(seriously), was slightly to the right(north) of cylinder, and actually did a \"death roll\" while in flight, but veered a little further right(north) of cylindrical object.  \r\n\r\nseveral minutes later, i picked up 2 additional objects that appeared to be much higher in the sky(as they were smaller in appearance, and slightly fuzzy;i believe, do to high-level cyrus type clouds). these appeared from the west(left side of screen); with one moving towards top of screen(east), and the other coming in the screen slightly to the right(north), of first object; moving at a 45 degree angle to the right(north)and center screen.  i believe this object was either larger or lower in elevation; as it is more visible.\r\n\r\nthe only object that can be seen at full speed was the darker object(but very quick).  i've attached 2 clips for you; one at full speed, then the other is slowed to 1/8 of full speed; and this is where you'll notice the cylinder object coming from bottom right(still very quickly), then the darker craft(also from the bottom right)...Then towards the end of clip, you can see the 2 other crafts mentioned come in from the bottom left of screen(they are lighter(i believe due to elevation), and very fast as well.\r\n\r\ni had filled out another report in march; of which was published with the still shot; and sent a report in regarding the capture i received on 4/6/14; but hadn't seen it, or heard back.  this is a truly amazing catch; because i speculate that the darker craft \"might\" be one of ours possibly chasing the cylindrical craft; but the \"death roll\" is very obvious too!\r\n\r\ni've attached the full-speed and 1/8th speed clips; along with stills that show each different crafts caught on video.\r\n\r\nthank you for your hard efforts!!!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s),  Other","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":55382,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":47.56276961164044,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04112014-0017","longitude":-94.77965469315848,"occurred":1397113200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Minnesota","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1397254402000,"summary":"Set my video camera 90 degrees up into the sky, and found 4 different anomalies;

descend about 2*moon diameters in altitude towards the horizon, and then remained stationary. it was a clear summer night.\r\nmy two friends had noticed this as well (and remained unimpressed, as they are skeptics).\r\nas we were discussing what we saw, another bright star-like object was emitted or ejected from the first one and moved along the azimuth in an arc of about +45 degrees,  remaining at the same altitude.\r\nfor about 30 minutes both objects remained in the sky, somewhat brighter than background stars (but not as bright as the planets or sirius etc.).\r\nanother friend turned up, and as i was describing what we had seen and pointing to the objects, the second object accelerated and desceneded towards the horizon, much like a shooting star (i.E. nearly instantaneously), disappearing from view\r\nthis fourth witness was slightly more amazed at what they had seen. \r\nthe first object still remained, but eventually there was little else to watch, and i stopped watching, forgetting about the object in the sky ( i cannot confirm if it persisted, moved or disappeared at a later time).\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
