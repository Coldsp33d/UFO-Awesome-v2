had just arrived home from the store, since i had been driving in the dark my eyes were somewhat acclimated to the night sky. before going in the house for the night i took this opportunity to star gaze as i often do, it relaxes and inspires me.\r\n\r\ni looked at the bright constellations in front of me, bootes and the big dipper were very prominent. i fixed my gaze above them, straight up 90 degrees into the sky as i do to look for shooting stars. there between bootes and the big dipper my eyes fell onto a faint grouping of stars, at 80 degrees, thought hey that's not where pleiades is supposed to be...Then i saw it was moving and triangular in shape, the size of a penny at arms length, a 90 degree triangle with a row of singular lights on the leading edges. the lights pulsed, they would become very dim and then pulse brighter randomly after 5 to 15 seconds. this craft was traveling nw across the sky at a moderate speed but after 1 minute i lost it behind the trees. i tried very hard to count the blueish-white lights, i think i saw 9 or 11 total, with one on the leading front center point followed by 4 or 5 on the edges behind it. it seemed very high up but it was impossible to judge the distance or size. \r\n\r\naircraft are often seen flying over my house as i live 25 miles from the minneapolis/st paul international airport, also 5 miles from the smaller flying cloud

of time before i saw anything unusual in the sky. the feelings i had about this were similar to sighting a rare bird, i will say this triangle seemed so far away i didn't feel threatened by it, just curious.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

distance (1-2k feet away & about 300feet above tree top level) a blue orb traveling at about helicopter speeds. i pause to try and make sense of what i am seeing but i quickly dismiss helicopter, plane or balloon. i then notice the orb changes colors, blue, white and neon green. i also see the orb change directions from south to north... i get in my car and decide to drive a bit forward where i can have a better view. at this point the object descended below tree top view causing me to lose sight of the object. i decided to wait and prepare my cell phone video camera just in case it ascended back to where i can see and catch it on video.\r\n\r\nabout 45 seconds later the object did just that and i was able to capture video of it traveling on a north trajectory. in plain eye sight the orb was really bright and a lot larger than what my cell phone video shows. frustrated that the video was not enough evidence i decided to try and get under the object to find out what this thing was.\r\n\r\ni put my car in drive and proceed to follow the object at this point the object switched trajectory back south and descended into the neighborhood it appeared to have ascended from just before i shot the video. i followed the object and made a left turn on 122nd ave and 24st and there it was on my left hand side (drive side) the object was slightly above tree level and this time took a north west trajectory causing it to fly above my vehicle. i was in amazement as the bright orb traveled above my vehicle. \r\n\r\nat that point i was able to clearly see the object.\r\n*it was bright neon green.\r\n*so bright my eyes squinted as if staring into a headlight.\r\n*i noticed what looked like a silver rod in the middle of the object.\r\n*my car window was lowered but no sound was heard as it traveled about 200 feet above my car.\r\n\r\n\r\nat that point i had a smile on my face and decided to head to the supermarket before they close on me and i was satisfied with what i saw.\r\n\r\ni was satisfied in the sense that i know it was not a helicopter or something i can easily explain. i am 90% sure i can rule out man made drone with lighting attached to it because of the vast amount of distance it traveled.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

out on to the terrace of where we are staying which has an un-obstructed view of the ocean bay. i actually came outside to have a cigarette, i noticed that the sky was pitch black and you could really see all the stars.  i noticed an object which was clearly visible in a rounded boomerang shape with pointed tips and a pointed center piece, it was slowly and by slowly i mean barely drifting very clearly in front of me from south to north. i really couldn't believe what i was seeing. it appeared luminescent like the light source was moving around the bottom of it kind of like a jelly fish type glow and movement of light. it was dead silent but more than that just the way it exhibited zero drag to its movement kind of gave it an even more silent type feeling. to say it was levitating almost accounts for the sound of what i would normally feel would be associated with that act of levitation, if that makes sense. it was lighter than floating(?).  i could very clearly see the shape and edges of the craft as it was fairly close to me above the water. as the vessel(?) moved to the north without a sound or even a ripple in the air around it it went from this floating type of feeling to turning out very slowly towards the ocean and then all of a sudden zing! it shot out into the horizon so fast it was stunning. the whole event didn't last that long but i saw the shape of it and detail clearer than i can see a sailboat in the ocean today.  i ran to wake up my partner who was sleeping and was shaking so bad and my heart was beating so fast i couldn't even talk straight or barely move my legs properly to walk.  i had to be calmed down and take deep breaths before i could even begin to explain what i saw. my mind is still trying to make sense of this but i just can't. i'm asking myself was it a hallucination? i was very awake and fully functional but can the mind slip into a dream? i don't understand and feel very very rattled and scared to tell you the truth. i

was traveling at a high rate of speed with no flashing light. i told my fianc�� to take a look due to the speed. at that time we were both looking at it and it disappeared. we both got chills and started scanning the sky's when we saw another object just like the first. it flashed randomly then disappeared. about 1 second later it flashed very bright. we never saw it after that. we watched the sky's for 30 minutes and saw shooting stars and airplanes. these triangular object were not anything like airplanes in the area. they were as high or higher than the airplanes but 3 times faster.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

bomber would when doing fly overs for air force games . but much bigger.It was huge about the size of a neighborhood block.  i could make out a outline of a v with at least 3 big orange/red lights on the rear. no flashing lights. totally silent. it glided north towards the air force academy. before it was totally gone from view it looked liked it just popped out of sight. it was the most amazing thing i have ever seen.
