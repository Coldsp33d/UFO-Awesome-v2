oscillating very strangely (not like the other bright stars).  when i decided to keep my eyes on it that's when it started to move around.  at first i just assumed it was an airplane since they normally fly in or out of that direction, but it wasn't coming closer or moving in the typical fashion i normally see the airplanes fly.  a little in disbelief, i leaned against a wall just to make sure it wasn't my eyes playing tricks on me, and i even used the top part of my fence as a gauge to see how far it moved to and from the top of the fence.  sure enough it was going in circles, figure 8's, up and down, and never moved back to the exact spot i first noticed it was in, yet never left the area it was flying around in.  this is actually the third such \"star\" i've seen doing this within the last 30 days.  though these are not the first ufo sightings in my lifetime, there was no negative feelings toward the object, but more of a childlike excitement and sense of relief at confirming some of my ponderings as to whether or not some of the stars in the sky are not really stars.  i found it strange that i'm actually getting an answer.  i never lost sight of the object, my daughter actually woke up and i had to put her back to bed.  i looked out of the window 10 minutes later and it was still there, then it started moving around again.  overall, i believe approximately 30 minutes had elapsed.","distance":"Over One

was walking past my window in my kitchen when i noticed something big hovering over the trees in my back woods. i stopped and went over to the window and watched it. i was really scared, so i called my neighbor who lived on the other side of these woods.I asked my neighbor to please look out her back window and look over towards my house and tell me what she saw.  when she came back to the phone she said\" if i didn't know better, i would think i was looking at a flying saucer.\" i never told her what i thought it was before i asked her to look out the window. i thanked her and told her, that i was just confirming what i was seeing hovering over our woods.\r\ni got this feeling like something was coming for me outside my house. after the phone call there is a total no recall of anything. i don't know if i saw or imagined a line of small gray people outside of my house coming for me. i awoke on my living room couch and a different neighbor down the street was knocking on my back door.  i was so happy to see him and immediately said \"k-- there is a flying saucer outside hovering over the woods. k---went to the window and said \" there's nothing out there. k---sat down and i went over to the window and looked out there. it wasn't hovering over the trees anymore. i looked higher up and more easterly and there it was. it was lower than any of the stars and very bright. it moved to the right and then to the left. it kept making this m in the sky. \r\ni was already embarassed at the fact i just blurted out there was a flying saucer, so i didn't point out the fact it was out there making an m in the sky. i was still looking out the window when my husband came home (8:30-9 pm). my neighbor blurted out to my husband as he was coming in the door, that it was a good thing he just got home because (me) was seeing flying saucers. my husband stopped in his tracks and said let me tell you what i just saw. on his way home( on a back road)he stopped to relieve himself. he said he looked up in the sky and there was this bright thing making a continuous m in the sky. now, i hadn't told my neighbor or even spoke one word to my husband yet. so, he saw it also.\r\ni have been

fact people would think she is crazy.\r\n\r\nher experience would go back to when she was a little girl in fresno. she would wake up in the middle of the night seeing a bright light shining threw her window, like a florescence white and bright. different nights she was getting visits. in her living room she said they had some big size windows and that was the windows were she saw the aliens commonly known as the grays. they would stare at her for long periods of times and she felt like they were talking to her threw her mind. she would tell me in detail how these things looked, from the broad shoulders to how skinny they were. she would see the short ones that gave her an easy feeling that it wasn't there to hurt her but the taller ones she said were the ones that scared her and those ones she got more of a meaner vibes. theses vibes that she got were there ways of communicating.\r\n fast forward time she is in her early 20s year is 2006 in a town called sanger outside of fresno. she has three people in her car. a guy, girl and the girls daughter the road is dark no street lights. a craft pools up to them less than 100 feet above them. all four witnesses are freaking out for the fact they are alone in the dark road. i asked her if there was a chance it was a plane or helicopter. she said no way it was much bigger making no sound with less than 100 feet above them with lights on the craft. her friends told her to step on it and she did and this object was above her the hole time. the little girl was crying the guy was praying. from what she told me they all in the car were historical. finally the craft disappeared.\r\n\r\ni always told her that i feel like they are following her..\r\n\r\nwe live in south san francisco now and my mother lives with us. about a year and a half ago one evening when me and my girlfriend were not home but my mom and my nephew were home. we have a big yard with a lot of trees, almost makes you feel like you are in a forest when you get to the back part of the yard. the forest type part of the yard is covered by a fence. my mom said that she noticed that my dog had its attention in the \"forest\" that is name we call that part of the yard. so the dog was watching something and my mom said how she noticed the dogs head moving fast from one side to the other almost like when you have a laser pointer and your dog moves its head fast to keep up with it. so she told her grandson to come with her to the \"forest\" to see why the dog is acting that way. when she gets there my mom and my nephew see these creature's in the forest running around in a very fast speed. they were around three feet tall and it was hard for her to make out how they looked because they were moving around at a very fast speed. she did say she saw green on them that could have been there clothing. my mom and nephew were very scared when they say these creatures. when ever i bring up this story they cant really remember what happened afterwards. i to my knowledge i never heard of aliens three feet tall running around at a speed faster then human. i hope someone can tell me if there ever has been another sighting of aliens of that kind.\r\n\r\ni am 100% that my girlfriend, mom and nephew is not making there story's up. my girlfriend would take these story's to her grave if it wasn't for me. i want this to be reported because it gives me conformation that aliens are out there and so are these crafts and i want the people to know too   \r\n\r\n       ","distance":"21-100

a alien was walking towards the window i was sleeping near, it called my name and then i had temporary paralisis. then i could move after a minute, i went to look and it jumped on the roof, the alien ran across the roof like a squirell on steriods. i felt like it left, so i went outside over the bay i saw a flash of light with a disc in the middle then it vanished. then a sesna plane flew to where the light was and then turned around this was at 4:30am april 2005. the next week it happened again this time i got a good look at the being it was approx 2 feet tall with a black space suit on and a star constellation on its chest. then i was spooked to go back down then shore.  then they started coming to my home, coming up to my window at 4:30 am calling my name, telling me to go outside. this went on for many years. wellaround june 2005, beings came thru my wall and were calling my name. i realized after a while they didnt understand english, so i taught them the alphabet, how to form words and meanings. these beings have the technology to be invisible and to pass thru walls. see i am disabled and no doctor could fix me, they said i would be in bed the rest of my life. these beings probed me, took samples and worked on me for many years. after 2 years of them working on me i miraculously got out of bed this was in 2007. i am no longer bed ridden all the time. now the aliens worked on my eye with some type of technology they said it will let them see what i see and help me see them better. sure enough i started to see them better. they also put something in my left ear to hear them better. these beings are telepathic. i experince telepathy, remote viewing, and psychic abilities since they ave been around.Then one day they asked me if i wanted to go on a space ride, i said sure. around 2007 they pulled me thru the wall and carried me to a ship, i remeber being pulled thru the wall and being carried thru trees, i remeber my feet brushing the trees. then i found myself floating in the middle of the ship with a big window in front of me, and two white greys at the controls, they said look at our planet, i did and i saw 4 spirrals and a planet with elongated continents.    i asked them what the spirral things were they said directional travel onto their planet, like n s e and west. then i excellerated backwards at a unknown speed the planet vanished and i had a buzzing sensation all thru my body, and i appeared in bed. i heard a racket i asked them what the noise was and the aliens said it was their engine. i felt hands on my body in bed probes going thru my legs,back brain, basically all over my body.One time the alien was touching me in bed and i felt its heart beat thru its hands, and its heart beat was 2-3 times faster than my own. now the beings are my friends they go where i go , they always talk to me , everyday , all day long,they are still with me still to this day,they wanna communicate to the right people. my friend recorded their voices on a evp recorder. i think i am running out of room so i will end this story for now, hopefully mufon will document the full story and the ships,beings and things and memories i have encountered since 2005.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

i have never seen anything like this. at 7:30-7:40 pm on 4-7-14 me and my supervisor were in the pit and noticed a bright star-like object appear to the north. it was moving at a rate of speed that is not humanly possible. it traveled almost directly from north to south and covered the whole sky from the north horizon to south horizon in about 7 seconds. it was about the height that jets and commercial planes fly. the object was super bright like a star but a clear bright color. it was about twice the brightness of mars, and mars is bright right now. i got out of my pickup to listen as it passed over us and it made no sound. it had no tail like an asteroid, and the bright light did not blink, it had no blinking lights anywhere. it was right before dark, it was still dusk, but stars were visible.  we also worked night shift last night. i was working in the office when i heard over the radio one of the employees call his supervisor to see if he was seeing what he was. i talked to him about an hour after work and he said just east of the mine, around an area known as the kneeling nun, there were 3 star-like objects that were hovering, and circled each other then merged and shot off. i did not get the elevation, length of time or trajectory from him though.  he did not know of the sighting we had on the 7th, and when i asked him what it looked like, he described the same light that we saw on the previous night. he witnessed it around 5:45 am around dawn. i do not know if there is a pattern of dusk and dawn, but these lights are really scaring me a little. either the government has developed technology way ahead of their time, or we really are not alone. i would love for there to be an investigation and will cooperate in any way i can with any details needed. i will also have my camera ready in case it happens again.

moving short distances abruptly. i had seen this same type of ufo, in the same location, on march 5th, 26th, and 31st. i filed sighting reports at those times with mufon, and included video footage taken during the last two. \r\n\r\nthis evening i also took video footage that i am submitting with this report. this ufo is identical to the shape, colors, and movement of the previous 3 sightings. only this time i observed the object travel a short distance horizontally, before repeating it's rapid change in direction.\r\n\r\na neighbor was out walking his dog and i pointed out the ufo to him. he witnessed all of he mentioned characteristics of the object without the magnification of my cell phone. \r\n\r\ni later went back out to see if the ufo was still present at approx. 10:30 pm and it was, exhibiting the same characteristics previously observed and recorded on video. it is unknown how the long the object was present.","distance":"Over One

before, i.E. a strange shaped craft moving very fast, fairly high, silently, leaving no vapor trail.  at first i was just curious because it was moving out of the normal flight paths for this area, i.E in a direction towards the open waters of the gulf of mexico.  nothing ever goes that way. it passed directly overhead, and the bottom of the craft was colored sort of a dull blue-grey and the bottom shape was kind of like a short fat hourglass shape made by putting two delta wings together at the apex of each.  (sorry for the lack of a better description) as i watched it move away, i saw the outline of the backside of the craft, and it was an oval shape on the bottom part with a more rounded protrusion on top like some sort of a fusalage.  i calculated its speed at circa mach ii, but there was no sonic boom or noise of any sort that was apparent.  i've never seen a ufo before, but i finally reasoned that this had to have been one.  nothing dramatic happened, it just continued on a straight line until it could not be seen. i had no camera or phone at the time so i couldn't take a picture, and i'm certainly not artisticly inclined but i made a rough (very) sketch of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":55301,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.67647638684838,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04082014-0015","longitude":-91.29768321550446,"occurred":1396058400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Louisiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1397018288000,"summary":"Craft moving very fast (mach ii) south in a straight line toward the open waters of the gulf of mexico.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"70392","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":11,"locationName":"Patterson, Louisiana","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:176757"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82751,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1108}
