look.  she came to the door and i pointed out the object to her and she quickly spotted the object.  i asked her to track the object and i retrieved two cameras, a nikon d3000 and a sony hd camcorder.  i first photographed the object with the nikon through a 55-200mm zoom lens at full 200mm zoom.  i got over 60 photographs with ease, as the object was hardly moving towards the north east.\r\nafter i photographed the object for the several shots, i turned on the camcorder.  the camcorder does not have an eye viewfinder, instead it uses an led monitor to see through the lens.  this makes spotting any object at a distance difficult when zooming in.  i did manage to capture glimpses of the object with the camcorder, however the photographs are the best capture.\r\ni had been meditating earlier just to communicate with such objects and give thanks to the 'great spirit' for all the great spirit provides.  once i observed the object, i thanked the object for the visit and wished for further visits.  i humbly, respectfully with unconditional love, had requested a 'fly over' from the gfl.  the gfl has always honored my requests, and this is not the first request made to the gfl, it is just at this sighting, i was ready with camera(s) and conditions were clear.\r\nthe photographs i submit are three out of over 80 photographs.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

march i had a feeling or urge to come outside, and i went outside i saw look like a silver or bright white light orb maybe the size of a 4x4 car or a decent camper trailer hoovering , bouncing around and look like it was lost or looking for something, thank you for listening.\r\n\r\n\r\nand kind regards\r\n[name removed/cms/tg]","distance":"20 Feet or

in a community that it very close to, due west of the texas motor speedway.  i looked in the direction of tms and noticed, at least, a dozen red lights moving from east to west, very slowly, and by my estimation, flying directly over the tms.  as they moved closer, the red lights faded out, completely.  at first, i thought they were disappearing into the clouds, but i witnessed several fade where there were no clouds to obscure them.  i took my dogs back inside and put on a jacket (it was cold) and came back out.  there were now another dozen, or so red lights, moving in the same path as the first ones i saw.  they, too, faded and became virtually invisible at about a 45-50 degree angle from my vantage point.  i tried filming them on my phone camera, as well, and did get some of the lights, but they just look like lights.  anyway, i began to scan above me and to my right to see if i could spot them without lights. at this point, the low hanging clouds were lit up from the neighborhood street lights and i spotted the dark underside (unlit) of a disk shaped object as it flew silently, and very low, in a continued path to the west.  as it faded out of view, i spun back towards the speedway to see that the red lights continued to show up and along the same description as the other 'waves'.  i continued to visually scan all around me and spotted to other moving objects.  one was disk shaped, much like the first on i spotted, but much higher. i saw this one through a break in the clouds and it was kind of glowing dimly and white.  the third object was the oddest. it was dark and i could only see it because of the light on the clouds (like the first one), but this one was very close and descending into what i would guess to be one block over.  this object was square in shape any perfectly silent.  i did not see it ascend, at all.  i could not get to the location as the houses in the neighborhood share fences where our back yards all meet.  i was afraid i would miss it if i tried to circle the block.  there were several more lights, fading red to invisible, but they eventually stopped showing up in the skies.  i'm guessing that i was outside witnessing this for nearly 2 hours.\r\n\r\ni should note that there are several airports nearby and very frequent air traffic, as a result.  the planes are a regular enough occurace that there are almost always planes in the air.  however, they are easily identified, very visible, and the sounds that go along with them are also heard all the time.  i even saw several planes during this event that i'm almost certain would have seen these objects, too.\r\n\r\nthe objects that witnessed made no sounds at any time.  they never blinked, made sudden movements, but obviously under intelligent control.  the recordings on my phone do not catch any \"smoking gun\" footage, but you can definitely hear my voice shaking in awe and nervousness as i tried to catch them.  all considered,between lights and the three more solid appearing objects, i estimate that i saw between 30 and 50!\r\n\r\ni have been scouring the internet for the past two days looking for other witnesses to this, with no

northern side of the housing area. in the back, or north side of this housing addition, there is a \"lagoon\" or cul de sac with no houses around this area, it is the only area that has yet to have houses built, so with no yard lights around either, it is an ideal place for illegal activity and a priority for monitoring the residential area from a view. a few feet from this cul de sac, there is a field (this whole housing area is surrounded by fields on the north and west side.) and the only entrance is visible and car lights absolutly could not be missed if entered.\r\n\r\nas i began to make a drive through this cul de sac, or lagoon, which is what it is nicknamed by the other security guard and myself, i noticed around 150 yards away there where 4 to 6 bluish, cool colored, lights. at first they appeared as flash lights from the way they were moving, they looked like they were being controlled by the person(s) who where in control of them. then, as i stopped and really studied what i was actually seeing, they appeared to skip and jump in flashes, and a few of them flicker and pulse like a flame would.  at that time, i called the local police department and advised dispatch that there where people in this field with flashlights, because it could have been the only logical explanation at that time. due to the fear of break-ins, i take no chances with guesses anyway.\r\n\r\nas soon as i hung up with this dispatcher, (i have a radio in my unit that stays on \"scan\" and picks up all local county radio traffic) she had called one of the officers via pd radio traffic. i then, pulled out my personal cell phone, which is outdated with poor video quality and has exceeded phone memory, and began video recording and managed to capture 18 seconds of these lights exceeding the remaining memory. \r\n\r\nas soon as my phone stopped recording, i then turned around and proceeded to the area of the housing that was closest to these lights. in order to leave the cul de sac, i would have to travel east-southeast bound which would be away from where the lights had appeared. i then turned and proceeded westbound on one of the streets. i attempted to visually locate these lights, and was fast approaching the area, and you guessed it, these lights had dissapeared. so i immediatly stopped my vehicle and turned around and drove straight to the cul de sac, again, hoping i would see them. these lights have never been seen again. myself and a pd officer both used our unit lights to try and locate what was out there. when i told him what i had witnessed, this officer raised his eyebrows with a smile, and that expression reassured me, my witnessed story wasnt normal. he told me he would look around the entrance to this field, and that night he never radioed anything about this field or the entrance. \r\n\r\nthis area has no type of traffic and is actully hard to get to. i never heard noises associated with these lights, that i could hear, nor seen anyone walking, and c'mon, for that amount of lights that i had seen, there wouldve been some type of contact made with the party and many people involved. i have never went and ivestigated where these lights where as of yet, due to my job and its policies and i will say this: i have no reputation to lose nor any gain with this testimony. i have seen many things growing up in a rural area, and this experience is another one added, but with evidence! thank you!\r\n\r\nnote: in the video at 0:00 pause it and you will see the back of the housing with yardlights and to the far left, you will see the lights. i apoligize again for the poor quality.","distance":"N/A","duration":"00:00:40","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":55274,"landingOccurred":true,"latitude":35.0584068,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04072014-0006","longitude":-98.2645408,"occurred":1395476760000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oklahoma","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1396906957000,"summary":"Ufo

near the horizon.  we kept driving but as we watched them they were heading in our direction and i noticed they had no flashing lights like other aircraft.  just a solid orange glow and were relatively large.\r\n\r\ni stopped the car to get a closer look.  by this time i could only see one of the objects.  it was a flying orange glowing orb.  it flew directly above me on a straight, purposeful path.  it made no sound.\r\n\r\nit was not something floating (like a balloon or lantern), i felt it was definitely flying because of the speed, trajectory (straight across the sky like a plane, not rising like a balloon) and steadiness.\r\n\r\nwhen the first one was about out of site as it continued flying away from me, a second one came along almost the exact same path and with the same characteristics.  it flew almost right over me.  i have mobile phone video of this, but the video only looks like a small orange light buzzing around (at least you can see there are no flashing lights like an airplane, just a glow).\r\n\r\nagain, when that second one was almost out of sight as it flew away, a 3rd one was then flying along the exact same path.\r\n\r\ni'm over 50 years old and this did not look like any other flying craft (e.G. airplane, helicopter, floating balloon) i have seen in my life.  it was not floating like a balloon, it was flying.  it appeared be a glowing orb,
