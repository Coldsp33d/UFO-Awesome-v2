to the davis-besse nuclear power plant. i was driving past the plant on my way home to columbus at around 3:30 a.M. and noticed something floating up and down above the reactor. i pulled off and got out of my car & it did this for maybe 3-4 minute's before it flew up about 50 feet and seemed to just slowly hover over the buildings. there were 6 lights.. 2 at each corner, a white and blue light side by side in each corner. the blue light would brighten when the white light would dim and vice versa. it did this for a few minutes then it just shot up and away at a 45 degree angle and was so fast it looked like a streak of blue light \r\n\r\ni heard no noise except for this pulsing vibrating sensation in my ears until it shot away. i never believed in extraterrestrial life until that night. now i'm convinced of it. i was in such shock at what i was seeing i didn't think to try to take a photo. of course my 2 friends were passed out in the car after drinking all night and didn't see it or even realize we were stopped.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

was on my way back home with my grandparents on i-64 eastbound from lexington, ky. where we had gone so i could pick out the bicycle i was getting for christmas.  as we were approaching the mm101,

he decided to pull over to see what was the matter.  initially we thought there had been a wreck until we got closer and saw what the people were doing.  we got out of the pick-up truck to find out what was going on.  i immediately looked in the direction the people were pointing and saw lights over the tree line in front me seeming to hover in place and slowly move parallel to my position.  i remember thinking why were these people getting so worked up over a plane or helicopter!  then in the spans of quiet of no traffic i realized this object wasn't making a sound, nothing!  as i stood there watching this thing i realized it had rows of lights that gave it a triangular shape.  i say that because this was a dark section of interstate, a very dark sky, and this object was dark so i don't know if my mind filled in the blanks to give it 3 edges to form a triangle or not!  the lights were in a triangle shape so i just figured they were along the edges!  the glow from the lights kind of revealed it's edges to give it a triangle shape.  even with all this happening, i kept telling myself it was probably some top secret military thing.  there is a small army base named avon that is about 15 driving miles from this location and probably 5 flight miles.  the object continued to move parallel to me which was a w, sw direction in no hurry until it was obscured by the trees and terrain.  we got back in the pick-up truck and continued home, satisfied that it was some sort of military thing.  then on ufo files, decades later of course, i saw the very same object on one of

my friend, mp. we were both 15 years old.\r\n   mp and i were running laps around the track at our high school stadium preparing for football season. we finished our workout and then sat in the middle of the field to catch our breathe before walking home. it was then that we saw five orange/red spheres moving slowly and silently over the treetops on the north end of the stadium. we both jumped to our feet, pointed, and said, “what the $!&@ is that!!!” \r\n  the spheres were each roughly the diameter of a trashcan lid, and from my perspective, looked to be radiating heat waves inside of them. they flew in an obtuse v formation, from east to west, and were maybe 30 feet above the tree line.  from where we were standing, we were probably about 250 feet from the spheres. it was just past dusk, and we could see them  clearly until they went over the horizon. i ran home scared after i lost sight of them. \r\n  i don’t know why, but i didn’t talk about it with anyone other than mp. after 10 years, post college, mp and i both moved back to alliance around the same time and confirmed to one another that we’re not crazy. also, with resources like youtube, i see that many other people have had similar experiences. i am now more curious than ever to know what that was.

me notice the object:\r\nthe movement of the object (triangle/v shaped object moving roughly n/nw to sw) and dim light/obstruction in the the cloudless night sky. there were no significant clouds in the sky during the sighting and the object obscured the sky/stars behind it during the sighting. the object was not bright but it was large (larger than my thumb with my arm extended).  at the end of the sighting there were slowly blinking red lights on the tips of the triangle (i saw two lights and the other witness saw three).\r\n\r\n3. what did i think the object was:\r\nmy first reaction was that it could be a b2 bomber close to v shaped (if viewed from the bottom) in the n/nw that became more of a triangle shape (change in angle?) as it moved out of sight in the sw - however my reaction was that object was far to large (larger than my thumb with my arm extended) to be anything that you'd see in the sky and it grew dim and then brightened which a plane doesn't do.\r\n\r\n4. describe the object/actions:\r\nit moved roughly from n/nw to sw.  the object came in higher in the sky to the nw and then moved lower in the sky as it disappeared to the sw.  as it moved across the sky it would dim almost out of sight and you could see could see the outline/it obscured the sky/stars behind it and then fade back into view. during the 1st 10-20 seconds of the sighting there were no blinking lights on the object but in the last 5-10 seconds of the sighting there were slowly blinking red lights on the tips of the triangle shape.  it became much harder to see as it went toward the sw with the exception of the slowly blinking red lights - of which i saw two (sides?) and which my son saw three (all three corners).\r\n\r\n5. describe feelings/reactions:\r\nmy reaction was the object wasn't supposed to be there or we weren't supposed to see it.  i called to my son who was in the lower yard to come up to the deck which he did and he was able to see the last 5-10 seconds and his reaction was the same - that the object was to big (huge or far to close), strange obfuscation of night sky, blinking red lights and that it shouldn't be there.\r\n\r\n6. how did i lose sight:\r\nit moved to the sw and dropped in elevation in the sky and moved out of view/horizon.  as the object moved toward the sw three small/dim/slowly blinking red lights could be seen on the tips

as the light came across the sky it suddenly made what looked like an \"z\" in the sky, changing direction instantly at sharp angles to make the \"z\" then continued to the ne for about 5 seconds and out of vision and i could not locate it after the short straight line. there was no sound, no other colors, the light or reflection was steady. as a former private pilot, investigator and owner of a

lights blinking.  not planes.  at times they hovered,  and moved about in all different directions.  my girlfriend seen pretty much everything i seen.  against her pleas for me not to i attempted to signal one of the craft with a light and asked it(thinking it could maybe hear me) if it wanted to make contact with me. i have always had a serious interest in ufos and ets. the one i signaled appeared to track and follow me to store up from where we reside and back.  at one point it looked as though it was desending on me but seemed to have second thoughts and stayed put. i continued to sit out in my yard observing that particular one. for the most part it didn't move much beyond that.  during this time i also seen craft which i would assume were at satellite level orbit.  these looked like stars and their movement was erratic,  changing direction and speed multiple times.  i also noticed certain large star patterns that did not seem familiar and there were a few of each kind that seemed identical as far as i. could tell. the patterns noted were 3 star triangular. these were huge too.  the others consisted of 2 stars.  best way can describe those is hold a cigar up to the night sky. and picture. a star on each end. i say this too because there \"appeared\" to be a dark siloete against night sky of that shape with the star on either end. keep in mind this is the one thing i saw that night and the few following that i am least certain about but i figured i'd note it anyway.  now it gets real crazy.  hovering slowly over our houses i spotted the first of many triangle shaped craft that to the best of my knowledge were the tr3b models built by us.  after spotting 2 or 3 more i had one fly directly over my head where i was sitting in  my yard.  i swear i might have been able to hit it with a rock. on a side note i jokingly spoke out to 1 a few min before that and asked if it could send one right over me possibly lower so i could get a better look.  yeah that could be a coincidence but to say i was shocked and freaked out is an understatement. we seen what we figured to be at least 20 of these patrolling all over the sky at various altitudes for the rest of the night. as dawn started to break they all seemed to be headed west in line o e after the other.  i also want to note i spotted what appeared to be one of them cloaking possibly in an attempt to look like a normal aircraft. reading up on these seems to indicate this ability. the next day the sky's were clear and i believe they had this ability on full display during the day. i only picked up on it because. i spotted a commercial airliner which seemed odd in that it was a flat dull white appearance flying overhead with chem trail following.  here's the real strange part..It had what i'd call an orb to the very front left of it leaving a trail as well.  i did a double take when it suddenly looked like a smaller version of the plane. both same dull white color.  the smaller craft immediately took off leaving the larger on in the dust so to speak.. there were many more of these planes that seemed odd to me following that first set all leaving the trails. \r\nthe following evening it looked as though we might get a better show than last night. right around 7 pm the tr3b craft were out again. quite a few at that. i seen the star ones again as well. when all this began emergency vehicles could be heard screaming around the city and for a while! suddenly it died down.. so did the tr3b sightings. they seemed to disappear while some were still visible but at much higher altitude. another coincidence? no idea! in between all of this another tr3b flew very low almost right over me and my neighbor. i yelled for him to look and basically said see i told you! he thought i was either nuts or on something when i told him about the night before. he seemed spooked and nervously said i'm sure it was just a plane.. i asked how many planes that low make zero noise?! what i can't understand about all of this is there was no mention of anything in the local paper,  news outlets small and large.  any online searches came up dead.  i asked so many people locally if the spotted anything and pretty much all look at me like i have 3 heads.  only 1 neighbor up the block knew what i was talking about. he seemed ecstatic when he walked by and i asked him about it. he stated his mother kept bugging him about the crazy stuff in the sky. that's basically me, my girlfriend and some guy and his mom that seen this.  i find it all so strange.  mainly due to the sighting being so large both in number of craft and duration of the event. are you or anyone else aware of any of this? if so i would love to hear! keep in mind that before all of this i have never seen a single ufo or et in my entire existence spanning 38 years.. i guess what else bothers me is the \"coincidence\" i see surrounding this. as i stated earlier i have always had a deep interest in all of this. what excites me and almost scares me though is the week leading to this i had my always deep interest turn into an obsession that's dominated every thought to the point of extremes i cannot describe. it was as though i experienced having premonitions about it all and as if someone or something was calling out to me...I know it sounds crazy. believe me i have no doubt i'm  the resident crazy on my social media circle. it ain't over yet either...Its been a bit strange since.. guess i'll just have to see how far the rabbit hole goes. sorry for all my rambling and if you read this then thank you for taking the time...Sorry no pics. i'll try again over next few nights","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1 Mile,

them getting mad. we stayed at a house on the property in a town called annada, which is approx 15 mins away from the clubhouse. the house sits in the middle of farmland/hunting ground and stands alone. this is the duck house and is primarily used for duck hunters. on saturday night i was standing out on the deck looking east at the sky. right above the tree line (about a mile away) there was a very large ufo hovering. it stayed in one spot for a good 10 mins. i went in and grabbed the binoculars and sure enough, it was a beautiful perfectly round craft with several lights in a perfect row all the way around! without the binoculars the lights looked orangish/yellowish, with the binoculars the lights were perfectly round bright white lights! i called my son and nephew out and they also saw it! i took pictures but they look nothing like what i saw which is a huge disappointment! in fact, im sure i took way more pictures than whats actually on my phone, only 1 is showing up then goes to my son and nephew of them sleeping, then there are a few more?? they were awake when i took all the pictures, and now they are out of order? i tried getting a picture through the binoculars and that definitely didn't work, lol. \r\nit was really cold this past saturday so we kept going to the window to check if it had moved. it did move slightly up and down after about 15 mins, after about 20 mins from first spotting it, it was gone! so we didn't get to see it fly in any direction. i took pictures in the daylight to show how far the trees were from us and circled the location of the craft. i will also upload a picture i found on the internet, it's the closest to what i saw through the binoculars on the lights were bright white and i could only see what i circled. there was no sound from the craft.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

afternoon i had finished school and was off to our local woods and park to play it was still day time but you could still clearly see this this glowing up like it was made of or powered by gold. it made no sudden movement's no speed or shooting off out of sight it just kind of sneaked out of view. i know what i saw i've never seen anything even remotely similar since id happily take any lie test

am from a scientific background studied engineering in university and never believed in ufo's but i cannot deny what i saw.  it was 5 changing to 4 bright lights in a triangular shape.  i was near the beach in an rv park and it moved slowly in a straight line to the east of me, made a sharp 90 degree turn and proceeded to a position directly overhead where it stopped.  it did not move for a few minutes then proceeded back to its original path. the lights then seemed to break up and some went directly east while others went to the south,they were capable of very high speeds and stopping abruptly.  one by one they disappeared. i managed to snap a 5.6 second exposure of the last object just before it disappeared on my digital camera.  the last object was stopped when i took the picture but because it was a hand held time exposure it made an irregular streak on the image.  i told several friends about it but they just laughed it off so i kept silent.  there was one more person standing near me that witnessed it too.  i am not a ufo hunter and the best way i can describe it is to say that i saw a triangular formation of unidentifiable lights that seemed do act in a manner that i cannot explain. so it may fit the category of a group of unidentifiable flying lights.  as i do not believe in et's i am still seeking a rational and logical explanation.  my camera automatically records time dates and other information so i can be very precise about that information.  there was an airport to the north about 60 km away that had ties to the air force.  i will see if i can attach an image that basically shows the last bright light poorly photographed. i want to remain anonymous.  i am a hobby photographer and am trying to recall this event as honestly and

appeared to be appearing out of thin air until i could see the entire craft   it was a multi level craft (v shaped, no wings) approximately 200 yards in length. it appeared to have four or five levels.  it was a dull dark gray color that seemed to absorb light.  there was no reflective material on the craft. it was flying in a straight line due east.  there was no sound eminating from the craft.  after about eight seconds it began to disappear back in to thin air as if it was clocking until it disappeared.  during the visual it maintained a constant speed as if approaching for a landing, but it was not on the same course or altitude as jets take when landing from the west.  the craft began to appear from front to back and then disappear from front to back.  i am only
