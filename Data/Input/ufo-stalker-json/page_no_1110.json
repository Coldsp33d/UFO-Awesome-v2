stephen greer/ ce5��� method of initiating contact with an et vehicle.  after maybe 10 minutes of sky watching (and i am an aviator, so i know aircraft types), i see a small white orb high in the sky, but i initially think it's a commercial jet at around 35,000', because i see a lot of those.  but the object moves very slowly and there are no contrails, and the object doesn't get any bigger (perhaps barely - i did notice what appeared to be a possible division or morphing of the orb). in fact, it looked like it could have been a tiny cloud or balloon, but there was not a cloud in the sky, and a balloon would have been blown about by the light wind. this object hovered, and came to within a 1/2 mile at perhaps 3-5,000', and remained stationary for at least 5 minutes. i called to my neighbor, who also witnessed the white orb.  it slowly moved across a part of the sky above the airport, while several commercial aircraft flew about their designated routes, oblivious to its presence.  anyway, my housemate came home, and he witnessed it too, as it started to move away, slowly at first, and then we saw it shoot rapidly up towards orbit.  i can saw without a doubt that this had to be either a military recon drone (unlikely), or an et probe (or whatever kind of instrument they send when a mental ce5 contact is initiated - if that is what it was responding to).\r\n\r\nthis was my first true ufo sighting, after 40-odd years of looking! at first, i thought it was a jet, then realized it could be an orb ufo, so instead of getting anxious (as i usually would), i made a direct attempt to look at the orb and send calming thoughts of acceptance its way, as if to say \"i'm glad to see you, and hope we can communicate\", still feeling incredulous to the event. but as the minutes wore on and the orb just sat in the sky, i gradually accepted it as a ufo without any fear.  i invited it to land, and as if it was watching me, i waved at it and made motions for it to come on down.  as the orb slowly moved from its first hovering position, holding altitude, i tried to get a cellphone picture, but my phone-cam is crappy. as the orb took off, moving at a very rapid rate of speed - i would guesstimate on the order of 5,000 mph+, because it moved into the upper atmosphere within 2-3 seconds, heading towards orbit. it was a thrilling experience!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":55265,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.36943664386886,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04062014-0035","longitude":-73.50284937685073,"occurred":1396831500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Connecticut","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1396837578000,"summary":"Slow moving orb appears from ne; hovers for 5 minutes; tracks slowly for 5 min; rapid ascent to orbit","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"06810","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Danbury, Connecticut","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:177977"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Vancouver","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was a beautiful clear sunny summer morning and i was on my way to a job interview (hence, how i was aware of the exact time).  while standing at the bus stop i happened to glance across the street and up in the air and noticed two orange-red spheres hovering in the sky slightly northwest to where i was standing.  they seemed to be in the distance.  my first thought was that these were balloons and i looked away.  it then occurred to me that these objects did not look or act like balloons would, i.E. they were perfectly round, textured as a soccer ball and seemed metallic as they were reflecting the sun.  i quickly glanced back and noted that there were now only one within my visibility.  the remaining orb then proceeded to silently move towards the west.  unfortunately, the bus arrived at that moment and i entered this so as not to be late for my interview. \r\n\r\nwhat i find a little shocking is that this took place in a fairly busy area, in the middle of the day with many people around, yet i am the only person to report this?  i will never forget the clarity and the reality of seeing this object -- in my own neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nin 1975 i saw a pair of lights high in the sky at night, in winnipeg, manitoba -

got back towards my house i was looking at a really big planet i thought was venus or mars, that was visible by the moon. i'm always watching the sky when i walk my dogs. i love the night sky & i'm always looking up... that's when i noticed what looked like little lights high up in the sky, that were circular/oval shaped, small & very star-like, were flying across the sky going from east-west & across the moon. i saw a few at first... & once those ones had gotten too far away to see anymore there would be other ones coming in from the other side. it started around 12:30 & went on until almost 3am... \r\n\r\nthere was no one else outside in the neighborhood & my husband, who is a deep sleeper, would not wake up!! i tried to get pics & video from my old video camera & my phone, but the moon was too bright & the lights/crafts too dim.. i tried calling a bunch of people to see if anyone else could see what i saw because i wanted to tell someone & have someone else validate what i was seeing!! but no one else that i called could see anything from where they live. i actually called 911 & immediately felt stupid as i heard myself telling him what i was seeing... but he was really nice & he's the one who gave me the local ufo hotline number. i did end up filing a report with them right away. i left them a message & they called me back the next day. and then i tried calling a few other ufo hotlines, but they were all message services too. i did leave a message on one of the mufon lines, but didn't hear back... but i figured i should still make the report now since it's still pretty recent.\r\n\r\n so i couldn't get anyone on the phone who knew anything about this stuff & i was really frustrated...I couldnt explain it, so i just kept trying to talk myself out of it. i had no one to see it with me, so i tried to tell myself i must be wrong! thinking of what else i could be looking at & going over everything as i stared up still watching the crafts go by... in the end i couldn't deny what i saw anymore. part of what convinces me is how i felt it when i went to bed that night. i realized i was absolutely freezing. i was numb & i was shaking! it took at least 20-30 mins curled up under a ton of blankets before my body was warmed all the way through... i was looking at something strange outside that i obviously believed in, for me to stand outside for so long in the super cold weather, when i was right outside of my house & didn't go back inside for about 3 hours! until all the crafts had stopped coming... \r\n\r\ni've never seen anything like it in my life & i feel very strongly that what i saw was a fleet of about 30-50 star-like crafts traveling across the sky. they were steadily flying & didn't make turns or crazy maneuvers, but occasionally certain ones would speed up & \"catch-up\" to other crafts. most were all exactly the same size, but a few were slightly bigger & brighter. they were bright white, or bluish white like starlight. i

thought of this event and i continue to often think about this event. in the early 1960's at night time my parents called my brother and me from bed, to come to the front window to see something unusual.  we both got to the picture window and observed a large bright red flaming object slowing coming from the direction from the left of the house directly down the street, approx. 15 feet above the street, toward the right side of the house at the same elevation going down the road to the right which is a dead end street of trees and past the trees is a lake and girl scout camp.  shortly afterwards we saw people in the street and then we saw police cars and fire trucks going down the road to the dead end.  they returned shortly there after without any sign of a fire or crash,  etc.  the ball was extremely bright and lite up the road and everything around it as it slowly went down the road.  in the morning my brother and cousins and i walked down the road looking for any signs of fire, etc., to the dead end.  we saw no signs of fire.  we walked into the trees/woods at the dead end and then to the lake/water walking what seemed endlessly in search for any signs of the bright fire ball, but we turned up nothing.  in the morning think i remember seeing a fire man looking for signs of anything along the road and i believe he said he did not find anything.  i think of this sighting very often, but i have never looked into the matter to determine if there were any reports from police and fire department ever dispatched along with other types of reports from people and i

helicopter and went back to my show.  i then noticed a few minutes later the light was still in the same position off to my west but it was twinkling like a star.  i chalked it up to a breeze and the branches moving making the light look like it's twinkling.  but curiosity got the best of me and i then went outside to get a better look, where the air was calm with no breeze.  i do want to mention that i sense certain things about people or situations and as i fixated my eyes on the craft i had the thoughts yelling in my head to the craft 'get out of here, you don't belong here!' then an uneasy feeling came over me where my legs were getting weak and my heart was beating faster. there was a sense of this object not being a good thing.  the light was still off some distance in prince georges county but this was certainly no star or aircraft lights i had ever seen, and we see a lot around here with andrews air force base nearby.  there were 3 different lights i could make out, white, red and green.  and they weren't blinking like a plane does, but sporadically flashing accompanied by a pulsating light within the whole craft, which my husband also witnessed.  it was a crystal clear evening so i tried to get a better look with the binoculars but was unable to see it clearly as it may have been too far away. seeing the light left me with an uneasy feeling so i headed to bed and prayed for it to leave.  upon waking the next morning i reflected on the lights i saw and knew it was not of this world and made a mental note to take a photo or recording if it happened again.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"01:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path then

clearly toward the west-southwest of our position).  the object appeared to descend straight down behind a tree line where we lost visual contact.  the total duration of my sighting was perhaps 2-3

spherical object high above the horizon. at first i thought it was a helium balloon or something except it didn't move. as i watched it turned black like it was being eclipsed by something then completely vanished. \"the size in relative terms was about the size of a #2 pencil eraser held at arms length. and when i described it being eclipsed it wasn't because of another object. it looked like a total eclipse of the sun, but you could only see the shadow. maybe it was turning, i'm not sure, it was very small from my vantage point. it was the blackest black i'd ever seen, it looked like the period at the end of a sentence floating in mid air. to go from a gray (silver gray) object to total black was weird. i thought for sure others must have seen it too. and when i said it vanished, it did exactly that, vanished, it didn't accelerate in any particular direction. it was just gone. reminded me of the dot you used to see on the old black and white tv sets when you turned them off, just blinked out. this happened around four o'clock in the afternoon, i was making my way home from work. although the gerald r. ford airport is less than a mile from where i was. it wasn't any kind of aircraft i'd ever seen before. the weather that day was sunshine and blue skies, that's why it stood out so much. air temperature in the mid eighties.\r\n \r\nthat's all the information i can give.
