States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"The time and place were the june 21-23 at the las vegas motor speedway for edc 2013. i saw the object at different points throughout the three nights i was at the event, each sighting was a different time and varied in duration, and multiple times on the second two nights. the object glowed blue and had a small red light that appeared to change which side of the object it appeared on each  time i saw it. the first sighting occurred after the fireworks on the first night because i was still looking at the sky after the spectacular fireworks. my friend and i both saw the object hovering in the distance to the east of the stadium. it appeared further in the distance and moved much differently than the police helicopters that were constantly circling the event throughout the evening. it hovered up, down, left, and right sort of unintelligibly. i speculated that it could be a edc drone videoing the event, but it was  not moving in any sort of way that would have made a good video. it generally seemed to be moving slowly but varied in speed. both my friend and i took a video of the strange glowing object while it hovered. this night's sighting concluded when i believe i saw the object shoot off some sort of flash and then i saw it speed off to the east much faster than it had been moving throughout the sighting. the next morning i saw that the video file on my phone for this sighting had somehow been corrupted. it appeared in my photos, but the file appeared as a grey broken file and when playing was attempted it would display that the video could not play. it was the only video of several i took that night at the event that was corrupted, and was coincidentally the one that had the object in it. i believe my friend still has his video from that night but i am not sure. \r\n\r\ni went into the second night of the event thinking that i would not see the same object that i had seen the previous night, since i had never before seen anything like it in my life. to my surprise i did see it again, on both of the next two nights. i first noticed it again in the east and it again looked to be far outside of the stadium. much further than the helicopters. this night i pointed the object out to multiple friends who also could not begin to guess what could move and look like this object. i also remember pointing it out to a random person, he also could not tell what the object was and was much more interested in the show (as i am sure was the case for the vast majority of the thousands of people at this event) each sighting, the object would hover predominantly up and down with occasional trends to the left and right (never going further from the east than northeast or southeast). i did not see the flash of light or demonstration of speed again though. these multiple sightings concluded when the object would appear to hover low enough that it was out of view, far outside the stadium. i caught multiple videos and photos on my phone from the second and mostly the third night, those videos and photos were not corrupted and are viewable. it is difficult to tell the exact shape from the videos but the blue glow is very visible and the path and speed of its movements are distinct. one video appears unintentionally out of focus, but appears to show the erratic movements of the object. one photo appears to show the shape as a blue saucer, another appears to show the red light but a triangular shaped object, and another (taken closer to dawn) accidentally shows light tracers from the camera not being held still. i will also post a screen shot from my phone showing the corrupted video file that has since disappeared from my phone's memory (with the nsa capabilities, i won't even begin to speculate as to how this video, of all the videos, was unplayable). the last of the videos i am submitting is of what the police helicopters that circled the event looked and moved like to provide a contrast to the object i have described. i won't pretend to know exactly what i saw, but i really have no good explanation for it. the lighting of the object was much brighter than the police helicopters and it moved in a way that a plane could not. i suppose there is always the possibility it was a drone of sorts, but if that were the case then why? to film? with the way it moved, it wouldn't have taken very good video. what other reason would a drone be there for?

then moved about 5 degrees to the right and hovered for another 15 minutes.  we left each other and i drove home toward it about 1.4 miles.  at home i viewed it from my balcony. i had a video camera in the house but i was in denial that i was seeing anything unusual and chose not to film it thinking that it must be lights on a nearby building.  after watching it for about 30 minutes i became tired of it and went to sleep.  the next day i realized that there was no building with lights on it that were in the area.  this was truly an over whelming observation and i have had anxiety over it ever since.  with help tom the uaf geophysical institute i was able to take measurements and make measurements.  a weather radar operator helped me take measurements using my gps garmin street pilot.  with all the information we gathered we used trigonometry to determine it's size.  the object appeared to be about 23 miles in width.  but not all of the angles and distances may be accurate.  it was extremely hard to measure since there is nothing on earth that size.  it is an overwhelming truth to have to accept and face.  \r\n\r\nwith some further research i discovered that a politicians aide was in north pole during that time and took photographs of it. but she is afraid to go public.  i have also learned that a fourth witness saw it from their house on fairchild.  so now there are at least 4 witnesses to it.

discussion with my friends about ufos, and i all i could remember about any ufos was some pretty uneventful ufo stuff. nothing really all that interesting. \r\n\r\nbut then..Later on that night, when i was meditating, all of a sudden i kept having these weird broken memories of events. eventually after a few days of continouslly thinking about it, i was able to remember most of it...Sort of.\r\n\r\nso it was some time in winter, since this is mississppi it doesn't really get that cold until janurary, so i figured some time in janurary or february. i know i was around 10 or 11 years old. so maybe some time in 1999 or 2000. my parents had a mattress on the living room floor, because we didn't have but one heater so everyone slept in the living room to keep warm. i was on the couch, and they were on the mattress, and we were watching some thriller movie on an old vcr. then somehow, the movie was off. the tv was doing that kind of staticy thing like the vcr had turned off. but for some reason i didn't really think too much of it? i also noticed that my parents were asleep, which is what i thought was weird, because they were just awake and were watching the movie. i figured maybe i had fallen asleep, which is possible that i may have, to this day i don't know if that's what happened. but i know i wasn't dreaming at this point. then i heard this really loud humming noise, kind of like a refridgerator running, except about 10 times louder. the vibrations were enough that i remember i could slightly feel them in the floor.\r\n\r\nfrom this point, i don't really remember how i got up to go look out the window, which is right across from the couch i was laying on. since the memory is so distant, i kind of want to say that i may have saw a search light type beam on the road outside the house, but i'm not sure. but i do know what i saw next. i looked up, above the tree which is right outside the window, and i saw a bunch of square-shaped colored lights, in a boomerang shape, above the tree. i think red was the first color i saw on the boomerang wing. the next colors i'm not quite sure it what order, but i remember white, red, blue, green, maybe orange. they were glowing very brightly, kind of like neon. it was so large, that i could only see half the boomerang, the other half was out of sight. it was slowly hovering in a kind of diagonal path coming from i think the northwest, regardless it was upperleft from my position, and it seemed to be going across the house.\r\n\r\nafter this...I don't know what happened. i remember nothing after this point. hell i didn't even remember this at all until probably 10 years later. i remember everything in so much detail that this wasn't a dream. besides, i've had much weirder dreams than something like this.\r\n\r\nsince i really don't know what happened, and because of the weird circumstances, i'm kind of afraid i was abducted. i've told quite a few people this story, but only really close friends have i mentioned the abduction part, because i don't want anyone to think i'm crazy. to be honest, with all the damn alien movies these days, the prospect of being abducted scares the hell out of me, so, if i was, at least i'm glad i don't remember.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

the object was larger than the landing light or lights seen on airliners.  \r\n of late, commercial airline traffic circles from the southeast, turns west and then south, with the completed circling

east. over a few seconds this bluish light faded and appeared to go out. it was too close to have faded because of atmosphere. i feel it deliberately faded from sight. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

bright slow moving object that looked like it was on fire, (orange and yellow flames) caught my attention.  it was around 45% up and moving from the nw to w.  i yelled for my wife to grab her cell phone and come out.  she tried to record it however,even though it appeared on her screen while shooting it, in replay.. nothing.  i held my hand up at arms length and the object was slightly larger than my fist.  \r\nit seemed to get smaller as it was moving across the sky then abruptly stopped.  it stayed stationary for approx 1-2 minutes then rapidly ascended and disappeared into cloud

close to it---no mistaking what i saw.  there was no noise.    it was white metallic, oval/disc shaped with a window.   an inner light shown from this window, but i couldn't really see inside. after a few minutes, i realized my friends were still inside and i was alone out there.  i turned to run to the house, and as i did, the ufo flew over the house heading west.  it didn't actually turn, that i saw, it just flew off.\r\ni ran down the street to tell my parents----i didn't know what to think.  they didn't believe me until the next day when a very respected man from the area told them he had also seen a flying saucer the night before, coming from the direction of bluffs and traveling west close to his home about 5 miles away at about the same time.  \r\nthis sighting took place in sept.

state highway 69 at the city limits of batesville. as i was driving down a steep hill, i noticed what i thought was a private jet headed east as it crossed above the highway. i remember thinking that the craft was flying extremely low for a  jet plane. it appeared to be somewhere between 500 feet-one mile up.It appeared to be a light color. once it crossed the highway it suddenly made a sharp turn to the left which would have been difficult for any aircraft to make. i turned off highway 69 & turned left on to highway 25 headed east. the craft had gone above some hills and was about a mile away when i was able to view it again. at this time it was stationary and was at a higher elevation. it was difficult to watch it very long. i was wanting a better look at it, so i turned left off the highway. however when i started looking for the craft again it was gone. i remember i was very curious about the nature of this craft. i didn't think it was like anything i had seen that low in the sky. i have seen cylindrical objects before in this area, but they were always at a higher altitude. i would estimate the total time of sighting was approximately five minutes.
