the section of i-80 just west of the area of sugerloaf, pa. the east and west bound lanes split and are separated by a tree lined hill. the road at this point is an uphill climb with the sugerloaf valley below and to the right. we noticed an object very high in the sky descending toward the mountain between rock glen road and tomhicken road. the angle of descent was approximately 60 degrees of angle from the horizon in an easterly direction and due south of our location. the object appeared as a redish-orange fireball. our initial opinion was we were seeing a meteor enter the earth's atmosphere and were excited that we may see it hit the earth. i had seen meteors in the past and typically the color was bright white or bright yellow and the speed is fast and steady. this object was between red and orange in color. it was when the object began to slow down in its decent that we realized this was not a meteor. the object came to a stop in its descent at an altitude of about 120 feet above the mountain top. the trees in this area are about 40 feet in height and the object was about three times the height of the trees from the ground. my best guess for its diameter is about 60 feet. the object then began traveling east along the mountain ridge for a good distance. we were traveling at about 60mph and i slowed to around 50mph to pace the object. it traveled parallel with us for about 8 minutes and then the object slowly descended behind the ridge toward tomhicken road (route 3020). my wife and i were in awe of what we just saw. \r\nthe size, speed change and change in direction, in my opinion eliminate the possibilty of meteor, conventional aircraft, or aviation flares. i researched flares and found the average burn time about three minutes.  since we observed the object for about ten minutes total time and considering the change is direction and size, i do not believe it was a flare. there were no other aircraft visible in the imediate area. there were however, several other vehicles on the road that night and at least two slowed down as we had to observe the object.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

early morning and rushed outdoors to see a very low-flying object described as a \"jumbo jet\" painted red and white which appeared from the northeast, overflew the island, and departed on about a 175 true heading over the horizon. doors were clearly visible on the flying object and the noise was described as exceptionally loud.\r\n\r\nit was suggested that this occurrence might be connected with the disappearance of malaysia airlines flight 370 from kuala lumpur which had occurred a few hours earlier that morning; however, analysis of the latter flight's presumed position seems to indicate that it could not have been in the area at the time. \r\n\r\nthe incident occurred in an area where low-flying commercial aircraft are never seen, as there is no nearby airport out of which such an airplane could have operated. air traffic controllers in mal��, some 100 miles to the northeast, confirmed that no known commercial aircraft were operating in the area at the time. the description is inconsistent with any known military aircraft, and the behavior is anomalous for a large jet aircraft, which would have been expected to be at cruise altitude had it transited the area.\r\n\r\nthe object departed in the direction of addu island,but no one there reported observing it. the only land on the projected flight path beyond addu is the coast of antarctica, some 4,200 miles to the south (though the path would have passed close to two uninhabited islands enroute, grande terre and heard island.)\r\n\r\nparallels are suggested with the scandinavian \"ghost flier\" sightings of 1933-34, which also involved sightings of detailed, realistic airplane-like objects in contexts where no known real aircraft could possibly have been.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

it lowered a bit more, and it seemed that it was coming in our direction. but it didn't take long for what looked like a red ball to turn into other colors again. then it flew all the way up and continued to move like it had when we first spotted it: very fast, up and down, and to the sides.\r\n\r\nmy feelings: fear combined with self-control and peace (even though i'm usually very emotional -- i don't know how i managed to stand still during those moments). with my fingers, i made the sign of number 8 and a triangle, and placed my hands on my forehead ( i was trying to convey friendliness). while it was approaching and passing right above us, i stood still repeating: \"peace, friends, peace, friends.\" however, my friend seemed to be in a frantic-like state. he rushed inside the beach and started screaming, fell on his knees and begged to be taken.\r\n\r\n...As it moved up into the sky, we got into my car, and it once again transformed into a star. it moved up and down, back and forth, and seemed blended into the sky with the surrounding stars. \r\n\r\none week later, when my friend and i went back to the same spot, we saw a small, soundless, roundish light above the ocean. it looked bright yellowish. we asked each other \"do you think it's the ufo?\" in unison. it glowed once, and very slowly the lights dimmed and it raised vertically, and very slowly, it moved above the sea, towards the end of the shore. we instantly jumped into my car and drove up to the end of the beach, but it remained hovering above the mountains, and i had no courage to continue to drive in that place. (i couldn't tell if it was a ufo, but it was certainly something unknown, trying to make itself known while in camouflage).\r\n\r\n\r\ni'm writing about this event, even though it's been years, not only because of the event per se, which were remarkable, but also because again in 1982, when those shores were yet pretty deserted, a group of friends and i saw \"something\" (about 4 or 5 miles away) colorful above the sea, it was hovering. we observed it in awe, and watched what seemed like a tiny light coming out of it and going into the sea.\r\n\r\ni believe that among the shores of \"barra da tijuca\" \"recreio dos bandeirantes and \"grumary\" ( in rio de janeiro- rj, brazil) there was something going on, at least until the beginning of the eighties, when these areas were deserted places.\r\n\r\ni know it's been a long time, but who cares about time, when we have quantum physics proving us that time is not linear?\r\n\r\nthank you for your attention,\r\nbest

i called on the cb radio and asked if a traffic \r\njam was down the road,\r\n a truck driver answered me and said he didn't hear of \r\nany, i then found out he was behind me about 1/4 mile. as i got\r\n closer to the \r\nlight i slowed down to get a better look at it, (about 45 mph) now i could \r\nsee smaller lights around the\r\n bottom of this craft, flashing green, blue,\r\nred. i asked the truck driver if he saw the bright light out his left hand\r\n \r\nwindow.\r\n then he told me he was looking at a very bright disk with little lights \r\nflashing on the bottom. as i neared the\r\n area of the light i pulled over on \r\nthe shoulder of the highway, just below and south of it.I was just above the speing\r\n garden street exit, my position was south and across from the philadelphia art musuam almost under a stone railroad btidge.  \r\n just then a truck \r\npassed me, and asked me on the cb if i was ok. i told him yes and asked if he \r\nwould report what we were\r\n seeing. \"no way!\" was his answer.\r\n\r\n when i rolled down my window to hear the whir of the rotor blades, it \r\nthen hit me that\r\n there wasn't any noise coming from this object. for some \r\nreason i picked up the spot light i use to locate house numbers,\r\n flashing it \r\nat the ufo, the craft flashed back from a smaller light in the very bottom \r\ncenter. it was mimicking me, ok\r\n lets try something here, flashing in morse\r\ncode the word \"hi\" it flashed back \"hi\". it must be a program to repeat back \r\nto\r\n the sender. so then i flashed \"my name is chalie\". what i expected to receive \r\nand didn't is why i'll remember this for the\r\n rest of my life. they \r\ntransmitted back to me \"my name is zon\". \r\n\r\nnow i can find out where they are from, looking back at the\r\n object it was \r\ngone! i scanned the sky and never saw it again. stunned and shaking i used \r\nthe mobile phone to report what\r\n just happened. three days later two men from \r\nthe government, (their words) interviewed me and told me someone would be\r\n \r\ncalling me to check on my sighting. to this day no one has ever called or\r\n asked about it.\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":55170,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.956535,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04022014-0020","longitude":-75.161799,"occurred":500025600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1396477980000,"summary":"Signeld bright ball in morse code, it answered back in morse code.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"19100","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":10375,"locationName":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:179815"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82751,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1112}
