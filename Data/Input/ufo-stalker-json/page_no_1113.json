this report is not a joke. we skywatch as often as possible as we have a lot of strange aerial activity here at night. there is an increase in the aerial phenomenon known as \"fake plane/transformer ufo\" sightings. whereas a bright glowing orb (usually, white, red, amber, or golden) is seen in the sky \"morphing or transforming\" into what appears to be a conventional aircraft light formations sometimes with fake airplane sounds accompanying it. \r\n\r\nlast night i was filming an object i suspected of being one of these craft. my boyfriend ( who is a an honorably discharged us marine with 5 years experience in avionics) was observing the same object i was filming through his nightvision binoculars. he alerted me that there was \"something\" following the craft i was filming. neither of us could see this object he was speaking about with our eyes. when airplanes at the same altitude this object was are easily visible with the naked eye.\r\n\r\ni looked through the nightvision and sure enough there was something following this unknown craft we were filming. it seemed to be slowing cruising along just above and right behind this fake plane i was filming. i began filming the incident. the spherical object had a very faint flicker to it which at the time i was filming, i didn't see. during the time i was filming it, the object seemed to slow down at times but stayed on a straight path of following this fake plane i had been filming a few minutes prior.\r\n\r\ni am familiar with satellites and even the famous iss. neither of us believe this was a satellite. \r\n\r\ni don't know what this was, but im pretty sure i know what it wasn't\r\n\r\nthe footage for this report is seen in the second half of this video on youtube. /watch?V=kijzb66uzs8.\r\n\r\ndon't worry about having an investigator contact me. i know if anything is flickering it's automatically concluded to be an airplane with mufon. no offense but it's true. i just want my report published so that others go outside & skywatch. these things need to be observed & documented. they are very real. transformer decepticons are real.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

could no longer see them. i cannot say for sure but thought i caught glimpses of an object 3 mores times until i crossed the belgian border. the objects were dark colored cylinder shaped with 3 white lights down each side. the light beam emitted from the first light on the left side of the object as i faced it. the objects seemed to move slowly but methodically. i got an sense that it was almost like they were scanning or mapping. i don't know that's just the feeling i got. when the object turned to parallel the road it didn't seem to bank like i thought it would. it just slowly turned like a train going around a bend.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"03:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line

(i have stray cats that i feed; but they hadn���t come yet. i was looking for one of the cats that was pregnant, and i was worried about her babies.)  my house isn���t far from the back alley of the house. (i���m horrible with feet estimations.)  but i���d say the back porch/yard of my house is about���for lack of the proper knowledge���about two in ground, family-sized swimming pools away from the back alley where i feed my strays. i know it was about 9pm because it had just gotten dark, and that���s what time it begins to get dark that time of year where i live. \r\n\r\n2.) i noticed the object because it would have been virtually impossible *not* to notice the object. \r\n\r\n3.) well, since the object was fairly low-flying, i knew it wasn���t a plane or balloon or other such easily-identified flying vehicles. plus, planes, etc. are not circular/orbs, nor do they glow a fiery, beautiful, bright orange color.  so i reckoned it wasn���t something that is publicly known regarding military or new private-sector experimental flight vehicles because i just can���t see them making a ���fireball��� vehicle. but what do i know?? \r\n\r\nso, i thought ���it��� was something unknown to (most of the) public. \r\n\r\n4.) okay.  so, the orb like bright orange���for lack of a better term������fire ball��� flew away. (by the way, this wasn���t the typical ���ghost��� orb. it was way bigger than those ���ghost orbs��� folks have taken pics of, yet not super large either.)  anyway, as it flew away, it dropped ���something��� out of it.  i cannot tell if it dropped out/released its object on purpose,  *or*  the dropped object ���crashed���, involuntarily into the neighbor���s tree in my back alley.  the ���dropped��� or ���fallen out��� object was either black or  dark gray. now here���s the super weird part���.\r\n\r\nthe object that either purposely dropped into the tree or accidentally crashed into the tree was robotic i assume.  i say this because it did something: let me explain.  okay, for describing purposes, , , picture a black jack in the box child���s toy for the next story portion������  this dark object was not that much bigger than a jack in the box, nor was it much different than one!!!  as i watched the black object, a smaller���again for lack of better words���strobe-like or snake-neck-like object protruded from the middle of the original small black object that fell/crashed./dropped purposely into the tree. on the top of the ���neck��� or ���snake-like neck��� there was an eye.  (not a real human eye, , , just something like a robotic eye).  and therein lies my 15 minutes: me watching the ���eye��� watching me!!!  i know it���s weird, but it is what it is. or was what it was.  \r\n\r\nthe ���eye��� scope watched me for about 15minutes until i realized that my dad would have loved to have been witness to this strange event, regardless of what it was (even if it wasn���t anything super special like a ufo or what have you; it would have been fun for my poor dad, and it was still a unique experience! but he missed it). so, upon that realization, , , i ran into the house (again, a fairly short distance, in that it probably took me about 10 seconds to run into the house������then another four to five minutes to try to explain something so weird to someone----so that they understand you enough to really want to come out and see!!!    \r\n\r\n6.) however, and of course, my poor dad missed it.  it was just gone!  so i���m so sorry to disappoint you by not being able to tell you how/when it ���flew��� away!!!  i mean obviously it ���went��� away from between about four to five minutes----give or take 45 seconds or so���. \r\n\r\n\r\n(i did number 5 and 6 in reverse because it makes it easier for me to relate my ���feelings��� about it at the end of the story, verses the number five instruction you give. so here it goes���)\r\n\r\n5.) how i felt.\r\nwell, i checked, ���affected my physiologically��� whilst filling this report because i think i  *was* affected, , , in that, , , i consider myself reasonably intelligent.  i would have thought to run and show my dad anything weird, fun, unique, exciting, etc, etc.  especially a weird, robotic moving, small object with a ���neck��� and an ���observation eye���!!!  however, i was mesmerized.  i didn���t move, sit to rest my feet, move my eyes off it, or anything for the whole 15 minutes.  i was like, ���locked-in-gaze��� with it (and it me).  like i said, i read a little; but i don���t know much at all! yet, it wouldn���t take an pro to figure out that it was observing me.  and, i hate to add this because i���m quite sure it���ll make me see ���crazy��� or an unreliable witness; but a women kind of knows when she���s been stared at or watched.  i ���felt��� it was definitely watching/observing me, and i was pretty transfixed. it was only when i snapped out of it, , , that i was able to fetch my dad (too late to see anything).  it took me 15 minutes to form my own thought (of my dad).  \r\n\r\ni don���t know if there���s any info i might have accidentally forgotten or anyone would like or any questions. i���m very nice.  i like people, and i wouldn���t mind answering anything at all. i guess since i���m not allowed to put my personal info, you���d have to contact mufon and ask them. but i���d sure like to know if anyone���s had a smiliar experience.  you hear ���ufo��� stories over the year; but i���ve yet to hear one that a person has a close incounter with a robotic entity!  i���d sure like to talk to someone else if there���s someone out there.  too bad i can���t leave my email���  ahh well���. \r\n\r\nbright blessings to you all,\r\n\r\ns \r\n\r\n\r\np.S.  it was moving its ���neck���. like a snake would do to look into a hole or something. and it definitely appeared robotic (not organic entity, but who knows!!!). \r\nemail me if you want me to email you my sketch.  sorry i didn't have a camera. i'm not a 'sky-watcher'. just was looking for my stray cats that i feed. i didn't realize the mufon form would have an upload option. i wasn't prepated! sorry! so i'll draw what i saw first thing tomorrow morning (april 2nd), and i'll have it available for you by 5pm est. if interested. peace everyone!!!\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

in the opposite direction. so now i was looking both east and west and the two objects appeared to be on a collision course so i really started to pay attention. i was also trying to figure who, as in which military base would be flying at that time of night. you see here on vancouver island we have 2 canadian bases and 1 american. the town i live in is kind of centred between them. nothing made any sense so i just kept on watching them. they continued until they came together and seemed to stop for only moments, then each made a sharp turn and ran a straight line side by side and then seemed to stop again and then turned back towards their start point except at an angle that made like a triangle, when they reached nearly to the line they had left when starting they again turned towards each other at a very sharp turn yet again. when they were close to their up line they again made a sharp turn only this time straight up. their stream stayed with them for only a mere second or so and then they were gone. i searched the sky for quite awhile and could find no place within my vision to see if they had come down or crashed. they were simply gone. i went out every night for several nights from about 12 till 1 to see if they would show up again, and well they never did.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

the blinking beacon lights flashing, on this light there were not any blinking lights that i could see, that is what kept my attention. i watched as this light moved in a straight line for about five minutes, then as this light reached a bigger brighter light it seemed to just be absorbed by the bigger light. the bigger light i thought was a planet because it did not blink or seem to move, i had a complete and unobstructed view of this area of the sky. i looked everywhere in the area to see if i could see the moving light, but there was nothing. i came in the house to get my tablet to see if i could figure out what the bigger light may be, i had a star chart app on it, the app would show what i should be seeing in that direction at that time. when i got back out less than two minutes later that bigger light also had disappeared. after i stayed out a few more minutes, nothing unusual caught my eye so i came in and told my wife about my experience. i told her i wanted to come get her so she could see, but i could not leave that spot because i had to see what it did. i have seen unusual lights moving in very strange ways a few other times in my life, but this time i wasn't driving so

at 5:58 am. i proceeded to put on my pants and shoes to go outside and retrieve my newspaper. upon walking out my front door, which faces due east, i was impressed by the sight of a brilliant venus rising in the east. as i walked down my driveway to fetch my newspaper lying by the curb, i noticed a fabulous view of the stars in the night sky unlike anything i have seen in a long time. i attributed this to the fact that a cold front moved south through the area on saturday leaving dry cool air in its wake creating an absolutely clear sky on this morning. no clouds, no distortion in the sky what-so-ever.\r\n\r\ni bent down to pick up my paper then looked again to the night sky to admire the stars. i was looking south and saw the constellation, scorpio and slowly turned to my right, facing west and continued turning and stopped to view the big dipper as i was now facing north-west. that's when i noticed to my left, in my peripheral vision, there was movement in the sky. i turned my head to the left to focus on the object and noticed that there were no lights on this craft. no blinking lights as you would normally see on the wingtips of conventional aircraft, no white light on the nose. this got my attention because this craft was close enough to be able to see such lights easily. the craft was coming from the ssw when i noticed it and it was going to pass directly overhead. this is when i could see it's shape from how it obscured the stars in the sky behind it. it was a solid black triangle.\r\n\r\nas the craft came closer, i could detect that it must have had a highly reflective surface because it seemed that light from ground sources were reflecting off of the bottom hull of the craft. this also provided me with more detail because i could now see the surface of the craft was also curved on the bottom up towards the sides. as it was passing over head it made a gentle change in course to move more to the north instead of the north-east.\r\n\r\nit was now when i noticed something else that was highly unusual, this craft made absolutely no noise at all and it was close enough i would have easily heard something if this was a conventional aircraft. i heard nothing, not even a hum. i continued to watch the object until i lost sight of it in the darkness. total viewing time would not have exceeded 3 minutes.\r\n\r\ni tried to study this object as best as i could. i had no fear of it just a great curiosity. i had a gut feeling that this was not an alien spacecraft but was man made and that i was witnessing the test flight of some new highly advanced technology. keep in mind also that my location is in close proximity to macdill afb in tampa, florida. a perfect place to hide such technology. i think this is an important consideration due to the fact sunrise was at approximately 7:30 am and this would force the landing of the craft and it's concealment before sunrise. it was also my opinion that this craft was not designed using aeronautical engineering. something else was powering this craft that had nothing to do with aero lift or drag and no visible means of thrust.\r\n\r\ni am reporting this to you in hopes that there may have been other witnesses who have also reported to you and all together you would be able to plot a flight pattern and determine where this object came from and where it was going. or

to that of morse code, only much louder, sharper, varying in tone and almost metallic sounding-very crisp and rapid and loud.  went to the screen door of my room that opens to the outside facing north, slid open sliding screen and looked out.  sound was very loud and was coming from directly overhead.  there was no light, totally dark.  could not see directly overhead because of porch roof, and was afraid to go outside.  sound suddenly stopped.  stood there wondering what has just happened.  looked to the north into the sedge meadow, nothing visible.  totally soundless--usually there are night sounds in the wetland--at least insects.  dead quiet.  then i heard the fax signal followed by the electronic sequence again, only this time farther away, out over the sedge meadow.  it is a conservation area of 475 acres and there is nothing there.  could see no object associated with the sounds.  the time lapse between the first sequence that was right over head, and the second sequence out in the wetland, was only about 10 seconds.  i listened and the signal lasted a few minutes.  then a few seconds later, i heard it again, only much fainter and farther away. then it stopped. at that point i had to attend to my dog who was upset, and went back to her on the bed\r\n\r\noctober 8, 2013--awakened at 1:57 am by the fax signal again.  ran to door and opened the sliding glass door and screen door, looked out.  sound again coming very loud from over head.  clear night, frost.  afraid to go out and look. the sequence of signals lasted until 2:04 am.  then moved a few seconds later to the north.  repeated.  moved again to the north, repeated.  this continued until no longer audible. could see no object that could be source of the signal. these events recurred into november, but coming progressively further from the east, moving north. always at or near 2 am. like something flying a grid, and signaling at intervals.","distance":"20 Feet or

decided to take a picture of the sunrise as it was particularly nice that morning. i noticed nothing at the time of the photo. upon reviewing it via computer, i noticed an odd coloration within the cloud area lit up by the sun. zooming in, i could see a triangle of lights. i considered that it may have been an airplane, but you can see in the photo the contrail of one to the right of the artifact. \r\n\r\ni know that in that direction is the approximate location of the o'hare flight corridor, but i highly doubt 3 planes would be circling outside of the landing orbit and so close together at that. i also considered that it was a smudge on the windshield as i was shooting though that. to debunk this, i took another picture at about the same time and location the next day, but the artifact did not present itself again. as it's winter, there are no bugs and birds would come up as black against the bright background.\r\n\r\nin the first picture provided, i took the liberty adding a zoom bubble of the artifact, though nothing else had been altered with the photo. i provided the unaltered picture as well for comparison (picture 2).","distance":"Over One

\r\n\r\nwhite otter (tom tetley, age 64) and i (su walker, age 55) were sitting together on the sofa watching television when suddenly a very large, potent feeling, strange wave of some sort seemed to roll silently though the living room from northwest to south east. i can only describe it as a large distortion ripple that flowed through the entire room like a tsunami. it didn't seem as tall as the room, but perhaps around 6 feet tall and rounded at its leading edge.  during the waves passing through us and the room, i remember seeing a slight distortion as if i were looking through curved glass.  it felt as if otter, i, and the sofa were being lifted up about 12 inches. i remember feeling momentarily weightless (perhaps a second or two) and set back down. it seemed like the couch was distorted upward and us with it, then returned to normal. i glanced at white otter whose eyes were also wide, startled by the weirdness that had just passed through the living room.\r\n\r\n\"did you feel that? was that an earthquake?\" i asked him. never having experienced a quake, i assumed he would reply with a nod.  otter did not.\r\n\r\n\"that was no earthquake,\" replied the california native firmly.\r\n\r\n\"then what was that? that was the strangest thing i've ever felt!\" i was very aware of the direction the wave came from and where it was on its way to as it traveled through the house. i also had the perception that its origin was not all that far away, perhaps up toward the four corners area? i picked up my cell phone to note the time. it read 9:39 pm. \r\n\r\nwhite otter just shook his head. his attention turned back to the television and suddenly he uttered aloud, \"what happened to the rest of our show?!\" \r\n\r\ni looked up then and realized the show we had been watching, which had a full 21 minutes left, was nearly ending. i checked my phone again. it read 9:54. i had just checked it the moment before. suddenly we both realized that neither of us could account for the missing 15 minutes. neither of us had any perception or memory of what had occurred during the skip in time.\r\n\r\nas a note of honest disclosure, i do have a history of experiencing ufos and visitors from a few other pretty long distance places.  i went through my own personal flap from 1998 to 2002.  however, even with that in my background, this was super weird! i'm a professional detail psychic for goodness sakes, so my \"strange meter\" takes a lot to set it off to this magnitude.\r\n\r\nso...Unique traveling distortion wave with gravitational anomalies coupled with 15 minutes of missing time by two people simultaneously between 9:39 and 9:54 mountain time in a suburb just north of albuquerque, new mexico the day before april fools, 2014.  \r\n\r\ndoes
