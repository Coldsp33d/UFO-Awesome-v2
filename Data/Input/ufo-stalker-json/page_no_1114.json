but there was no sign of any visitor. ���my ears are playing tricks on me,��� i thought. after awhile, it seemed as if several people were speaking a few feet away, near the farther end of the lean-to. yet their words were not quite recognizable; it was as if they were speaking in an adjacent dimension. this too i chalked up to nerves.\r\n\tthen there was a loud crash against the front wall of the lean-to, the side that faced the sea, as if it had been struck by a rock. this was no figment of my imagination. \r\n\tin terror, i ran outside, and called out. but there was no reply. i tried to examine the wall of the lean-to, but could hardly see a thing in the dark. the wind was blowing and the tides were making a lot of noise at the shore below. i quickly scrambled up the steep clay incline, using both my hands and feet. the fog was so thick that i was nearly blind, but dared not stop. \r\n\tas i got over the crest, i sensed a presence over my head, but i didn���t look up; just kept running into the miasma across the bed of rubbery green stuff that grew profusely atop the bluffs. a moment later i found myself encircled in a wide ring of light, despite the fog. it was as if a huge floodlight had been focused on me from above as i ran, although this seemed to be physically impossible, given the fog. then on the upper periphery of my vision, i saw what i first imagined was a giant bird about the size of a small plane silently gliding over my head, seeming to shut off the light as it flew by. (in the mufon checklist, i called this a boomarang shape, but it���s really hard to be sure. the sizes and distances are also very rough guesses. and i never saw it in proximity to the horizon, just when it was above me.) i kept running.\r\n\teventually i reached the paved road and hitched a ride back to town with two guys around nineteen or twenty years old who lived on the island with their families. on the way, they asked me what i had been doing near black rock point at night. when i told them what had just occurred, they were astonished. ���didn���t you notice that all of the houses out there are empty? everyone knows���that���s the most haunted part of the island! nobody goes out there after dark!���\r\n\tbecause of this, for decades i believed that the entire episode was some sort of poltergeist phenomenon. but now i���m inclined to believe that it was a ufo experience ��� my first and i hope, my last.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":55114,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.172137,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03312014-0022","longitude":-71.5576073,"occurred":-14835600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Rhode Island","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1396313516000,"summary":"Poltergeist phenomena followed by silent craft with beam gliding over my head as i ran across bluffs near block island sea shore.
