wrong because of the way they were calling my name and i was immediately panicked i walked out of the sliding glass door to see my two family members looking up and i said \"what happened? whats wrong?\"\r\ni was told to look up at the sky and i instantly noticed and object moving side to side and up and down sometime stopping ...Seemed random and also the lights i will never forget theses lights the colors where red,purple,green and the most beautiful colors i have ever seen i cant properly explain myself as i type this i am still a bit shaken up and not sure exactly how to process what just happened to me.....I stared at the lights that were attached to this object for approximately 5 minutes? i was asked to go and get my phone to take a picture and i immediately said \"no i dont wanna miss this!\" and i could see that at certain times there was a pulse? or beam of light that came out of the object when i saw the green .....The colors where so beautiful .......I just stared into them amazed and absolutely stunned by what i was seeing and it was close no more than a mile away ....It was close very close , my relative did take a picture of the object but for some reason it did not show up on the picture hardly at all ......We watched it dim ? and then get brighter and move around in very, strange random patterns flashing lights .....Almost changing shape or maybe because it was turning so much i don't know  ....Then it stopped in mid air and something lit up underneath it ...A very bright orange ball of light directly underneath it and it started coming down from the sky very slowly , my relative actually jumped in his car and went to look for it that it was so close .......After seeing those lights , i felt very strange for aprox. 30 min to an hour but did notice that the nausea i was experiencing earlier that night was gone ....However when i would blink i would still see the green light in my vision ...The green light was somehow what really stood out most to me ....Its been a few days since i witnessed this ....And i seriously don't know  how to explain what's going on with me , i feel different somehow ...Some sort of clarity ? ....Along with being very very confused ......And i am not sure who to talk to about this besides the two other witnesses i told my gf and i think that i made myself sound crazy lol....So i found you guys ....I hope this helps someone out there somehow ....This is in no way a joke or a hoax and what i saw was not an airplane, helicopter or anything of the sort .........","distance":"501 Feet - 1

driving down a straight road with an open field to the right and i glanced over at what i thought were several helicopters flying in a formation,( blackhawks and chino will often fly in pairs over town), but noticed that they were flying pretty low. at this point i rolled down my windows and slowed down as it flew in front of me and to my left. it was travelling about 10-15 mph as it flew in front and to the left there is a neighborhood. as it reached over the neighborhood it seemed to hover over the houses with a circular path. the front 2/3 of the craft was in the shae that resembled the hr71 blackbird and the back end looked like it had some sort of stabilizers, it was only visible from the lights on it. there were five lights 3 white lights one on the front area and two on the back which rendered it to appear as a triangle, and two red lights on the belly that reminded me of those 70s dome cop lights that stick to the roof. the lights spun at approx 1 revolution every 2 seconds and one spun clockwise and the other counter clockwise.  i felt bizarre as anyone would seeing something that i had not seen before and was unable to identify it.  i slowed down and took video. after taking about a minute of video it had moved on from that neighborhood to another about 100 feet away from it. so i sped up to turn and follow it but by then it had bizarrely reached approximately a distance of about 3/4 of a mile then i turned again to head in the direction but by the time i turned i couldn't see it anymore. the video i took unfortunately was like a cliche with

was with  my 17 and 12 year old daughters) were very near the airport but this wasn't an airplane.  as we got closer to it, i asked one of my daughters \"what is that?\"  it was a v shaped object in the sky but it wasn't moving.  it had lights on it around the point of the v or at the point.  i was actually severely lacking sleep at the time so i kept asking my daughter what is that?  she kept saying she didn't know.  the only reason we could see it aside from the lights on the object was because the object was darker in color than the sky.  the lights were not beaming they were just on.  i picked up my phone and called my husband and asked him how fast an airplane had to go in order to maintain any altitude in the sky because this wasn't moving.  my other daughter then said she saw a plane.  it was moving.  when i got off the phone with my husband i kept asking my daughters what that was.  my 12 year old kept saying she didn't know but that she knew for sure the one thing was an airplane.  i said then what was the other thing?  she said i don't know.  so i said when i was on the phone you know for a fact that the one thing was an airplane she said yes.  i said then what was the other thing?  she said i don't know.  \r\n\r\nthe lights i saw were also round in shape i do not recall how many lights there were.  i also can not remember exactly what direction the object was in the sky, i know it was not up and down but could have been horizontal but somehow i could see the lights and feel like they were on the bottom or underside of the object.\r\n\r\ni pulled up some pictures tonight and had my 17 year old look at them because i saw something that looked very similar to what i'd seen.  i asked her to look at the pictures and she pointed out exactly what i thought looked like what we'd seen.  when i tried to get my 12 year old to look she refused and ran out of the room and avoids anything and everything to do with this.  i don't know why.\r\n\r\nbecause i was so tired i didn't do what i would have done had i been thinking clearly and that would have been to pull over on the interstate and take pictures (it wasn't that busy on the road) and i'd have watched it.\r\n\r\ni hope it happens again but what i'd really like to know is if anyone else has reported it.
