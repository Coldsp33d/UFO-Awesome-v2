apartment faced a small open courtyard shared by three other apartment buildings. as we were talking something caught my eye and i noticed what i initially thought was a t shirt/ plastic shopping bag fall from the second story of the building across from where i was sitting at(around 25 yards away) but how it fell and the color and size seemed way off to me. i kept talking to my friend but my full attention turned to this object because it never touched the ground and was hovering about 5-6 feet above the ground and was completely still. my friend kept talking but she quickly fell silent after noticing the object. after the object hovered for about ten seconds it started moving to and around the doors and windows of other apartments and appeared to look into the windows, as it did this it was completely motionless and still about 5 feet off the ground, except when it observed the windows of the second story windows it was around 15 foot off the ground. as this was happening i was not scared but tried to act like it was not happening because i was unsure about the capabilities of this object. the object kept floating up and down \"observing\" then after several minutes flew directly to where we were sitting then abruptly turned to its left (our right). i then got an excellent look at it, it was about the size of a basketball but was transparent and it resembled a human brain, and appeared to have beady eyes which looked right at me.   i then stood up in amazement and it turned and looked directly at me and raised up about a foot almost instantaneously then took off behind the building to my right, i then followed it and my friend followed behind me. i saw the object hovering about 6 feet off the ground close to the apartment buildings exterior wall as i approached. when i got 5 feet from it the object it immediately raised up to 10 feet i then reached towards it and it raised up a few more feet, i am 6'4\"-6'5\" and when i raise my hand all the way up its closer to 9 feet. but when i lowered my hand the object dropped in height, i then raised my hand again and it raised again i lowered my hand and it lowered. then i slowly raised my hand again and the object lowered itself allowing me to touch it for a few seconds. i felt very calm after touching the object and lowered my hand after it raised up again. my dad came outside to see what where i was and my dog was barking a lot.  it then looked at me then abruptly shot off into the sky, i watched it as long as i could until it vanished into the night sky.

i'm 99.9% sure i did, because i can describe it like it was yesterday. but if i really did see it. could it be possible that they took me, planted a device in my skull and then brought me back without anyone ever knowing?\r\n\r\ni may never really know. but regardless of what i or anyone else thinks about any of this. i will always believe that in all that vastness of space, we can not possibly be the only intelligent forms of life. and although we may never know. i hope that if we ever do find out someday, that it's in a peaceful manner and that we can help and learn from each other.\r\n\r\nplease continue searching for the truth.\r\n\r\nthank you,\r\njames balzer\r\n\r\nand although i have no pictures or drawings of what i witnessed, i can describe the event in exact detail.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":55044,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.482326578145475,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03292014-0028","longitude":-88.20622721045659,"occurred":364964400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Wisconsin","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1396152849000,"summary":"I witnessed a ufo flying over our neighborhood when i was a child.","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"53095","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":11935,"locationName":"West Bend, Wisconsin","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:181750"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Lakewood","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"  on a full moon night in august of 2003, about the 13th, at approximately 2am, i was talking on the phone while sitting on my front porch and an orb appeared. the orb was about the size of a large grapefruit. it hovered above my lawn, next to the apex of my roof, about 25 feet above the ground and about 20 feet away from me. \r\n at first, i thought it was a spiritual orb until i focused on the center of it and realized it was moving in a more \"mechanical\" way. the orb's aura emanated light approximately 1 foot in diameter. the orb seemed to be made of glass and the light inside of it moved very rapidly in the pattern of the infinity sign. \r\n  the only other lights around were: the streetlights, some stars and the full moon. i remember thinking how the light of the full moon paled in comparison to this orb. i was transfixed on it. i could not look away. i have a mild form of epilepsy and usually bright lights bother me severely but the brilliance of this orb did not hurt my eyes at all.\r\n  i am not sure exactly how long this orb hovered there. it seemed like minutes but it could have been merely seconds. i was so hypnotized by the rapidly moving light inside, time seemed to stand still. i don't remember it appearing or disappearing. at the time this happened i had absolutely no belief in aliens or ufos. i told one person about it and they dismissed it and me, so i never spoke of it again until years later.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"When: 1967, june (day unknown)\r\nwhere: big sur coastal highway, near lucia, ca, parked in a highway 1 mountain-side pullout, about 500 feet above the ocean.\r\n\r\nup to now, i was a hard-nosed skeptic concerning ufos.  i believed air force investigations that had ���proven��� all ufo sightings had either been hoaxes or natural phenomena, and reputable scientists had concurred.\r\n\r\naround 3:30 a.M., as i was dozing off to sleep in the rear of our van, an unusual low-pitched, pulsing, hum caught my attention.  at first i thought it was a freight train in the distance.  then i realized that the nearest railroad tracks were located in the salinas valley, along the east side of the santa lucia mountain range.  furthermore, the pitch of the hum was a bit too high to be that of a distant train, and too low to be that of any aircraft i had ever heard.  as an aviation enthusiast and licensed private pilot, i had developed a keen ear for aircraft engine sounds, and could identify many airplanes by sound alone.\r\n\r\nclimbing out of the rear of our van, my wife and i  immediately observed that the low-pitched hum was emanating from a white glowing disk-shaped object a half mile south of us.  initially, the object emerged from a narrow canyon that opened onto a small beach.  then the disk slowly climbed towards the ocean.  for the first minute or two, the craft was only a few feet above the beach and slowly ascending, with small yellow flames randomly erupting several places along the bottom of its large glowing disk.  soon after igniting, the burning objects fell off the bottom of the craft and hit the ground, sometimes with a burst of sparks upon impact before flickering out.  as the craft continued its slow climb, fewer flames erupted and fell off the craft.  by the time the craft was about 200 feet (70 meters) high, the last of the flammable debris had ignited and fallen into the ocean.  it appeared that this debris was ground vegetation that had been adhering to the bottom of the craft, for the flames had the same yellow-orange color and flicker as burning brush.\r\n\r\nthe lack of a nearby reference made it difficult to determine size, but we estimated the disk to be approximately 150 feet long and 25 feet thick in the center.  this mysterious object had the same appearance and sound of ufos in hollywood movies such as the day the earth stood still.\r\n\r\nby this point, we had four observers; two friends in the front seats (tom and mary), my wife (kathleen), and  me.  i knocked on the two cars parked beside us, disturbing both partially-dressed couples who were making love, oblivious to the excitement outside.  tom and i also flagged down a motorist, so we now had nine witnesses.  in amazement, all of us kept our eyes glued to the slow flight of the ufo.\r\n\r\n  once the glowing disk was above the ocean, it changed direction and began moving directly towards us at a slowly accelerating speed.  the hum grew louder and slightly higher in pitch as it approached us, and the glow of the craft illuminated the nearby mountainside.\r\n\r\nwhen the ufo was several hundred feet away and still slowly flying directly towards us, six of our observers scrambled in terror into a gully on the other side of the road to hide.  by now, the ufo was illuminating the three of us who did not flee.  feeling intense fear, my instinct was to run and hide, but the ���scientific observer��� in me made me stay where i was, well, almost.  i did back up across the road, along with tom and the driver we had stopped.  as the large ufo came along side and level with us, the surrounding area was illuminated enough by the glow of the craft to cast our shadows on the cliff face behind us.  the glow made the area almost as bright as daylight, but with the monochromatic illumination of a full moon.  the throbbing hum became faster, louder, and higher in pitch as the speed of the disk slowly increased.\r\n\r\nwhen the glowing ufo was abreast of us and a couple hundred feet away, tom exclaimed, ���come take me with you!���  his cry put my nerves more on edge as i did not want to catch the attention of the ufo crew, who were close enough to hear tom.  even at this close distance, the outline of the object was indistinct and fuzzy.  as the disk passed by us, the white glow transformed into a faint yellow hue.  the loud hum also continued to increase in pitch in proportion to the increasing speed of the craft.  the faint yellow glow of the craft smoothly transitioned to deep yellow, then to orange, and finally to deep red just before it flew out of sight.  after passing us, the acceleration of the ufo became exponential, increasing at an ever faster rate, once it began an upward-curving flight path.  it was flying almost straight up at an extremely fast speed when it finally became too small to see.\r\n\r\nthis experience left us all in shock.  repeatedly, we went over the details, finding it hard to believe our senses and needing confirmation that we had not been hallucinating or dreaming.  when the ufo was only a few hundred feet from us, we were all filled with an intense tingling, visceral terror that was out of proportion to the experience.  we literally felt our hair stand on end.  the three of us who remained in the open agreed that it took all our strength to resist sensations of terror and not run and hide with the others in the gully.\r\n\r\ni strongly suspect that the physical sensations we felt were related to a strong electromagnetic field coming from the propulsion system.  this suspicion was validated in 1984 when i briefly worked in a small metal transmitter room at the base of a broadcast tower.  the room was filled with powerful tv and radio broadcasting transmitters and multi-thousand-watt power-supply transformers that created a loud hum from the extremely strong electromagnetic fields they generated.  upon entering this room, i felt my hair tingle, and i experienced an anxiety-producing visceral sensation that reminded me of the similar but more powerful feelings i had experienced when the ufo flew near me.\r\n\r\nthe morning after our ufo sighting, i called the local flight service station to see if there had been any notams (notice to airmen) or unusual pilot reports in the big sur area.  there were none.  whenever the military conducted exercises or experiments they always issued notams in order to close their airspace to civilian air traffic.  fort hunter-liggett, a military training base, is on the east side and a bit south of the coastal mountains we were on.\r\n\r\nlater that day we met a hippie who had been camped on the beach south of the ufo takeoff.  he, too, had been awakened by the loud hum coming from the craft, which he saw take off a few hundred feet from his campsite.  his description of events concurred with our observations.\r\n\r\nthe above account was written when my wife and i returned home from our vacation so we could share our experience with our friends, and capture details of the event while it was still fresh in our mind.\r\n\r\nhoward sodja\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional

the speed of a helicopter but it made no sound. i'm used to seeing helicopters fly over and i know what they sound like. it passed over my head and cleared the trees. i was so dumbfounded that i began meditating again and asked for the craft to do another fly over my head if this was in fact real. after i did that for a few seconds, the craft turned around and headed directly over my head again. it came from the north and went south. then it came from the south and went north. no sounds. i had a feeling of joy as if i had actually communicated to a being in the craft. it confirmed the reality to me when the craft reversed and came literally straight over my head. i at first thought it was a plane because of the red flashing light but i didn't hear any noise and i've never seen an airplane with two rectangular orange beams of light that were at least 6 times the size of the red flashing orb. i have extensive knowledge of military and civilian aircraft. the rectangle orange aligned north to south almost sandwiching the red light. there was distance between all the lights and i could not see anything behind the lights but i felt as thought there was a large unlit craft. it moved too
