(lat/lon included) i left work as normal had just entered westbound onto round lake bypass. i was the only vehicle in the valley at that moment, which is not normal, but happens occasionally. the traffic circle i had just exited is higher in altitude, and the bridge over the waterway is a gentle arc that dips down over the waterway and rises back up on the other bank. the grey region between my vehicle and the orb (see screenshot) are steep rock embankments as the road bed was dug down into the hillside. this forms a vision tunnel as you enter, there is really nothing to see there, so your eyes naturally shift focus all the way down to the bridge. just seconds after exiting the circle and my vision now focused down into the valley, a white orb shot straight up from just north of the close end of the bridge. this area is a conjunction of: highway bridge, access road, nature trail, stream, retention pond, and drainage ditch. ordinarily, i would ignore a situation like this, except for the velocity situation. while it vaguely resembled a white flare, there was absolutely no change in velocity as it ascended and disappeared. it traveled much faster than vehicles, but slower than ballistics, and as it climbed up out of site (eventually cut off by my vehicle roof-line) there was no fall-off in speed at all. as an engineer who is excellent at estimating, my best guess would be 200 to 300 mph. i know this is not an exciting siting, but the last time i saw an odd light (green light that flashed s->n through my living room), there was an earthquake just minutes

9:30pm and a very clear night sky. she was out back with my mother-in-law and her two other friends. being polite i stuck around to listen to their discussion. i was standing the whole time and just started to look at the sky. all i saw were stars. and just looked to the east, south and west enjoying the night sky. i noticed a larger brighter circle white light much lower than the stars and stationary not flickering. it appeared to be at an altitude that an airliner would fly while making an approach to land a couple miles out. fyi, i live close to a smaller airport, and know the patterns, size and what and airliner looks like at night. the strange part was that there were no airlines in the sky while i was looking around. i continued to look around in the night sky some more, always looking back at that circle brighter light in the sky. i remember a few times looking at my wife's mom and her friends while they where talking. i was really testing to see if that light would go away when i looked back up at it. finally after looking and starring at the light for about the 4th or 5th time. i finally asked my mother-in-law,her friends, and my wife to look at the bright light in the sky. their conversation stopped and everyone just looked at it for about a minute. i think it was one of my son's who asked me what that was. i simply said i don't know. we all starred at the bright light. i looked at my mother-in-law and her friends and everyone was just looking at the light. i looked back at the light which still has not moved in the 12-15min i have been at my mother-in-laws. \r\n\r\nthen about 3sec. after i tuned back to look at the circle bright light in the sky. a bright light that was narrow from the bright circle and widened as it reached earth shined down from the circle bright light all the way down to the ground for about 12-15sec. then that light jumped or shot up off the ground to about 3/4 the way down to ground from the ufo for about 2,to 3 sec. then the light shining down jumped/shot up again from the ufo and is now about 1/2 way down to the ground,then for about 1 sec. the light that was shining down jumped/shot up again to about 1/4 way down to the ground from the ufo. at this point the light was almost back to the circle bright light. then within a nano second what was left of the light shining down blacked out and so did the bright circle light. gone. it just disappeared. i looked at my mother-in-law,her friends,wife and everyone's jaw was dropped like they saw a ghost. and we all just looked at each other.\r\n\r\nmy mother-in-law started making excuses. she said it was a plane. i told her planes don't sit there that long and shine a light down, and said there are no planes around. interestingly enough. i started to see airlines fly by. and pointed to her that is what an airline looks like in the sky which wasn't even remotely close to what we witnessed. in fact, the 12-15 min that the circle light was in the sky there were no airlines. after the circle light was gone. in about 8 min. later i saw two airlines in the sky one flying east to west the other north to south just west of me. and those were the airlines i pointed to my mother-in-law. her friends were still in shock. i didn't know who to call so i went home got online( can't remember the site) and filed a report.","distance":"Over One

look out my bedroom window. i was calm and actually felt like i was going to see family. i looked out my 2nd story bedroom window to notice a yellow/green pulsating peacful very slow decending orb like object. it rested silently about a block away over the houses and the lights stopped and just a slight outline remained. i knew it was clearly there for me. i recieved messages in my head and understood everything being told/taught to me. words and images . about long before humans , during our ancestors times and warnings of human pride. war was always on their mind not war with is but war among us. that was the day i started and have never been able to stop having a discust for the inhabitants of this world. i'm not saying im alien i'm not crazy.\r\nit's just this sickening feeling lodged so deep it has to be in my dna. several other times leading up to my next visual encounter i've always had frequent what i call my \"reprogramming\"  it's this settling feeling just before sleep followed by a hollow almost electrical twanging noise and i slip away and usually return fully awake within 30-45 minutes laying in my same spot aware that i have no explication for the time thats passed but i always seem to have new knowledge of things i never heard about or thought of on my own and it's always something to do with this world and its people. the premis of the teachings is always the same . all races and people on this planet need to come together as one and when humans can accomplish that very small feat much much more will be given to us but as of the past up till present we \"humans\" cannot be trusted i dont know why i'm told this i just know its always the same . cannot be trusted! at age 23 in a gold rush town in the sierra nevadas california i was awoken about the normal time \"2-3am\" to be drawn out of bed and outside where i witnessed 3 very fast moving and low travelling from east to west triangle shaped craft silent as if they weren't even there but they were so low and so fast i should have heard them but i was not surprised i didnt. but then about 2 minute after they passed out of the northeast i saw 4 incoming low silent fast yellow/green lighted crafts. there was no communication then only a fierce sense of urgency that was so great i sat outside all morning till 7-8am worrying and i didn't even know about what but i just couldn't shake the worrying feeling.. i was even late to work that day. for several more years i went about my life with my eyes in the sky all day all night any free time i ever have i'm living out there even though i'm here.  many more of my \"reprogrammings\" take place over the next 10+ yrs now living back in my home state again i was traveling home from a friends and at about 2:32am i was instructed to pull over next to this field and i watched them come down and rest silently just above the horizon fairly close to me just grayish outlines of the familiar craft . the electric twangy noise came one thing was different this time i tried to take a picture using my cell phone and it was off when i tried and it was back on upon my return to my vehicle not a physical return but the same type of return i experience during my before sleep experiences .My battery was full and i know it was on cuz i just checked the time on my phone hence the i knew the exact time this encounter took place .... i've never came out to anyone about this i am positive that i posses knowledge given to me for whatever reason i'm not sure if im to keep it or pass it on. or if somehow they were using me as a delivery boy and somehow the teachings given to me have been transmitted to where they belong through me to avoid detection.. i have no clue but as you can see i have explored all options and theory's possible to explain this to myself but as of yet i have no idea why me .. i can tell you this , i feel such shame for being human and for bringing others into this world .. i feel so much pain and sorrow that i will not be here when they come back again it feels truly like a child that misses their parents. sorry if i have wasted your time and all but i needed to get this off my chest because it surly will not leave my mind.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path

came running back in the house screaming my name, yelling, \"come outside!\" he was running so hard through our house, his hands smacking the walls, as he was running down the main hallway, that he was shaking the house. i actually thought we were possibly having a small earthquake. i yelled back at him, \"hold on!\" before i could even get outside, he came back inside screaming for me and my son to hurry up! my son and i go outside and see at eye level, why he was so excited. a brilliant, absolutely gorgeous, sphere was at tree top level, directly across the street from your home, hovering directly over our neighbor's large pine tree. it turned colors from a aqua/neon blue, a cobalt blue, a bright red, a hot white and emerald green. after capturing our full attention, the air show began. the maneuvering capability of this light ship was beyond all comprehension. it would arch it's flight path in a \"c\" shape jumping over the top of the pine tree, hopping back and forth, over the top of the tree with ease and back again. it would stop about 50' from the left side of the tree top, hover, then free fall to below the tree line, then ascend straight up faster they anything you could ever see at six flaggs, hover again, go behind the tree, jump over the tree, free fall halfway, stop in mid air, free fall again, then ascend straight up, hover on and on and on and on. this lasted for approximately thirty minutes. my husband had the time to go back inside to find his camera, scrambling to find the right camera lens, running inside and outside and he was successful in video taping the light ship. i have tired to upload the 2 clips but i believe one of the two, is too large. i will try again. the ship remained until our age teenage neighbor and his companion arrived by car at their home, where the action was taken place over their heads. as they drove up, they could clearly see the three of us standing in our driveway, excited and my husband with a camera in his hand filming the sky above their home. they naturally crossed the street and walked into our driveway to see what we were doing and to see what we were looking at. it was at this point that the ship dematerialized, as seen on the second video tape attached. i believe it dematerialized because my husband was informing the teens as they were crossing the street, that it was a \"ufo\" and the two teenagers might have become afraid and the light ship literally dematerialized, just as the two teens were turning to look at it, from our driveway vantage point. i believe this was a completely peaceful contact experience and the \"et's\" are so kind in fact, that if someone becomes afraid, they will dematerialize their ships to avoid causing anyone, any emotional duress whatsoever. i even tried to tell the teens to not be afraid but the ship did not rematerialized in their presence. we had to show them the video so they would not think we were all crazy. please excuse my husband's profanity in the videos, as he was so frenzied and frantic to film this sighting, that we can now both laugh at his reaction. i, on the other hand, was talking to the craft, thanking it for this awesome experience, asking it if we could photograph it, etc., and my husband clearly wanted me to \"shut up!\" our conversation on the audio is hilarious. the experience and sighting left me so incredibly happy for hours. while watching it live, i left like i could predict it's next movements. my husband would say, \"it's gone.\" i found myself responding, \"no it's not, it is going to come out from behind the tree and drop straight down\" and it would. i seriously felt like i was somehow communicating with it and could direct my husband where to point his camera next to try to capture this fast moving object again and again. the best part of this whole experience was that just prior to my husband going to have a smoke outside and seeing this craft at eye level, he and i had just had a brief exchange /squabble about et's. ironically or not, below are the details of our discussion just minutes before his initial sighting. in a nutshell, i am a huge fan of dr. steven greer. i have his et contact app on my cell phone. i was in our bedroom listening to a podcast with dr. greer about the details of his near death experience and i paused the podcast to find my husband in our living room, to tell him about it. i told my husband, unsolicited of course, that i too, like dr. greer, believe that when we die, we go to where we are, consciously and cosmically. so, i was nagging my husband for the 100th time, that i wanted him to increase his conscious awareness, start meditating immediately, quit smoking yesterday and be at a higher level of consciousness, so that by the time we both die, we might have the chance to know each again in another dimension, pending that he cultivate his cosmic awareness. after that lettuce, i walked back to our bedroom to resume my podcast with dr. greer and my husband walked outside and into another dimension. thank you et, thank you mufon and thank you dr. steven greer","distance":"501 Feet - 1

my shaman teacher and fellow students, went outside on my patio to get some fresh air. \r\n\r\nas i was standing on the patio in the sunlight, felt an urge to look up. \r\nsaw something in the sky but did not recognize it as any kind of airplane i have ever seen, and i do like to check out airplanes as my father was a pilot.\r\n\r\nthere was a also a sound somewhat like a jet engine.\r\n\r\n\r\nwent inside to get my binoculars. the ufo was still in sight when i returned outdoors.  through the binoculars it looked like an aircraft with wings, but the wings glowed and were gold in colour. the body of the ufo seemed silvery-gray in colour. what was really different was that it did not move like any plane i have ever observed flying.  it moved very slowly and seemed to turn right, then return to the center, then turn left, then return to center a couple of times.  this looked really strange and i thought \"that sure looks like a ufo\".  \r\n\r\nthis ufo just disappeared suddenly, though the sky was clear and sunny, with no clouds in sight.  \r\n\r\nthen i saw a second ufo from what i assumed was the back, as there was a double contrail.  this was close to where i saw the first ufo.  this second ufo disappeared suddenly after about 1 minute, leaving no contrails as all. i thought this was quite unusual as contrails usually stay in view for quite a while.\r\n\r\nduring the sighting i felt quite excited and interested to be seeing something unusual.  have not seen any ufo's for several years.\r\n\r\nalso, two days after my sighting, there were two articles in the metro newspaper about ufo's.  these were general articles and did not mention any report of a sighting in kanata that weekend.  these articles gave me the idea to contact a ufo reporting webside.  tried to contact the ufo group in manitoba, canada but was unable to report my sighting on their webside, probably due to incompatible software.\r\n\r\nluckily remembered mufon, and your webside is conpatible with my rather ancient laptop (thinkpad t61), reconditioned but works quite well.\r\n\r\nboth ufo's disappeared very suddenly, not the usual way that airplanes disappear into the distance as i watch them. \r\n\r\nthese unusual appearances and flight behaviours were what made me think i was observing a ufo.\r\n\r\ni was so excited to be viewing the ufo's that i completely forgot to take photos.  i will make an effort to use my camera to take photos if and when i have another sighting.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

mile out over the water, about 100 feet high. this was the classic flying saucer shape, with lights around the diameter of the craft. at first it just hovered there for about a minute and then a very bright light about 10 foot diameter shown on us for 30 seconds or so. the light went off, the craft flew at a high speed to the left - it moved what looked like about 1 mile in a blink of an eye, then to the right just as fast back in front of us, then flew up at about a 45 degree angle at an unbelievable speed, and was gone. \r\nwe looked at the group of people at the camp fire around the cove and

stop. and when the second one which was heading south reached the first one, it made a turn to head east. it was very cold out that morning, and i didn't have very much on to stay out much longer. i think i was standing out there for about 10 minutes. neither one was moving at a fast speed. but because the sky was rather bright that night, i hade no problem in getting a good view of both of them. so after that incident, i made it a habit to look up at the night sky every night. and what i have been seeing is something that i have no idea of what they are. and this is every night when the sky is clear enough to see them. and there are anywhere from five to thirteen of them that i can see. and now because i have mentioned this, more and more people are coming forward that saying that they are seeing these strange things every night also. i don't know if you would be interested to follow up on this. i have so much more to tell that would take up too much space here. but all kinds of crazy stuff has been going on. everyone that i have talked to don't know if these things are from another planet, or if they are from our own government. i hope that i will be able to talk to one of

to have a cigarette and look at the stars between the hours of 11:30pm and 1:00am 3/28/2014. it was a breezy, clear night, with very few clouds in the sky. i leaned back on the deck railing and tilted my head back to see the stars. as i looked up, the wind quickly died down to a calm silence and then i noticed the black/slightly reflective chevron v shaped object come into vision from the south east over the tree tops. the object proceeded to glide directly over my head aprox 200-400 feet in altitude with no sound and no light emitted in a slight arch to the west. i estimate that the v was between 12-20 feet wide. within 5-10 seconds i lost sight of the object behind a large tree in my back yard. as i tried to re acquire the object i saw one star sized flash of light in the same direction the object was headed, then 5 seconds later one last flash of light in the same location.\r\n           at first i was skeptical of this sighting, as i live within 2 miles of a commuter airport, but due to the lack of any landing or strobe lights, the path of travel, no sound, and only 2 flashes of light in the distance i believe this was a legitimate ufo sighting weather extraterrestrial or military drone. \r\n            two other interesting facts about the location are that: #1 there is a large secluded public fishing lake in the exact path of the ufo travel and #2 the navy regularly conducts touch and go training with e-2 hawkeye early warning radar planes at our public airport which is roughly 250 miles inland from norfolk va.
