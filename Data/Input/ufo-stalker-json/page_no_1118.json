(30*46'42.70\"n x 98*17'26.36\"w ) was expecting a large b-52 multi-engine jet.  saw a long silver object flying in front of four to five smaller jets.  larger object was at least twice the size of the smaller jets. larger object appeared to be maneuvering, causing flashes of sunlight off its surface.  relatively straight flight pattern but appeared to be toying with chase planes.  large silver shiny object did not appear to have wings! (expected tanker to have large wings)  altitude was too great for good clear identification.  smaller jets appeared to be f-16s on afterburners. (single burners)  strangely, the chase planes were flying in a really tight formation for a chase? they were hard to identify as they were apparently in close formation with a lot of acrobatic maneuvering going on during this time. con trails on two of the smaller jets actually formed a corkscrew con trail.  first impression was that they were jockeying for better view of the larger silvery object.  they did not appear to be able to catch up with the larger object.  the larger object appeared to be lunging forward at times as if it slowed down to let the chase planes catch up.  all observation was through a 35mm lens and was extremely fuzzy due to extreme altitude. all objects were headed south to the gulf of mexico.  only military bases in that direction would be the electronic test range near big bend,texas. also navy bases at corpus christi, and kingsville.  i do not think it was a refueling operation as smaller jets appeared to be on afterburners!  activity was too close for refueling. i do not know what i saw!  was upset that i did not have better optics!  lost the flight as it crossed the sun to my south-southwest.  objects passed nearly directly overhead.\r\n about five to ten minutes later i saw another con trail headed in the same direction.  however, it turned out to be a southwest airlines jet (737) that was only about two thirds the altitude and less than half the speed.\r\n     this report is not sufficient to stand alone, however, it might help if others reported this.  strange times we live

by lights in the field that i could see by my window.  i did see greys several times as i used binocs to look at the craft landing site. about 8 years later, i remember walking into the field and returned to my room not by myself.  i bieleve now that  i was being abducted.  when i was about 10 yrs old a mark that resembles a birth mark appeared on my right hand between my pointing and middle finger in the shape of a triangle.  it hasn't always been there, i was told if i have it removed i will be marked with something else. all i remember from that abduction was being scared.  and i am very sorry but i don't remember all of them.  \r\n\r\nwhen i was about 8yrs old, i didn't see the craft that year.  instead i was walking in the field with the dogs, the field was going to be mowed for hay in two days so i wanted to walk through the field one last time.. this time was weird.  in the middle of the field the furture hay was laying down in a circler motion, i had no idea what had happened but there was several little places connecting to the big circle.. when my parent got home i took him to that spot to show him what i found.. he got very anxious.  we went bad to the house and he climbed on the roof to see the 'circles' from up high..  he came down and said come with me, we went to the barn got a couple of brooms, we went back to the field and stood the grass back up.. it was totally amazing to find the grass intact!!! the stock was not broken, it was whole.  after we stood it up, he mowed it, that day.  several days after my mother was going to the store, being a typical kid i begged her to let me stay home alone.. she finally gave in with stipulations.. ya know don't do this, don't touch that etc.  5 to 10 minutes after she left a car pulled into our driveway..  \r\n\r\nnow union is in the country, we lived up on a dirt road in the middle of nowhere...  this car was black.  black wheels, black windows, black everything and no plate.  the people were also dressed in black.  i knew wasy of leaving the house without anyone hearing me and that is what i did. these men walked to the exact place where that crop circle was, they took samples of the earth and the grass around it, walked back to their car and left.  to this day if i write or talk about it i get painful goosebumps.  men in black??? \r\n as far as what it looked like... \r\nit looked like a disk, with red,blue,green,white,orange colored lights moving in patterns.  it was always the same type of craft. when i think about it i get deep painful goosebumps.  and really freaks me out!   \r\n\r\ni don't really remember much about being abducted thankfully.  i kinda remember them being nice to me at first then being more forsful as i got older.  and my reactions now... scared...  \r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"03:13:16","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Window(s)","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path then

had not suffered a stroke or heart attack. they said that i was most likely not going to make it. well my parents told me i woke up 7 days after my accident or whatever it was. i woke up healthy. i remember having a little trouble walking when i woke up. also i had scars on the right side of my body and a big bubble as if i had got a real bad burn on my right foot. the bubble scarred and i have a circle scar now which again baffled the doctors. the following weeks i remember getting tests done in just about everything and they couldn't tell my parents what it was. my parents and i have never

(the \"star\" i'm referring to is always in the sky in the spring and fall. it is brightly lit and stays visible long after the sun washes out the night sky). then, randomly another light dropped down from the original and stood stationary for a second. the second light from our viewpoint, circled the first with great speed 3 times then immediately zoomed over head of some power lines to the right of the vehicle. i felt a sudden panic and then calmness washed over me. the panic i felt seemed to disappear and if i had a camera at the time, i wouldn't of been able to photograph it. we all in a stupor observed a black triangle at about 300ft in the air, sit stationary without making a noise. there were 4 lights on the bottom of the craft. three pulsating, color changing lights on each corner of the triangle and one red light in the center. the corner lights changed from red to orange to yellow and back repeatedly for about 3 minutes. as the sun was rising, we all had a very good daytime view of the object. then it accelerated to a ridiculous amount of speed very, very quickly out to the west. the object did not change direction from its origin to its leaving. this event especially had an impact on me. i have been fearful of things i could not logically make sense of. i am not superstitious, religious, spiritual, or mentally ill in anyway. although this day has given me countless nightmares and obviously had a psycological impact on me. i had an immense feeling that this craft knew we were watching it. i can remember looking at my mother and sister staring at it frozen, unable to move although i could. as if time had stopped for a second and then seemingly fast forwarded back. this happened for a good thirty seconds. my mother has seen \"ufo\"s before in close proximity so she says. i have no choice but to believe this craft had a consciousness to it and was not built by humans as there is no logical way occupants could survive the maneuvers i witnessed. my research has shown based on the descriptions, the belgian triangle ufo's are the same craft. as well as numerous reports around the u.S. in the mid to late 90's.
