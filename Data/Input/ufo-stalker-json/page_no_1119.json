minute drthere. the wake was from 5pm- 7pm we left around 6:30 headed back to alabama.My oldest sister was driving i was in the passengers seat my twin sister was in the back with her 3 yr son and my 3 yr daughter. we were on hwy 90 was when i noticed a bright light in the sky it seemed a little odd because it was to low to be a star and to high to be a street light but i couldn't take my eyes off of it i kept asking my sisters \"what is that light\" we turned on hwy 188 and the light is still outside my window. suddenly it gets so dark as if there is a power outage no street lights we only have our headlights i have never experienced darkness like that we were driving slow as we could barely see the line in the road . nets thing we knew we were headed for a field it was like we just woke up there and started yo panic we turned the car around slowly trying not to go off the narrow country road not knowing how we got here because we were not on 188 anymore. when we turned around there was disco type lights going around the car the the car cut off and there was a spot light in the middle of the road we were hysterical by this point when we cranked the car the light went away and we found our way back to 188 when we got home it was around 10:30 pm we somehow lost a couple of hours although it was odd we just passed it off because we didn't see any type of alien or actual craft just strange lights. it soon after i started waking up paralyzed and a lil scared but the beginning of last year i started having dreams of ufos that were so real to me and sometimes scared to open my eyes just laying in bed because i thought there was a alien at the foot of my bed i dreamed of 3 egg shaped objects with lots of round windows and a bright red moon and once in a dream i was with another man and he asked my name and he told me his name was mc elroy he told me not to forget his name to repeat it over and over and when i woke up i was saying his name. i also had a dream of a black craft that sorta looked like a triangle shaped navy jet or something it was also real to me it because it happened in real time and just like the other dreams it was so vivid but this one felt threatening to me as but it made my living room wall disappear and an object came out like a surveillance camera","distance":"21-100

we came to a stop sign facing south.At this time,we observed a configuration of white lights in a diamond shape with all the lights equidistant apart.The lights were solid white and at the top and bottom there was an additional white light that pulsated together like a heartbeat.All we could see was the lights.At first,we thought it was a celltower because they were stationary.After further thought we realized celltowers have red lights,not white.We returned to the site about 5 minutes later and the lights were gone.We were really confused now.Why,if this was a celltower,did the lights go out?We returned to the site the next day after sunrise and found nothing but an empty field.No structure,no anything!!!To this day it bothers me greatly.I am a man who uses deductive reasoning to figure things out.There is no explanation for this.Whatever this was,it made no noise at all.It was approximately 400 feet from us and maybe 200 feet in altitude.I will never forget this experience

light in the sky caught my attention. at first, i thought it was a blimp - we sometimes have them flying in our area, but i couldn't hear any noise. as i watched this object i noticed it started moving around in many directions and seemed to be changing colors. i figured it would fly off, but it stayed pretty much in this one area so i took a chance and ran into the house to get my phone to try and record it. it was a strange sight and i wanted to try and figure out what it was. in the video you can hear the crickets in my backyard so at the time of the sighting i did not hear a plane or engine. i recorded it for 1 minute and 42 seconds. during that time it darted around up and down left and right and changed shapes and colors. at 1:12 seconds (i looked at the time on the recording) another object came down from the upper right sky and the two objects moved around wildly together for a bit (up and down and all around) before i lost sight of them. i've never witnessed anything like this before. i'm glad my video recorded what i saw because no one would believe me if i shared this story. it was not a blimp. at the end of the recording you will hear a plane. this plane route was behind me. it did not come from the objects i was looking at. if you watch this video in slow motion you can make out a circular object with lights surrounding it - two objects once the other one falls into the frame. i took stills from the video if you would like those too.

blocks and crossed a busy street and by the time we got across the street it disappeared out of site. we drove through the entire neighborhood for about 10 minutes trying to find it, but it was nowhere to be found. i dropped my neices off and decided to comb the area once more, but did not see anything. we had our eyes on it and just like that it was gone from the sky. it was truly amazing

two of us others were waiting for the fire to burn down before go to sleep in our tents. my name in alan, and my friend freddie happened to be sitting about 5 feet a part in chairs facing west watching the fire and the sky above. we had talked about ufo's earlier in the night, but we are skeptical, especially myself, alan. we had been talking about all the jets flying very high in the sky light at night in different directions, especially they seemed to be flying west towards lax before midnight. well approx. 10:30 pm we happened to be looking up towards the east and we both saw a bright light coming towards us over the horizon, approx. as fast as you would see a jet way up in the sky at night. however this bright white light was not as high as a high flying jet, at least in did not seem that high. it was a very powerful bright white beam of light coming closer, and ran for my camera phone. it seemed 10k to 15k high and cruised directly over our heads! my friend freddie was stunned in disbelief   and could not move to get his phone camera. i barely got my galaxy note ii phone camera, switched it to video, and boom there here is! however the round globe was cruising very smoothly, slowly, noiseless, smokeless, and straight. i was freaked out and was staring at it, not taking the best video footage, but at least i got it. i am upset i did not video it 100% all the way, but we were almost a sleep and i ran for my camera phone in my tent, and at least i got this video. we both agreed it was white, then glowed orange, then back to white and maybe small to big and small to big, then back to orange and bigger. towards the end of the video, it seemed to have slightly change directions a only a few degrees, turn white, get smaller and go up out of sight, or disintegrate. this had no blinking lights, no noise, no trail of gas or smoke, not an airplane or balloon, not a meteorite, and low flying! perhaps it was right outside the earths atmosphere, where there is no gravity, and this was perfect round glowing ball on lava floating? it travel from west to east, right over our heads, in painted canyon road, mecca, ca, on the north side of the salton sea, ca. it appeared to be slightly cruising at 200 mph or so. it is possible is was much higher than jumbo jets, but we both agreed it was not that high, and definitely not something garage made sphere or military made orange ball. if it was a slow moving glowing orange rock, well it almost hit earth near the salton sea. it was truly a ufo! a giant round orange sphere silently flying at night! it never did make any sound at all. we have both never seen anything like it before, and may never again in our life time again!\r\nregards, alan","distance":"20 Feet or

window and it was still there. about 10\r\nminutes later,i received a phone call from a friend who lives about 40 miles east of me and i told him about it, and asked if he could see it. he went outside and confirmed that he also saw it. i asked him if he had a sky map app on his smartphone and he did. he pointed the sky map at it and no identified stars showed up on the app. while we were

gone.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":54946,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.44937082038209,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03252014-0014","longitude":-86.8837848046865,"occurred":1395634500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Tennessee","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1395808696000,"summary":"Bright

valley lights and such and  as i turned to my right heading to the shop i saw a flash or reflection of light in the sky to my left and turned to look and i was amazed to watch \"something\" moving my way. i could tell something was there but could not grasp it! it then was closer on my left side and then i could see what is very difficult to explain. it had no lighting at all, total blackness. they were triangles connected and stacked so they would fit in the area, like a window. it was level and not very high. how high is for someone else to say but i can approximate the distance above my neighbors home. it continued on west and at about the same distance to my right that i first saw it on my left, the \"window\" was not visible, but the same strange motion and \"stuff\" was there. then it was gone or no longer visible to me. i can not even guess at it's speed but someone may know more if i showed them how i turned my head and the points it became visible and was not.\r\nmy feeling now is i witnessed something in the sky but i am sure no one else has ever seen anything like it. my reactions are varied, it could have been a stealth air craft and i saw it because the lighting was shinning just right but it was soundless, nothing at all and that's what was even more freaky. because it was so difficult to see it makes it hard to judge it's size and how close it was to me. i will always remember it and hope you don't think i nuts. thanks for letting me talk about it.","distance":"101-500

sighting.\r\n\r\nhusband went outside to the balcony and was talking on the phone.  looked up at the stars and noticed that one of the stars on the big dipper moved to the center of the big dipper, then zipped backed and forth, then went back to the center and started to flash.  then it shot straight down.  then he noticed out of the corner of his eye a flash and thought it might be fireworks.  he started to watch these strange cloud like flashes and they were shaped liked a rainbow or dome.  they were green and white but mostly green.  then he came back in the house and continued with his phone conversation.  he first noticed this event around 10:00 p.M.\r\n\r\ni went outside to the balcony around 11:15 not even know that my husband saw this and then noticed a flashing from the corner of my eye.  i was sitting down getting ready to make a phone call and i saw the flashing again.  my first thought was - is there lightening out tonight but there was not a cloud in the sky and it was a clear bright night.  then i saw the flash again and started to watch it.  first i thought, is that a firework and just stood there because i realized that it was not.  i saw orange flashing and white but mostly orange and at first it was shaped like a rainbow or dome - then it just became orange flashes of clouds and then a little white flashing and this frequent.  \r\n\r\nthere was one this one orange cloud like flash that i noticed with some kind of oval shaped object.  it was going down and it looked large from a distance.  i was just starring at it watching it and i thought i saw red colored lights or it could have been a reflection from the orange flash.  it did not look like it was part of the orange cloud that was flashing.  i know i saw something.  i was waiting for it to come back up so i could get a second look but it never came back up.  when this object was coming down, it was not like a drop or quick movement. \r\n\r\nwell, i went back in the house to tell my husband what i saw and that is when he told me what he saw.  \r\n\r\ni was watching this for hours and it seemed to be flashing less as time went on and then i noticed that it was flashing only white until about 2:00 am. then i went back out at 3:00 and it completely stopped. some of the lights i saw in that direction gone and just total complete darkness  like normal.\r\n\r\ni have to say that i could have sworn i saw other unexplained things - it seemed very active out there.\r\n\r\ni can't imagine that we were the only one to witness this.

(please note: i'm approximating the date and time.  as i said, i hadn't planned on reporting it.)\r\n\r\nat around 12:30 am, in september 2013, i was sitting on my front steps reading (a favorite past-time).  the expansive sky was dark, but completely clear.  i'd scanned it, but saw only the same stars that i usually see - where i usually see them.  there was the occasional car or pedestrian passing by, but overall it was quiet.\r\n\r\ni was reading my book, intently.  my reading was interrupted by the sudden appearance of a huge, blossoming, blue-white flash in the north-eastern sky.  i immediately scanned that area of the sky, but there was nothing unusual to be seen.  nothing was out of place.  nothing was added.  no movement.  no shadows.  nothing.\r\n\r\nbut that flash... it'd come from, well, nothing.  just the vast darkness.  then, from a microscopic spark... it exploded... blossoming/expanding simultaneously in all directions... to such a size and such a blazing, brilliant, brightness that... it had to be - something.\r\n\r\ni know that it wasn't a camera flash.  i know that it wasn't lights on a plane/drone/rc anything.  it wasn't a helicopter.  it wasn't a paper lantern.  it wasn't the planet venus or mars or any other.  it wasn't a shooting star.\r\n\r\nit felt, to me, like it was extremely faraway, but also focused.  it was intentional.  i don't know...  perhaps it was a signal to... someone?\r\n\r\neverything had been and still was quiet.  i sat there, slack-jawed in my awed silence.   in my head, i kept asking myself, \"what the heck was that?!\".  i'd never seen anything like it before - or since.\r\n\r\nthen, just for fun, i looked towards the point in the sky where i'd seen the flash originate and i said - aloud - to the seemingly, blank night sky, \"i saw you.  i saw that.  do it again.  please.\".  and, in the very next instant, when i was about to return my attention to the book in my lap - it exploded into existence, again.  i watched as a second huge, brilliant, blossoming, blue-white flash began... grew... spread out across a vast (in the amount of dark, distant sky it seemed to erupt from) area, in nanoseconds.  and then, just as quickly, it was gone.\r\n\r\ni desperately scanned the sky for something... anything that could have caused the flashes.  but, there was nothing.  no planes.  no helos.  no lanterns.  no drones.  no planets, comets, meteorites.  no movement.  no lights.  no shadows.  nothing.\r\n\r\ni was glad that i'd seen the first flash.  and, i was elated that whatever had created the original flash, had \"done it again\" in the very same spot - seemingly upon request.  and, i was also a little disconcerted, to be honest.\r\n\r\nbut, even if my experience was related to consciousness/communication and/or ufos... telepathy, itself, is far from a new concept to me.  i just hadn't considered the possibilities... the distances it could traverse... instantaneously.\r\n\r\nthank you for reading my account.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":54941,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.7711672,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03252014-0009","longitude":-122.4379148,"occurred":1378969200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1395783772000,"summary":"Traffic-free night sky. saw huge, sharp, expansive blue-white flash.  searched for source.  nothing.  intrigued.  said, \"i saw that. do it again.\"  it did, instantaneously.","tags":["flash"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"94117","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":194,"locationName":"San Francisco, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:183081"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82751,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1119}
