from calgary). we had pulled off to side of the road to talk. bonnie noticed 3 lights in a triangular shape out the front window.(to the north) at first we assumed it to be a helicopter coming straight towards us. it just didn't seem right though. i said to her that looks just like the ufo on youtube. bonnie started to get a little scared and started driving north towards it looking for a place to turn around. we drove about a half kilometer to a left corner which is at the edge of a valley. as we started turning left and going downhill the craft came into a better veiw out my passenger window. i could see the entire bottom and part of the side. it had a diamond shape front then 2 circular shapes in middle then another diamond shaped rear. these shapes were pulsating with numerous colors. yellow front and rear of diamond shapes turning green near center. red on outer of circular shapes turning blue and purple near center of craft. the side that i could see was very dark if not completely black and had a choppy surface similar to stealth aircrafts that i've seen. i could not see any windows or even a distinction to say front or back it was perfectly uniform in shape.\r\nit was about 7pm and was a very warm night so i had my window open but i could not hear any sound coming from the craft whatsoever. it was approximately 100feet above us and was about 100 feet in length and 70 feet wide. from my vantage point i would say 10-15 feet in height.\r\nit slowly floated south towards airdrie. i was so stunned by its features that i didn't even think to grab my phone to get a picture at first. when this idea came to me it had already floated behind the hill we were driving down. i asked bonnie to turn around now and follow it so i could take pictures. by the time we had turned around and reached the top of the hill again now turning right(southward) it was already at least a mile or so in front of us. it again had the appearance of 3 lights in triangular form. we tried to chase it but it seemed to be going incredibly fast now and just kept getting further away. i kept my eyes on it but it just kept getting further away. then suddenly it just seemed to take off in an instant straight south. we kept driving for quite some distance towards where i last saw it but never saw anything again.\r\ni enjoy drawing and can easily draw a fairly accurate picture of it as i have for numerous friends and family since.\r\nbonnie seems to have been quite rattled by the encounter and does not like to talk about it.\r\ni would really like to know if anyone else has seen this or similar flying objects in the area. i can't say for sure that it was unearthly or an experimental military craft. with the stealthy appearance it seemed more military to me.\r\ni do not care if my identity is revealed i would just really like an answer to what it was i saw that evening.","distance":"101-500

and saw something that looked very much like a ufo but very sceptical and would totally understand it if you said it's a different type of plane. however there was no sound from the plane nor a trail behind it. it was either white or reflective silver with what i think looked like two spherical balls joined together but sometimes it looked like a ball and it also looked like it was spinning from the video but can't be 100% sure of the last fact. it has a sort of shade underneath and the more i look at it it reminds me of the look of a metal chinese stress ball. it's hard to tell as it looks so bright. it was filmed on my iphone so the quality isn't great but it picked it up enough for people to think what the heck is it. \r\ni honestly didn't know what to think at first as we over look an airport and see planes all the time but this was unlike any plane i've ever seen and i've seen a fair few in my time. \r\nit looked like it was going in a constant speed even though the video is deceptive as i was moving down some outside steps to get a better view of it so that gave an elusion that it was moving in a zig zag pattern but i don't think that was the case. \r\ni would like someone to tell me what the heck it was and let me know if you think it was just an experimental no sound plane of some kind. \r\ni filmed it from looking up in the direction of my garden at the rear of the house. i went outside to get a better look and as it travelled north my view of the object was hampered by the terrace buildings.\r\ni felt quite excited that i might have filmed something out of the ordinary. \r\nyou can hear my 1 year old daughter in the background shouting 'daddy' as she wanted my attention but clearly my attention was elsewhere.

mentally trying to communicate with them, and after about fifteen minutes of walking my dog and stopping to watch the sky i telepathically said ok star family, your not coming so im going in. as i was walking down the street, i saw something above me. it was dark and had many lights on it, at first i wasnt sure if it was a fleet of orbs, but i saw a boomerang vector shaped outline. the lights were dimmer than planes. like a warm whitish yellow tone. they covered the ship. i was overwhelmed with such love and happiness i started crying from happiness. i make contact with them often and never have made a report. i knew it was a et ship the moment i saw it. i have seen many in my life but this one was different. it flew in a straight line right above my head, it seemed to be going slow over me, then it speed up and i started running trying to keep up but it was gone. i was so emotionally overcome i couldnt stop crying tears of joy and it was such a spiritual event. this is how it always is, but this time was way more intense. even after coming back inside i was still so over joyed as once again i have made telepathic contact with the star beings. i dont hear back in my mind from them but i feel strong emotions. i had given up on seeing anything and at that moment they showed up. they always go overhead slow then take off at high speed and basically dissapear. im not sure if i am seeing into there dimension or they are in our 3rd dimension then take off thru portals. i will make reports for all future sightings. i feel it important to mention that i was over taken with the

was not clear, but seemed slower than when you watch a jet plane flying high in the sky, and much slower than when you see a passing satellite or iss at night.\r\n\r\nafter watching for about 30 seconds, i could see that the lights were in a triangle pattern (3 per formation), but there were multiple formations (2 to 3 formations wide). formation after formation kept coming (ne-->sw). we were too shocked to count, but easily 10 or more formations passed overhead (ie: 30+ lights).  after several minutes of watching, a very fast moving light appeared to intercept one of the smaller triangle formations, with an observable red flash at what could be seen as 'impact' on the leading light, however it appeared to have no affect on it.  immediately following, the light on the right emitted what looked like tracer rounds (think \"shock and awe\" in the iraq war) in a short 3-4 round burst.  it was during this intercept event a faint sound of a jet engine was heard, but the rest of the

object in the sky traveling from the south east.  i estimated it was about a mile east of my position.  i traveled in a straight line, but seemed to wobble a bit, where i could see the sun reflecting upon it's surface which was a polished silver finish.  it had a light that seemed to be part of it that was dim at first, flickered in and out until it started to get closer, so estimating it to be traveling north an slightly west. when it got closer the light stayed at a constant.  there were no clouds in the sky, and there were some tree's it was heading behind.  \r\n\r\ni had to wait for the light to change and the cars coming the opposite direction to give the right of way, but thought to myself if it was an aircraft or a mylar balloon, i could continue to track it since i was able to pull off to the side of the road well in time to catch a photo/video of it on my camera since there were no other obstructions for my line of view near the spot except for a few of the tree's i mentioned.  upon pulling over i fully expecting to see it emerge from the tree line, it simply was no longer there, it basically vanished at this stage. \r\n\r\nthe cloudless sky was bright, so not a need for an aircraft to require it's running lights, and the light emitted did not seem like normal aircraft lights or a reflection from the sun.  a  balloon left adrift would not explain it either since they do not have lights, but sharing my initial thinking upon observing it. it wasn't specifically fast from my vantage point thus the reason i thought i would have plenty of time to further track it. i stayed at my spot for a few minutes, just to be sure i was not gauging it's flight speed incorrectly, but there was nothing but empty sky.\r\n\r\nin addition, strange military helicopters continue to fly low over battle ground and the surrounding areas, including directly overhead where i live at in ridgefield now, no insignia or markings, but clearly military complete with a rather large cannon like attachment to the chinook models nose. this is not the first sighting in the area, not likely the last on the ufo's.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

live in a city right outside of camp lejeune and used to seeing aircraft in our area, and i live a few miles from the albert j. elis airport.  it traveled toward the east and hovered over my property: great spirit pow wow center. i was in disbelief, but wondered if it was a drone or some new military aircraft. i called my son outside to witness.  at first he did not see it because it had moved behind the tree line on my property.  it had come out into the open, so he got the opportunity to observe it before it disappeared in the sky. he had been in the us army, but told me that he had not seen anything like it before. i have recently built a medicine wheel with crystals in the wheel where the object appeared to be hovering.  approximately 9pm i went outside and observed three aircraft (helicopters or airplanes) above my property and traveling in a triangular pattern.  i felt nervous and excited because i felt they were investigating the ufo that i observed.  i googled the cylinder ufo and saw that other people had seen something similar in many different states and countries. i do not know if this is related, but approximately six weeks ago i had told my son that i had a dream that felt real that i was abducted by gray aliens. i woke up and where i touched the alien my finger had a burn.  it was painful.  i started feeding my farm animals and within 30 minutes the burn mark had disappeared and no longer hurt. i also recall having a needle put in my head.  i have a very strange mark on my head. i am a us navy veteran and worked at the national security agency from
