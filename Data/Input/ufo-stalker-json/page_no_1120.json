it was cold out. i decided i wasn't going to point it out to her as i didn't know what i was looking at and i didn't want to scare her. as i watched the light move across the sky it faded to orange

observed a large green laser grid- like pattern pulsating and scanning over the back side of our house. we were both sitting in the back yard at the time this occurred star gazing.  i'm familiar with lasers and how they can be projected at objects at great distances but i had never seen anything like this before. the laser grid appeared to be 'scanning' the rear bedroom of our house that my 13 year old son was occupying. he ran out of his room to the back yard where my wife and i were to excitedly tell us that he saw a very bright green flashing light penetrate his window through closed blinds and light up his room abnormally. my wife and i were still in shock from what we saw from the outside. i jumped up on a patio chair to get a peak over the neighboring fence in search of an answer to our beam of light and found nothing. no cars no people. i'm a skeptic. so i ruled everything out. the way the laser like grid was projected on the house was definitely from above. but of course the sky was clear and very quiet, except for a low humming sound during the entire 6 seconds of the occurrence. i hope this is descriptive enough. i can give better details via phone conversation. as for the three of us that witnessed this phenomenon, we strongly feel that it was an extraterrestrial attempt of some sort of communication.\r\nthank you\r\njf","distance":"20 Feet or

planet from a telescope in s. africa.  the planet is half green and has blue clouds.  the page says that the green areas are vegetation.  this is really a 'smoking gun' proving that nasa has lied to

1890s photos of mars with lines on its surface which astronomers then called 'canals' by 1962 hundreds of clear photos of the canals were taken and published in the new york times and other publication that the us airforce made a map of them based on these photos which can be seen on line. three years later the first satellite took the first crude pictures of mars and nasa said it was a dead planet.  the famous astronomer, percival lowell, said it was evidence of an advanced civilization. the fix was in and the nyt ran an editorial denouncing anybody who believed that life existed on
