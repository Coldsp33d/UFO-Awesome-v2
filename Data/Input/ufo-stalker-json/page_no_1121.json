'wow, if that's a plane, it sure is flying low', i thought. it was going slow as if it was doing surveillance. then i noticed the lights were different from an airplane, they were all red and going in a rhythmic blink, blink, blink, blink, blink around the craft. \r\n\r\ni live two blocks from the pacific ocean, and it was coming from that direction going east. lindbergh field (airport)is in san diego just north of me, and i'm very familiar with the flight paths of airplanes in this area. this craft was acting completely different from a plane or a helicopter. \r\n\r\nthis is completely out of character for me, but i ran into the house, grabbed my purse and keys, and then jumped into my car to follow it. i had to run several red lights and stop signs as i zigzagged across town. i kept hoping the police would see me, or maybe i would come across another car, but there was nobody out that early in the morning. after 20 minutes i was on the outskirts of town, at the base of the mountains just east of san diego. that's when i realized the ufo was slowing down, and if i didn't slow down i was going right under it!\r\n\r\nall of a sudden it stopped in mid-air. i quickly pulled over to the side of the road and turned off my car and headlights. the clock on my car said 4:00 am. i was terrified that it had noticed me following it. i scrunched down in my seat so it wouldn't see me, and decided i wasn't taking my eyes off this thing until i saw what it was going to do next. so there i sat for 45 minutes, watching this thing hovering in the sky about 20 feet away from me. and it was totally silent. this thing didn't make a sound, but my heart was pounding like crazy. \r\n\r\nafter 45 minutes there was a bright flash in the sky, like the flash of a camera only much brighter. the ufo seemed to be getting smaller, but that didn't make any sense. then i realized that it was slowly rising upwards, and the higher it got, the smaller it got. i watched as it got smaller and smaller, and eventually it was so small it just blended with the stars, but i could still see faint red lights blinking around it. it was getting light outside and, no longer fearful, i started up my car and drove home. i was very emotional on the way home. the realization hit me that all those people who've said they saw ufos really were telling the truth. i couldn't believe what i had just experienced. i had to look one more time. i pulled my car over to the side of the road and there it was, amongst the stars, a tiny object with very faint red blinking lights. you wouldn't even notice unless you were looking for it. \r\n\r\nwhen i got home i felt i should call someone, but who? if i called the local police they would think i'm crazy, so i decided to call homeland security (as if they wouldn't think i was crazy.) i called the miramar station (san diego) and told the person who answered the phone what i'd just experienced. i asked if anyone else had called about it and she said no. i asked if it would've showed up on radar, and she said if it had she would've heard about it (but that doesn't necessarily mean she would've told me about it.) anyway, i just wanted there to be some sort of record of what i'd seen. \r\n\r\nthat was almost two years ago, and not one day goes by that i don't think about it. i often look up to the sky at night and wonder how many others are out there that we don't know about, looking down on us, and masquerading as stars?","distance":"21-100

9-10 pm. i watched it for at least 15 minutes hovering over 'big pink'; elevation approximately 5,000-10,000 feet, the size of the larger spaceship was about the size of 3-4 football fields across, and i saw a smaller version of the black triangular spaceship dock with the larger black triangular spaceship and together they slowly drifted off to the north. both spaceships were solid black in color and totally silent- i could not hear any sound coming from either spaceship. the size of the smaller spaceship was about the size of the length of 1 football field across. exactly in the middle of both spacecraft was a circular opening with the circular rim of the opening emitting a ring of light and the air below the circular opening was emitting light like it was ionized air. i saw the smaller black triangular shaped spaceship come up over the horizon through my window travelling slowly and at one point in time for several seconds many pinpoints of lights lit up evenly spaced all over it, then all the lights went out and then it moved out of sight from the vantage point of my window so i went outside to see it and that's when i saw the larger black triangular shaped spaceship, and watched the smaller spaceship dock with the larger spaceship. the smaller spaceship approached the middle of one side of the bigger spaceship and docked with it- like it had fit in to a wedge-like notch in the middle of that side of the big spaceship. both spaceships hovered over big pink building for about ten minutes then they both drifted west with the smaller spaceship docked on the trailing edge on the south side docked in the rear of the larger spaceship. at that time there was very unusual weather going on- windy and rain weather and pink flashes of light flashing through the sky; like an artificially induced weather storm to act as camouflage. then they moved slowly, maybe 15-25 mph. this triangular anti-gravity spaceship that travels around the world and has been the

getaway trailer in the woods, on the mountain with my husband. a very noisy hawk was circling above our traler, so i grabbed my camera and attempted to zoom in on it. the camera was poor quality, so i figured when i got home i would attempt to zoom even closer to the hawk and determine if it was a red-tailed hawk, or not. \r\n\r\ni did not notice, at the time, anything in the sky except the hawk. i noted the cluster of ufos at a much later date, when going through photos on my computer, at home. i noticed the circular shapes and first thought, wow, that must be a flock of birds way up there! but, after i zoomed in on the computer, i saw they were circular shaped, all the same size, and the sun was reflecting from the west (the same on all the ufos). my son had seen a similar formation, while topping a tree, about 100 feet up in the top of a tree, near wash. d.C.)....We have a tree company.\r\n\r\ni did not see any of the ufos till much later, zooming in on the photo, on the

how would i know their direction.\r\n\r\nwe have seen another ufo, at night, there in the same location that appeared to dance around the sky and suddenly approach us, very high up. i have never felt such terror and felt secluded, isolated, and thought i only had a groundhog gun in the trailer to aim at it/them. it was late at night.\r\n\r\nsince i did not see the cluster/fleet of ufos, at the time....I did not stay and observe their direction, etc. i did not know about mufon until this past year, in a book.  i applied a neon application to my photo to enhance the shape and existence of the

years old but i can still see this as clearly in my mind as if it happened yesterday.  this event made me believe in ufo's throughout the rest of my life.\r\n\r\nit was apx. 10:00 p.M. and i was with a family friend in the car as she drove to pick my mother up from work. we had just left the apartment where we lived on fulton st. in houston, tx. (possibly close to fulton and cavalcade)  i was in the passenger seat and was looking out the window as i usually did while riding in the car.  it was dark out and we were driving down a short street with houses on it.  i saw an object on my side of the car, above the trees, that was a circular shape.  i know this because there were red and white circular lights (alternating in color) that were going around the object as they blinked off and on.  they acted similar to christmas runner lights i suppose... the object was stationary in the sky as the lights circled around.  it seemed the lights were going around the bottom of the object... they seemed to be flat - on the underside of whatever this was.  both the red and white lights appeared to be the same size.  the object didn't seem to be right at treetop level but a little bit higher than treetop.\r\n\r\nwhen i saw this object, i immediately alerted our friend that was driving.  we were going slow down this street (a stop sign was a little further ahead) and she looked out and saw the object too.  i don't remember if she leaned over to look out my window or if she saw it from the back passenger window or what.  i just remember that she saw the object too.  she couldn't continue to watch it though because she was driving.  (i spoke with this family friend a few days ago and she said she remembered seeing this object.)\r\n\r\nas we continued toward the stop sign, the object began to ascend at an angle away from us.  it just went up and up and up....The lights were still blinking and circling as it went up.  we passed some trees that blocked my view of the object and by the time we got to the stop sign, the object was gone.\r\n\r\nthis all happened in less than one minute as we drove slowly down a street between our apartment and another road at the stop sign.  the night was clear as i remember.  it was clear enough for me to be able to see this object clearly.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":54888,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.8165886,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03232014-0003","longitude":-95.370804,"occurred":115714800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1395585081000,"summary":"Ufo hovered as lights blinked, then ufo ascended at an angle until gone.","tags":["lights","ufo"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":14813,"locationName":"Houston, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:184331"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Phoenix","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Were taking pictures of clouds did not knowof objects untill we looked at the pictures later. the pics were taken by a friend. it so happens i was on the other side of town and took a pic at around the same time. a closer look at my pic zoomed in on object did not kno w was there.

road, castlegar, canada. the two dull glowing sphere's appearance occurred around 10:15pm to 10:27pm. the blinking star was happening at least thirty minutes before the orange sphere's made their appearance, took me quite a while to pinpoin blinking's exact location because the pauses were about 20 seconds long.\r\n\r\nwhile we were stargazing, we both saw what appeared to be a white blinking star in the sky south east, it was peculiar because it was flashing like a beacon, with long pauses between each flash, and it was remaining stationary in comparison to the earth rotation, as you know the stars appear to move slowly from west to east, but this 'beacon' was just staying still.\r\n\r\nas soon as i was able to pinpoint it's exact location in the sky, thirty minutes later, two dull glowing orange ovals decloaked out of complete no where, horizontally parallel from one another seemingly attached to one another by a grey line, it appeared at around south south east from the lookout, and went past us heading north east along the kootenay river, it appeared to fly over the brilliant dam along its path and then it zipped silently around behind mt.Sentinel.\r\n\r\nthe two orange spheres seemed to be attached by a white line, as they came toward us, one dull orange ovals rotated under the other all the while still seemingly attached by a grey line, as it dipped into the valley over the river. it then quickly ascended as the other orange oval rotated under the other just before passing over the dam. once over the dam the two dull glowling orange ovals now horizontally from eachother zipped straight with no special maneauvers along the river and behind mt.Sentinel out of sight.\r\n\r\ni was immediately filled with a paranoid sensation, a feeling that i needed to get to a more populated area right away, so i got my boyfriend to drive us to seven eleven at this time. after we got there we gathered our wits and then headed to the complex's feild to see if we could spot the blinking light in the sky, but it wasnt there anymore. couldnt fall asleep that night untill 2:30 am i was too spooked.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

two more appeared behind and on either side of it, i thought it was a group of helicopters. the thing i found strange was that the lights did not blink. i see airplanes and helicopters all the time

like a bird might if it were catching the wind to glide. as it was at the top of the loop it was flying directly towards me and as i realised that i felt that burst of adrenaline that you get when you are scared, but i remained calm and continued watching without moving. then it continued to fly into the playing field at head height and away from me for maybe 30 yards or so and then just kind of vanished or turned its lights off.\r\n\r\n there was no sound the whole time and the lights appeared as small orbs about the size of a football which were kind of like a mist lit from within - a kind of faint woolly green light. the three lights kept the same formation and gave the impression of being held together by some sort of invisible structure - what i assume was a craft of some sort. it was travelling pretty slow - around running speed - what is that maybe 15 or 20 mph? the whole sighting probably lasted only 15 or 20 seconds from start to finish. i don't recall exactly but i'm pretty sure i stopped walking and stood and watched without moving when i spotted it although  i may have taken a few steps towards it before i realised it was something unusual.\r\n\r\n as it disappeared i had the feeling that it was some kind of creature rather than a craft and that it had somehow read my mind and put on the whole display just for me - like it was showing off. i appreciate that those are quite extraordinary claims but the whole thing was way off the chart regarding how weird it was. afterwards i remained standing there trying to figure out what i had seen and if it was some kind of laser display or some kind of trickery - i half expected to hear someone laughing or something. i must have been stood for a good 4 or 5 minutes before i resumed my walk home and just before i left i noticed 2 helicopters in the sky a couple of miles to the north. maybe related-maybe not, but i remember thinking that the whole thing seemed to fit other sighting reports i have read.\r\n\r\n i have never had any other paranormal or ufo related experiences other than a possible ufo sighting about 6 years ago but it was far away and dark and although i think it was a ufo it was too ambiguous for me to make anything of it. however that did lead me to take an interest in the phenomenon as a whole and i have to say i am pleased that i now 'know' that there is at least some legitimacy to ufology.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":54876,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":54.0070992,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-03222014-0015","longitude":-1.5232213,"occurred":1388284800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"England","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1395522954000,"summary":"Small triangular craft with green light at each corner gave short, close up aerobatics display then vanished","tags":["light"],"timeZone":"Europe/London","timeZoneName":"Europe/London","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"HG1","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":83,"locationName":"Harrogate, England","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:184342"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Maine","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was a s/sgt in ground control approach at presque isle afb when your jan. 53 event occured.  eagle beak (long range radar site) scrambled four f94f's from presque isle afb.  i tracked the ufo and the fighters.  i remember details that may be interesting. as the pilots approached the targets, a pilot said,\"no joy\".  the target accelerated rapidly to over 2000mph,based on radar time line sweep markings i made with a grease pencil, for each sweep rotation. then they made a sharp left turn and climbed to over 75000 feet.  \r\n\r\ni also was involved with another incident when landing a b26 in ifr conditions.\r\ni was landing the b 26 by gca when a target came out under the aircraft from quaggie joe, a small mountain s of the base.  i pulled the b26 and took him arround.  we were below field minimums with fog.  i called the tower and there were no small a/c in the area to our knowledge. i brought the b26 around and the target came out again but followed the b26 to landing.  the target slowly flew down over the runway in the fog. oscar lyko was in the tower and got pictures when the fog opened for a moment.  we in the gca trailer only saw the green glow and heard the hight pitched squeel when it went north.  we were inteviewed, then were told it was a weather anomoly we had observed on radar.  it was not, we had a cpn-4 gca unit with mti which eliminates the effects of weather on the radar display. i was surprised to see the event in january.\r\n\r\nwe were never inteviewed on the fighter scamble event. for what it is worth, i hope this helps you.  best wishes,  [name removed/cms/tg]","distance":"501 Feet -
