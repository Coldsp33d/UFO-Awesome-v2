sure what to say. i along with your other guests have lost time. i don���t believe that my time was like your others. i have checked maps, times and eta���s. i have found no reasoning why i (or my friend driving) should have lost time.\r\ni see that you are still active on here, and that is my main reasoning for contact. my (our) incident occurred in 1998 in paris, tx.\r\nmy friend and i were on a trip to kansas from florida. we had not been on the road long enough to see delusions. we were on our way to paris, tx. ok, that is the last place that i remember going to before the incident. my friend was driving and i was in the passenger seat staring out the window. at 2200 i noticed what looked like airplane lights, flashing and blinking. at 65 mph, an airline or military plane would have surpassed us. but i noticed the lights were not blinking like they were supposed to. i watched for about 10 minutes before i said anything to my driver. i made a general comment that they looked like they were going backwards, not forwards. we kept driving for about 15 minutes before i said something else. i made mention of the odd lights again and we saw a place to pull off the side of the road and check things out. my driver slowed down and we got out of the car and watched the lights as they passed into the north. we got back into the car and proceeded on our way to ky. the light still to my east (driving north). we drove again and watched the lights head north and west around us. we thought that was the end.\r\ni looked at the clock and the time was 2300. i looked again at the clock and looked at the road to make sure we were on track. the clock was fast and the sign that was approaching was mortifying. i looked at my driver and told her we had already been here. she sounded confused at what i said, but i again told her we had been here already. i looked back out my window of the passenger side of the car and saw the same place we had been an hour ago, and had pulled off to watch the lights. my third time telling her that we had already been here and this was what was coming up convinced here that she had not lost her mind. i suggested pulling over at a hotel, and we did. i think it was a holiday inn���.Not sure. we looked at each other after the incident and i had never been more afraid of anything in my life. i have never had the hair on my neck stand up or been more terrified in my life. i know goose bumps and chill bumps. this was completely different. i was in panic mode, so was my friend.\r\nwe decided to get back on the road and get the f*ck out of dodge.\r\nwe lost an hour that night. we will never know what happened in that time frame. we have checked maps to make sure we were not doubling back or getting lost. i saw the ���welcome to paris��� sign twice in my life and it scared the crap out of me. how in the hell did we get back to it the second time???\r\n","distance":"Over One

object flying at a high rate of speed, moving from east to west, and appeared to be following a straight line flight path.\r\nthe object was emitting a very low, almost inaudible pulsing humming sound.\r\ni noticed the object because i noticed it's movement as it flew over a nearby water tower. it was very large, it appeared to be larger than a c-130,but not quite as large as a c-17. i lost sight of the object as it passed behind some trees, i ran out into the field adjacent to my driveway to see if i could get a better look at it but was not able to find it again.\r\nas i stated the object was blimp shaped, but had what appeared to be a cylindrical object or attachment the ran across the lower front of the fuselage, perpendicular to the body of the craft.\r\n\r\ni would like to point out that i was an air defense soldier in the u.S. army that received regular vacr (visual aircraft recognition) training, a retired volunteer firefighter with 21 years experience, as well as a

it was moving too fast to have been a blimp.\r\ni also find it odd that the object was nearly transparent and appeared to be utilizing some sort of stealth technology. i believe the only reason i was

sky.\r\n\r\nso i kept my eye on them as i came into greencastle, and i noticed as i got to the bottom of waterworks hill next to the fairgrounds that i was now almost directly below them. when i noticed this, i quickly pulled off the road, just to make sure i was actually looking at airplanes. this is when i realized what i was watching was definitely not airplanes.  they were moving so slow, they almost looked like they were hovering.  but they were moving just fast enough that you could tell they were moving. they were moving in perfect unison probably no more than 200-250 feet apart.\r\n\r\ni watched the two lights until they got directly above me when they just disappeared. this freaked me out a little bit because i had no explanation for where these lights went.  i blinked and they were just gone. i searched the sky and they were nowhere to be found.\r\n\r\nso i sat there in this gravel lot on the side of the road for a second, just trying to figure out what i'd seen.  and just as i started to put the truck back in drive, i looked up and saw another light, that looked exactly the same as the first two, once again in the sky just south of me.\r\n\r\ni was amazed that there was another one, but this time i took out my iphone to see if i could get some sort of picture of it. the weird thing was, though, the light would not show up in the camera on my

8. first i witnessed what i thought was a plane, then i realized the lights were much bigger and there was no aircraft, there were 3 round orb-like and orange lights in the shape of a triangle that were moving/flying rapidly upward then suddenly disappeared. at first i was very confused at what it was that i saw and why/how it disappeared, and if it was a plane how this was possible? i was totally perplexed and almost wanted to disacknowledge what just took place. what made me notice this was the size and triangular shape of the object and how quickly it was flying upward. \r\nafter 30 minutes later my boyfriend and i were having a conversation when i noticed in my peripheral vision one giant orange circular/orb like light to the right of my vision (south of gila bend - seemed to have been outside of ajo, arizona). this light was not moving in any direction it was staying still in one spot but it was almost the size of a penny, and was about 20-35 degrees above a mountain. we continued to watch it for 2 & 1/2 minutes until we watched it dissolve into nothing, dissolving from bottom first then top. it almost appeared to look like a mini sun, in the middle of the night, i compare it to this because of how bright it was and the intense aura of light it was emitting, the light was a very bright orange hue and it was sparkling almost like a fireball or star in the sky but much more intensely than anything i've ever seen. it appeared out of thin air, there was no trail or streak of light before it appeared, nor was there anything left behind when it disappeared. it just slowly faded away and was gone. while watching this i just had no idea what i was seeing, i knew it wasn't a plane or a flare because it would have left a streak or trail, i felt in shock at this point and awe at how bright this object was. i almost felt afraid because i had no way to explain what my eyes were witnessing. \r\nthen about ten minutes later after we had driven away from the place we had stopped to watch it, we noticed that 4 more of these orbs appeared in a line. at this point we were further away from them, but they were the same color and shape ( bright orange orbs floating in same spot radiating intense light) then a minute later a 5th one appeared, and for the next 2-5 minutes these orbs continued to appear and disappear across different positions in the sky. out of nowhere once again, it was as if someone flicked a light switch when they just disappeared. however, when they were still in the sky it did look like they changed shape at one point into a diamond like shape, but then they returned back into orb/circular shapes flickering immensely almost like extremely bright stars/suns. at this point i felt extremely happy/excited that i had seen something out of this world and unexplainable i was just happy and calling everyone i knew sharing that i was witnessing some crazy lights radiating this intense orange light. then as i drove away i felt afraid and in shock for the unknown. at this point today i would just like to know what i had seen.

metallic on the bottom.\r\n\r\nthe object(s) began very far apart and were sphere shaped, and then they moved very close together and formed a triangle formation but still separate objects. they hovered for a minute or two and then they began slowly ascending. \r\n\r\nthe object that was the front point of the triangle moved down/backwards and the objects formed a line and became square shaped. the two on the sides rotated around the one in the middle to change directions, the object on the left was now on the top still in a line formation. they then hovered again for a minute or so. they slowly started going up until they became aspirin size. then the middle and the bottom object shot up and the third object stayed there for at least five minutes. she then turned to see her sister exit the building and when she turned back to look again the last object was gone.\r\n\r\nthe three boys that were with her saw the third one shoot upward, but they said it moved in a spiral motion as it moved upward, then it disappeared.\r\n\r\nwhile we can clearly see the great salt lake from our home, as well as from both schools, these objects were several miles away while being

that. i looked up and saw a large disk silently floating over my head at a very low altitude. less than 1000ft. \r\n\r\nmy initial reaction was to say to him \" don't let them see you\" and i step

they totally dismissed our story.\r\n\r\nthe next morning it was all over the news papers that 13 guy from nj \r\nwere flying ultra lights in a circle formation as a hoax.\r\n\r\nthis was not the

route that included redding, mt. shasta , and weaverville, heading home through the chico area. \r\n\r\non 3/19/14 we started our day in mt. shasta , heading to weaverville after my first appointment. as we were leaving around 9:30am we both noticed the beginning of heavy chem trail spraying in the bright blue sky. as the day proceeded and we advanced to redding then onto weaverville , the chem trail spraying continued heavily. this became the theme of the day, unfortunately , as we both we taken aback by the amount of spraying in the sky as well as the head aches that followed. \r\n\r\non our way home...\r\n\r\n\r\nas i was driving , my friend shouted out that there was something in the sky. i pulled the car over when i had the chance and also saw 3 large sphere-like objects that were white that seemed to be observing the chem trails , sort of surrounding one of them. the observatio of these spheres that turned into 4 total lasted for 2 hours time- until we drove away from them on our way home. \r\n\r\nto be perfectly clear- these spheres were mostly suspended and fixed in one point each in the sky ... this sighting happened around 5pm-7pm while it was still very light out. \r\n\r\nat one point , when i was watching, they changed color slightly into a pink then blue- but mostly were and illuminated white. \r\n\r\nthey were also seemingly very large although they also seemed to be far away, also at one point they seemed to rotate or do something that made it look like they changed shape, sort of getting skinny, then going back to normal. \r\n\r\nmy personal beleife is that these objects were ufo s and that it had something to do with the heavy chem trails that day. one thing to mention as well is that i don't think many people observed these spheres because you had to look up at the sky, and most people were busy with driving or doing earth bound things... i think that there are more ufo s that go unnoticed because most people don't look up..They are too busy.M\r\n","distance":"Over One

a bright white, pulsating object. looked like an hourglass standing upright with rounded ends. i rolled my window down and took 2 pictures with my cell phone (iphone 5s) i zoomed in as much as i could. the light turned green so i kept driving. it was in my sight until i got home i was never able to turn the radio back on for about a 15 minute drive. it was still static. the object was still in the sky when i got home. i even had my teenager come outside to see it but we got scared so we went in the house.  when i looked at the pictures it looks like it's 2 objects and they split.  with my eyes i did not see this. the window was open and the car was stopped when the pictures were taken. no clouds. in the picture there is a lamp post to the right and the 2objects to the left. in one picture they are one above and below each other. in the next picture one object has moved to the left. i did not see them separate. they still looked like one object standing upright in the shape of

husband and myself were camping on the  brazos river near blum texas. we were out doing some morning fishing. right before getting out of the car i noticed a white light flying toward us. at first i thought it was an airplane so i didn't pay much mind to it. then it stopped moving. it was flying low maybe 500 feet in the air and was a across the river from us. for almost two hours it stayed in the same area, moving only a little bit at a time. it would sway side to side, move up and then down. it was a single very bright white light, it was like the brightest star youve ever seen only this light was about 500 ft in the air. i told my husband that we had to wait until the sun came up to see what it would do. we had completely ditched fishing and just sat in the car gazing  with  curiosity and disbelief. we knew that not only where we watching this ufo,  but that it was definitely watching us too. as the sun started to come up we watched it slowly ascend into the sky, in a straight line, and at a consistent speed. we video taped it and watched it ascend through the morning clouds until it was so far away we could no longer see it. we have video of it while it was still dark outside , when it started to ascend to space as the sun started to rise and we have video of it after the sun was up and you can still see it through the clouds. this was by far the weirdest experience of my life. i have had doubts about ufos and aliens but this affirmed it for me and now i am a true believer.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

maintenance dirt road heading north. i never noticed anything unusual about the night. we were talking and laughing just enjoying our ride when about a half mile into the dirt rode i saw movement in the left hand dide of the ditch.I slowed a bit as i wasnt going much over 40 but i thought it was a deer and didnt want to hit it.\r\ni watched ad this \"thing\" stepped onto the road..The kids got quiet and i knew they had to have seen it too.\r\ni compare it to the little \"geico\" on the insurance commercial. it stood maybe 6-7 foot it was white/grey almost like it was reflecting the headlights. its head was alligator shaped but with a stubby snout and looked like its mouth was attatched like a alligator. it was upright on two skinny legs the body was long and skinny with two unusually long arms with long fingers, i couldnt see how many. it didnt look our way but i could tell its eyes were located more to the side rsthet than front. as it stepped noticed it feet lookef like swim flippers but narrower. it took one step up from the the ditch and and two move it was to the othet side and gone. i was shocked,ive never seen anything like this in my life.Oh yes,it didnt have a tail to speak of but rather a triangle shaped nub..I dont know but it scared me as much as it made me curious. ive thought about it since the sighting if im crazy all threr of us are..We dont know what we saw there arent creatures in rural sd like this and definitely not aligstors or giant geicos. i dont go out evenings for a relaxing drive any more..Really dont want to be out alone at

large flock of birds that was glowing and moving in my direction.  as it progressed north it passed directly over my head at a very high altitude.I could see the space between the lights(which were round and a weird yellowish orange with a diffused white background)seemed to be shaped like an outline of a birds wing.Seems to be connected to similar shaped pieces of craft to make a doublerow of lights in front and along sides in a singular line. looked be be v shaped while looking south but when it got overhead it looked like a fat twinkie traveling fast and direct. i have seen alot of aircraft and this would have taken 100 airliners to span that amount of space at that altitude. it continued north out of site. i ran round to the other side of the house and watched it continue north.The shape of the grill stood out between the lights though it was the only real part that did not get blurred by the strange glowing lights. no pulsing or blinking occurred. no sounds i have 10 years military service and spent years on an aircraft carrier.I have seen alot of aircraft but never this sized which really was freaking amazing. i can describe the grill as black x but the lines kinda curved making them look like wings which was a pattern across the front. very creepy i raised my hand straight out when it was overhead and it still was bigger than my hand.
