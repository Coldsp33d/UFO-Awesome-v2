were walking into a gravel quarry outside of freeport, il in the summer of 1997. i was the first to notice a really bright light in the west. the others first dismissed the light as a star. for some reason i stayed fixated on the light as we kept walking. soon the light was to bright to ignore and we all started watching it as it approached directly toward us. the object was moving extremely slow, i would measure maybe 5-10 mph. as it approached, what had appeared to be one bright light was now visibly 2 bright lights in the front and smaller lights in the rear and sides. as it came closer i could begin to hear a silent noise that i can only describe as a hovering sound or \"quiet mechanical air\". what happened next is what makes this too hard to believe. as the craft was almost 15 to 20 feet directly above us, a light came on and projected down straight onto one of the friends i was with. this image will be burned into my brain for the rest of my life. when the beam shined onto him we all began to run and as i looked back i saw him take cover behind a nearby pile of gravel. the light stayed on him as the craft continued to travel east over the treeline and then turned off. this was not a helicopter or an ultra light plane. after the craft had flown past the treeline we looked back in the direction it had come from and saw 4-5 of the same lights heading in seperate directions from west to north. i have reoccurring dreams about the event, and think about it constantly.

and his son recorded a very long bigfoot call at 8:30 p.M. on sept 1st.  on our way home my husband and i were traveling on a road that was at least seven miles long.  we looked up and saw black streaks in the sky.  they were swarms.  i didn���t hear a sound and i know that they weren���t bees or locusts; we thought they were mosquitoes.\r\n \r\nthe swarm only followed the road and the multitude of them ran longer than the length of the entire road (7 miles).    we knew that this was a highly unusual activity and decided to pull the truck over and park. the first photo shows an oncoming swarm.  \r\n  \r\nit is highly unusual for a swarm to form at this time of day. you can see in the first photo that there was one light in the sky or what appeared to be a light in the sky at the time of the photograph.  the second photo shows three lights in the sky.  i turned to the back of our parked truck to photograph what i couldn���t see but what my perceptions allowed me to feel.  the ir on my camera is always on.  i clicked the 3rd image.  these photos were taken on sept. 2nd, 2012 the following evening in the same area after bigfoot researcher eugene and his son recorded a very long bigfoot call on sept. 1st.  the first photo shows the oncoming swarm (in a time period when a swarm shouldn���t have been traveling)  you will see one light in the sky in this shot. the second photo has three lights in the sky.\r\n  \r\ni turned to the back of the parked truck to photograph what i couldn���t see but could feel.  the ir on my camera is always on.  i clicked the 3rd image.  i couldn���t see anything but found it compelling to take the photograph.  i put it on my computer and saw orbs traveling in the beam that the ir on my camera captured.  i also saw the swarm encircling the beam. \r\n\r\ni wanted to know more about insects and i found on the internet that:  insects��� senses vary from mammals, and one of the most important traits they have is their ability to perceive heat.  it appears that the beam was giving off heat.  insects, especially blood drinkers, like mosquitoes, use heat detection as a means of hunting prey, focusing in on big heat sources like big animals.  even though the beam couldn���t be seen with human eyes the insects detected that it was there.  i have an excellent camera.  the first two shots were fine but later on i found out the camera malfunctioned on the beam shot.  i took test shots afterward and the camera functioned perfectly.  the fact that the camera did this seems to support that something was there.  i just wished i could have seen this beam with my naked eye.  if i had i would have put my video on to see if the orbs in the beam were traveling up or down and i would have aimed my camera higher to try to detect where the beam was coming from.\r\n","distance":"Over One

was about 1/4 the length those usually left by such planes as are more commonly seen, so i nudged my mother and gestured to it. it was in the middle of the sky at this point, no clouds around, and out in the wide open. she says 'it's probably just a jet', and in the short time it takes her to say those five words that i looked at her for, i look back and not only is whatever it is gone, so is the entire tail it was leaving behind it in the air. which at the slow speed it was going while leaving the tail would be pretty much physically impossible for it to disappear from the sky along with the

to be oblivious to what i was looking at. then it flew out over the intersection, rocked back and forth like an airplane when it's waving to you, and headed west. then it was gone within seconds. i

and i said now im seeing flashing low on the horizon.. she said you need to call akron canton airport, look up the number in the phone book. i got off the phone.. the flashing after the ufo made me think something was happening, like the ufo crash or zapped something. i called my friend and asked did you see the sky flashing.. and he did, when i got offthe phone with him to call the police he went outside, and he said the flashing was n.E. of him, and said it must be outside of canton. he thought maybe the power went out, i checked american electrics power website and it showed in stark county 501-2000 people with out power! i did not call the airport, im pretty sure they dont have a numbrr listed to talk to anything but a help desk or something, plus calling 911 was enough.\r\nthe 911 call i have on my phone as a record. it was about 7 minutes from the ufo to the power outage in the n.E. and i honestly think the power outage, where ever it was in n.E stark county, is linked to the ufo. it wasnt windy, and it was mostly clear here, and no clouds where the ufo appeared. \r\ni checked online to see if anything comes up on a search, and i get nothing on a ufo anywhere and notthing about the power outage aep had on the outage map online for stark county.\r\ni know about sky lanters, fireworks, this just appeared and disappeared with out moving, and they all started to strobe at the same time and all out at the same time, it was perfect and i know it wasnt someone causing it, or that it wasnt a natural event. for me this was 100% alien, and not just some light in the sky. \r\ni dont know for sure on distance, it was close, maybe only visable to the neighborhood.. my house sits up on a hill and i can see everyones roof tops looking east northeast. someone needs to investigate, maybe starting with what caused the outage. i checked at 3am on aeps webite and the power was still listed as out and that was almost 6 hours later!\r\nsomeone can even come out here to see what part of the sky i was looking at.. i just know this���for sure needs to be investigated.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:04","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":54808,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.790455746454455,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03192014-0015","longitude":-81.49903700022165,"occurred":1395203100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1395265293000,"summary":"10-20 green orbs appear steady  on, start flashing to a strobe, disappear","tags":["flash"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"44647","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Massillon, Ohio","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:185038"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Fremont","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Witnessed a huge object which at first thought was a hang glider. it banked right between 2 mountains but didn't come out the other side.  then i thought that was way to big to be a hang glider.  no sound.  i was within feet of the mountain.  sightings seem to be picking up.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":54807,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.543796362192786,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03192014-0014","longitude":-121.91578962898221,"occurred":1395039600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cone","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1395256076000,"summary":"Huge unknown object within feet of mountain","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"94539","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2,"locationName":"Fremont, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:185039"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Ottawa","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was at home talking to my neighbour while he was having a cigarette i noticed a star look  alike shape in bright orange i  knew it wasn't a star thought it was a planet we kept staring at it and when i pointed it out to my neighbour it started to move like hovering movements. i was so surprised to see it i ran in the house to call my wife when we came out it was gone it moved position i found it again it was so scary we ran in closed our doors and shut our lights of.

and asked me what it was. we watched it for approximately 10 seconds and then the craft disappeared to the west. the size of this craft was insanely large.
