Nang","country":"Vietnam","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My girlfriend and i were sitting on the beach, about 100 meters north of danabeach resort in da nang, vietnam.\r\n \r\nwe were sitting and talking for about 10 minutes or so when suddenly she saw something in the sky directly overhead that instantly caught her attention as strange. the time then was 6:45 pm. she mentioned immediately after the first sighting that she 'felt' something strange was happening above her, and she was compelled to look up.\r\n\r\ni looked up as well and my jaw instantly hung wide open, shocked and a bit scared at what i was seeing. it was a very large boomerang shaped craft moving at a steady speed and straight line to the north, towards son tra mountain. \r\n\r\ninstantly i could tell this was something strange, and my mind started racing to try and identify what this thing was. it didn't fit anything i've seen in the sky before. \r\n\r\nthe object appeared extremely large, but it was also totally silent and had no lights whatsoever. my first reaction was that this thing was a kite someone had lost their grip on and was blowing over our heads. \r\n\r\ni quickly realized that this was no kite, because of it's shape and altitude. there were two layers of clouds that evening, one low marine layer type sporadic clouds, and one blanket cloud cover at a very high, upper atmosphere level that covered part of the sky, especially to the north. \r\n\r\nthe object appeared below the top layer of clouds, but well above the bottom layer. the outline was clearly visible when contrasting the top layer of clouds. it had a perfect boomerang shape. when passing in front of stars, it blacked them out. \r\n\r\nthe color was a greyish white and actually looked almost 'smoky' like it had some kind of 'active camoflauge'. it appeared to be a craft that was designed not to be seen.\r\n\r\nit maintained a steady, smooth speed as it passed overhead to the north and we lost sight of it as it blended in to the cloud cover towards the mountain. the sighting of the first craft lasted about 10 or 15 seconds. \r\n\r\nwe were totally awestruck by this, and immediately started trying to figure out what it could have been. i was racking my brain trying to come up with some logical explanation but it just didn't fit anything i've ever seen in the sky. \r\n\r\ni've been in dozens of airplanes in my life, big and small, i'm a skydiver, i'm a climber with lots of experience with high altitudes and weird looking cloud formations. this was nothing i could explain, no matter how hard i tried. \r\n\r\nthe shape was too perfect. it was at an altitude where there were no other clouds. though it was similar in color, it contrasted to the clouds that were in the sky. it was moving too fast. it had no lights at all. \r\n\r\nif it were an airplane of some kind, it's relative size was too big. to look that big it would have to be flying at like 100 meters or something and would have been extremely loud. this thing was dead silent. \r\n\r\nthe size, speed, perfect shape, altitude, lack of lights, clear straight line flight path... all of this didn't add up to any aircraft i've ever heard of. \r\n\r\nda nang has a pretty active airport, right near the beach where we were. there are both commercial and military planes and helicopters flying overhead commonly every day. we've seen all of these and are familiar with them. \r\n\r\ni should mention that the skies were busy with air traffic that night, which is normal. there were no planes that seemed to interact with the craft we saw, and they looked like the normal blinking lights that we see everyday.\r\n\r\nso that was the first one. \r\n\r\nwe were pretty excited to have witnessed this, and a little shaken up by it too. we started talking about ufos etc. while looking straight up at the sky to see if anything else was there. \r\n\r\nafter a few minutes of neck straining i thought nothing was coming. every plane would catch our attention for a moment until we ruled it out as ordinary. it was looking at one of these planes that my eye caught the second boomerang craft. \r\n\r\ni could not believe i was lucky enough to be seeing this again. we got a longer look at this one, maybe 20 seconds or so before it blended in to the clouds to the north. \r\n\r\nit looked exactly like the first one and had the exact same flight path. i checked the time after we saw it, and it came about 15 minutes after the first one, at 7:00pm on the dot.  \r\n\r\nwe were basically dumbfounded at this point. and sat waiting and watching for anything else that might appear. nothing came. \r\n\r\nit is the next day as i write this, and i'm pretty blown away by what i witnessed last night.\r\n\r\ni hope somebody else saw this besides my girlfriend and i.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

walking their dog before going to sleep for the evening, when gazing at the sky while walking i noticed a red lantern type object in the nw part of the sky that slowly began to head toward us descending at the same time. it was clearly not a star, comet/asteroid or baloon.  i would assume it was less than a mile from us before it shifted direction east and ascended meandering up and down going farther north east until it disappears out of view.   it did not hold a flight pattern like anything i have seen.   it remarkably resembled those red chinese lanterns they light for prayer, though this was not constructed from paper nor was it a baloon.  the red was a constant color with no flickering lights or light beams.    the 3 of us were pretty sure we just witnessed a space craft of some sort.  it was awesome, though we went home and just went on with our lives, not thinking to do something or tell someone about it.  \r\nit wasn't until feb 2012, when visiting those same friends, when they showed me a video of similar red lantern type ufo's, but in clusters of 10 or 15, did i really believe what i had seen the previous year.  the last minute of the viral video \"mass

crash. i was so scared i just ran in the house the old simpson's came on. i remember how the simpson's came on cause of what took place outside that night. cause if u look at the simpson's they take the camera underground and u see the cartoon ufo. and i thought to myself that's what i seen it was a ufo but not  same kind. just a coincidence this happen for a reason type deal. but if u want to dismiss it for a falling star, u can my sister seen it to. second time... unmistakable can't be dismissed! so one night dad ask me and my brother to go get kerosene he had just got off work so my brother was driving i wanted to ride cause he had the best car out at that time i was looking for the girls. needless to say he pulled down to the end of the drive way i looked to the right all i could say is. \"you see that? lets go down there. \" he said \"hell naw.\"and last thing i remember about that night was that. i don't remember going to the store. i don't remember coming back from the store. i'm not saying i was abducted maybe everything after was so insignificant after i witness that.  i mean it was huge or it could be huge for a 15 year old where anything looks huge. it was silver disc shape look as if it had windows like riding by someone house at night with no curtains up and just a light on. i didn't see aliens people nothing on the inside maybe we didn't stay long enough i don't know. glad we didn't! that wasn't the weird part the weird part was after that a 1 year or so after they built a military/air force after that there in this small town.Coincidence? maybe but it makes you wonder. so 2012-13 i started telling people about what i seen. and come to find out they also had some accounts with unidentified flying objects","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the object slowly going on and off it was flying very slowly down the road right in front of my house. i could see the shape of the object it's outline stood out against the night sky. the light's came on and off slowly that's when saw it had round windows and i could see inside there was faint light inside and i could see the wall inside with what looked like bolts or rivets running down a seam. that's when i got afraid that i might see who was in there. the object went slowly just above the tree's and stopped right above the tree's where the creek was, then the light's started to flash all over the object in a pattern, it looked like it changed shape but it might have been just the light's that made it look that way, then it went straight down into the tree's but there's no place for something that big to land because it just dense woods, it never made a sound nothing, it was the last i saw of it. i went down and looked the next day to see if i could find where it went but there was no sigh of a landing anywhere no tree's broke nothing. i have been calling it a object but what i saw was a machine i don't know who was flying it but it was a machine. the light's changing on it was really something to see. i was no more than a 100 foot away as i looked at it and no more than 500 foot when it went straight down. a couple of years ago i told my grandson what i had seen when i was young and he ask me something that i didn't have a answer for, he ask me why i wasn't like the people on tv who spent years looking for ufo's. i still don't why i didn't tell everybody i saw and why i was not afraid the next day or even now it was like it wasn't very important. that is what has been bothering me ever since my grandson ask me that question. i have never seen a picture

hour, upstairs and my mother and older brother were watching the world series.  our mother came up screaming for us to change the tv channel to 10 which is the columbia, sc station.  the weather man joe pinner was reporting that a ufo was hovering over the columbia airport.  we thought wow changed the tv back to cbs to watch the show.  about 20 minutes or so later the tv reception started messing up but with rabbit ears they always do then there was a strange humming sound inside the house.  my sister and i had no clue why until our brother yelled for us to get down stairs that something was hovering over our house, which was a 2 story brick house and the main tv was attached to an antenna outside the house.  on our way down stairs our mother had gone out the front door to see what was going on and our brother locked her out she was screaming beating on the door and the dogs were howling in their pens.  i got to the door first and got it opened it to let her in or go out and see what was going on.  as i looked up above the house some 500 ft. up was and oval shaped object  approximately the size of our house making no sound outside but the inside of the house was still humming.  the object seemed to float around until you could hear the sound of jets in the distance then the object started to move off to the north east, when the jets came into sight the object seemed to gain altitude then it looked like it left the jets standing still.  in one second gone from sight.  when we went back in the same reporter was on tv saying that authorities said that the object was just weather balloon.  my mother, sister and i slept together that night our father was in atlanta on business and our brother barricaded himself into his bedroom with his guns.  \r\nthe object was oval with lights on the bottom maybe eight to twelve none were blinking just sort of pulsating dimmer then brighter.\r\nthis is me thinking back when i was 6 years old at that time i drew a sketch of the object.  it was not until my mother���s death when we were going through her stuff that some of the drawings were found.  of course at that time or anytime people may think you are crazy so we never talked about it much after we told our father when he got home.  \r\n","distance":"101-500

was unwell. coming out of my balcony my wife called me as noticed on the left side of our house (place where the sun rises-east) had a \"star\" much larger than the other and with very intense brightness and sparkly. she looked to the naked eye, don't move, however started to take some pictures with your cell phone and your computer we noticed some kind of change of ways.\r\ni got my camera ge a730 digital compact 7 megapixel of because she has some resources to take night shots and fireworks. in this way took multiple photos then the supposed \"star\" that at first i thought it was \"vesper\" or something. to view these photos that i was careful to take in several adjustments to my machine we were stunned because the object took on photos unexplained formats. i've always been careful to support the camera a \"tripod\" improvised because i've been a photographer of the company's products that i worked in 80 years and knew of the possibility of causing inadequate effects without the correct support of the camera.\r\nreturning to the phenomenon, are several photos where the object appears to change shape every second dramatically. however i observed characteristics that are repeated: the light that emits in the pictures we took with \"fireworks\" is always white with several points that seem to \"pink suckers\". there is also a point always with white light stronger on all photos. in a few moments the object appears to join and form a more compact mass. suddenly there is a mutation in seconds and the same expands into several \"tentacles\" strangers with several points in these so-called \"pink suckers\".\r\n\r\nthe photos are extraordinary, shocking as you will be able to see. i've never seen anything like these programs that sometimes we see on tv.   the phenomenon didn't happen in the early hours of the next day (3/15/14 day) however in the early hours of today-3/16/14 happened again and saw around 04:00 a.M..  i'm forwarding some pictures in

the other end almost had a cylinder shape. the aircraft hovered for a few seconds and birds were circling it in the sky. i went to grab my phone to take a photo but when i looked up the craft was gone, but the birds were still there circling. they stayed in that spot for a few moments. as soon as i had a chance i drew a sketch of what i seen just so i wouldn't forget. i have included that photo. i didn't feel much except i knew what i saw and that no one would probably believe me. i told a friend and he just laughed so i have kept it quiet since.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

in the sky from the southwest and passed by us at about 70 degrees from the horizon going towards the north west. they made no sound.  there was no trail behind them.  we both thought they were nothing we had seen before:  not the space station or satellites, which we've seen before, nor shooting stars.  we though ufo.  it was very exciting.    they all stopped glowing when they reached about 45 degrees from the north west horizon but were still seen as black objects following the same trajectory but disappearing from view at about 30 degrees from the horizon.  the sky was clear and it was still fairly light outside with constellations visible. it was not windy at all.  \r\nthen a plane went from the north to the south in the direction they came from.  the sound of the plane was behind the sight of the plane  so it must have been going quite fast.
