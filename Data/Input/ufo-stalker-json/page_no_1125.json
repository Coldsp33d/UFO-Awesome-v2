person.  at the above time, about 1am, on a back road leading from bellingham, mass. my girlfriend and her friend were returning from a dance. they were headed back to rhode island via i 295 outside of woonsocket, ri.  they had nothing to drink at the dance.  the road, as she soberly related the story to me the next day, was deserted. the small mill town was 'tucked away' for that saturday night.  as they came to a cross road intersection, where no cars were seen, a bright, glowing ball of light, about the size of a basketball, as she related to me, crossed in front of their car at chest level.  she said the ball of light was not going at a high rate of speed, but she estimated it was going 5-10 mph.  she and her girlfriend watched in shock as this ball of light crossed in front of their car, proceeded west, and then suddenly changed direction, crossing the street to a church on the other side,  and then 'zipping' up over the church and steeple and down the other side and gone!  neither of them had ever seen a ufo before, and were quite animated in their description of the object, which seemed to be a 'probe' of some kind.\r\ni decided to call the local wjar channel 10 news station the next day to report this incident.  the news director came on the phone to me.  i told him the story.  he said that the same object had been reported earlier that night in the framingham area of massachusetts. about 15 miles away.  he was rather stoic about receiving the report, as if resolved to do nothing about reporting the event to the public, even though it was collaborated by witnesses in two different towns not far apart.  apparently, this was not 'newsworthy' to wjar.\r\ni feel my report, though 'second-hand,' needs to be evidenced as it shows how many other sightings go un-reported, either from witnesses not telling anyone or in this case local news stations refusing to broadcast the events publicly.  what is reported on the ufo phenomenon, i feel, is the 'tip of the iceberg.' most sightings by people all over never are made public.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with

beautiful clear weather, no clouds, sunny, warm but not humid or hot.\r\nnoticed an odd item in the sky at what appeared to be some distance. shape was rectangler, ratio about 2 to 1, wide side down, approximately horiztontal in the sky, appeared to be some distance away as the color of the object seemed somewhat greyed out, yet the \"shape\" was distinct. i continued driving, glancing back at it every few seconds. the thought crossed my mind that it was an aircraft towing a \"banner\", yet there did not appear to be any aircraft around. note that at one time i was stationed on an attack aircraft carrier. i've seen lots of aircraft in the sky in all kinds of weather conditions. i pulled off the road, stopped, and took a good long \"look\" at this thing. guess what, now there are two of them. over a period of about five minutes or so the total count would up at a total of seven of these rectangles, didn't appear to be going anywhere, just seemed to stay in the same place. the greyed out look did not change, size did not seem to change. what was very odd was that they were all in the same orientation, wide side down, somewhat like beads on a string. they were not \"lined\" up, no two were at exactly the same height, yet the difference between any two was no more that the \"width\" of any single object. in the horizontal sense none were any further apart from the next object than 1.5 times the width of an individual object. \r\n  obviously, this is a bit dated, but it was extremely strange, and yes, i have a very good memory. after a few more minutes, and no changes, i decided to continue to the store parking lot, about a mile. when i had parked i tried to relocate the objects, and they were not to be found anywhere. as i said, the weather was clear, early morning, no clouds, no aircraft in the vicinity. note that richmond does have a fair sized airport on the far side of town, about twenty miles or so to the east. whatever these things were, they seemed to be at some distance, and large to account for the greyed out look. this would also tend to indicate they were at a quite respectable altitude. my navy job was taking care of the search radar systems and related equipment, among other things. this event still bugs me so to speak, since i definitely can't account for it. i know what they were not, but not what they were. perhaps someone else has reported something remotely similar. if so, i'd love to hear about it.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

noticed a formation of lights in the sky heading from the north east to southwest. we have a lot of air traffic in the area with ups traffic in/out of sdf and private planes into bowman field. and is in not uncommon to see ky air guard c-130s (in close formation with only red collision beacons) and national guard and police helicopters. the moon was about 15 degrees off the eastern horizon and the sky was clear with some intermittent cirrus clouds. \r\n\r\nbut what was striking was the size of the formation; seven (7) bright orange/white objects. they each appeared to be glowing orange with a single bright flood light. we had just pulled into our driveway and got out of the car to watch them pass overhead. at first we thought that they might be chinese lanterns but they were moving too fast, northeast to southwest and against the wind, which was out of the southwest. as they passed overhead (they didn't make a sound) the brilliant white light went out and the orange glow began to fade. as they picked up speed the were above a layer of cirrus clouds. i would estimate the altitude at 25k feet and their speed similar to a commercial airliner at that attitude (400/ 500 mph). as the last object headed toward the western horizon, the glow was gone and it was appeared to be an orange colored slab and was clearly accelerating west-bound above the cirrus cloud layer. i took one photo with my cell phone. while the quality doesn't allow any detail, it does reflect what we saw....Glowing orange color with a brilliant white light at the

intersection i saw a pulsing spherical light or orb or craft moving in a quick and sporadic flight path approx a couple of hundred feet above in the direction i was headed. it was just above the tree line and was executing quick turns and descending and ascending altitudes in a manner i've never seen. \r\n\r\ni pulled over and it had circled me and i watched and recorded it for a few minutes... see video at:\r\n\r\ni returned home to get a better camera and brought another witness back to the scene. at this point it was directly above at least a few thousand feet. there were two lights, both looked the same that were pulsating and hovering. they moved away from one another after coming together and moved in a direct path very slowly. there was complete cloud cover and aside from the full moon, they were the only two lights visible. \r\n\r\ni zoomed in with my video camera and was as tight as i could get. i witnessed both through the camera and with the naked eye, the light pulsating and growing bigger, forming a typical saucer / star tetrahedron shape. it would expand and briefly blink out only to immediately return to it's original size and spherical shape. see second shot on video. we witnessed it for approx ten mins (around 10pm) and then left with it still high above in the sky.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
