rectangle or triangle ufo outside our house.   \r\n\r\nthe symphony started at 8pm. my dad never wanted to be late so we left a little after 7pm to make sure we made it there in plenty of time.  our house is on a small hill near the end of our block. it was twilight to dark. as we left the house and started walking down the front steps down to our car ��� we saw this black object floating just barely above the tree tops.\r\n\r\nit was enormous and hardly moving.  it spanned from one end of our block to the other end. i don���t know how long our block is but the object was more than the length of our block and there are 6 three story colonial houses between our house and the end of the block and the object was long enough to cover them all.  it was wide also covering houses on both sides of the street. the object was also thick (maybe one story or more thick) and not aerodynamic at all. there is no way that should be flying. it was so large that we could never see the far side of it. we really only could see 2 sides of it so it could be a rectangle or a triangle.   \r\nwe walked down the steps and into the middle of our street and stood directly underneath it.  it was very close nearly touching the tree tops (large oak trees in our neighborhood).  it was a matte black and blocked out the sky from our view because it was so massive.  it had lights on the underside -some large, some small, but the lights were dull and not bright. i can���t remember where the lights were but know some were different colors. the side of the object had a window like opening which had dim lights. \r\n\r\nwith an object flying so close, it should have been loud but this object didn���t make a sound but you could sort of feel it in your chest.  even blimps make sounds but this object just didn���t make a sound.\r\nwe stood directly underneath it for several minutes looking up and then it slowly drifted up the side street next to our house. it went from moving straight ahead to moving at a 90 degree angle without turning. we kept walking with it up the side street while it was directly overhead. it was gliding so slowly that it was easy to keep walking with it.  \r\nwe could have kept walking with it but my dad said that he didn���t want to be late for the concert and we had to go. in the end, we watched the object for about 15 minutes.  i didn���t want to go but we did. when we got into the car, i asked my dad what it was and he said that he didn���t know and didn���t want us to talk about it ever again.  i tried to bring it up several times and he made it clear that we were to never discuss it. years went by without talking about it��� when my dad was dying i asked him about it and he couldn���t remember it happened.   i thought maybe it was all in my mind so a few years after my dad died i asked my mom if she remembered and she did.  this made me both relieved and frightened.  we���ve talked about it several times since then. \r\n\r\nwhile i wasn���t afraid while we were watching the object, those moments since seeing it have haunted me almost every day since.  i���ve been uneasy sleeping at my house since that night and have had to sleep with a light on only when i���m there. every time i felt the slightest low hum, i rushed to my bedroom window to see if it is there. i���ve since moved away but my mom still lives there. i moved to a very large city and oddly i sleep better in this large city than at my childhood home.  \r\n\r\nwe had no idea what the object was when we first saw because it was and remains like nothing we've ever seen before. we noticed it because it took up the entire sky above our street and was very very close to us. we could not miss it unless we were blind. it was one of the most pivotal moments in my life. an investigator may contact me if needed. \r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with

police department,my shift was from 7pm - 7am. on this particular night,i had been at the police department for a short break.I walked out to my patrol car and left heading east. i drove one block over and noticed something on top of the post office that caught my attention.I stopped my patrol vehicle in the street between two vacant parking lots.  the post office was located one block to my north of my position. this was a cloudless night and very clear. my driver side window was down and was in direct line and view of what i was observing.I first saw something light green getting larger as it was heading across the roof of the post office toward my direction. as i watched it, i began to realize it appeared to exactly resemble a person walking.  it stopped at the edge of the flat roof of the post office on the side facing me and stopped. the best description i can give of the thing i saw is the following:  it appeared to be about 8 foot tall. i base this by the height of the post office wall in porportion to the things  height. the body of the thing had a regular build to its height,meaning what a person who have who was in good shape. not fat or skinny. the most extrodinary item was the thing was transparent. the lines of the thing were flourecent green with gave it somewhat of a mass but was still transparent.The thing had great 3d detail. every feature except for the height appreared to be human. the clothing appeared to be what i would describe as a jumpsuit. but again, it was all one color and made up by its green outlines.The thing appreared bald to the best of what i remember. the thing stood at the edge and put its hands on its hips and turned its upper body a began looking back off to the west as if it was observing something. it then turned and began looking off to the east for a few seconds. all i could think was that i cant believe what im seeing and i hope it didnt see me.  a few seconds later it looked down directly at me. i didnt feel fear. i dont know if i could actually see a smile or just had that feeling like it was smiling and saying, \"well you saw me.\" i never felt threatened. the thing turned and began walking back the way it came. i remember saying to myself, like hell your getting away. i drove to the back side of the post office (north side). the walls to the post office are about 25 foot tall on all sides. i knew it couldnt jump down.  i called the fire departemnt which is located next to the police station and told them to bring a ladder truck over to the post office because i believed someone was on the roof.  another police unit left the police department and set up watching the opposite sides of the building.About 5 minutes later the fire department arrived. i told the others to stay down and i would check the roof. i climbed up on the roof and there was nothing. i searched the spot on the roof where it was standing and the path it walked and found nothing. i believ the roof was graveled but cant remember for sure. the officer and fire department personell im sure thought i was nuts thinking someone was up there. i dared not tell them what i saw. so i sat on this for years and only told a few close friends about the experience. since the internet has come out i have tried to research any other sightings such as this but have found nothing.I can say this with the utmost confidence. i know what i saw.  there was too much detail in the thing. this was a very clear night. the thing had the dark sky behind it so it was easy to see, not to mention its size. i have been retired from the pd for 4 years now. i run my own business and do private investigations and security contracts. if you have had any other reports like this i would greatly appreciate a response. this has bothered me for years and i just would like to know what yall think i saw or what it could have been. thanks in advance! if you need an exact time and date the police department should have made a call report on the incident.The month and day above are just a guess. i cant remember. but the year should be close.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

visible as it shifted so fast behind the tree and came out the other side, it would continuously move down from the moreno valley area towards riverside. this star would sit for a roughly 2-3 minutes with a beam of light flashing downwards at times and then would move just a little bit repeating itself.. as i moved around to keep my eye on it i then saw what appeared to be a disc shape with red lights blinking around it with no pattern and was stationairy. today i witnessed the same thing but this time another ufo having red lights flickering out of order flying over the first disc shaped ufo i just mentioned. i then went the next day to where i had thought it was located but found nothing whatsoever. the photo appears to show it on a mountain but the same day i searched for remains i recognized that not a single tower was located on any hil or mountain which has the characteristics of what i saw. i did not lose sight but rather went to bed after it already being close to 12 am. my belief is that the object is military involved. a lot of strange behavior has been taking place this past week and a half. jet formations, cargo planes flying in circles, marine gun ships and an awac radar jamming airplane. i've questioned the military on past issues like drones being flow over moreno valley residential areas and received contradictory statements but from my discoveries of ufo snapshots in palm springs , military aircraft to orbs over the base have me thinking the military is prepping for something either related to the ukraine crisis or of something else. i will admit all

not.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":54724,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.9604987,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03162014-0003","longitude":-117.3935664,"occurred":1394644800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1394963384000,"summary":"Something

three large orbs hovering in the sky. i got to the end of my street and did not have a good view, so i made a left, and then a right hand turn then pulled over. i rolled down my window and watched them. i thought maybe there was fog and that the fog was discoloring  airplane lights. but there was no fog, and they were not moving.  some people came out of their house so i decided to move down the road a bit further. i made a left on the next street,and immediately pulled over. the orbs were sw in the sky. as i was watching, two of the orbs faded out. cars were having to go around me, so i pulled up the road further. i looked up, and the last orb was still there. i took a right on a side road, parked and got out of my car. the orb was amazing. i knew, without a doubt, that this was not normal. it was large, so blatantly obvious, just hovering. i got better look at it and it was orange, pulsating and kind of spinning. i could see that the interior was brighter than the exterior of the object. there was some kind of movement, but it was hovering while moving. after watching it for a minute, a small aircraft was flying at about the same elevation, fairly close by. the plane was traveling ne. from my perception, the orb seemed bigger. after a few minutes, maybe a minute after the plane flew by, the orb started to head south. as it was leaving, the same orange color was visible. the orb flew at a pretty high rate of speed, it's size decreased dramatically as it got further away. then it was just gone. \r\n\r\nthroughout the sighting, i didn't want to waste time taking pictures. i didn't want to miss anything. i had my phone and had to force myself to stop looking and try and take a photo. i thought i snapped a photo then tried to take video. i have a very short video only.  my adrenaline was pumping, but i was calm, yet excited. if it was right in front of me, maybe i would have felt fear.

went outside onto the porch of our trailer, to smoke a cigarette.  the porch had a metal overhang that covered the entire porch, except the steps. we were sharing a cigarette, standing on the porch under the overhang, facing the steps (south). i walked down one or two steps and looked up at the sky.\r\n\r\ni remember it was a nice, warm, clear morning. it was mainly a clear blue sky, and when i looked up i saw something flying, which was odd because it seemed like it just appeared, i didn't notice anything in the distance before that. i was facing south, and at first i thought it was a plane because it looked pretty big to me. but then i realized it wasn't a plane.\r\n\r\ni heard no noise from it. i thought i could see a rounded, long beak/nose and a giant body. i would maybe compare it to a bat or a pterodactyl, i didn't see any feathers. it was hard to tell because it was kind of shadowy, i guess, is what i would describe it as. or blurry, like it was blending in with the sky or surroundings. but it wasn't invisible, it was just hard to see details. it's coloring was grayish brown, dark, maybe even black, which i think helped the shadowy, blurry camouflage thing it did. it's wings looked like a bats wings and it was pretty big, not as big as a plane like i first thought. maybe the size of a small plane, like one that sprays pesticide on crops, or a little smaller.\r\n\r\ni was facing south, standing on the bottom steps of my porch, and it was flying over my neighborhood, above the treetops, heading north. i ran out, about 2-4 ft. away from the porch, so i could see over the overhang and trailer, and had a more clear view of the sky, facing north. the strangest thing about it was how it flew. it looked like it was swimming through the sky, kind of gliding. it undulated through the sky, and i think it was going pretty fast, although the way it seemed to just swim through the sky made it look like it was going slow, leisurely. \r\n\r\nmy boyfriend saw it about the same time i did, i can't remember who actually saw it first, but we both ran out, away from the porch steps, to get a better view of the sky. another strange thing happened once we were no longer on the porch, under the overhang. as soon as we got out in the open and were watching this thing swim through the air, we both got this feeling of fear. i don't know if it was just because i saw this strange, unknown object/creature flying above my house, but as soon as i moved away from the porch i got extremely scared, like i knew it could see me now, and could feel it watching me. the feeling intensified, getting much worse, until i looked at my boyfriend for a second, and we both freaked out, ran up onto the porch, and inside the door. \r\n\r\nthe second we got inside, the feeling of fear lessened, and my boyfriend immediately ran back outside, and i followed him. he went off the porch so he could see over the trailer and i hid behind him, but we did not see it. afterwards, he said he got the same feeling of fear, like it was watching us, and intensified until it made him run for cover, too. it had to of been moving pretty fast, because we should have been able to see it flying for awhile, the skies were clear and it was easily visible over the treetops, with a large area of sky visible in the direction it was going.  \r\n\r\nthe last i saw of it, i was a few feet out from my porch steps facing north, looking up at the sky. it was already pretty far out past my porch and trailer, probably 5-6 trailers away, steadily swim/flying north, and it seemed to be staying at the same altitude, above the trees. it took about 5-10 seconds to run inside, then back out to where we last saw it, probably less time for my boyfriend because i was being cautious, staying back behind him, and he just ran back out to where we last saw it. the entire incident took maybe a minute. i saw it for maybe a total of 30 seconds, and it travelled from right past the porch overhang, above the steps, to nearly the other side of the neighborhood. \r\n\r\nthe entire time it still had that weird blurry, shadowy, blending thing going on, which could have had something to do with the way it flew. the way it moved, it did not look like anything flying, whether bird or plane, it looked like it was swimming through the air, like a snake or jellyfish would swim through water. i could almost put it off as a plane or bird that i had the wrong perspective of, or the sun shining made it look different, except for the way it flew. i've never seen anything seem to appear and literally swim through the sky like it's water, cause intense fright, then disappear. it may have flown off in a different direction or landed somewhere instead of disappearing, and the fear may have been natural. but i don't know what i actually saw, if it was some type of creature or aircraft? i think some creature, but what was the blending thing it did? i just don't know.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s),  Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line
