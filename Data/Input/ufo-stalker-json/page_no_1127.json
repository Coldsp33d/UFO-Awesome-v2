States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Hanging with my brother leaning on our mothers car at about 1:30 or 2:00 in the am we both simultaneously noticed a light shoot fairly quickly up from the south .At first i though a firework or something but then it hovered in what appeared to be one spot so we tried to put some logic to it,maybe a helicopter ,maybe a flare and at some point not long ( maybe 7 mins after we first noticed it)we realized it was getting closer.At this point it was a fainter light but clearly visible .This light really had our attention and for some reason i knew it was different than any other airship/plane i've ever witnessed and ive lived quite a while right next to selfridge air force base with  large helicopters ,jets and cargo planes around all the time.Roseville where the sighting occurred is only 5 miles away.Anyway we observed the object head slowly( about walking speed) toward us and then over our heads less than 500ft ,it was completely silent the whole time until we were directly under the center of it and than we could hear albeit very low/quiet thrust type noise,the craft was green with some small red accents ( almost like soviet green and red .The craft had one small blinking light and it hadn't any windows but had a sort of protrusion like you would see on a zepplin .When finally passed us we could see the light coming from the rear from flame type aura thruster which encompassed the the whole of the rear of the craft , you could see everything and we had time to get a good look,the craft seemed to be put together like the space shuttle -green tile like large plates ,here's the thing it seemed like something i would say could be man made except for the facts- the thing was 1000 feet (thousand) long or longer -( it was like a icbm (missile )with 3 stubby fins in the rear which was observed as it left our site)\r\nthe thing was completely silent until we were directly under the center of the craft and even that sound only lasted a few seconds.\r\nit was so big and slow it should have fell out of the sky. \r\nwe called the police and they said no one else had called about it, it flew over a major interstate and a very populated area( how could no one else see it?(my brother thinks we only saw a part of it and that maybe it's cloaking device was not properly working) \r\ni think it's man made alien technology, reversed engineered if you will but why such a larg craft, anyway the craft stayed on the same path and headed northwest toward canada ,it had to have been seen by selfridge ang .It kept its same speed and silently went its way.Its the real deal and i haven't seen anything on any show or book yet .Closest thing is a cigar shaped craft but this is different( i've been researching this ever since ) i've submitted this story to some suite years ago but this is as real as it gets and want people to know if our goverment has alien or future human technology.\r\nthanks you","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:40:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line

a light i pointed out in the sky to the north or southeast. before we knew it, it had zipped from a star to hovering over our road. it took a turn above the driveway and i noticed it's illumination onto the gravel below. it was the size of a small car but a sphere glowing from red to orange, then to white. it made no sound and seemed to be a sphere of pure light with what seemed like craters. we ran to the door which was locked and after banging my mom let us in and said she didn't lock it and reported us being gone for a while. \r\n\r\npenniston and burroughs from bentwaters, england reported the same but penniston described it differently than burroughs like my brother differed from me. the next day my brother drew a disc and i drew the sphere i saw.\r\n\r\nin 2013 i had what i believe was a close encounter of the third kind. i saw a tall grey next to me in my bed. i noticed wrinkles and hair in the back of it's neck and when i ran it turned it's (stun wand thing) towards me. it was very thin and whitish and had the typical narrow black eyes like an ant. i put on my shoes since it was only a nap i woke from and saw a flash of blue from my bedroom window where it had gone through the wall when i went outside to see a craft. if it wanted to harm me it would have. it knew i was scared.  i woke up and was frightened the next day, but i was relieved it didn't pursue

late just talking and watching movies. we had turned the tv and lights off in my room around 2 or 3 am and just talked for a little while. something prompted me to go to my window. i sat on my floor looking out my window, still in light conversation with my friend who was sitting on my bed about 3 ft away from me. as i gazed out my window across the street in my neighbors back pasture (about 50 yards from my house) which was a semi dense pine and palm tree area of about 3 acres i saw something rise above the trees in their pasture...As if it had been \"parked\" there and was now leaving. it slowly rose above the trees without making a single sound or disturbing the trees from where it was rising from. it hovered for a moment above the trees...Maybe 50 ft in the air (if that) and began to fly directly towards my house over the power lines and the street and the oak tree just to the right of my window. it moved rather slowly so i was able to tell that this was shaped like no other flying machine i had ever seen. it amazed me how silent it was...I knew that if it had been a small plane or helicopter i should have heard something or the trees should have been blowing, but nothing. it seemed to be a round shape maybe about 30-50 ft in diameter. this was a rural area so there were not many street lights or traffic lights to illuminate it well enough for me to make out specific characteristics about its color and shape. i could tell though by the arrangement of the lights on its exterior that it seemed to be like a flying saucer shape. it had many small lights on it that were many different colors. once it flew over my house i lost sight of it and had turned to my friend to ask her if she had just seen what i had just saw. she said that she had seen it and was just as perplexed as i was. in my state of confusion i did not think to leave my room and go outside to keep watching it....Honestly i was concerned that whatever it was might have seen me watching it. this is not the only time i have seen something in the sky i could not understand but it was definitely the first.

and on the way back i saw a very bright light out in a field to the west. thinking it could be a downed plane ( there was a municipal airport nearby) my mom drove to the sight. i am the oldest of 5 and all of my siblings were present. we observed a very large ( 1/2 the size of a football field) cigar shaped craft hovering over the ground. it appeared to be metallic and had two very bright lights on the front and back. my mother turned off the car and rolled down the windows and it was silent except for a slight hum which could have been the power lines overhead. my mother and siblings have no recollection of how long we were there. strangely, even though i pointed the craft out and was older than the others, i have no memory of that night. i have retold the story always saying that it was something that happened to my mom and siblings. one day as an adult i asked my mom something about the event and she looked at me startled and said...\"you were there, you were the one who pointed it out!\" she found it odd i had no memory of that night. when i was twenty i wrote a paper for a college english class. it was an odd experience because i wrote this story very quickly and without having to think about it, afterwards i was somewhat surprised at what i had written. it is a story called \"the precious harvest\" and recounts the abduction of a young woman describing her examination and the explanation for the procedure being done on her. she was told that our species had been planted on this planet long ago and that the aliens believed that in a short period of time we would destroy the planet and ourselves with it. they described themselves as the guardians of seed responsible for making sure that our genetic material would be available to one day re-seed another planet. i am now 55 years old. i have been plagued by many unexplained events that many around me and at times myself, wrote off as \"supernatural\". my senior year of high school and first year of college i received phone calls from a woman who consistently told me where i had been and what i was doing, making it clear i was being closely watched. the event was reported to the police and persisted for a year and a half. it got so bad i had to have a police escort to nighttime events on campus. oddly, the woman would often say when i asked why she was doing this, \"we love you as we have always loved you.\" i finally left school early and moved back east to live with my dad. the harassment stopped. however, i have since experienced what i thought was living in haunted houses. myself and my kids have had appliances turn on, furniture move, faucets turned on, lights turned on and off and many other odd occurances. when my son was ten he had an experience of something lifting his bed off of the floor, he was so frightened he could not call out for help, luckily his sister checked in on him and he flew off the bed and wrapped himself around her, still unable to speak. he never slept in that room again. my children and myself often wake with unexplained bruising and scratches. myself and my children have observed ufo's on multiple occasions and in different states.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then

however today when reviewing the last 20 sightings posted on this website i noticed one from alton, illinois describing objects similar to the one i saw in alton a little over a year ago.  i observed the object from my top floor office in an office building at the highest point in downtown alton. the view looks out over the mississippi river which is just a couple of blocks away. this was in the afternoon, slightly overcast and not in any way dark, hazy or foggy. solid white non-reflective oval object hovering at a tilt over the river. after watching it for about 5 minutes i asked my assistant to come take a look. she was as perplexed as i was as we took turns looking at it through a cheap pair of binoculars.  we both moved to a different office where high-powered binoculars are mounted on a tripod, and observed it for another 10 minutes. it was only slightly higher than our own elevation and although not directly across from us, it was easy to observe.  after hovering, it very slowly moved to the west above the river until slightly moving to the north over land and out of our view. alton is located near a small regional airport where private jets and small prop planes are in and out all of the time. there is an international airport 25 miles away in st. louis, missouri.  in addition, boeing builds and tests military aircraft next to the international airport.  about 40 miles south and east is scott air force base.  i point this out to emphasize we see all types of aircraft in the skies above alton and what i saw is nothing like anything seen from any of

they are here, what bothers me also is the amount of people who go missing every year yet the governments keep it very quiet. hey good luck and at least you have an interesting task which is more than most people.\r\n\r\nvery best regards\r\n\r\nmike","distance":"Over One

to find me in a daze screaming and crying and unable to speak clearly. i was taken to the doctor and my parents were told that i was having \"night terrors\"... \r\n   what i recollect about these event is that i wasnt crying because of a bad dream i was crying because i felt so overwhelmed by my inability to put into words what i felt... now as i think back the way i xan describe it is \"frighteningly vast\" as if standing next to a topless skyacraper in a bottomless pit.... what i remember are opaque translucent orbs about 8 to 10 inches floating in my room and down the hallway.... i rememeber my ears ringing like a gun had went off next to my head and this weird visual in my mind of like a line with dashes on it sort of like a ruler and the feeling of my awareness jumping skipping a few dashes landing and jumping againg down the line... the orbs had colors to them maybe they pulsed they were lit up in the dark but did not admit aany light or brighten the area around them.... these visits would happen when i was sleeping and i always remember straining incredibly hard and fighting to wake up as if something was physically keeping me down. for some reason when this would happen i would wake up o  a bare mattras sheets and pillows and blankets all heaped neatly in a pile by my door.. the orbs would be in my room or id see them outside my door in the hallway... the feeling at that age was not one if fear ir terror... it was one of being overwhelmed beyond the capability of my words... i can not say for certain if i ever left my room but on seperate occasions as an adult i have felt myself being slipped into bed and the temperature difference between my cold body and my girlfriends warm body woke us both up... same ringing in ears, same feeling of my cognitive awareness bounding down a line of measurement or something of that nature... same sickeningly overwhelmed feeling of how small we are... when we woke up she was curious as to where id been... because my side of the bed was cold as well as my unclothed body... i didnt have an answer just as when id wake my parents up crying... and tears came as an adult as well... when i went to get a drink of water i noticed the front door at the bottom of the stairs was open woke my girlfriend up fully we checked on her daughter and all the upstairs rooms then went and closed the door and checked the downstairs... where it was very cold so obviously the door had been open for some time... i know for a fact that when we went to sleep the front door was closed and locked both handle and bolt because or neighborhood wasnt the best.... im not sure if this is an abduction or visitation, there is a smell that i always have in my sweat after these events and i cant place it... if this is happening to anyone else please contact me with details...

for maybe six to eight seconds. i was maybe a hundred yards away. the b-58 hustler does not hover. i've seen a ufo flying from east to west, covering an estimated distance of 20 miles; in about eight seconds. it seemed to be anywhere from 500 to 1,000 feet long. it bounced up and down as it crossed the sky. it bounced up and down in the sky, like an a/c current sine wave. from peak to peak of its bounce, i'd say was maybe half a mile. and i saw one ufo that looked basically like a navy f-14 tomcat with its wings folded for super-sonic flight. the similarity ended at where the engine intakes are on an f-14. it was like an f-14 without a cockpit; ascending and reflecting sunlight so much it almost hurt my eyes to look at it. so over the years, i've seen a few different ufos. if they are ours, the government is keeping them secret from us. if you would like to contact me, well, you have my address and e-mail address, [email removed/cms/tg]","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,  Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":54675,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.968727103809414,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03142014-0004","longitude":-85.51638055554454,"occurred":-40867140000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1394789089000,"summary":"One was shaped like a 55 gallon oil drum.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"32440","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":16616,"locationName":"Graceville, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:188174"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Aquinnah","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"While camping alone on the cliffs of gay head, aquinnah, martha's vineyard, massachusetts i made this observation.  it waa bill clinton's birthday, as mine was the day before, so i guess we were both celebrating on the island...My accommodations were a bit more primitive than his i'd guess.  to save money i drove my motorcycle to a secluded spot on gay head cliff, looking out to no man's island, an uninhabited island that had been used by the military for bombing practice, about a mile off shore. it was very dark, but a nice starry night.  i had passed clinton's motorcade earlier that day and was just enjoying the solitude and peace of that beautiful island.  the beach front lay before me at the bottom of the cliff; a clothing optional beach, very famous, was nearby and got extensive use on sunny summer days.  the president had done a book signing that day in vineyard haven and may have been coming back from the beach when i saw his motorcade.  it was late,about 1am,  when i finally settled down, as i wanted to be as inconspicuous as possible; camping was illegal there. i  had only a sleeping bag, which was enough for that nice weather.  as i was looking out over the cliff to the sw i saw a fishing boat way off, a dragger, with all its very bright lights on, not moving so it seemed.  suddenly, to the right of the boat appeared a large, spinning, pinwheel kind of light, with reds, oranges, and yellows going round and round, going clockwise.  it was just at the ocean surface and not far from the boat..I thought, those guys on the boat have to be looking at this light.  it was kind of freaky watching, trying to figure out what it could be.  it was not related to the boat at all.  i watched it stay steady for about ten minutes when all of a sudden it just went out, like someone pulled a light switch...Just gone.  the boat was still in the same spot.  i wondered whether it was still there with its light out or moving in the darkness with out lights.  i kept watching but never saw the light again..I didn't sleep much that night, wondering if it might find me there alone, miles from the nearest habitation. just a weird and lucky observation for me.  i wonder what the boat crew thought.  i'd say the pinwheel was almost the size of the ship and that they were very near each other, relative to my position.  was it observing the boat?  i don't know.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":54674,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.3352369,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03142014-0003","longitude":-70.8007864,"occurred":872064900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1394788388000,"summary":"Large, rotating, orange-red pinwheel type circle on ocean surface","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":6050,"locationName":"Aquinnah, Massachusetts","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:188175"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82751,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1127}
