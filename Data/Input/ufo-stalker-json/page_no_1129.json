stargazing with wife. first noticed bright light on southern horizon that split into two lights. for over three hours we watched lights of varying intensity come into the area from the southeast to the south. none of them landed. some seemed like they were combining. at one point there were five in a row, then three of them repositioned into a triangle shape. some would grow very bright, then dim out or fade away entirely. when aircraft would come into the area, they would all fade out. after aircraft left, they would turn back on. hard to say how many me and my wife saw. if each time would one appear it was new craft, then we saw dozens. i am certain many of them were the same craft however. i feel as though we probably saw a dozen different ones, however the most that were visible at once were five, but it looked as though a sixth very dim one was there as well. was able to see them through both a telescope, and binoculars. most of them were bright orb shapes, one appeared to be a diamond. even as we left for the evening, one was still on the horizon cycling between dim and intense. more intense then anything else in the sky except the moon. they did not have aircraft lights, and they did not blink. at multiple times during this, we could hear a very strange pulse or thump. it was off and on and was varying in loudness. hard to tell where it was coming from. not sure if it came from the objects because they were a few miles away at least. i would like also to state that i was able to keep one right in my telescope for maybe around five minutes. anyone who has ever used a telescope can agree that when looking at a star or planet, you have to track it slowly due to the rotation of the earth.

ahead at the intersection of ministerial road (rt. 110) and old post rd, in the perryville section of south kingstown, ri, i saw a large (maybe 15 ft. across), round, off-white light hovering above a telephone pole (power transformer attached to pole).  my immediate thought was 'that's not suppose to be there.'  i slowed down as i approached the intersection from the nw (post rd north) and stopped at the four-way stop sign, keeping my eyes on the light. there were no other cars on the road at that time; night was clear with stars and cool.  i was fixated on the light as i crossed the intersection and stopped my car below the large light, trying to make out the shape of the craft, which i thought was either triangle or chevron shaped. i was a dense, dark object with only the lights prominent.  there was no noise whatsoever as the craft just floated perfectly still above the pole. i then noticed a small 'electric green' flashing light, like a neon light, and a beautiful green color,  at what i would call the rear of the craft. i estimated that the craft was about 30 ft. to 50 ft. in length. there were two homes on either side of the road where i stopped (noticed no one inside) and an automotive garage (scott's automotive) which is usually open nights 'till 11pm,next to the house across from the pole. i got out of my car, keeping my door open in case i needed to beat a hasty retreat for any reason, while i observed in fascination this craft.  at that moment a car came out from a small dirt road/driveway next to scott's automotive and i thought it would stop...Instead, it accelerated past me and blew through the stop sign heading north on old post rd...The driver must have seen the craft i was looking at and in fear sped away.  i was alone again at that point, and as i watched the craft in slowly and ever-so smoothly pivoted, rose up a bit, and slowly drifted off across ministerial rd, heading nw, over a hill and toward the town of wakefield.  at that point i had this strange sensation that time was slowing down, even as i got back in my car to head home nearby.  i called the south kingstown police to report this incident as i drove.  the female dispatcher took my call seriously and said no other calls had come in related to it at that point.\r\nas i drove away from the spot the feeling of slow time seemed to go away.\r\ni was too fascinated to be scared of what i saw but never felt threatened by the craft at all...Just felt lucky to have such a fascinating observation.","distance":"101-500

started talking about ufo' s i got brave and told her this, i use to remember the year and what city and i know i knew this, but pieces have faded almost like plucked out of my memory, i don't have a clue where i was i do know it was between 2002 and 2010 it feels most possible when i lived  in nv. jan 2004 i move there and moved away in jan 2010. i use to remember more detail stuff but it's like it was wiped out of my memory, so sometimes i think i was dreaming, but i'm pretty darn sure i wasn't. no memory of waking up after siting i was just there where ever i lived my apt. so all i remember now is many many humans outside just outside, on the side walks in the streets, on the grass. hearing like a low buzzy humming sound not loud at all, many colors of lights white red blue yellow bright lights, and this i feel was mother ship because i remember it was massive huge, i'd say easily 10 football fields or more, and a voice speaking  like there were speakers u could hear e voice well, i have know idea what was said, not any more i use to, plucked out of my memory. i just remember not good, that's only way i can explain it, bad things said to all people on ground, this ship was like right there over our heads, i'd say no more then a couple hundred yards above and i remember maybe a mile  or so straight ahead were many no actual amount i remember of small ufo's triangle shape disc shape darker color possible grayish white or bright lights just in front as they were flying towards use don't remember seeing this smaller ones close up, i don't remember any more of ship leaving plucked out of memory, it's creepy because i know i use to know a lot more of this siting and it's vanished from my memory, extremely real feelings not a dream feeling, i knew what it was everyone did  i remember feeling scared to death, i wish i could remember the bad, not good feelings of what the voice said and what is so bad in what we heard. i've reckelected  this thing siting i guess i would call it, 5 or 6 times, last time before today was less then a week but was blank as i am right now, so i just forgot about it. when i was living in nv. my hair started thinning a lot almost like small bald patches right on top up front on my head, since i moved back to ca. in 2010 it's not thin anymore. i also use to get these little small almost like paper cuts on my fingers all the time, they be sore red and sometimes i would squeeze and clear liquid would come out, i put hydrogen peroxide on all the time so i wouldn't get infected, and just like my memory so faded about siting same goes for a so familiar feeling that i woke up all twisted up in bed at least once since then, i am not a mover when i sleep, i always wake up the same way as i feel asleep. this is hard to write about i can't explain it creepy feeling knowing memories then what i just knew what i was thinking then it's washed away no reckalishion of many things from that siting, that i know i use to know, i'm thinking maybe no more then 2 years ago that i remembered everything, it was within a year of moving back to ca. that i had good reckalision of that siting. july 2013 i bought a new mini apple ipad never any real issues, no viruses apples don't get viruses  anyway but since about 1030 am this morning, 3-12-14 after i told my friend and we went online to see some ufo info spots, this ipad is acting weird, i was filling out your questioner i tap the boxes and it wouldn't check mark the yes and no boxes very easily, and typing this letter the letters and spacing bar keeps hesitating as well as back spacing. also i have some esp i believe we all kind of do, it use to be quite often, i new for a fact i was going to win a prize at my kids school function  and i made it loud and clear many people heard me  say i was going to win. i also had a preminission   i was awake and later that day i saw this happened on news in my head a child in a school bus who got killed bad accident ,  now i \r\nhardely ever have esp or preminissions they diminished within the last 5 to 8 yrs. i am curious if any other persons have had sort of the same forgetful bad feeling siting? i don't remember being abducted i don't feel like any objects are under skin, i did have a lot of pelvic inflammatory infections when i was in my mid to late 20, but my husband was a cheater.   i was leary about writing this due to poor memory of all, but very curious to see if any one else ever experienced something similar. i'm curious also to see if my ipad stops hesitating when i log out of yr site, i do believe in ufo 's no one can be that ignorant to think in the massive university there isn't some other sort of life, and with ancient egypt and drawings it shows the technology was so far anvanced of these ufo's so many yrs ago, they must really be more advanced  now. anyway i hope you don't think i'm a crack pop, i hope to hear of some similar sites as i have.  i believe i had another  siting very quick in february to april was month 2010 i just moved back to ca. at my moms trailer in highland ca. on baseline st. it was 10 or 11 pm ish super clear night  i was smoking cigarette out side looking way up in sky saw light. from quit a distance and very high but i never saw anything move across the skies that fast before i knew it it was directly straight above me but still quite a distance, then this light was gone completely i kept watching never saw again, no clouds nothing just like it went right into a hole in the sky, no trails no speeding up descending, just gone that quick. well thank you for your time. robbin","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),  Appendage(s),  Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

from my cousin. he was frantic and told me to hurry up and go outside. i advised him that i was already outside. he told me to look up north east towards the moon. he stated that there was at least 40 objects in the sky. i took my daughter out of the swing and proceeded out from under the tree. i stayed on the phone with him, and to my amazement i spotted one object nw of the position of the moon. as i looked more to the left of the moon i saw a group of them. there was at least 30 of them. mind you this is not my first encounter. i have been interested in the ufo phenom for some time now. its very exciting. that being said, when i first saw the group of them it gave me a sort of feeling of anxiety. i have had sightings in the past, but the amount of objects in the sky at the time was almost overwhelming. as i watched in amazement, the objects worked together to form what looked like a peace sign, a square, and a circle. i noticed that no one found it strange that i had a child in my hand talking frantically and pointing at the sky. so i walked over to a family having a bbq and asked them if they wanted to see something cool. i never said what i was pointing to. i allowed them to see it on their own. at first they thought it was balloons, but they also witnessed the weird formations. i was about two blocks from where my cousin who called me was. so i hopped in my car and drove over to the house. there was my 2 uncles, about 3 neighbors, and my elderly grandmother. we have these ufo conversations all the time so everyone was extremely excited. when i got there the amount of objects probably reduced to about 10. but that was not even close to the end. we stayed out there for about 2-3 hours. it seemed as though all we had to do was scan the sky and we could spot one. there was one in particular that came closer than all the others. his size was double what the others were. i'm guessing because of the close proximity. it seemed as though he knew we could see him, and was saying hello. that could be complete b/s but that is how it made me feel. and thennnnnn!!!!!! lol like out of some sci-fy movie, leaves fell from the sky, in all directions. no wind, and the leaves were coming from at least 100 feet above the tree lines. and it was all directions. we all looked at each other like what the heck is going on !!!! and then i looked up and saw about three birds acting kind of strange, as i pointed them out i looked to the right of them and noticed about 30-40 birds, flying in a circle, at about 1000 feet or more, in a frenzy like manner. then they started to leave the circle. 2 at a time in a synchronized manner. we sat in the driveway indian style for about another hour after the bird event. these objects were everywhere in all directions, coming and going, hovering, doing circles repetitively. the last one we spotted went over our head and back in the direction where it all started nw of the position of the moon. and that was that. truly and amazing experience. im not sitting here saying there were aliens controlling them. i dont know what they were! i saw what i saw. i don't care if anyone believes what i am saying. i don't even talk to most people about this subject because it is outside of most people's comfort zone. all i can say is look up every once in a while.

could  get a look at the sunset, and there it was. i immeaditally pulled the car in the only space left in a drive way,and  immeaditally  me and my daughter got out and we watched this beautiful

kelleher rd. it was a very bright white light like l.E.D. huge, big as a full moon appears when its fulll at like 10-15 degrees above horizon.  biggest and brightest thing ive ever seen in sky, have had 4 other sightings 2 with witnesses but this was much bigger. as i looked at it i tried to rationalize what i was seeing, maybe a helicopter with a new super bright searchlight of some kind? but no movement or flashing lights.. only saw it for about 30-45 sec.B4 i was going up bowhill and the object was out of sight. turned off at the next exit (bow hill) and drove south down hwy 99 till i got back to the flats so i could get another look at it. as i drove past where kelleher and 99 meet i noticed 2 parked police suvs door to door with no lights on and no one around outside of them . drove south on 99 bout another half mile to a bridge over the rail road tracks turned around and didnt see the object or anything in the area anymore, when i passed by kelleher rd again 2 police suv's were still there and with my headlights shinning on them this time i could see no one was in the vehicles. thought that was strange considering what i had seen and the proximity of the vehicles to the sighting location.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

taping it with my phone - as the orb got closer the screen got blurred with blue staic and the phone shut off. i turned it back on and got pictures .Again it happened several times in january with a burst of ufos coming in around jan 7th through 10th  these ones looked different and have a horrible energy. they started harrasing me and my dogs. one night i came home and the dog.Were terrified shaking like they had been scared to death. it was very late and there was no where to so i parked in a grocery parking lot to wait for dawn. at 4;30 am two lights orbs approached and i put my camera phone and and reversed the frame so i could take pictures of what was in the back window. one very large nasty evil thing appeared in the back window of the truck with a little bug like thing about next to it. the pictures are taken in my truck and my dog islooking at the little bug thing out the rear window- the bug thing is hovering on my tool box in the bed of the truck.It then shot a beam dog. \r\n on march 10 at a friends house in san gabriel  we both saw a craft steadly flash and hover. i was hit with a burst of energy from looking at it that knocked me off my feet and made ill.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was lying in bed around 10pm when i saw the star like object hovering above tree line south of my house. it would have these white lights that would shoot out of it really fast. it was not constant but did it off and on for around 30 min. my fianc��� called to say she was on her way over to my house when i told her she was missing one hell of a light show. she came over and looked at the object from my bedroom (french doors) facing the south, and said it looked like a bright star. it stopped shooting things (these bright lights out of it really fast) after she got there. after around 30 minutes she saw it shoot 2 of these fast lights or objects from it. she layed there watching it to see if it was going to fly away or disappear for approx an hour and a half and then she fell asleep. it wasn't there the next morning. we don't know what these white lights or objects are that it was emitting but they were shooting out of the star like object super fast. you couldn't see any type of shape. the object was hovering near a barn that had a security light, water, electric and a pond that was north between the object and my house. it was larger than the security light and above the trees. it just look like a super bright star and larger than a normal light on a security pole.\r\nthe streaks of light we have captured on the game cameras are going super fast and we have wondered if the streaks of light that this ufo was omitting is related to what we catch on the game cameras on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nwe have also been ask to report the orb we witnessed in oct. my fianc��� had purchased a new pickup that had a lot of new gadgets on it and that night we were parked in front of my house and were trying to figure out what all the pickups options were and how they worked. i punched the bed light to show her how it worked and how well it lit up the pickup bed then i punched the pickup bed camera to show her how it worked when we both saw this floating round object kind of bouncing around in the bed of the pickup. it was light and round and i'd guess it to be smaller in size than a soccer ball. it bounced around then went up and out of the pickup bed and was gone from sight. we both were stunned and shocked at this. if i need to report this on a separate report i can.\r\n\r\ni also think you wanted me to report the time i was working in my shop and i saw a flash of light outside my shop window. i didn't think it was supposed to storm and thought it was a lighting flash so i stuck my head out the door near the winnow to look and see if there was a storm coming up and two steaks of light zoomed by me. they were going to fast i couldn't make out any form or shape to them. they were again, white streaks of light going extremely fast.\r\n\r\nthanks and maybe someday we will know what it going on and what these things are.  we don't have a picture of these or the ufo (star like appearance ) that was emitting fast streaks of light. i have a lot of pictures of other very weird streaks of light my game camera has caught as well as many fog like things. i'll attach more pic's of things that were on last weeks sd card (in game camera) that i have mounted on my front porch.\r\nthe unknown objects in the sky you have to enlarge a lot to see. the one that shows something in the trees i noticed by looking through several pictures and noticed something different when flipping through the pics fast. it is a darker spot between some tree limbs. i'll send the two pics again so you can look at one then the next and maybe you can see what i'm talking about.","distance":"101-500
