woke up and went to the kitchen downstairs to drink some water, i checked the time on my microwave's clock when it was 5:07 am. i looked at the stars for few minutes as i always do. the sky was clear and i still could see the stars, even with my neighbors' outside light on. suddenly (around 5:10 am) i noticed something skinny and long moving towards my direction from e to w which i thought was a big bird, maybe a canadian goose for the size. however, the movement pattern didn't look like flapping wings, so i thought it was struggling with the wind. as it got closer i realized it was a solid ruler shaped object. it was spinning slowly enough that i could identify its shape. it was non-reflective and had no lights. i am not quite sure about the color, but it could be something between dull white or light grey. it lasted 20 seconds or so, but after making a sharp right turn it sped up to the same direction it came and disappeared when it was about at the same spot it first appeared. it made me think of a huge boomerang, not in shape but in trajectory. i kept looking the sky for few more minutes in hopes of seeing it again but the only thing a noticed was a satellite going west. unfortunately i didn't have my phone with me when that happened. i think it was clear enough to be recorded on camera.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:22","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

but it was visible out the tent flap until i did. it was nevertheless gone the next morning. i first caught sight of it out of the tent flap when i had woken in the morning of the day that i saw it all day long. after seeing the object, i eventually wrote a large web site which mentioned some of the information which i had been enabled to learn. i learned additional information; but i have only mentioned the additional info to a few people. i am now 78 and in poor health, so i would like to mention the additional info to someone before i cease to live; but i am now unable to make an additional website. so would mufon like to become a repository for the additional info, which was given to me piece-meal?","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"12:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":87643,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.173747,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10282017-0015","longitude":-115.1385379,"occurred":600760800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nevada","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1509198411000,"summary":"Inverted double-decked lens cloud, 12 x 3 miles, hovered over valley all day although other clouds passed over it.","tags":["ufo","entity"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":1509289643361,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":-25399.75,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":-55573,"maxtempi":-99999,"maxvism":null,"maxvisi":null,"meantempm":-55573,"meantempi":-99999,"meanvism":null,"meanvisi":null,"mintempm":-55573,"mintempi":-99999,"minvism":null,"minvisi":null,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":-9999.9,"snowfallm":-25399.75,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":-25399.75,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":-55573,"maxtempi":-99999,"maxvism":null,"maxvisi":null,"meantempm":-55573,"meantempi":-99999,"meanvism":null,"meanvisi":null,"mintempm":-55573,"mintempi":-99999,"minvism":null,"minvisi":null,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":-9999.9,"snowfallm":-25399.75,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":10514,"locationName":"Las Vegas, Nevada","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:13157"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"San Francisco","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was in the backyard area of my apt complex in san francisco late (1:30am) admiring the clear skies and the constellation orion, sirius, polaris and the pleiades;

fenton city park, which is open until 11pm. there were 2 things that were odd about this sighting, one of the off-putting occurances we didn't even put together until later after we were both home. we arrived at the park and began our walk around 9:10-9:15pm, we walk this trail very often and it normally takes us around a half-hour, give or take a few minutes. we were having a conversation when we noticed something coming over the dense treeline (the part of the trail we were on at the time is surrounded by trees), i would guess that whatever we saw was a few hundred feet in front of us and about the height of 2 to 2 and a half trees as it came over the trail. what we first noticed was the lights because it was so dark out that night, there were three of them and the best color i can describe them to would be the green you see on old fashioned christmas lights, only much dimmer. the lights were not bright at all and seemed a bit hazy. we could not see any other things which may have been on it but we could see the outline of its shape and the shadow of it under the slight amount of moonlight at the time. the outline looked completely black and we could not see any specific colors. initially, we thought this was an odd drone but that got dismissed because it made no noise like a drone, and it was very elongated and narrow and did not appear to have any wings. it flew over the trees and trail until we could no longer see it behind the trees. it was approximately the length of 2 cars. i would guess it was moving at around 20mph but that is very difficult to guess accurately. we just stopped and watched it as it passed in front of us and seemed to get caught in the moment. my phone shut off and restarted and i was unable to get a video or picture. we guestimate this happened around 10:12 because when we got back to the car the time was 10:22 and from the point in the trail we were it takes about 10 minutes to get back to the lot we were parked in. my friend also noticed her watch was no longer working when she got home. when i discussed this with someone when i got home they convinced me this was not a drone like we hoped it was, mostly because of the shape and its lack of noise. oddly, when my friend and i were putting the timeline together later that night we discovered there is about 23 to 30 minutes were are unable to account for and have since gone back to retrace our steps, and still cannot account for those minutes in time loss. i was told to report our sighting the night it happened but was afraid to come forward with it, until some showed me someone else saw it too. it was a desolate night and we had only passed 2 men at the beginning of our walk.","distance":"101-500

become bigger and bigger and after some seconds started smaller and smaller and finally fainted. after some seconds i saw again that some two or three strange lights suddenly appeared in the sky and keep going to the same direction of that big light. after this i saw a strange light brighter than any star appeared in the north sky in cloudy day. sometimes it went upper to the cloud and sometimes it comes down to the cloud. many events more but i can't say everything about that. i was scared in that time. but finally i realized that they don't have any intention to harm me but they are

i couldn't believe the size of this thing. it's incredibly difficult to say how high or far away it was but i'd say it was over a mile away from where i was. i'd probably say it was around 10,000 feet high. i judged the size by the lights, and the lights to me showed it's wingspan. i recorded it on my phone, but i couldn't capture a good enough image of what i was seeing because of my phone camera quality. i couldn't even see the lights on the video i recorded so i deemed it as useless. my girlfriend and i witnessed it for around 3 minutes. we lost sight of it because it went behind the trees, we moved to try look at it but it had gone by the time we got into a better position.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":87627,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":53.5538169,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-10272017-0030","longitude":-0.0731365,"occurred":1496529000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"England","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1509143728000,"summary":"3 bright white lights in a straight line, equal distance apart, getting brighter and dimmer at the same time moving through the sky","tags":["photo","video","ufo","lights"],"timeZone":"Europe/London","timeZoneName":"Europe/London","tweeted":1509289638805,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":" DN32 8PY","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":146,"locationName":"Grimsby, England","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:13173"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Ouray","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My daughter and i were in our backyard looking at the stars and watching two contrails, lit up by moonlight,from recent airliners passing overhead. we live in a town that is at about 8000 feet in elevation surrounded, closely, by mountains. \r\n\r\nwhen my daughter and i were noting how fast the two contrails passed overhead we both saw a flash of light to the southwest at about 45 degrees up in the sky. the flash did not have a streak like a meteorite would make and was white in color, like a star. we both exclaimed at the same time about the light. then i saw about 3-4, maybe 5, more flashes like the first slightly more to the south. these other flashes were like the first, but not quite as bright. my daughter stated that she also saw some of these flashes.\r\n\r\nshortly after, my daughter and i saw sequential flashing lights to the north from what i assume to be some sort of craft, however, these lights appeared out of nowhere and then disappeared about 10 seconds later.\r\n\r\nwe do have a few trees in our yard that do, occasionally, make me think i see stars blot out, but these lights were not where the trees would be at all.\r\n\r\ni have seen other \"ufo's\" that i can't quite explain and ended up telling my daughter that she may have just seen her first ufo. i am at a loss as to what these were. the flashes almost made me think they were meteorites, but the lack of a \"streak\" makes me think otherwise.

should that be deemed necessary.\r\n\r\nso, i wanted to come forward now and report an experience i witnessed back in the (approximate) late summer of 1996/7. while walking along the beach at ardnadam / lazaretto point one late afternoon, i observed a glistening aeroplane fuselage in a typical position and not uncommon altitude in the sky, from what i could assertain would perhaps approximate around 1,000 feet above the top of the highest point of the adjacent hill top, not an entirely unfamiliar sight at least, that's what i initially thought it was on this, a perfectly clear virtually cloud-less sunny day but the events that unfolded over the following minutes however, changed that entirely. i somewhat surprisingly noticed firstly there was a distinct lack of any vapour-trail or notable trace of direction of travel as it moved very slowly on a direct course upon realizing this merited closer examination i immediately determined the colours were unlike any other metallic surface or similarily shaped structure usually associated with every day commercial aircrafts as this was gleaming with the super-reflectiveness of light on glass or a mirrored surface, there was an almost translucenct hue to the body. colours which i observed i would have to say still don't currently exist and i've still yet to see replicated. i'd almost compare it to something which is alive, something resembling the scales you'd find on a champagne coloured comet goldfish under the light of a incandescent bulb. it's appearance was that of an exceptionally highly polished chromium, copper, brass, gold and/or platinum, a multitude type of contrasts to these, are the closest assimilation i can express as a visual representation, it was all of those in one shape, so obvioulsy not a 'generic' aircraft fuselage paint you'd commonly find, i'd seen those many times and this was nothing compatible. neither was it at this point any type of helicopter as there was no kind of rotor blade noise vibration detectable. this situation was heightened when all of a sudden this object just stopped dead in place and hovered as though it co-incided with having an awareness of me noticing it. i could still make out the light cascading off the surface from the sunshine in sequences of reflective rays along the bodywork as it hung there, it remained silently motionless for a few moments, possibly a full minute or slightly more before accelarating directly upwards and in doing so, the shadows changed from my observational perspective, meaning this object had a difinitive shape to it with a distinguishable form akin to holding a plate overhead and i was clearly able to distinguish colour darkening and changing as shading and shadows were cast around the underside peripherary edge with a lower-hanging slight 'domed' external form to it becoming visible and as it climbed above all base cloud level and any reflected light from the earths surface below, continued far up into the stratosphere - where if i hadn't been focusing on it from my initial viewpoint at that moment in time, it's possible i wouldn't have noticed it all, then with a deliberate and controlled graceful long high-arching curvature shot off at a speed far beyond anything i could attempt to associate it to. having an almost animated or 'cartoonish' quality to it and just like that, it was completely gone in well under a couple of seconds, thousands of miles away in an instant with no visible trace of it previously even being there at all. the memory will always live with me i wasn't concerned, quite the contrary, i felt exceptionally lucky, it was a memory i cherish and it had such a profound effect on me that i am able to recall with such clarity over 20 years later. i was the only one present there and i don't recall even hearing a single vehicle during the entire time. i returned home and recanted the story to my parents and really didn't think much else of it, that was until the local paper reported others witnessing identical happenings in the local police reports column that week. (that may be worth pursuing for research purposes as records with both the police and the local paper should still exist and be relatively easily traceable and it may well serve to substantiate my account but obviously i'll leave that to your discretion) what's most intreguing here is that this occurred directly over a former site the us navy occupied from the late 1960's to the late 1990's - this took place merely a few weeks after their departure from the region. i wondered if there could be a correlation as just a random coincidence didn't seem likely given the definitive synchronicity and timeframe of this particular encounter.\r\n\r\nas to why i didn't come forward sooner, many reasons. having both the time to dedicate and consciously deciding to actually attempt recounting everything from memory and compile it in a coherent way hasn't necessarily been afforded to me as well as the fact this record is highly personal to me and i haven't felt like i wanted or maybe wasn't ready to disclose it at all, until now. i have also moved around considerably over the years and most importantly when this encounter took place it was long before the age of mobile phones or phones with camera's, even the advent of the age of the internet for that matter. i obviously didn't have anything with me at the time (and believe me, i still rue the day for not having anything with me) but it was intended to be nothing more than another leisurely walk along the shore to me, i couldn't ever have imagined it would have involved a quantifiably life-altering experience at that particular moment. i also only recently learned of mufon's existence and thought now may be the opportune time to reach out and report this in an 'in-depth' style and pass this on to you. i understand a considerable time has passed but i still feel what occurred that day holds a definitive certifiable validity. \r\nit may be worth mentioning, apprently that particular area has accounts of activity prior to my testimony. there is i believe even still to this day, a video uploaded on you tube of an event during the night recorded by some visitors to the town some years back.\r\n\r\ndue to the sensitivity of my position working here within the state department, i'd kindly request that any and all contact be handled discreetly. i'd be more than willing to follow up with any other information as per your request. should the need arise for any interviews face to face, i'm sure accomodations could be mutually arranged within a convenient neutral environment. -\r\nmany thanks for listening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:06:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":87620,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":null,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-10272017-0025","longitude":null,"occurred":871171200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":null,"reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Saturn-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1509136246000,"summary":"Observed an airborne object and witnessed it manouvering at super speed","tags":["video","ufo","disc","light","contact"],"timeZone":"Europe/London","timeZoneName":"Europe/London","tweeted":1509289356371,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/87620_submitter_file1__mufonII.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"pa 23 -

look like a ___. saw it on monday this week and again twice yesterday; all 3 times in my back yard and what i thought they were balloons, couldn't see any strings attached to them and both times they seem to appear out of nowhere. 1st time yesterday around 11am i was filming a plane in the distance and a floating sliver/grey/shiny orb floats down from some power lines. first thought is 'ok, those are balloons..Oh no it's not...\" got up a ladder and kept filming, all the while with a deep fear that i've seen it, again. a balloon wouldn't change directions and go up and down. then the 2nd time it was floating off to my right under some power lines and i again thought 'ok, now those are balloons!!...' but again they weren't! it passed right in front of me and then continued along to the left. i took some video of it. please tell me these are balloons...Sorry for the cursing in the video!","distance":"101-500
