opened my eyes and there was an image, about 2'x3' on the wall in front of me.  it was obviously bamboo trunks and leaves.  the image faded to black in about 3 seconds.  this has happened before with other images, like forest scenes.  these wake-up calls are usually accompanied by craft being sited outside my window.  this time my blinds were open.  i rolled over and there was a very large star-like object (as big or larger than venus or jupiter.)  every amateur astronomer with even a 70 power scope knows how fast the moon and stars are moving up there.  you have to keep adjusting your telescope constantly or the object drifts right out of our field of view in a few seconds.  knowing this, i positioned my view so that the bright object was against the window frame and waited.  the object did not move for 10 minutes.  after that, the angle started to increase from 45��� to about 50��� which was the opposite direction from the moon (which was visible and which decreased its angle during the time the bright object was both stationary and moving in a retrograde motion from earth's rotation.)  \r\n     i determined then to get my nikon d7100 camera and do a telephoto long exposure shot, sort of thinking aloud, \"if you don't want me to photograph you, you can leave before i get back with the camera.\"  it did not leave.  i held the camera against the glass and window frame and took the shot.  the camera automatically did  a 2 or 3 second exposure.  i will attempt to upload the full resolution photo.  it appears to have captured some detail, not just a sparkle as would be the case with venus or jupiter since i only have a 200mm optical telephoto zoom on the camera.  i have had more than 20 sightings since the first during the phoenix lights flap.  this is the first time i have ever attempted to take a picture of any of them.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

float gently across the sky. i see a cluster of 5 small clouds. i estimate that they were 10-20 miles north. after going for a drive in that direction a little later, the clouds were really 50-100 miles away. to the right of the clouds i see a tiny white dot. it looks like a silver mylar balloon. it's stationary. the clouds are moving. the dot begins to move, a little slower, but in the same direction. it becomes stationary again. once again, it begins to move, but this time, it keeps up with the clouds. then, it's stationary again. it begins to move again, but in the opposite direction of the clouds. once the clouds have passed the area of the dot, the dot is gone. the odd part was, sometimes you see the dot. sometimes you didn't. it was behind the clouds.\r\n\r\nit could have been a mylar balloon, but not likely because it was 100+ miles away. i couldn't see that. it could have been a star, but stars don't move in different directions and it would have been visible for more than 5 minutes. it could have been the sun reflecting off a plane, but it was too far and eventually, a plane would have traveled in one direction. \r\n\r\nthis is the 2nd time in less than a year i have seen something in the sky that i could not explain. both times, the objects were way to high to be planes and for me to actually see them if they were planes. i have seen 3 planes since seeing the dot and they are much lower, but you could clearly see they were planes. what ever it was, it was over 100 miles away and i could still see it. it must have been huge.....As was the last one.\r\n\r\nafter seeing the first one, i checked the internet to see if anyone else saw what i did. someone did. today i checked and another california resident reported seeing a large white dot in

merged with the big shape. there were snaps of all different colors coming from this thing, mainly from the outer edges. no pattern, just all over, haphazard like. it shot to the right about 2 hand widths. wiggled left to right and back for a bit, then the far side of it seemed to raise up, a black arrow shape appeared toward the center, it flashed brightly once, the next flash, it vanished, or took off! i thought about thisfor a long time. all i could figure out is it may have been meteoric powder( iron or rock?) heated, polarized, drew together, and took off toward it's strongest pull from the earth. the whole thing lasted 2 minutes tops. cool though!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then

night, march 3 at about 9:35 pm as i was sitting in front of my desk in my workshop, i glanced out the window and saw a very bright light approaching in the sky. leaving near the airport, this is very common of course. what was different this time though was in the brightness of the object and the complete lack of any flashing lights such as what would be seen on an airplane. \r\nit appeared to be somewhat round in shape though it was more of a bright, roundish blur so no solid shape was discernible. colour was a bright orange/ red, more on the orange side.\r\ni watched it as it approached, coming in from north/ northwest and appearing brighter and larger as it came. as it started to go over the roof, i quickly jumped up and ran outside and behind the shop, expecting the object to be veering towards the airport. i then saw it further to the east than i expected and observed a sudden change of direction further to the east. not a gradual banked turn such as an airplane would make, this was more of an instant change in direction. it did this twice, just seconds apart. now heading directly away from me to the east, the bright object then faded out quickly over the next few seconds. total time since i first saw it coming to when it was gone from site was roughly 1 and a half to 2 minutes. the entire time there were no flashing lights and it did not make any sound at all. \r\nat its brightest, from where i was first observing it from the workshop, the brightness was comparable to a full moon on a clear night. it was far larger in the sky than any star, planet or space station would appear. our local astronomer also confirmed that it could not have been the space station as the timing was off by a couple of hours.\r\nwhat was it? i have no idea. it certainly did not behave like any aircraft i have ever seen.  one other person also contacted me and described the object to me and the description matched with what i saw. and i had not yet described just what i had seen. he also is from an entirely different part of town than i am.  \r\n\r\nin the following days, i have had 2 friends tell me they have had similar sightings in the area over the last year or so, including up to 1 of these objects flying in apparent formation.

the front too, but i smoke out back... this time my mom saw it too!!! she just happened to be saying goodnight, and telling me she was going up to bed, so i told her to look up at a different light which was moving very strangely as a small plane approached what looked like merely a few feet from that light thing, then as soon as the plane was past that strange light which mostly seemed to be hovering still again at this point.  so my mom stood there for a moment to see that, then all the sudden at about the exact second we both noticed to the far left of the strange light i had pointed out, a very close very low orange to sort of red egg shaped or orb like light.  we both kind of say look at that one, i asked mom where did that come from, it weren't there a second ago, and she agreed, and i, not thinking pointed at it.  so then it very slowly came right at me, it changed altitude a few times, at this point i was kinda freaking out.  i was scared so, i moved away from mom and asked her to stay at the back door step area, she wanted me to come on in, but i needed to see it.  i also felt the need to sign to it that i saw it, and i knew what it was, i really didn't mean to lie to it though, i have no stinking idea what it was, and now i am scared, i keep seeing these lights up there, all around, but never this close.  why did i point at the thing?  and then signal to it like that?  our little jack russel dog was also very scared.  this was just tonight, it was just a little while ago, i would love to know if anyone else in this area seen that!  there is something very scary happening around here!  i always thought when the other lights are/were up further in the sky that they were more of a perfect circle, some being a triangular shape, but this one has me wondering, as it seemed perfectly round when we first saw it, but then it got so close and just above me and i noticed it was an egg shape more than a circle. what was that?  should i be worried?  i am a believer in jesus christ, and while i do mess up, like lying in a moment of fear to a unknown glowing flying object, telling it i know what it is when i really don't know at all; i tell you that my lord and savior knows that what i am telling you i just saw, and my mom just saw as well, is exactly as i just described it.  i need answers more than ever before.  i intend to try to catch these things on my cheap cell phone cam and learn how to send them to this form or youtube.  however when i try to cam the lights in the sky they wont show up, i am new to all this, but i now need to know, and want video or pics to show anyone else who would be able to tell me what it is!
