decided to grab some gravel and throw stones at it cause i felt threatened. as soon as i lifted my arm to throw the rocks the craft shut it lights off and very slowly turned to the left. the road was curving to the right and then straightened. after turning left it started fly down the road but never changing altitude until about 1/4 mile down the road it accelerated at such high speed almost a blink of an eye kind of speed and it was heading north at a 45 degree angle. no exhaust was left behind and it made no sound when it accelerated. changed my life and i never seen anything like it

also looked like the craft was spinning two gig lights on the end to one on the end with 5 or 6 smaller tailing. i could sort of make out the shape of the craft with the design of the lights it sort

beautiful golden yellow orbs were balloons floating toward me but instantly realized they were not as they were almost perfectly single file. i jumped up and stood next to the corner of my house next to a bunch of computer discs, an air foil that made flashes like mirrors. i counted them as they came 13 of them, the leader came so close i think i could have hit it with a rock when all of a sudden they must have finally sensed me they broke formation and headed south a perfect 90deg turn. i ran to get my old sony camera it only took a minute but by then they were white glowing dots in the sky. i felt cheated that i didn't get pictures of the beautiful golden yellow orbs, then as i stood there staring after i see more movement directly the east again! here came a massive orb like the sun i was stunned and then i see a tiny classic saucer shape hiding slightly behind it, it came to about 1/4 mile away and hovered, i was so shocked i forgot the camera,,,,,,,,,,then i done something i regret doing, verbally i said who are you friend or foe? then holding my hands out i asked do you want to be friends ? instantly i felt this searing pain in my solar plexus and upper stomach and i yelled ooooh  as i grabbed myself. instantly it/they moved south and to the west on other  side of my house and i ran  around and tooksome  pictures but they changed shape like  they were instant far from me,,,,,,,,,,two i took when close turned out blank.   i was  scarred  and felt sick, when my wife came  home i told her what happened. for 3 days i told no one for fear they brand me a teller of

her dog and neighbors dogs barked for 1/2hr continuously, they didn't know why? i called air national 4 miles away and asked about radar check, they said their was no alert but requested a  report and i also sent a report to seattle to the ufo report center  there! i swear this is all true and i still suffer chest and stomach pain occasionally to this day.","distance":"21-100

continued southward direction. there are usually planes in the area, and the object seemed to be at the normal altitude for a plane, but we carefully observed that it did not have plane-identifying lights at all. all we could see of the object was its light, which was varied red-orange in color, with a fire-like glow, but no tail or smoke. \r\nwe observed it steadily making its way to the south, neither gaining nor decreasing in speed or altitude for several minutes. i can't speak for my friends, but i was very pleased to be watching it, my first ufo sighting. when the object was very far to

northeast, absolutely silent and  without any visible engine, wings, tail or nose, it resembled a tall narrow bell jar with a plate shaped bottom.  at that point it was about 1/4 mile from me and approximately 500 feet in the air.  as the object moved over the top of the house i ran through to the front to see if the rising sun would back light the object enough to view if it was an airplane or  helicopter, or something else recognizeable, but no,   i could also see through my binoculars that there was no visible structure to it, just pure light with a , plate shaped bottom, no dark center where one would think a cockpit might  be.....Exactly the same craft/object  i witnessed on september 12th and 14th of 2012.  the sighting on the 12th involved an airforce jet from davis monthan afb in south tucson, which is about 9 miles north of where i live.   as the object went over the houses it shifted slightly to the north-north east and i continued watching through the binoculars until it disappeared out of sight due to distance. i didn't have any unnatural feelings during this sighting, i was excited to see it return and i'll be watching to see if it comes around again!  i will also keep my camera handy for photographic proof.   i will submit another report on my previous sightings in 2012.  at the time i was afraid of getting a visit from someone from the airforce.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

cream cones at the nearest town. it had just gotten dark as it does in late august. it was about 8:50-8:55 pm. no outside light had been left on as i unlocked the door to go in when i heard the sound you hear when an airplane is falling to crash. then a short whispered boom. i grabbed my parents and told them to get outside as i felt something was happening. we got outdoors and i noticed the sky turning very bright from the west just over the ridge that was about 500 feet away. suddenly it came over the ridge and we were blasted with an intensely bright light. as we diverted our eyes, we could see everything in our yard and all around, same as daylight, even under the leaf laden trees in our yard. then we noticed we were in its shadow and looked up and saw a huge ship that extended over our yard, over the road and well into the pasture out back. it was a solid dark color with no windows or  features other than the shape of the ship. it had a stealth-like shape but seemed flatter and more expanded than the stealth planes. it was moving at a walking pace and made a slight humming noise. it literally looked as though it was just over the treetops and my mom screamed saying it was going to hit the church on the west side of our yard. it well cleared the church and as my view was now blocked from seeing it, i ran around the front of the church and watched as it cruised at the same pace over the neighbors and beyond the ridge that was about 2/10's of a mile away. years later, i asked my parents if they remembered what we did afterwards. none of us did. my mom said she supposed we went to bed, but, i find that hard to believe as the excitement of it all would have kept me up most of the night. i honestly don't remember what happened afterwards.\r\n     many years later, i met a man that i started working with and one day we started talking about ufo's. he started telling me about a job he and his sister had worked at in a nearby city(45miles away)and that they would get home about 9 pm. long story short; he and his sister saw the same ufo drop out of the sky and they went to higher ground to see if they could get a better view and saw a very large ship drifting to the west with a powerful light on top beaming forward. this was the same night we saw our ufo only he was seeing it from 8 miles away. that was when i realized that from our point on the ground, it looked very close to us and later realized that it was actually much higher in the sky than we thought and that it was actually much bigger than i thought. much, much bigger.\r\n      we discreetly asked some of the neighbors if they had seen anything unusual, but no one had indicated that any event took place. we kept this information to ourselves for many years for fear of being teased, so, it wasn't common knowledge that we saw anything.\r\n      to this day, i can't understand why i don't remember what happened afterwards and also why none of us felt even the slightest bit of fear (other than my mom's concern for the church)...","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Straight-line

Sudbury","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On the evening of augast 13 2012 my girl friend and i were walking beside a lake in sudbury ontario and saw what we thought was a fire or fire ball on the far side of the lake. as we watched what we thought was a fire on the other side of the small lake ( 150 feet away or so), we noticed short and obese looking kids walking around the fire. my girl friend said they look like puffy kids or fat kids. i suggested it looked like the michelin man because of how the arms were extended out and puffy looking/short. approximately a minute or two later we noticed what we thought was a camera flash or an arc flash and the fiery sphere/ball lifted about 2 or 3 feet off the ground and turned into 2 firey balls. within a few seconds we watched as the one on the right slowly ascended into the sky on what looked like a set trajectory as it steadily ascended up and to the right in the sky until it was out of sight. immediately after the first one disappeared the second one ascended at the same trajectory almost exactly. after these two ufo's and entities were out of sight, i almost immediately said let's have a look at what's over there and see if we can find any evidence of the crafts/orbs. after some convincing my girlfriend agreed to go look with me,  however we weren't able to find anything as it was getting very dark and we weren't prepared with flash lights. so basically after a quick glance in the general area of the landing spot we decided to go home and come back in the day. so the next day i came back and looked during the day but had dificulty finding anything at all. this is where it really get's interesting/ weird. i returned the following evening to the shore line that i saw the orbs/crafts with a flash light and began a stake out of the area. wihtin minutes weird stuff started to happen i heard all kinds of strange banging in the woods behind the shoreline where i stood, and almost immediately after the banging i heard a huge splash in the water. this splash scared the hell out of me, it was very close to me, i was very scared and thought something shot a boulder in the water close to me. however upon closer examination, and after a short dash and regaining my senses as well as jolt of curiosity i decided to stay and find out what was going on. a minute or two later i spoted a long snake like creature with a big head and shiny glossy eyes. this creature was not like any snake i've ever seen and i quickly realized this creature was responsible for the loud splashes. i have never seen anything snake like cause such a loud splash, almost like a warning to get away from the area. i did become very freightened to be honest, however i couldn't help but probe this creature/serpent as i dubbed it. i began to signal this serpent with my flash light with 3 quick flashes at it, when i did this it would always come over to the shore within a few feet of me and swim/ snake by and create huge splashes. i got several good looks at it and can't relate this serpent to anything else i've ever seen. this thing could wip the water with it's tail or possibly a wing as i could not see what was causing the splash as it always happened so fast, this creature would do laps back and forth in the area that i saw the orbs/crafts landed, and it would splash around me if i tried to get close to the water or if i kept flashing my light at it, the serpent would splash and swim/snake side to side away. i noticed it never went under water it always had it's big gead out of the water, this thing had a python like head but it was no python, it was approximately 4 or 5 feet long and almost a foot thick looking at it's thickest/tallst part of its body. i saw all kinds of weird bumps and prehistoric looking features on it's body through the water, with my flash light shining on it. i watched this creature swim around for several nights as fall came too. it was very cold out in october and this serpent was still there to be found every night around 9 oclock it would come around, i could never see it during the day. now i live in northern canada/ ontario, we don't have predatory looking snakes like this, the biggest we have are small rattle snakes in parrysound/ french river ontario area. i have never spotted one myself, and any water snake i have ever seen looked nothing like this serpent/creature. i once shot small rocks at it and it was very distant after that, almost like it was intelligent and began to see me as a threat. i did try to snap photo's of this but it was too hard to gain any detail in the dark. i do swear this all to be true, i did not wish to name the lake as i do not want any harm to come to this serpent. i decided eventually to leave it alone, something told me not to speak of the event to anyone other than family. i am now coming forward with this event, in conclusion i did not see any other craft sightings in the days that followed the initial sighting, but did spot the serpent numerous times and it was bizarre. my girlfriend also came and saw it too, she can verify this story. i would also like to mention that no boats are aloud on this lake and it's essentially a safe haven for geese as their are no motor boats allowed on the lake. i would be willing to say which lake, just not on this public description.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

southbound on i-95 in lorton, virginia; i noticed three reddish-orange lights hovering in the sky. at first glance it didn't seem to be out of the ordinary, and with the area having high air traffic i almost disregarded it. but as i looked further, i could tell these were not stars due to the very bright nature, or aircraft due to it not having any of the characteristics of methodical flashing lights or consistent movement. the position of the lights in the sky was directly over the interstate, with two of the lights being level on each side of the highway and the third being slightly lower and on the left of the light on the left side of the highway. i then mention them to my girlfriend in the car, who had been driving. she said that they looked weird but didn't think its was odd. within the first couple of seconds of her looking at the lights a fourth one appeared in between the two that were positioned on the left side of the highway. at this point i became a little freaked out because lights just don't just appear in the sky and just stay there, and the light was the same color and had the same sort of vibrating/pulsating effect as the other three. the pulsating effect was weird because it wasn't a traditional flashing light where its off then on, but rather the lights was on and had a rapid dim and brighten. all four shared this same characteristic, so i assumed that they were the same things. when the fourth light appeared  its position was strange because it formed a small triangle. at this point i try to film the account on my iphone 5s but coincidentally i was out of storage and did not have space to record. soon after attempting to record it 2 of the lights that were on the left side of the highway disappeared. i can't recall how they went away, but no sort of movement was witnessed, just the lights appearing and then disappearing. all of this happened in the span of 5 minutes and about 3 miles all of which were southbound.

(strike group commander set course and speed). it was mirroring our course and speed almost exactly with no discernable difference to our own for a period of about 15 minutes. the ball then traveled very rapidly from a forward position relative to my ship to aft then changed elevation and rose vertically nearly instantly to an elevation of about 200 feet or so from my perspective. it then appeared to mirror our course and speed from that elevation and follow us. startled and perplexed i put out my cigarette and went directly to the cic (combat information center) to report what i had seen to the cic watch officer and radar operators. i told the cicwo my findings and was brushed off. i then went to the sps-49 radar operator and he had apparently had overheard my story. the petty officer on watch proceeded to show me that he had contact on the surface and air search radar that corresponded to what i had witnessed.  he also told me that same chain of events has been reported 3 other times by other individuals and had been occurring since our transit had begun 2 days prior. i do not recall if the incidents had been logged or not in the cic watch contact log. i seem to recall being told by this petty officer that they were instructed to maintain contact and observe its movements but dont bother logging it as it didn't appear hostile or of any interest. i was also told by him that the past 2 nights they had lost contact due to extreme elevation at about the same time each night. a few hours before dawn. oddly enough during the actual rimpac exercises my ship as well as every other ship in our strike group experienced strange connectivity and communication issues. an investigation was launched by the strike group commander under the premise that there was suspected probe initiated by the chinese on our entire strike group.  i later discovered that the comms and systems phenomenon the ships experienced had no explainable origin and no evidence of an attack from a foreign nation was detected.

road from the step uncle's home to a small store approx. 4 miles from his home.  we were approx. 1 & 1/2 mile from his home driving through a heavily wooded section of the road when we all saw a large object crossing the road at tree top height.  the objects total length was obscured by the trees on both sides of the road but was passing directly over our path and only yards ahead of us.  the object was gray in color and had windows through which we could see blue tinted light. the object made no sound of anykind and was moving at a very slow speed from our right to left.  the object was moving to slow for any object to stay airborne and was perfectly horizontal at tree top level. as the car passed directly under the object all conversation had ceased and no one spoke for several seconds until one of us (not sure who spoke first) asked what was that.  there still was no answer or conversation for several seconds until someone else acknowledged they had also seen the object.  then there was a couple minutes of conversation in which we stated our amazement at the sighting and all described the object with no difference of opinion as to its look, speed, direction, or height.\r\n\r\non the way back we briefly discussed the chance (fear in my case at least) of seeing the object again, but we did not.  my step uncle and his family lived in the same home until his death two years ago.  i never discussed the sighting with him or my brother who died in 1986 after that night.  my step father and i have only recently discussed the sighting again.  i have brought the subject up of what we saw 46 years ago to him and we still have identical memories of the happenings of the eveving prior to, during, and after the sighting.  we agreed that although the four of us had an identical experience it has been a subject that none of us were willing to openly discuss even with each other.  i only recently found out from my mother that my step father and his uncle described the sighting with their wives upon our return.\r\n\r\ni feel blessed to have made the sighting.  i know to be the truth what most doubt.  i do not know where the object originated from or
