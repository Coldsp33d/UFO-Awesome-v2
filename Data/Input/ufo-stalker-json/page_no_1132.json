happen while doing my usual night astral photography. i had my two still camera���s setup up a nikon coolpix 510-46x zoom, a canon sx30-35x zoom and two video camera���s  a canon vixia hg21-12x zoom, a panasonic sdr-s50-78x zoom. it wasn���t till the next day that i noticed that on my panasonic video camera had caught some extremely unusual activity on the moon.  a craft moves across the moon at a high rate of speed and lands in a crater named rima agatharchides after passing over the crater bullialdus. while the craft is moving across the moon from right to left it is constantly changing it shape. it has two arm extensions one on the top and one on the bottom that extends from the middle of the craft and rotate in opposite directions. when not in use these arm extension fold back into the craft to make it look cigar shaped as the top and bottom arm extensions rotate so does the main structure of the craft rotate.\r\nall of this is very visible by watching the videos and frame grabs of craft 1. in the original video which i have not enclosed which has not been touched or edited it is only the first 3 minutes that i have investigated although the video is 15:56 minutes long so far i have been working on it constantly for 6 months to confirm the craft and compare it with other moon shots i have.  in the short version of the video at the beginning you will see the craft enter the moon ��� way down on the right side of the moon it is extremely fast so watch carefully you will see it go through a brown dead spot (more on that later) and go over the first crater causing dust to rise then watch the next crater as it lands in the crater. i slowed the video down and zoomed in and grabbed frames from the video (a few enclosed) and made a slide show with them i also edited the video down as short as possible and slowed it down and zoomed in and made another video as well as full speed.  where ever possible the video times are left in the frames.\r\ni then proceeded to do some calculations on the craft this is what i came up with:\r\ncraft size ��� 43.558 miles (70.1 km)\r\ndistance covered ��� 2968 miles, time to cover -2968 miles=3.2 seconds\r\nthis gives it a speed of 927.5 miles per second or 3,339,000 mph\r\nthen it stopped in a heartbeat to land in a crater.\r\nthere are numerous frame grabs i have enclosed that i have worked on but they all come up with the same conclusion.\r\n\r\nthis is not a hoax and absolutely nothing has been faked or any misleading material sent to you. this has been a ongoing incident for many, many years all documented by video and pictures all untouched and will stand any forensic exam.\r\n","distance":"Over One

left a streaking tail as it descended, but burned out. my guess is it was a meteor, however i am puzzled by the intensity of the green hue. it looked kind of like one of those flaming balls that gets shot out of a roman candle firework, however this object left no smoke trail as such a burning object would (also the object was descending, not ascending  ... looked more like an a neon electric streak, is how i can best describe what i saw. i have seen many meteors streak across the sky, but this one was much closer to the ground. the object did however streak at a very high rate of speed like that of a meteor... and most likely burned up in the atmosphere... but it had to have been quite a large chunk of something, made up of some material that glows vibrant green under such extreme heat as entry into earths atmosphere....Never have i seen such a green glowing meteor! also in the sky there was a commercial jet airliner. the pilots had to have witnessed the event for the object appeared to pass between the aircraft and me.  the time, was 11;10 pm give or take a minute or two because afterward i went and described the event to a couple of neighbors who were in their garage with the door open but did not see the object.   i seem to recall, seeing a video clip that came from a police patrol cars dash camera (think somewhere in usa midwest) of a green object streaking above and past the car. what i witnessed was similar but not quite as long of distance traveled... then again when observing objects in space , it is difficult to gauge height and distance due to lack of reference points.  whatever it was, it was quite a spectacular spectacle!!  other than the aircraft, there is a high probability that the object was seen by long beach airport control tower (lgb is sse approx 1.5 miles of my place).","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

happened. it was approximately 1986. i was about 8yrs old at the time. my younger brother was about 1 or 2. at the time, the only way my mom could get him to go to sleep for the night was to take him for a ride in the car. an uncle of mine who was living with us at the time would always go along as well. one night when they came home, they were both quite excited. they said they had seen a ufo. they described an object that was rectangular, estimated about 100ft long and 30 to 40ft wide with bars of white light on the bottom. it hovered in place for a few minutes and then suddenly rocketed away and disappeared. the next night when they came home, again they had seen something. the next night, again they saw something. the fourth night, i asked to come along. as i said before, i was about 8yrs old. what eight year old kid wouldn't want to see a real life starship? \r\n\r\n   (i should mention my father was in the military at the time and we lived near an airforce base. so even at the age of eight i was quite familiar with airplanes and helicopters.)\r\n\r\n     we'd been riding around for about half an hour and i was keeping a constant vigil on the sky. i had a couple of separate sightings which i recognized right away as airliners. then i saw something that seemed out of place. it first appeared to be another airplane but it was much lower than the other two i had seen and was moving much slower. i saw three white lights. they formed a perfect triangle. the lights themselves were quite small. they looked about like stars but they were moving in unison so they certainly weren't stars. there was a dark mass between the lights so it had to be a solid object. i know that because it obscured the stars as it moved. as far as the size, it looked to be about the size of an airliner at an altitude between 500 and 1,000ft. i pointed it out to my mom and uncle. it was moving slow enough that we were able to follow it in our car for some distance. we actually got ahead of it at some point and it flew right over us. my mom and uncle dismissed it as an airplane. i continued watching it as we went on our merry way. a few minutes later, the craft changed from three white lights into one large white light and began to accelerate. my mother and uncle saw it too. suddenly it took off and vanished. it moved so quickly it left a streak of light in it's wake. about thirty seconds after it disappeared, three large airplanes flying one behind the other and quite close to each other, came from the direction of the airforce base. they were at about the same altitude as the ufo heading toward where it was when it disappeared. when they reached about where it had been they started flying in a circle. they remained there for i guess about ten minutes and then headed back toward the airforce base.\r\n\r\n     i don't know what it was that we saw that night. soviet spy plane? experimental aircraft? alien starship? i don't know what it was. i'm not completely sure i want to know either. i only know two things for certain:\r\n\r\n  1. whatever i saw that night, i never saw anything like it before. and aside from a few stories on tv and the net describing a similar craft, i've seen nothing like it in the 30yrs since.\r\n\r\n  2. whatever it was, it got the attention of the airforce.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

sorts of military aircraft throughout my 20-year career. these objects were not jet or turbo prop aircraft simply based on the physics of the objects' movement. the only possibility i could come up

i looked out the window and saw it was a ufo.  i took the children, 2 at that time, 2 houses down to see it.  it rose up off the field slowly.  i saw that white lights went one way around the rim of the disc, while red lights went another way in a circle in the center of the disc.  i thought to myself that i would like a closer look at it.  that is when it rose up slowly on its side and came towards us rising sideways.  it was enormous.  my kids ran home.  i did too.  i smelled something in the air.  a month later, i had viral pneumonia.  i also have suffered from colon cancer which is not something in the family.  i have seen one once before 10 years prior in sauk village.  after this incident, i saw this disc come over the horizon towards the house for 2 weeks straight.  my oldest daughter still fears them.  i have no memory of abduction.  i finally left that area years later.  i did not fear this object until it turned on its side to go up.  it was so big it frightened me as well.  i called the police and reported it.  they said it was a blimp.  they refused to listen.  75 calls came in to the richton park police and they ignored it.  i drew a picture for a deputy in will county who then chased it. i had pneumonia for 2 months.  i almost died from it.  i think now it was radiation poisoning.\r\n     i have recently had a blackhawk copter fly over my house.  don't know why but it rattled my windows.  it stopped when i put the event on facebook. most of my friends on there are states attorneys and police officers.  im a retired state worker. \r\n   now i wonder if this has been all through my life.  my parents put a window lock on my bedroom because i was scared as a child that someone would come in.  i used to sleep under all the blankets with my head covered so something couldn't see me.  dreamt of my room being a rocket ship over and over again. odd stuff.
