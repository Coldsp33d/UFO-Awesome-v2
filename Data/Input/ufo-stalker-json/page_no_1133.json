didn't think a balloon could stay that stationary or possibly some type of drone. we continued our hike for about another 10 minutes and the object remained in position. by the time we got to the

here in bartonsville, pennsylvania, i was on the back enclosed sun porch making some jpg photos of old silver dollar coins.  it's nice and bright out there in late afternoon so natural light is all that's needed with the camera iso set at 400.   was using an old nikon d1h digital slr because it somehow takes better close-up pictures than my later model d2 series camera. \r\n\r\nwhile working there making close up photos, i happened to glance out the window to the southwest and noticed in the blue sky, numerous military jet contrails.  it was first pondered as to what might be going on to get such weekday afternoon military plane activity. looking up again towards the now broken whirlee-gig windmill atop the rear deck upper railing, a blotch of what appeared to be rainbow colored light was seen shining from behind an odd wispy rippled mackerel skin like cloud.  that was about 3:48 p.M. then with the afternoon sun getting low in the west.  it seemed then as if the sun was perhaps shinning into the cloud at a precise angle and reflecting ice crystals making the rainbow colors.   took the d1 camera that i was working with at the time and strolled out onto an ice free area of the back deck to make a couple of pictures. \r\n\r\nabout the same time, the light from within the cloud became extremely bright as if something very shiny was up there reflecting the sunlight. noticed then was a stream of what appeared to be exhaust smoke or maybe vapor clouds on the right side before the blinding bright light. i realized then that what was being seen was not a rainbow but something else.   after clicking a couple of more pictures it was seen that the camera battery on the old d1 was getting low.  \r\n\r\ni returned inside the house and grabbed the nikon d2hs camera with it���s fresh charged battery and a clean memory flash card with 2.1k empty picture slots. by the time i got back outside the bright light had faded along with most of unusual wispy mackerel skin cloud.   instead, there was more puffy little clouds in a row leading to a strange stationary rust colored blob in the same spot in the sky.  took some more pictures of the unusual clouds and returned inside.  coming back in, i happened to glance outside again to see the reddish blob turning into a brilliant blazing light that was more defined and with what looked two headlights.  the skies all around were also again filled with crisp fresh jet contrails.  noticed too was that the light from the object was shining or reflecting like beams into surrounding clouds.   the wispy rippled cloud around the object appeared again and seemed to get bigger.  series of pictures was made within probably seven or eight minutes.  though i was tempted to put the camera on motor drive at 8-frames per second, it was decided to make more carefully composed individual pictures with foreground images shown so to help with perspective and location.   in total, there are probably 20 or 25 pictures made with two professional grade digital cameras.   of those, some look to be washed out before a lens hood was installed.  the images on the original memory cards have not been modified so that the sequence of photos can be verified.   \r\n\r\nattached please find three sample pictures taken yesterday of the described thing in the sky. these are in sequence with time gap between. \r\n\r\nthis is f.Y.I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":54499,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.03257641790243,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03072014-0002","longitude":-75.25063354081855,"occurred":1394149500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1394218376000,"summary":"Bartonsville,

1973. ( i am sure about the year, just not the month) that night mike, sandy, laura, and my self slept out side, we were making out with the girls when mike stood up and asked \"what's that ?\" the time was approx. 2 am, i rolled over and saw what i thought was the moon shining through a weather balloon and told mike \"it's just a weather balloon.\" and rolled over back to sandy when mike said, \"that isn't a balloon.\" when i rolled over onto my back i could now see a large triangular craft approx. 300 ft. across, and approx. 300 ft. off the ground slowly moving over the top of us. what i thought was the moon shining through a balloon now looked more like an observation bubble under the nose of the craft, and it was glowing a dull light purple in color. as it moved over it made no sound, and i saw no lights, but as it cleared the moon you could see the light reflect off the craft and it gave it the color of gun metal blue, and the edges appeared to be rounded. it continued its slow moving progress away from us following the hills of the desert, and flying just above hill top level. mike and i then got up and started putting on our shoes while the girls begged us not to follow fearing something was going to happen to us. so we followed running up hills, then down one and up another, but the craft got further away each time so we stopped and just watched. i saw no sign of an engine, and we heard no sounds. had it not been for the fact it flew right over the top of us we would never even had known it was there. my feeling was that the craft was running in stealth mode, no lights and at very low levels to avoid detection. what struck me so odd, was back then it was supposed to be fast moving shinny disk shaped objects, like in \"chariots of the gods\" i did not see anything like what we saw until i watched a program on tv describing the same thing i saw, except ours did not have any of the lights mentioned.

was then that i spotted a silver mettalic disc hovering above the trees behind us. i do not know how long it was there. we got up and walked closer to observe it. we stood there trying to figure out what this was by naming off anything we knew. i remembered my mother was in the house and i went in the house to get her. she was on the phone. i ran back out and the object had moved off in the direction of the river. my mother came out several minutes later but it was gone by then. it made no sound. it reflected the sun so i know it was real. it was viewed for several minutes by both david and i. we were afraid of being made fun of so we did not report it to anybody. through the years i have told this to friends and family.","distance":"21-100

about the speed of a small aircraft.  the lights where very intense, and really unexplainable in the way they flashed.  but there was a almost chaotic repetition.  i went inside and alerted my parents, who promptly came out to see.  \r\n\r\nwe watched the object for about 2 more minutes, noticing a small aircraft flying in the same flight path, but it was quite a distance away.  \r\n\r\neverything continued the same until my mother yelled at it, trying to communicate with it.  i know odd right, but this is not the first time we have seen things like this.  \r\n\r\nafter my mother yelled at it, it changed color very quickly.  it then became a red object which seemed to be pulsating.  it got brighter, and it looked like it skipped.  when i say skipped it was like it disappeared, and appeared probably 100 foot or so faster than it had been flying, hard to tell.  it did this a few times, then it got really bright red, like an explosion of sorts, but not.\r\n\r\nand it was gone.\r\n\r\np.S. i have been seeing quite a few of these ufo's before and after this indecent.   last week i spotted 3 of them to the west.  one dancing and swirling.  and then again last night i saw two at my house.  one moved up really fast like a fish swimming up, then hovered, and repeated this a few times.  note, if try to record them, they always just stop moving, like they are pretending to just be a star. lol\r\n\r\nhave a great day.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Driving home after work, through hide-a-way lake development in carriere, ms. just past clubhouse, when i observed an object just above the roof of a house that was just built (not yet occupied), on the right side of a left turn in the roadway. i quickly made a right turn into the houses driveway to get a better look, unaware of what the object was. initial observation was a row of lights (dull red and green) in a row spread the length of the house yet beyond the roof line on both ends. the vague outline of the object was approx. 20' above the roof, and was approx. 20' wider than the width of the house. the row of lights ran along approx. the lower third of the  objects height. after sitting in the driveway approx. 20-25' from the house in the driveway in my pickup (maybe 1 min.), i turned off the engine and climbed out of the cab, and onto the bed, leaning against the roof of the cab observing in awe. my \"scientific\" mind was analyzing the data i was witnessing as soon as i could, fearing that it might leave. it was soundless, nothing....It was motionless, the lights were dull, but easily visible. cars were driving past, seemingly unaware of the object, as it was off to the right of the road, as it makes a left rounded turn. i was fixated on the object, not wanted to miss anything, yet was amazed none of the cars going by seemed to notice the object. the outline of the object itself was vague, being black like the night sky. after what seemed like forever, my emotions were observational initially, taking in all that i could, then after running mentally through all the logical explanations of what it could be, and concluding it was \"unknown\",....Suddenly, i felt the onset of fear, realizing that whatever it was, or whoever was in it, had to also be observing me! being so close (estimate 50'),.... fear suddenly took over my emotions, thinking to myself, i need to get out of here, before \"something\" happens!?? just about that time, as fear entered my mind....The object started slowly moving to my right, maybe 5-10 mph, crossing over the subdivisions fence line, and across the neighboring golf course. i watched it slowly go across the golf course towards the sw, which i later lined up to be towards an electrical substation on hwy 11,...Then after about 3-5 mi jtes in that area, it shot extremely fast straight up at about a 10 degree angle to the east,....Up and out of sight...At a speed i've never witnessed (within seconds 1000's of feet up into the night sky and gone).\r\ni immediately drove home about 3 minutes away....Told my wife what i just saw, and called my uncle, who was and air force base commander in duluth, mn. and minot, nd....Who had told us of ufo sightings while he was on duty on several occasions in the past. he verified the definition of my experience as \"normal\" occurrences regarding how i described it at that time. i have not reported this incident until now because of fear of ridicule. the experience is as real today in my memory as it was way back then. the is 100% no uncertainty that it was a ufo, and nothing in modern aviation today can fly soundless, and directionally as that object did,...I assume, it was magnetic in power source, as the only explanation of its qualities.","distance":"21-100
