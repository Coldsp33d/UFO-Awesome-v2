sagittarius. to the left of the constellation i noticed what appeared to be a very bright star. however it pulsated and changed directions very rapidly. i moved into the road, which was very dark with a clear line of sight away from tree branches, and noticed that it continued with this color and travel pattern. several aircraft flew in different directions, at what appeared to be much lower altitude, during the entire time of observation. \r\n\r\ni am convinced that this was no plane or helicopter, due to the rapid ability of the object to change directions constantly and stop. i then came inside my home and told me wife to accompany me to observe the ufo. we continued to observe the object for approximately 20 minutes. a neighbor came out to place his trash cans at the curb, and i called him over. he claimed to be a military pilot in the past and tried to explain it as one, at first. but when i pointed out the rapid direction of travel while not following a flight path, he couldn't explain it. \r\n\r\ni had my cell phone with me and for the first time, decided to try out the video taping function. at this point in time, i'm not sure that it recorded, but it enabled us to zoom in on the object. it was at that time that we could see the vivid colors pulsating on the surface of the orb, as well as in a ring that appeared around it. \r\n\r\ni came inside to get my video camcorder, but found the battery was not charged. at the time of this report, i'm not sure if i have the video on my cell phone, but will try to find out how to retrieve it by checking on line (its a company provided cell phone - motorola droid razr). \r\n\r\ni should mention that i had observed multiple ufo's in 1967, when i was 14 years old, which rapidly changed flight paths before bursting at high speed into space. i've often checked the night sky and haven't seen anything resembling a ufo until this point. \r\n\r\ni have prior law enforcement experience, with extensive observation and investigative skills while in the corporate security profession for over 35 years. this includes report writing and court testimony. so i have established total credibility throughout my career. i have also been a certified njsp certified security officer instructor since 2007.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

orange light some 50 feet above the ground, i am a security officer and was in a field to the north of the event waiting for walk in persons to enter the venue without buying tickets. this object flew over the top of me without sound and appeared to be only 50 or so feet above me but was actually less it had orange lights under it, i shone my torch on it but it picked up no known reflection. an hour later i saw to the south west orange lights in what appeared to be flares. but one would come out of the other.Etc. so i left my area of patrol and went to investigate.The area was some 400 metres from the stage areas that were blocked off to access except through selected doors. when i got there i noticed a light beyond the trees in a southerly direction, it went down slowly then back up, so i shone my torch onto it, it appeared to be over a mile away, however on closer inspection the next day during daylight it turned out to be less than half of that.I shone my torch onto it and flicked it on off. then turned it off. the object flicked on off. then i moved my torch in a cross like a plus sign and then a circle. i repeated this a few times and always switched my torch off.Then the object did the same, it slowly came out above the trees. we played these games for about half an hour then in front of me on ground level, two flashes very bright, an orange white colour flashed. on closer inspection the next day this is where there were small trees and leading into swampy grounds. i dared not go in there that night. so i continued to play with the light in the sky i did so for at least another hr, however i did notice from that time on which was the last 2 nights of the event that there was always 4 objects over the stage areas, i knew this as it was cloudy and they were well inside the confines of the clouds. 2014 i worked again at the same area, this time the falls festival, again these objects were seen, further away from my area but again near the stage area, again orange lighting, and rising from the ground up, it was reported on our radios by other guards that they were chinese flares, however they would rise slowly then their lights would go off, but you could still see just the illumination of the crafts with the naked eye for a further amount of time as they rose higher then into the clouds. no noise heard.This went on every night for the duration of the festival. i have seen to date now 114 ufo's\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

ocean front room,(facing the east) and left our balcony doors open each night to hear the surf. our first night in cancun, we went to bed early, tired from our travel from ohio. we awoke about 3:45 am to see a beautiful crescent shape moon out our balcony, and a brilliant shining star called altair above it. we use our ipad skyguide app. to see what constellations are around, satellites, etc. at first, i thought i was watching a shooting star. it appeared rapidly from the north (on our left) and shot by quickly, but suddenly stopped just below the constellation scorpio, backtracked a little ways, then began zig-zagging all around until it finally sped off to the south. within moments another object, which had the same soft orange glow as the first, appeared from out of nowhere above us, stopped in mid-flight, changed course, and began to zig-zag before flying off. i tried to video and photograph using my ipad but they were so far they looked grainy on the screen, and were way too fast for me to follow. another orb appeared as the first two, and shot off in an erratic manner. we were stunned at what we'd seen and sat on the wall of our balcony searching for more, when suddenly two appeared, flying in tandem, much closer to us than the others, and much slower. we could see these more clearly and they looked like they were orange, transparent orbs with whirling wings. they made no sound, and moved steadily along, then zipped off down the coast. they reminded me of two big dragonflies, sort of, but in a mechanical way. it was as if the first 3 were testing us, knowing we were watching, and then the last two came closer to show off a little. my boyfriend is a usaf veteran, and he said what we saw were definitely ufos. they were not planes, satellites, drones, helicopters, searchlights, balloons or anything else. we were so excited and so amazed by what we've seen. we have told all the people who were on the trip with us, but no one else was up at that time so they missed it. it has made us both even more sure we are not alone in this vast universe! one of just many universes.","distance":"Over One

because you have also had reports from venice florida which is about 30 miles north of my location.\r\n   orion was high up about 45 and object was about 10 degrees.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

a light arc toward my backyard (a hay field).  i thought it may have been fireworks and was worried the field would be set on fire. i checked outside, visually, from 3 areas, and hollered out into the darkness from all 3 locations - but it was clear, no one was outside.  it's a very rural area, everyone knows everyone out here.  if someone was outside they'd have hollered back when i yelled to see if anyone was out there.\r\n\r\n\r\ndirectly after observing this event, i posted to facebook that i saw this green thing falling quite slowly from the sky, and a friend of mine said it was bizarre that someone she knows in the next town over (richmond, maine) saw, pretty much, what i explained i observed and facebooked it almost at the same exact time.  the falling \"flare\" or \"orb\", or whatever it was, in my yard was so low there is no way this person in another town was looking at what i was looking at.\r\n\r\ni went out to the hayfield to check what it was that fell, but could find nothing.  \r\n\r\n\r\nso there were 2 witnesses to at least 1, maybe 2, green-light \"flare\" like \"orbs\" in the air on the same night at the same general time.  i say \"in the air\" and not \"in the sky\" because, really, this thing was lower than the trees - it was within the trees and falling toward the ground - when i saw it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis same type of event happened again roughly 5 months later - sunday february 23, 2014 -  around midnight and was observed by 2 different people and also in 2 different towns.  it was seen in richmond, maine and reported on facebook, and a friend responded to this report by saying they also observed a green flare like orb in bowdoin, maine at roughly the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\nin addition:\r\n\r\ni'm not sure if it's related, but a few years earlier (less than 10 years earlier) i saw an orange spotlight hanging in the sky over the trees just beyond the hayfield this green flare/orb fell in.  i honestly thought nothing of this spotlight - i thought it was something normal, like a helicopter or something, maybe with police in it and they were looking for people?  it just never occurred to me it was weird, until our garage motion light was triggered by us opening the garage door.  when the motion lights flashed on in the yard, i was still looking at this orange spotlight, and i observed it go from a completely standstill position - it was literally just stuck there in the sky, no movement and no sound (we was in our truck at the time, driving into our driveway.  i rolled down my window and verbalized it was weird there was no sounds from helicopter blades.) - to instantly streaking across the sky and zipping completely out of sight in the direction of bowdoin/topsham/brunswick/freeport... \r\n\r\ni have no idea what that was.  i can only say that's what i saw. i didn't talk out loud about it to too many people but luckily those i did tell read the paper.  there was an article in the portland press herald (i'm pretty sure that was the paper) that was specifically about ufo sightings all over different parts of maine that week.  one of the reports was pretty much what i saw, which was this orange spotlight.  the town that happened in, i think, was norridgewock, and that's quite a far distance from bowdoinham.  \r\n\r\n\r\nand now these green orbs are falling in, and around, these towns, and people are reporting their movement as somewhat intelligent in-nature because they aren't always just \"falling\".  they've been reported to zig-zag and take direct turns.  \r\n\r\nso i thought i'd post it here and maybe someone from this area of maine will chime in and report any sightings they may have had. \r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100

watching the rain i was looking north east between my neighbors house and the empty lot next to him where i could see the northeast sky without any obstruction. as i was looking in that direction all of a sudden 5 evenly spaced bright red lights lit up for about five seconds then blinked off. this was just slightly above the rooftop level of the neighbors house 200 feet away and to the right of it where the empty lot is. it was about 15 degrees elevation and at a bearing from my back patio of 75 degrees. my impression was that it was no more then a block or two away just from the way the light intensity was and because it was drizzling rain at the time. the lights appeared to be in a horizontal line. in between the lights there was just darkness so as to appear to me that they were individual lights and not lights attached to an object. it did not appear to be moving but instead just appeared and disappeared like somebody turned on and off a light switch. the lights kind of reminded me of christmas type lights but in the morning i used my binoculars to see if my neighbor had any lights on their upper patio deck which they did not.
