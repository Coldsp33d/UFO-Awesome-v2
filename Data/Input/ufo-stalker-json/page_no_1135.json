saltillo i noticed 3 bright white lights. i thought it looked disc like at that point. i pointed it out to my husband that was driving. we slowed down ans began to watch it because the lights were so brightly glowing white. it was in the distance at this point. it quickly changed direction and altitude. as it began coming toward the highway (east)where we were. it appeared to have some sort of light \"drop\" out of it. like a raindrop of light. we turned to each other and said, \"did you see that? are you seeing this?\" my husband said we need to get a picture of it because no one would believe this. we slowed down even move and came to stop on the highway (not on the side of the highway because we were so captivated by this) as it passed overhead in front of us. i did not grab my phone for a picture because i was afraid i would miss something incredible. as it got closer we could tell it had 4 lights in fact. 3 bright white glowing lights. not blinking. and 1 tiny red light that was in the bottom center of the craft. we were able to make out a black structure with a triangle shape. we did not see wings on the object. it just had the triangle shape. we thought if it were an airplane it would not have been able to turn around like it did before, it would have a blinking light on it somewhere and would not go so slowly over us it had slowed down when it passed over us. there was no noise like a helicopter. i did think it was slow for an airplane. it disappeared off to the east toward birmingham more quickly though after it slowly went across the highway. the whole event may have lasted 5 minutes. i am not saying that i saw an alien but we did see something! after the object was out of sight and we headed on our way we agreed that it was just like something you would see on tv. i have never reported anything before and probably won't again. i know it sounds strange but it is true.

around the constant pulsating strobe, no notable pattern, got out of my car, told my uncle to look at it, explaining to him - that that was not a helicopter, it was at too high an altitude, while debating with him, i pulled my cellphone out and hit a/v record, the grouped together lights moved abruptly to the left, the acceleration and deceleration where highly unusual, fast, but smooth, my uncle kept saying, it's vegas, it's something from the casinos, i couldn't believe what he was telling me, he then said, he was cold and he was not going to wait for it to do something, he started walking away, i stopped recording, and it suddenly dropped in 1 second, and stopped right over the homes in the valley at about 500 feet and 2-3 miles north from my location, could still see it beyond

party my band had played for, held in a barn in a rural area about 45 minutes north of pittsburgh. the rest of the band stayed to visit with party hosts and guests but i wanted to get home to my daughter so i left about 11pm. i had no health problems, was not experiencing any stress, have no history of mental illness or substance abuse, was not overly tired, and had not been drinking. the job had gone well and i was happy and relaxed though vigilant as i was driving on a windy, unfamiliar 2 lane country road with no street lights. i was driving a vega station wagon, with clear view of the road behind; the speed limit was 35 mph but i was only going about 30 mph. \r\n\r\ni was about 10 minutes on the road when i suddenly saw the glow of a red light in my rear view mirror. it appeared to be immediately (literally, inches), behind the car, at the level of the top of my back seat. my first reaction was, ah man, it's a cop, and i was going to get a ticket. there was no place to pull over, and no other cars on the road so i just put my flashers on and brought the car to a stop. on my left on the other side of the road was a steep grassy hill about 10 feet high, at the top of which was a large field (about 5-6 acres i'd guess) with a farmhouse about 100 feet in the distance. beyond the farm house were woods with tall trees.  the only light i recall in the farmhouse was a porch light. i rolled my window down and reached for my purse to get my driver's license etc  when i started to realize there was something wrong with this picture. the red light remained in the same position behind me but wasn't blinking like a police car would, there was no policeman in sight, i hadn't been driving over the speed limit, and the red glow was so bright, i couldn't see past it to visualize a police car. i wasn't frightened at that point, just very confused. i sat there for maybe 1-2 minutes, looking at the light in my rear view mirror, when i heard a soft hum and the red light slowly lifted straight up out of my view. i had a terrible uh-oh feeling, leaned out of the open driver side window, looked up, and saw the underside of a round, grey, metallic craft of some sort hovering about 2 feet above my car. it was approximately 6-8 feet in diameter. now i was scared, petrified actually. i brought myself quickly back through the open window, and sat there quite paralyzed, wondering what the hell it was and what i should do: drive away fast, be still and hope it went away, etc. it hovered for maybe another 1-2 minutes, then moved slowly toward the hill where it stopped again. now i had a clear view of the craft - circular with a dome about 4-5 feet in height, and a pair of oblong structures on the back of either side (facing me). they were about 6 feet long, pointed on top and bottom, wider in the middle, with large well defined red lights in the middle part, and not well defined, smaller white lights flanking the red lights too & bottom. the metal of the light structures was lighter and shinier than the body of he craft. it hovered there for a very short time, less than a minute, then took off straight above the farmhouse and over the surrounding woods at warp peed, leaving nothing but a light trail behind it. it made no sound as it flew off. i jumped out of the car and ran up the hill to see where it went but it was gone by the time i reached the top.  i thought about going to the farmhouse to see if anyone was there and if they saw it but was shaking all over by then. i got back in my car and drove fast back to the main road, full of fear that whatever it was might come back. it didn't and i've never seen anything like it since. i have a sketch of what i saw; i don't how to get it to you electronically but would be glad to mail it. \r\n\r\nover the years i've confided the experience to 4 friends but never officially reported it to police or other government agency because frankly, it was such a close encounter and so outrageous, i didn't think anyone would believe me. i wrote it off to an amazing life experience and put it behind me until watching hanger one on tv this week; it was the first time i'd heard of mufon, checked out your web site, and decided to report my experience. it was a long time ago but i remember every detail like it was yesterday. i hope someone will find it useful to know.

direction of the tv across the room.  the red beams spread out and lit the room with a light so intense it reminded me of pyrotechnics. as the light scattered, it collected in the corners along the walls and ceiling and bounced around (similar to sparklers) before dissipating. in the next moment i was aware of a tall thin human shaped being to the right of my bed.  he was wearing head to toe black with some kind of sparkles all over but not an intense covering of sparkles. as i was processing what i was seeing i was not fearful, primarily due to the sparkles which in my mind ruled out a criminal element. the sparkles could have even been residual from the light that predicated the appearance of the being. as these thoughts were going through my mind, i hid my face and then decided to take another look and raised my head. he was standing in the same place on the far side of my bed to the right, about 6 feet from me.  his arms were crossed in front of his chest but i didn't notice his hands, nor could i see the lower legs.  as he stood there with arms crossed, he took a step forward with one foot and turned his head to the left to look at me.   i put my head down again and when i looked up a moment later, he was gone.  rather anticlimactic. but i often wonder if he'll be back.  so many questions haunt me with no answers.  the next day, as i was trying to make sense of it, there was no question that it was not a figment of my imagination, although i had never heard of a tall, black e.T., at least not yet.  so i googled 'tall thin black alien' and found several similar sightings, but most were in europe and i am in texas. one was so similar it was described as having a sheen in lieu of sparkles. but that sighting was 20 years ago and during the day.  so all things

minutes to brew.  after watching tv for 10 minutes , i got up from my chair and went into the kitchen to fix a cup of coffee.  as i was stirring my cup of coffee , a thought came to my mind .  this is october , it's a beautiful morning outside , no moon , crisp and clear with millions of stars in the night sky .  so i decided to step out onto the back porch and look for satellites or anything else that i might could see that was unusual.  within a minute i caught movement out of my perihphial vision to the west.   i spotted a starlike object that was somewhat low in the sky as i turn to the west .  it moved from my right to my left in a straight line which took approximately eight seconds and stopped .  the object was bright like a star with no visible markings or shape characteristics whatsoever.  essentially it was too far away to notice any other details.   the vehicle stopped for approximately eight seconds and then turned downward and moved in a circular flight path .  the spacecraft completed 80% of this circular maneuver and then stopped for another 8 to 10 seconds.   at this point the bright spacecraft then seemed to be powering up as it became larger and brighter.  after another 8 to 10 seconds of powering up, the spacecraft emanated a bright white beam from the front of the ship which created a large circular bright white energy field.  another 8 to 10 seconds went by and the spacecraft then got twice as big and twice as bright.  the spacecraft then accelerated forward with the speed of light as it entered the circular bright white energy field known as a wormhole .  the spacecraft did not exit on the other side ,it simply vanished inside this energy field.   i then watched this bright white circular energy field slowly shrink in size until it got to the point as if you blew out a candle.  i heard no sounds whatsoever during this event.  i was in the right place at the right time.   the alien spacecraft that i saw was 100% true and accurate.  absolutely nothing man-made about the object that i spotted that sky.\r\nwe are not alone and albert einstein was so correct in his theories about wormholes .","distance":"501 Feet - 1

lit of time together and this particular night i was telling him somewhat the way satellites functioned and there purposes, so we would wait for the next to fly over and follow it until we no longer could see it as it went out if site, the pattern of flight for what we were observing was from south to the north, as we were watching mabe the fourth or fifth one if the night , it was about a little past the halfway mark above us going north when we observed one coming from the northwest going south southeast,i don't recall who saw it first but weboth kinda said tthere's one going the other way , it was coming up from the lower horizon travelling at the speed of all other satellites and as it approached the high point above our heads it made a almost ninety degree turn and at the speed of a falling star it flew to the north west with amazing speed , tim and i both like shouted out, did you see that ? r running into the house to tell others what we had just experienced, and thirty years

grouping of lights to the north west as i drove west on hwy 40 approaching hwy 270.  as i got closer, there was two groupings of lights and a noticable red pulsatiing \"dome\" on the grouping of lights nearest me.  the closer i got, the more detail i could make out...The \"head\" seemed to have 8 or 10 white \"windows\" across the front and a count of four or five levels (floors?) down ... the back area seemed to have a light panel with points of light and random pulsing of stronger light within the light panel.  there seemed to be a secondary such panel on the north side of the first.  as i passed the clustering, it seemed like i could make out a bottom, \"flatbed\" type structure that might be the body connecting the two (three) groupings of lights.  my mind was saying \"like a cruise ship in the sky\" and \"like fireball xl5\" from my childhood.  as i passed it, there didn't seem to be any back lights.  i was unable to immediately stop to shoot video, but i turned around at mason road and came all the way back east on 40 to spoede road, parked, got my canon xa 10 out.  by this time, if what i spotted was the ufo, it had moved considerably north (several miles).  i shot some video and as i couldn't see it anymore, there was a plane flying into view from the east and i shot some video of that to show the difference in lights between the two.  this all occurred between 9:40 and 9:50(?) pm on friday night, february 28, 2014.  submitted here friday night but it didn't take for some reason.  will be submitting video and research later when ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

receives basic digital channels on my tv, and i could not find the remote so i was standing at the tv manually changing the channels to find something to watch. i stopped on channel 13, because it was coming in the best. there was a little interference, so i adjusted the antenna a little bit, which caused the sound to stop coming in clearly. it was no longer the sound from what was airing on tv, but something weird and different i could not make out. i put my ear a little closer and thought it might be worth recording so i pulled my cell phone out and set it to record sound. at first i had the phone up to the tv speaker, but it did not sound loud enough so i raised the volume on my cell phone, and turned on the surround sound speakers at a higher volume. i continued to record it and wondered if it was the sound from the tv just being distorted, or something else (alien sounding). it was like \"predators\" were talking. i use this comparison because it did not sound human, and its the closest sounding example i could think of. i kept recording for a minute or two, and compared the sound to what i was seeing on the tv screen. they did not coincide with one another at all. i decided to change the channel to see if it would change, and it did once i got to channel 10. i went back to channel 13 and the sound was coming in perfectly clear from what was airing on tv. i was no longer hearing what i recorded. very weird, and interesting. i feel i may have caught some transmission between an unidentified being.","distance":"Unknown,
