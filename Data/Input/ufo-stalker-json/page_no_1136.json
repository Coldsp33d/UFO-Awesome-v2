they did not dim... they went away for a split second. the direction that they were moving was east to west. there was more then one , because they were not following the same line. but the direction of travel was the same!\r\n     so i aimed at jupiter, orion's sword, plaidies, big dipper, a bright star in the southeast [i do not beleave that it was part of orion } and a red star the might have been mars! after about 45 mins. i came into the house to download. as i was reviewing the photos, i came across the one in question. \r\n     the first photo is the untouched origional. the second

the west of me and i followed its path as it headed northeast until it disappeared.\r\n\r\nit was extremely bright. i saw no blinking lights around it, as you see on planes. it had no form, like a plane, simply a brilliant ball of light. and, what struck me as the strangest thing of all, was that it was completely silent.\r\n\r\nmy husband and i spend many nights outside on the patio star-gazing. since we are very close to the flight path of louisville international airport, bowman field, and a tv station that has a helicopter landing pad, my husband and i are very familiar with all types of aircraft at all levels of altitude. even though we live relatively close to the city and the light pollution can sometimes be a problem, we can also spot satellites as they pass overhead.\r\n\r\ndespite our familiarity with the aircraft/spacecraft that fly over our home (we���ve lived here for 8 years), i couldn���t identify this as anything i���d ever seen in the past. i remember asking myself, ���what is that?��� when it had disappeared (after being visible to me for about 45 seconds), i walked back inside and mentioned to my husband that i���d just seen something that i���d never seen before in my life. i wondered silently to myself if i���d seen a ufo.\r\n\r\na few days later, while checking the internet, i found reports of people in california on new year���s eve spotting light orange orbs of light that were completely silent. i was stunned. i believe i saw exactly the same thing in louisville, ky.

show last night, a few times a clip was shown with an object that looked a lot like what i saw. my family and i were camping at first landing state park, va, in july 2012. the camping ground faces the chesapeake beach side of virgina beach and is right next to the joint expeditionary base, fort story. around 10 a.M., i was walking up to the camp bath and washrooms and noticed what looked like a 50 gal. barrel hovering above the beach area closest to the base at a slight eastward angle. i ignored it figuring it was a kite or something, but then it stuck me as being unusual. i looked back up and stared at it for a few minutes. \"what is that?\" i said several times, each time trying to rationalize it as a balloon or kite. but it looked very solid and didn't move at all. if it were windy enough for a barrel-shapped kite to take flight, i would expect it to move or sway a bit. but it didn't. as i was staring at it, a guy walked by me, also heading to the bathroom. as he passed, i called out to him...\"hey, what is that?\" the guy looked up, stared a few moments,then simply said \"i don't know\" and kept walking. i continued to stare then saw two or three blackhawk helicopters take off and head toward the northwest. i said to myself they're going after whatever that is. as i continued toward the bathroom, i kept watching the object as it hovered motionlessly. the helicopters did a large westward loop. and i continued into the bathroom. i was in there maybe 5 mins. when i came back out it was gone. i don't recall if the helicopters were in the air or area when i came out. i returned to the campsite and jokingly told my wife i saw a ufo. i never saw it again while we were there and never quite saw anything like it again.
