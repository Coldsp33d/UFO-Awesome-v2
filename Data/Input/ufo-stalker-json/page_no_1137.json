noticed a white light in the eastern sky ,my living room faces east.Moving north to south,i thought it was a helicopter so it didn't strike me as strange it seemed to move as such.I also have a back ground in aviation (pilots licence).As this light moved north to south it stopped then moved back south to north then stopped and hovered there for a while.After about a hour it seemed strange it was in the same position.So i got up and got my binoculars to see if i could see it.I couldn't judge the distance or elevation ,but my guess was this light was out over lake michigan i did at this time see a airplane traveling east then bank north.When i seen the white light fade away,only to come back at a higher elevation,then fade again.Then thats when the light show started green then blue ,red.Yellow ,orange all seemed to be on dimmer switches fading out only to reappear in a different spot.Then they started forming shapes like a diamond shape then a rectangular form and others .This lasted till about the time the sun started to rise and at that time the lights all started to fade away with the white light being the last to go.At one point i really didn't believe what i was looking at so i woke my brother up to look at what i was seeing wasn't my imagination and he seen it too.I was so amazed at what i saw ,that i waited up for the next two nights to see if the lights came back and they did.What seemed strange is i called the airport and asked if they seen any lights in the eastern skies and they said no,i felt kinda like a crackpot calling them and asking them that.I never seen them again, even tho i look all the time in that direction.Then on evening i was wathching a ufo program of lights over tinley park which is close to me ,when they showed film footage of the lights and they were exactly the same ones i had seen,it sent a shiver down my spine.In a million years i never thought i would be one of those people who witnessed this sort of thing.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then

florence, oregon to yachats, oregon to stay at a cabin belonging to my in-laws. approximately 12 miles north of florence, i noticed some lights shining through tall fir trees on the west side of the highway.  as we got closer it seemed unusual because we were too close to the ocean for any houses, and there were many bright lights of various colors.  \r\n\r\ni remember telling my husband that it looked like something hovering in the sky.  he took his eye off the road and eventually stopped in the middle of the highway.  we just stared at it in amazement. i told him it must be a ufo and to try to remember what it looked like so we could draw it when we got to the cabin.  then i realized that we could get hit sitting in the middle of the highway.  i'm not sure how long we were there.  he pulled the pickup off on the the right shoulder and we watched some more. the object was huge. we were shock. it's hard to say how big it was, but i would guess that it was at least the size of a baseball field...Just a guess.  i could easily see various lights flickering that were in a circular arrangement around a spherical shaped object consisting of several levels. light streamed out off of the various colored lights. the best i can remember is that the colors were blue, yellow, reddish-pink and various colors of white. \r\n\r\nnot long after we pulled off the road, we decided to move our pickup forward up the highway past the trees to get a better look. just at that time the object moved quickly north and behind a bluff.  we were unable to see it again.\r\n\r\nduring this time our son remained asleep. we were shaking until we reached the cabin. once there we each took crayons and pencils and drew pictures in separate rooms to see how similar they were. when we say each others pictures they were quite similar. he had more light coming off the craft from underneath.  i slept soundly that night, but my husband said he was restless all night and felt the cabin shake. i didn't have any recollection of the cabin shaking. \r\n\r\ntoday some 34 years later it is still vivid to me.Some details of the ship are lost, but the lights, the size, the lack of sound, the location and the feeling i had at the time are still very real today. i am still surprised we sat in the middle of the hwy for so long, not thinking about being hit, and with not other traffic to speak of.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Hovering then

at fire during the daylight but it was full dark.  it wasn't as bright as fire would bye at night and there were no flames trailing.  all color was contained in what appeared to be a perfect circle.  the craft appeared to be approximately 3000 ft. altitude, from 1 to 3 miles away, cruising straight and level at between 180 and 220 knots, north to south.  it was silent.  a neighbors dog, in the

craft in my career that i don't have any idea what it was.  i called the port orange police department to see if they had any other reports of strange flying objects.  they didn't have any other reports however they did send an officer to take my report.  the next day i called the daytona tower to find out if they had any information on the event.  the man i talked to said he was personally in the tower at the time, 2035, the previous night and had seen nothing.  he was snide and condescending.  i expected  more from another aviation professional.  from the direction the craft came from it should have flown by the kdab tower.  it was in there airspace when i first noticed it.  after that experience, being disbelieved by the air traffic controller, i dropped the issue.  for some reason i am compelled to report the incident now. so i have.  note that the month and day are very approximate.  it was a long time ago.  the time of day is correct.

feeling of arousal.  i awoke because of these feelings and wondered why i had them because the dreams i was having didn���t coincide with them.  they wouldn���t subside.  i thought this was highly unusual so i decided to get up and take a look around to see if i could find anything that may be causing this.  i didn���t see anything in the house, but my instincts told me to look out the back door (i live in a national forest & my backyard is the forest).  i saw nothing to my left nor in front of me but there, there to the right, there it was.  i couldn���t believe it.  nearly 150��� away and 20��� off the ground was an orange orb.  i thought that since i saw it and made a noise opening the sliding glass door and its accompanying screen door it would disappear but it didn���t.  i still had those feelings and i was becoming aggravated.  never had i experienced a duration of this sensation that wasn���t prompted by what is considered usual/normal.   the orb looked like it was about 3���wide at the distance i was viewing it.  i kept looking at it trying to observe if there were any changes in it or if i could seen anything around it even a plausible shadow.  if i had to speculate on a speculation it would seem that the orb provoked a situation that produced energy and by its reaction it seemed to collect the energy.  i have ready many things and i find that orbs are around volcanoes, are seen at earthquake faults, have been photographed around children playing, and have been around a mine cave-in in which minors lost their lives.  i have heard on a popular t.V. show���to paraphrase, the gods came down from the sky, we received technology from them, and we have offered blood sacrifice.  in a blood sacrifice energy is given off.  i wonder how much a person or group of persons would offer up in exchange for technology.\r\nthe things i noticed about the orb were that it had a hard edge to it.  by that i mean that it had no haze surrounding it; the light didn���t extend beyond its parameter.  it was enveloped in the forests blackness.  i saw a couple of very interesting things about this orb that really struck me.  the first was that: if you would imagine yourself putting your finger in the centre and drew a craggy line from that point to the outer edge then another from the same starting point to the orbs edge separated by about 10 degrees that section was brighter than the sections that weren���t in the craggy areas.  this one was at the 2:00 o���clock position.  there was another of these with lesser degrees at the 7:00 o���clock position. when viewing the orb i saw no change in it and i wondered why it was there and i wondered why it enabled me to view it for so long.  since it was there i thought ���ok, let���s play���.  i looked at it and tried to direct intense energy toward it.  it flared up with the craggy sections lighting up even more brightly than the rest of the orb.  i repeated this several times and the orb duplicated its action each time.  i wondered if i was going to make it angry or curious.  i didn���t want to make it come closer.   i ran into the other room where i had my night vision stored.  i looked through it and saw nothing yet, when i put the night vision down, i saw the orb.  i repeated this several times all with the same result.  i found out that this was because night vision sees low energy and the orb was high energy.  i was growing tired and ceased trying to send energy to it.  i was delighted when my feelings of arousal had ended.  the second interesting thing was that the very instant my physical feelings ended the orb immediately turned white.  it flickered white like a like a short circuit would act.  each time that it flickered more of it seemed to be gone until finally only part of its rim showed then it completely flicked out.  i slipped off to bed.  on succeeding nights i looked out and didn���t see it at the times i went out.  i took a metal detector out on the 14th.  the detector didn���t pick up anything and i didn���t see anything on the ground or surrounding plants unless i missed something but i did notice that the air was electrified.  the hair on my arms reacted.\r\njune 27, 2013\r\nat 2:03 a.M.  i awoke to a calling out of something i never heard before.  again, i live in the woods and i���m familiar with the sounds of the forest.  these calls were broadcast at regular spaced intervals and had a faint human quality to it.  i woke my husband and asked if he heard anything.  he said he never heard anything like it and that it sounded really, really scary.  we stayed in place and continued to listen for a while for further calls.  the onset of each call was preceded with a strong heavy rasp.  the last of its calls was followed by coyotes that seemed to surround the caller.  every now and then we have a call from a coyote or two but nothing like this.  they ceased shortly after.\r\njuly 10, 2013\r\ni woke up to intermittent regularly intervaled whistles at 2:18 a.M.  the interesting thing about these short blast whistles was that they were as strong from the onset as at their termination.  people build up their whistle as the air being propelled from our lungs builds making the whistle louder then it diminishes in volume upon expelling the last of the oxygen taken in.  these whistles weren���t that way at all.  i lay in bed hearing three more.  i got up to get my parabolic dish.  i tried not to make any noise but on a hardwood floor that is almost impossible.  the whistles stopped immediately.  after the whistling stopped i only heard 1 or 2 coyote calls followed by one dog bark.  i don���t ever recall hearing a dog bark just once.\r\njuly 11, 2013\r\nafter the most recent activity early, around noon, i thought i���d take a little walk around the property.  on the side of the house, the same side where the orb was seen and the sounds heard i found a footprint that was 14.5��� long and 6.5��� wide.  it was a barefoot left print.  i���m a pretty heavy person and under the same moisture conditions i can���t leave a print that is more than .25��� deep.  the deep spots of this print were the heel and the ball areas of the print were near 2.5��� deep.  the grade the print was on was about 35 degrees and there were no claw marks.  the area was pretty dark but the print was fresh.  i put my fingers into the print and felt the toes and felt deeper impressions in the track where they should be making someone faking the print really too difficult.  i saw no slippage with the footprint.  enclosed you will see an enhanced photo.  it has been enhanced because the area was too dark to get an otherwise good view of it.  \r\njuly 12, 2013\r\nnot long ago i took a mini vacation with my husband to mt. lassen, ca where we saw sulfur being expectorated from the mountain side.  i walked out into the backyard patio around 5:00 p.M.  the smell of sulfur was so strong that i couldn���t take a breath in and had to go inside.  my husband asked that i close all of the windows.  i lit a match in the house and its odor was identical to what was outside.  hours later the odor seemed to be in front of the house now.  i went to bed at around 10:00 p.M. and the scent remained.  i never got up again to see when it dissipated.\r\n","distance":"101-500

what was alarming it seemed very low, and there are not any airports near by that would manage a jet this large, and this low. as i traveled closer i realized this thing had no wings and looked like a blimp.I am very familiar of the size, and colors of blimps in my area because i'm close to daytona, and there are always blimps in the area for the daytona 500. what was odd typically there is a cockpit under the blimp, and steering fins on the back. this had neither, and there were not any markings what so ever..The object from approx 1.5 miles south looked as large as a blimp and a half. \r\nas i got closer i noticed a dome on top of the object, and noticed the object was a tan/pewter, or beige in color. no wings or lights. as it flew over the interstate traffic seemed to slow down significantly possibly due to the object, but i'm not sure. the object seemed to be moving about the speed a small aircraft may go. once if flew over the interstate it flew over a wooded area and made a 90 degree turn to the north. this happened rapidly, and once again not wings, or lights were observed. at this point the object seemed to descend closer to the tree tops, and i loss site at that

extremely slow and didn't make a sound. i was so confused as to what i was seeing. i actually got my wife and told her to look at what i was seeing. she was carrying my daughter because at this moment

to bring her back inside. when my wife went back inside i stood on the deck watching this object slowly move in a north west direction. i could remember vividly the object blocking out the stars as it was moving. i saw 3 white lights on both sides of the longer side of the rectangle shaped object, one light in the middle of both sides of the shorter side of the rectangle shape and a white and red light center of the object. the lights were steady. i just kept looking at it until i couldn't see it anymore. as soon as i went inside my house we just kept talking about what we just saw. i never in

headlights on vehicle, bur no beam emitted.   very ultra modern as it was july or august of  1968, and i have not seen anything this modern to this date except in movies.  no propellor. no thrust, so how it stayed up no idea. more modern than space shuttle oe stealth planes that i have seen.  similar look of robots on moon or mars but much bigger, and we cut have easily hit it with a mid size rock real hard.  about 15-20ft wide, 10-12ft ht., 30 ft length.  no signs of any on board, no portholes to see from.  no abduction, but surely they knew we were only 20 ft. on road watching them go over power lines at a speed of only 5 or so mile per hour.     i have talked with folks that suggested possibly recharging some sort of power system, as they were only about 5 ft above power lines.  we did not follow it for some reason as it headed down road in steady direction.  we just watched it in amazement as it west down the power lines.     here it is almost 46 years later this summer of 2014, and i still think about it most every day..  never to this date i have not seen anything in real life that modern, as it makes what i have seen then seem rather antiquated, and that was 1968.  obviously very advanced beings, no fear to us, but will probably never know who or where they were from.  more modern than any thing i have ever seen till now.  this is the truth.  advanced beings and

there were no strobes, no aircraft marking lights, going at an incredible speed, yet there was no trail of light. the object went completely dark. i stood up hoping to catch a view of where it would be if it reappeared in the same direction of travel, and at the last 2 seconds of view, it lit up again with the same exact color. i reported the sighting to the 193 special operations wing at hia - harrisburg international airport - due to the fact that i was concerned about the potential for an accident with other aircraft -- about 1 hour later. it took me a long time to decide that i should report it to somebody. they were very cordial and took down my witnessed event. they suggested that i report it to my local leos, which we both chuckled at and i politely declined. \r\ni'm contacting your organization because i feel that this event should also be documented with you. it's almost been a week now & i've concluded that even though it demonstrated many characteristics of a meteorite,

this being nothing more than another meteorite.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:11","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

west when i noticed a huge bright light hoovering in a large soybean field ...My husband at the time dismissed it as a large combine needed for collection of soybeans,, the light was so bright i just kept looking as we pulled onto hwy 30 heading west suddenly the bright very quickly was behind the car hoovering in the passenger side view ..It was as large as a football field and had multiple lights bright surrounded the middle and a large dome light on the bottom had windows all around tho i did not see any beings,,,the huge thing followed the car started sputtering and the radio went into like the am mode i kept screaming to my husband to out run it in a super panic mode and he said he had it to the floor but the car would not get over 20 my husband then stated if we live for another half mile we were pulling into what then was his moms house to see this huge thing but of course i was in extreme panic and just wanted to go home we then sputtered to almost his moms driveway with my eyes on it the entire time it then shifted like up in the air in a blink paused and like a flash it went north like a zip never seen that thing since but it has forever impacted my life as a huge fear of traveling after dark and the largeness of the object made me think we were powerless the closest ive ever seen to the size of that thing was the movie indepence day the large craft that appeared was the exact size it was a city and i know they exsist bigger than a disc ...Did not have a camera would have never thot anyway but i wasnt the only witness as the object appeared again further down hwy 30 hoovering again and a friend heard me talikg about it and she came out excited and loud saying she saw it too at or before sunrise","distance":"21-100

left in sky caught my attention since they were only lites in sky at about 530am it is now 610 and it is still there and no other lights in sky to be seen in any direction and where it is stationed no regular airplanes use other than helicopters for weather or traffic or emergencies or summertime private planes.I have reported same object lites before and was asked to take photos .My cel phone shows poorly i asked many friends for a good camers all have newer cel phones but no good cameras and so i cannot send u  good pictures.I cannot afford any hipowered photo equipment-unfortunately--retired-on social security income only.This is second sighting this week -i do not always report because as an oil painter am busy early hours-old people do not sleep late!  i never lose site of object,i just do not sit or stand there for long periods of time ---like now i just looked in direction it was at and at this time 624am it has left .Don't know if this report helps you professional observers .I have nothing to gain by any of these sightings but find them interesting and most of all why more people than a few ladies in my apt.Building have not reported sightings? i think most do not have time to get involved or worried to tell any one. i think if i were not retired i would not have time for this either. respectfuly ,anthony","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

no other lights were displayed by the helicopter , approximately 50 feet behind the copter was the object , in trail as if following it , i watched the copter overfly my home and disappeared beyond my vision over the treeline behind my home , i did not see the object re-appear after it winked out as soon as i first observed it , all this happened on my front porch of my home , it was very dark outside and       no moonlight or other type of light was observable at the time , this is not the first time i have observed strange lights or military craft in the area of my home and i am firmly
