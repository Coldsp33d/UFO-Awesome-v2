when nothing different happened, we finally went inside, but the objects had not completely stopped appearing when we stopped watching.  when i saw the first object, i thought perhaps it was a weather balloon being launched, though why there would be a pulsing hum i could not figure out.  but when the objects just kept appearing, probably for about 10 minutes, i could not believe so many weather balloons would be launched from the same place at one time.  i did not feel fear or dread, just curiosity, and a bit of amazement.  i fully expected to see or hear an explanation of the event on the news the next morning, but i have seen and heard nothing at all to date. regarding the video i took with my iphone, sadly i cannot seem to email it to myself so i can save it to my computer hard drive, and cannot get it to publish to youtube.  but i would love to be able to share it so that this event can be fully investigated.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":54338,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.08498890293395,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02272014-0020","longitude":-80.1702221769364,"occurred":1388286000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North Carolina","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1393560556000,"summary":"A series of perhaps 50 amber, glowing orbs rose into the sky one after another with a pulsing sound, then dispersed and disappeared from view.","tags":["sound","pulsing"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"27107","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":61,"locationName":"Winston-Salem, North Carolina","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:194662"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Pembroke Dock","country":"United Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was woke from my sleep by my wife she asked me what is that noise. all i could hear was a deep tone hum, so i looked out of the bedroom window to see what was making the noise and could not see anything, so i opened the window to get a better look. the hum was still continuing just one long tone. i was leaning out the window to get a better look the road was quiet (being a dead end no through traffic ) all i could hear was the hum no other sounds not even bird song that we can usually at that time of morning. by now the hum had been going on for 15 to 20 minuets. not sure if was the hum or just that i was still half a sleep but it was getting difficult to think or focus my thoughts. then there was 3 bright white flashes as if someone had set a camera flash off in my face 3 times in a row with only a second between each flash, as soon as the 3rd flash happened the hum just stopped and then i could hear bird song and the sound of light traffic in the distance but no moving cars in my road or other roads close by. went back to bed with a mild headache.

size of the north star. my eyes were immediately drawn to the color as i've never seen an aircraft with that color light. the light was just hovering in the sky then quickly moved to the left of its original position. traveled about 12 inches {from my view}. at this time - it was behind a palm tree but you could still see it partially through the leaves. it then hovered for about 10 seconds and made another quick move to the left {about 4 inches}and and made approx a 90 degree fast turn up and stopped. it then came back the same exact way to the right and once again i had an obstructed view with palm trees. stayed at that location for approx 10 seconds and the object began to change colors from electric blue to a bright pink then just disappeared.I had my daughter grab my cell which has a video camera and managed to take a quick video. i had to lay on the floor of the balcony to capture the image {between palm tree leaves} but could not get a good view. because the view was so poor - i was unable to capture the object turning pink. everyone was amazed at that point. approximately 15 minutes later, my daughter noticed that the object was back but it was dimmer and farther southwest than the first time sighted. i took my phone and ran to the pool area {5th floor} and watched the object get brighter {electric blue}the object hovered and began to pulsate pink and blue {the video attached is very shaky, the object was stationary for the most part, the movement was from me holding camera phone}as the object hovered and pulsated pink and blue it began to descend at a slow pace. unfortunately, the descent i did not capture, i was trying to watch with my naked eyes and camera at same time. it descended out of my view behind a building.  {the video isnt that great and seeing the object in person had better clarity}there are 2 videos attached with this sighting - 1 fast and crappy and 1 in better condition. you'll notice the object get larger - that was me zooming in.\r\n\r\n2nd sighting -same night about 40 minutes later.\r\nafter witnessing the first event, i decided to walk to the beach to see if i could see it again, hopefully to get a better view and also to see if anyone was on the beach, possibly flying a remote helicopter - no one was on beach... i stood on the beach and looked around the sky. lots of stars, crescent moon. i looked to my south west position over the gulf and saw nothing. within 5 minutes a red faint blinking light appeared. i started to video but could not capture on video because it was too faint. as i watched this light it then became two lights. the original light was still faint red but the second light was brighter. the objects just sort of sat in the same position. i began to video and you 'll see 3/4 through the video both lights. i also made sure to put a high rise building in view at times {to the right} i videoed for about 2 minutes and eventually the objects moved slowly out of view to the right, past the buildings.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":54327,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":25.9397412,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02272014-0009","longitude":-81.7075355,"occurred":1393142400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1393529890000,"summary":"2 separate sightings , same night, both with diff characteristics","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/54327_submitter_file1__jjjjjjjj316.mp4","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/54327_submitter_file2__jjjjjjjj322.mp4","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/54327_submitter_file3__jjjjjjjj326.mp4"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":4,"locationName":"Marco Island, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:194672"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Moose Lake","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was on the shore of north moose lake ten minutes from where i live and i have lived in this area all my life so i know this area real well i was out bird watching that day and immediately i noticed this huge ufo. knew right away it didn't belong there. bought my camera home and down loaded them onto my computer to have a better look at it and to my amazement i saw this ufo hovering over the lake nothing like i have ever seen before and in broad daylight. i contacted a elder who lives nearby he came over too see the photos and i asked him where i was taking these picture he knew the location immediately. he assured me that not even a cruise liner would be able to keep afloat in these waters not even in the middle of our lake its to shallow for anything that huge. my dad went out the next day to check it out with his quad and binoculars he seen it and then he dropped his cap from his lens he bent over to pick it up and when he stood up straight to take another look through his binoculars it was gone. i have held on to this photographs for 2 yrs not showing the public or media not know what to do with them. but i know what i have captured and i know for a fact that these photos can be used for science and investigating. wanting to sell them if the price is right.

disappeared at tree top level. \r\nthe angle at which i first observed it and to where it disappeared  made it look as if it were about 1/2 mile north of the interstate. from the time it formed to the time i made my closest approach was probably a minute or less. i fully expected to see the fire of an airplane crash and had already mentally prepared myself to view some really horrific injuries. when i made my closest point of approach there was nothing there. i could see some houses throught the trees, but all was quiet.\r\nthe second event was much like the first. in oklahoma, on interstate

i saw 3 red lights moving in unison toward me and i heard a low roaring sound. the way the lights appeared was a different configuration than i have ever seen on an airplane.\r\n\r\ni ran inside and got my girlfriend. the lights flew over my neighbor's house, 2 houses west of us and as it passed 3 streets south of us a few more red lights suddenly turned on.  we watched a row of red lights drift in a south west direction for a couple minutes before i couldn't see them anymore yet i could still hear the roar. the light formation was half the width of the neighborhood block.\r\n\r\ni ran inside and told my mother. less than 5 minutes later i walked back outside and heard the roaring sound again, louder. i looked up and flying directly over me, coming from the east, i clearly saw a dark v-shape with  four red lights underneath each side of it forming a v. the same red lights i saw before. there are 50 ft palm trees in the front yard and the object was at least 100-150 ft from the ground. it sharply turned south when it was 2 houses west of me and followed the same path i saw the first time.\r\n\r\nas it flew away i noticed that the object appeared completely flat with nothing visible besides the red lights. across the street from me is fresno high school and the outdoor lights that illuminate the track/field were on since dozens of people were exercising out there. i was shocked that i clearly saw a dark v-shape against the night sky and it moved quite slow. if i had a bike i could have kept up with its speed. i lost sight of it after a couple minutes. i even ran out into the front street with my mother to get a better look.\r\n\r\nit wasn't until then that i realized that the row of lights i saw fly away the first time formed a v pattern too. i was stunned. by the time i realized i should chase after it in my car, it was gone. i was unable to get any pictures with my phone. within 10 minutes, a small airplane and a helicopter flew back and forth over the object's path.\r\n\r\nthe next day (2-25-14) i found out online that pictures were taken across town of a glowing disc shaped object just 1 hour before my sighting and a few days prior, seven glowing objects were also seen/ photographed in the same area as the disc. \r\n\r\ni know what airplanes look like and the object i saw not only dwarfed any plane i have ever seen, it also flew as slow and low as the local police helicopter does.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional
