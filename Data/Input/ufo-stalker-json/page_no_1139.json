( very vivid memory of this. ) that is when i finally woke up just shaking with fear. i've thought about doing the hypnosis thing to see what really happened but have not. i didn't tell anybody about this for about 3 years. i tried to convince myself for some time that it was a dream, but i could not deny the reality of the alien encounter. i once read a book ( i forget the title ) about ufo sightings and there was only one sighting among the stories that were in washington state. the sighting was of a ufo seen by mt rainier on the same date as my encounter. i also read about the hundreds of uso's that were seen coming out of the water by many witnesses around santa monica california earlier that same evening which spurred a lot of calls to the police in the area. my only child was born exactly 10 years to the day of this event.

looking across the street i saw between the pine trees a star like object going up behind the pine trees and slowly continuing upward to the night sky. it continued its path upward to the curve of the night sky and disappeared. as i watched it, i was not in fear but in awe as to what it was. i wanted to take a picture of it, but figured by the time i got back with my camera it would be gone. so i just watched it until it disappeared. it seemed to go into the blackness of the night sky. after it disappeared i waited to see if anything else would happen and since nothing did i went back inside my home with the dog. i was still in awe after it left and to this day puzzled as to what it was. \r\n\r\nprior to this event, about a week before i was taking my cat to get clipped and dipped and while passing the block called under hill rd. there was a white truck that was marked flood clean up. i did not pay too much attention to it and went on my way. about 3 hours later on the way back to pick up my cat, i went the same way and that same truck was in the same spot on the same road. there was kind of a haze around it and i had the feeling that if i turned down that road that something weird would happen to me. in this area there is a man made hill that goes out to babcock st. and unless you walk up the hill you can't see what lies beyond. so again to this day i am wondering what i saw and if the two incidents are related in some way.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

flight path of the nieghboring airport for mainland departing flights and as they got closer they didnt have any marker lights and werent omiting any sound what so ever.They seemed to be about2to 3 hundred feet apart and about 1,000 ft when closest to our location.When just in front of us they changed direction and started heading due north and were just as bright departing in that direction as they were approaching.Could not make out objects definition because of the brightnes of objects.They then seemed to slowly disappear as they proceeded toward the evening horizen,actually looked as they were slowly going into the water.My wife and i were at aw ,at what we just observed.Never saw anything of the sort b4.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

cigarette, when suddenly my wife pointed and said, \"what the f is that\"!!!???  i turned around and immediately noticed a huge glowing reddish orange object flying north to south over las cruces, n.M. just a couple hundred yards away from us. the object at this time was a couple hundred feet off the ground moving north to south in a slight diagonal downward direction. it came to a stop approximately less than 100 feet off the ground and passed parallel from me and my wife a few hundred yards away from us. it then started moving east going away from us in an upward diagonal direction.  once the object started moving away from us, it no longer had the red and orange glow, but instead it looked like a star moving through the sky with a random bright and dim fluttering light.  as i was waiting to lose sight of it, expecting it to fly past and behind the organ mountains, it suddenly started to descend somewhere near the organ mountains. i eventually lost sight of the object as it had descended lower than my line of view over the houses. my wife was able to capture a few of the bright flutters from the object on her cell phone before we lost view of the object.  at this point my wife decided to grab her digital camera in case we saw anything else and in less than 10 minutes my wife pointed out another big reddish orange object directly north of us, coming directly towards us! again the object was moving from north to south in a downward diagonal direction.  the object flew/floated directly over us less than 100 feet. as it was directly over us, there was no longer a huge glow. neither my wife or i were able to make out any kind of shape to the object, almost as if it was transparent.  the only thing i saw was what looked to be little bits of fire flames coming off the object. the object then stopped almost directly above us and changed directions moving in a slight upward diagonal direction moving northeast. just like the first object, once this one was moving away from us it wasn't glowing red and orange but instead looked like a star with random bright and dim flutters. i eventually lost sight of the object as it flew away northeast of us. neither objects had any sound as they flew. completely silent! both objects also flew from downtown las cruces to the organ mountains in about 1 minute with no sound. from downtown las cruces to the organ mountains is approximately 15 miles. on top of the cell phone video of the first object, my wife was able to capture 3 digital photos of the 2nd object.  in the video you will notice a constant bright light.  look directly to the right of the bright light and you will see the object flutter right before and after a car passes by on the video.  i can't honestly tell you what i saw because i truly don't know what it was, but i can say with confidence that this was something special and out of the ordinary!

(i dont know how long that times was.) the craft took of with very little or no sound at all and as the night sky was very clear we could see it's path for probably 50 miles or so. it cleared that distance on a even smooth curved path out over lake michigan in less than three or four seconds.\r\n\r\never since than i have always been interested in any explanation of what i (and my friend and

only a few small details.\r\n\r\none big point i have now is that of all i have heard or read about, the triangular ufo sightings are not all that uncommon, but this event happened in 1974, and all

party. we both exited out the side gate of our property, and before getting into the car, we both noticed a dullish red/orange spherical object through the trees over the river in front of our house. i was about 200 feet from where we stood, travelling e about 5mph, maybe 80ft above the river. throughout this description, please keep in mind that we were pretty much seeing this thing from only one side. \r\n\r\nthe object was about the size of a vw beetle car, and was not exactly round, but a round/diamond shape. the exterior was a lighted transparent orange/red color with a whitish/yellow bright orb visible in the center to top of the shape. the shape had an open top where you could see the center ball of light not only through the orange/red shape, but above the open top as well. there were a couple of dark lines that ran horizontally across the side of the object. looking very closely, you could also see what i would almost describe as a wing, or fin on the front off to the side, down below the object. it was very transparent, barely red or orange in color, and kind of shimmering with tiny lights. both my daughter and i were completely mesmerized by the sight, and kept repeating \"what is that\". because it was so close to us, it was very easy to see.\r\n\r\nas it moved to the ne, following the river, it ascended rather steeply. it was at that time that i remembered my cell phone camera, and got a video as it ascended into the sky. it was when it was high up in the sky that it started to pulsate and then i noticed another pulsating light not far from the one we witnessed. they disappeared into the sky.\r\n\r\ni thought about pursuing it, but by then it was too high up in the sky. i have never in all my life seen anything like this, and since that time, have

only when the end of it passed over me toward the south south-east. it was moving slowly at a steady pace. there was no noise and my dog did not become aware of it.\r\n  the rear edge became clear and sharp as the bright sky appeared behind it. the shape revealed to me was circular and its thickness was defined by a clear, straight, vertical line which connected the two circular edges which i assumed to be the top and bottom of the shape.\r\n  \r\n  using basic triangular math, this object, if at an altitude of 500 ft. had to be 500+ ft. in diameter. it \"felt\" to me that the object was about 800-1,000 ft. high, which would increase the object's dimensions greatly.\r\n\r\na personal word:  i am male, and at the time of this observance, i was 54 years old and in great health. my eyesight was above average at 20/10 vision. as a member of the u.S. army i served in korea during 1954-56. i became familiar with daytime and nighttime flights of the air force near the border (dmz) with north korea.  \r\nafter the military, i worked for a large civilian airline (twa) in chicago, both at midway and o'hare airports. i worked at o'hare when the boeing 707 was introduced to commercial flight. during those years i worked the night shift exclusively. i was able to discern the types of aircraft in flight at night, as did the majority of my fellow employees. \r\n\r\n  the strangest part of this to me is that i did not become excited! my dog and i merely crossed the street and went home. i mentioned it to no one, not even my wife. i never completely forgot the experience but it didn't seem important until i was at that corner again with my neighbors, months later, and i felt excitement for the first time when i was telling them about it.\r\n  i should have been shouting about this to the rooftops!  several of my friends, twa pilots and crew, had privately shared tales of ufo's back in the late '50's, so i knew of ufo's and should have been quite excited, but at the time it felt just \"ordinary\"!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

temperatures (at this point we lived off of hurstbourne- now we live in the bowman field area). we were looking at the sky and witnessed a grouping of three, perfectly spaced lights which were initially still, then began traveling south. the speed varied, as it was slow in the beginning, barely moving, then they sped up. at one point there was a directional change as though they simply pivoted in the sky. that was when we realized we were looking at something entirely different than we've seen before. the pivot then had them facing more of an east-west direction. they just simply stopped and smoothly did a turn from the stand-still. they didn't travel far after their directional change but, while we were watching, one the light on the right simply went dim and the light on the left moved toward the light in the center until they were presumably \"one\". we didn't make any assumptions as to what these lights were as we watched the now, brighter light fade into the night. it's hard to say, but to paraphrase, i think the flight pattern was this: 3 lights moving southward, the pivot happened, three lights moving east (toward us, slightly, though not close to us by any means). the right one faded, the left joined the middle, then the joined pair traveled southwest. it was pretty incredible and we were both in awe for a moment. to this day we speak casually about the \"ufo\" we saw that night- the fact of the matter is that we weren't hurt. we were filled with a sense of wonder and somehow, it was very peaceful. i believe the stories of those who have witnessed strange lights in louisville, and i hope that people still look to the sky at night. louisville's a beautiful city and there's nothing for us to fear.\r\n\r\n*i should note that i now live next to a small airport (i did not at the time of the sighting), however i have seen nothing since then that remotely resembles what was in the sky that night. i'm used to seeing aircraft and it is my true

several different ufo's occurrences for nearly an hour which for me is extremely unusual, but it is the very last sighting of that evening i am wanting to really report first even though the other sightings are important too.\r\n\r\ni had just moved to mesa, az in 2009 and decided to take some pictures of the full moon, so i set up my camera's tripod on the porch waiting for the full moon to get into view.  during that time, i was looking around in the sky when i started seeing these things occurring in the sky which for the whole evening  i had a total of  eight separated ufo sightings. in the last sighting around 8:34 pm which is what i really want to report, i was watching the sky towards the west when i saw what appeared to me to be a large flock of black color birds flying towards my direction at a very low altitude. i thought that flock of birds might be a good picture to take with the twilight slowly fading away in that direction where the sun had recently just set.  so i  peered via the camera's eyepiece viewer which the nikon camera had a 300mm telephoto lens attached to it.  what i saw traversing towards my location literally surprised me when i was only expecting a flock of birds flying in a tight group and at a low altitude.\r\n\r\n  what i saw was absolutely bizarre and i had never seen anything like it before in my entire life-- one section of it appeared to be a very dim red light similar to a dim led light which had on each side of it two larger pure black sphere objects attached to the dim red light.  additionally, there was at least 50 of these things flying together in a group at equal short distant flying in perfect unison in a flatten diamond shape pattern.  furthermore, i thought i could see through between the spaces of these objects and faintly see the background behind it.  at that point, the object(s) started to get out of my view which i lifted up the camera and quickly relocated the camera to the north wall; in the process, someone was walking down the sidewalk, and i startled him.\r\n\r\n the man looked at me, then saw me looking though the camera, so he looked in that direction. he stared in that direction at the object for at least 5 seconds then looked back at me in surprise, then quickly continued on with his walking. to the naked eye, it may had looked like a flock of birds, but if he had looked through my camera's lens, he would had seen what i was seeing which i didn't tell him.  i began taking pictures of the object as it was traversing, but what i didn't realize at the moment that my iso film speed wasn't set correctly for low light condition.\r\n\r\n  during the entire time, i never heard any noise being produced from the object. the object went directly over my head and started to make a sweeping turn. at that point, i lifted my camera up again trying to take pictures of it. i then relocated the camera to the west wall. when i looked up into the sky on the west wall side, i saw (with my own eyes) the object now appearing to have an extremely long \"v\" shape wing something like two rulers joint together to form a slight angle. it was somewhat similar to an stretched out boomerang shape. the dark color wings looked very skinny to me almost like a glider wing, very long and slender, and somewhat smoothly curved at the end.  i was also having a hard time trying to determine if it had actually a solid, black color wing since it almost seem like i could see through it. the object glided over me so slowly that i thought it was almost hovering over me for a brief moment. what shocked me even more was the distant in altitude this ufo was located in the sky.  i originally thought this object was at a low altitude like just above the rooftops, but it was in fact located at least and nearly three miles up in the air. i speculate that the total wingspan of this object was at least 100 yards in distant. the size of this object also appeared to me to be possibly 3 times the size of an 727a commercial jetliner. \r\n\r\n this object had no fuselage but just pure flying wings.  i seen gliders before, and they have a fuselage, this object didn't. this object didn't even resemble closely any b-2 nor even a b-17 jet.  what was interesting that this unknown object came from the direction of the phoenix's sky-harbor airport and curved towards the gateway airport located in gilbert, az. the unknown object as it traveled in that direction just seem to get quickly smaller and melt away or blend into the darkness located in that direction.\r\nof all the pictures i had taken, only one picture somewhat manage to come out showing either multiple objects or multiples pictures on just one picture due to trying to adjust the exposure towards the end of the event. \r\n\r\ni lived in mesa, az for nearly three years after that incident, and after i knew every normal bird flight pattern going though the area, and every plane and jet  pattern in the sky either high or low, and i have not once seen anything like that unknown object since that time. after that sighting, i had also experienced additional ufo sightings more than one person could possibly ever imagine one would be able to experience in a lifetime. i have now moved to a different city which is quite, but while i lived at in mesa, az, it was the hottest ufo hotspot if i ever saw one. the only ufo type i haven't technically seen thus far is that disk shape type...Well maybe if the huge angry looking eye object counts as one, and that one quite literally scared me pure white as a ghost, and i had to force myself to look into the camera's eyepiece.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

problems in the neighborhood with the local chapter of future felons of america i keep a few cameras out with monitors in the house. via the monitor it appeared there was someone in the pasture so i went out to deal with them. i saw multiple objects ranging in size from perhaps a basketball to a small car! they objects emited lights that changed apparently randomly to every conceivable color in the spectrum! they appeared 2-3 at a time. manuevered in apparently random yet controlled (if that makes sense) manners. as they varied wildly in speed & direction yet hit no obstructions ie trees powerlines, my barn etc! it was the strangest thing! i took many pictures & shot a lot of video and upon reviewwing the video i had considerable static in the audio!! i have never had this static on other ocassions & could not replicate it! the objects would come and move about individually or pairs and i saw trees and powerlines on both sides so i know what size & range they were. my animals were in the barn silently staring at eachother! the objects would vary speed, direction, color, brightness and altitude! i am a fairly observant individual so i noted everything i could & i had heard a helecopter an hour earlier and while i was watching this show an aircraft passed at altitude leaving a visable contrail. i could see its lights & knew it to be a passenger/cargo jet. when i saw these lights higher up! they appeared similar to the objects seen before me but were higher up. at times they would pass above the jet contrail being dimmed by it, other times apparently below it. their speed was almost as amazing as everything else about them. i saw one traverse 3/4 of the sky in about 2 seconds, literally! then at speed make a 90 deg turn! and yet another & head back to its original point of origin! i watched these for id guesss about two hrs until the last one appeared to lift vertically then pause for a second or two & upon emitting a flash of light depart at an incredible speed!!!!! these were not lantern kites, balloons, reflections off swamp gas nor a comet!! i'm not claiming them to be anything.. i would like to know what they were.. its rather upsetting
