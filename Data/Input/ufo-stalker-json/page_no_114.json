louis, city.  also, on the porch was a lady that just had a baby and her husband was coming up the back steps having gone to the store.\r\nreason for being on the back porch was this was before the days most people had air conditioning.  the building was a brick 4 family with flat tar roof.  you didn’t want to be inside when it was 90 degrees outside.  so people were on the back porch, 2nd story.  \r\neveryone was just looking/staring off the back porch in the hot summer heat.  then from the right field of vision, horizontally, i.E. from east to west came 6 objects.  i seen them first and said, “look flying saucers”.  today i refer to them as ufos.  \r\nthey came in at a speed that put them into a blur and stopped instantly on a dime, so to speak.\r\nthey were no more than 35 yards away and were a gold luminescent color.  there was no sound.  the really strange thing was even though they were gold luminescent and were bright they gave off no light like a light bulb would.  \r\nthey were in a formation.  they were oval shape.  i would say approximately each one was a yard wide by 2 feet high.\r\nthey looked like they were slightly shaking when stopped but there was no sound.  they were there for approximately 15 seconds.  they then shot off behind the tree.  we waited for them to come out the other side and they never did.  the tree was full of leaves in the summer.\r\nas i said they were about 35 yards away and only slightly higher than a second story porch.  this was in the middle of a city.  i.E. st. louis.  this was not in the swamps of louisiana were some one could say it was swamp gas.  it wasn’t far off in the distance where someone could say it was venus.  they were close.\r\ni watch the ufo programs on the history channel and only once have ever seen anyone talk about ufos like the ones i seen.\r\nthey were only two dimensional, there was no depth at the angle we seen the ufos. we were looking north. as i said they came in from the east and exited west behind the tree.\r\n\r\nthe thing that makes this sighting even more extraordinary is that when you think about what is said above you realize there were six ufos and there were six of us on the back porch.  i don’t remember seeing anyone else anywhere at that time. not in other backyards or on the street.  and this is in the middle of the city.  also they were in an overall oval shape and each one was oval individually.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

off from abq airport from east to west.Then it did it again , a flash so i ran inside and got the binoculars..It's cloudless and clear tonight at that time over albuquerque nm ...When i looked through binoculars i saw it flash again but there was this smaller round one right next to it near the back of this thing and it smaller one dimly flashed at the bigger one in a pale dim blue color and then the big one flashed again in this bright bluish turquoise light from the back end and it shot out a bolt of light or electricity and into the smaller one from the backwards end/tip .When this happened i could see it light up the side of this thing .. when it did i could see this thing ,it looked like a long silver cigar shaped thing which had no other lights to it that i could see. it had three dark round windows and it was facing me pointing and a little to its turned right i could see three round windows the one in the middle was bigger but they were dark black.. right about then a jet was going in same direction over head \" west\" at this time the smaller round one shot off to the right/ north so fast i couldn't follow it with my binoculars or my eyes, i remember looking the way it went without binoculars and it was so fast i couldn't even turn my head fast enough. in all my life i have never seen anything move that fast! . at this time the cigar shaped craft was quickly dimmed from the back end which reminded me of a hot piece of metal cooling off and cooling down and as it did i could see it turning away from  \" my right, it's left\" and fading off in the west direction.  i stayed there for about 20 min looking through binoculars trying to see if could see this thing but i couldn't. i went back outside a few more time but by then it started getting cloudy and i have

along with several others who had attended a guided bus tour to the old moss plant location witnessed 3 silent unknown objects pass overhead moving west to east, silently, at a very high altitude. i first noticed a small star-like round light brighter than other stars visible in the sky at that time perhaps 35 to 45 degrees up from the horizon, the yellow/white star-like light moved eastward slowly and silently, it had no flashing or blinking lights and was constant in illumination - i at first thought this could be the iss or a satellite so just maintained eye contact as it passed slowly overhead. as the first light passed over head, a second group of lights appeared behind the lead star-like object. these new lights that appeared were all solid light blue and flashed on one after another until some 8-10 lights had come on, then went off and began flashing on again one after the other repeating the sequence. moving as one group as if these light blue lights were attached to a larger object, following after the lead star-like object in a moment one could make out there were two “sets” of light blue lights one on each “side” forming a disc shape, each “side” of lights followed the same sequence of coming on one light after the other until all were lit, then would go out to start again. at this point i shouted to the remaining bus tour group around me to look up (as it seemed obvious this was something very strange, and of interest). as the second object moved off after the first object silently, a third object appeared - it however was more of a blob of light forming a roughly arrowhead-like blobby shape of yellow-white light (it too was silent, but had no flashing/blinking lights - the light was a constant yellow-white). i recall one tour guest who was witnessing this with me commenting he believed an object was triangular shaped “you could tell” he remarked, just before it entered the clouds. there were thin clouds and some thicker ones in the sky that night. overhead to our position where the second and third objects appeared to trail after the lead star-like object there were some wispy clouds. the objects trailed one another and moved off eastward. the last tour bus arrived to take the remaining group of us back to woods harbour community centre, when i boarded the bus i checked my iphone to note the time and it was 8:02pm. myself and one group of fellow witnesses had an animated discussion about what we saw on the way back to the community centre. i know at least 4 other people, other than myself witnessed this event (there is a good chance more witnesses exist).\r\n\r\nprior to having witnessed the objects, canadian coast guard were shooting flares up into the sky from ship not far offshore from our position and using a searchlight to re-enact in a small way the october 4, 1967 search for the object that crashed into shag harbour. a 50th anniversary shag harbour witness (lorne) was throwing flares into the water, and an rcmp cruiser was on scene with lights flashing. this activity had ceased aprox 10 minutes prior to the objects witnessed.","distance":"Over One

to tell my mom to get up quick and get out the kitchen door and get outside. we got outside and down the driveway to the street. she saw them right away. i then called my sister to tell her to get outside side quick the ed orbs are here. my brother and sister live 1 mile away to the east. while we were on the phone she saw them too. my brother also saw them and got some video. it was all very very exciting to see. while i was talking to my sister on the phone i went back out in the yard were you can see a little better and my mom was out at the end of the driveway a car stopped by her and ask if she was watching the orbs, as she had spotted them and was trying to follow them in her car. i then went out to the front of the driveway with my mom and we just kept watching as the went by.
