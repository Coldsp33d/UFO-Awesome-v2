through the cloud beside each other.\r\nafter 5 cloudy days finally cleared up january 20 so i decided to do another overnight observation.  again i waited the moon to rise high in the sky just like last time then i made the first shot at am2:42 then i made the second shot at am2:43.  the photographs were nice and clear but the ghost star still wasn't there any more.  the sky just like before was deep black with no stars just the shiney moon.  at am3:40 i came back and i made another shot at am3:42 and i made a secon shot at am3:44.  i saw nothing unusual by naked eye just a few small cloud patch close to the moon.  next day i made pictures from the last 2 shots that clearly show a flying object at 7 o'clock just edge of the moon.  second photograph show the same object at 9 o'clock direction, the size of the object in this distant must be enormous that logically is a giant asteroid popped out from behind the moon and sling shotted deeper into the solar system.\r\nafter a day or two i called one of the scientific government office about my finding, but nobody responded back to me.  then i called one of the government emergency office and again nobody responded.  then i called one of the space scientific office and again nobody responded back to me.\r\nfew weeks later on february 18, a 295 yard giant asteroid size of 3 football fields approaches close to the earth in speed of 43,000km/hr.  the slooh space camera detected the asteroid several weeks after i reported the asteroid to the officials, and missing the opportunity to study it in earlier flight.\r\n\r\nscenario is this:\r\nthe 295 yard asteroid captured by group of six ufo space ships in deep space to use it as an energy source and as a flying vehicle.  they positioned themselves in the backside of the asteroid to shield themselves against meteorites and other flying objects in their way.  then they turned on their spaceship engine thrust and speed up the asteroid appoximately 1000km/second and steered the asteroid to our solar system.  when they reached our solar system they slowed down the asteroid and separated themselves from it.  they continuingly flew to their destination to the earth, unknown location.  the asteroid was steered precisely into the solar system and harmlessly left thanks to the crew of the ufo.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

shape. i continued to watch for a few more minutes as the object continued on a northeasterly course,then just as it started to come over the mountain it just stopped and hovered. it sit there hovering for a few minutes before i realized this isn't an airplane or helicopter or blimp it was totally silent. at this time i noticed that the colored lights were pulsating left to right, right to left. i immediately called for my wife to come and see this object, she had no sooner got out the door when the lights got extremely bright then went out. seconds later the lights came back on, dim first and then bright again. these lights were the brightest lights in the sky, extremely brighter than the stars and any aircraft running lights.  there are 4 airports in a 40 mile radius, the closest being johnstown's john murtha airport, where they keep attack helo's and other military aircraft which you can hear coming before you can even see them.    as my wife and i were watching the object we noticed that there was another craft off to the left of the first one, i told my wife im getting the camera . when i came back outside the lights started to get bright again then all of a

object in the viewfinder was so bright that not even the stars were visible. then as soon as i was done recording i happened to look to the right of the object and noticed that there was another craft

consciousness on this ongoing phenomenon .\r\non new year's eve 2013(12/31/2013) numerous lights(15+) were observed  in the night sky(8:30-9:00pm)pst. miles up the lights made distinct movements and formations that eventually moved closer to the observer. 4 of those ufos descended to about 200 ft to the top of the neighbors house located on a nearby ridge,and approximately 1000ft from the observer.The size of the ufos are similar to the house size in the photos and video. the ufos continued these vertical formation for 10 min. then begun shifting side to side then forming a horizontal pattern now even closer to the ridge line homes. the observer had been shooting multiple pictures during the decent. now filming video as well you here his voice tremble with fear ,yelling for his friends and family( neighbors )to get out side and see this.Then from one of the ufo s comes a white orb small in size that comes in a half circle path that splits the distance of the observer and the

walking on air 3 ft above the ground and sees what appeared to be some kind of \" matrix \" below him holding him up. \r\nafter zooming in the pictures ,the photos reveal not swirling fireballs as seen with the naked eye but a robotic man with energy sources located at his chest and knees, another revealed three bodies holding hands .Also after for investigation on the photos we found what

at a restaurant that had an open roof.  this is the reason i first looked up. we were having lunch in a roof top restaurant in winter with an open roof.  the sky was deep blue with no clouds.  the objects moved ne to sw direction.  they were reflective like the bottom of a plane on a deep blue sky in winter however they were almost not moving.  they were moving as if to survey.  they stayed evenly apart until the northern most shape stopped as the other two continued.  the northern most shape fell well behind the other two.  after a period of about 10 minutes the northern most object headed directly north at a steady but fast pace. the remaining two stayed on course.  after about 10 to 15 minutes more the two objects disappeared. i kept looking up to find the objects when i saw one object going the opposite direction.  then another one joined it going in the same direction, sw to ne.  the object to the south of the other object moved rapidly in front of the other object and made a severe left (northern) right angle turn at a significant pace.  this object disappeared again and the one remaining had a bright light come on from beneath the bottom of the craft.  the light was brilliant much like a light shining thru a large diamond cut prism.  the light would flicker and pulse but the light was always changing.  it was not rhythmic and steady like a strobe light. the light was bright white considering that it was so high up in the atmosphere.  it was a well defined light.  this lighted object started to move in an easterly direction. it went east for about less than 5 minutes and then went out.  i did not see the objects again after that time.  within 3 minutes light wispy clouds started to come thru the area.  i am hoping someone else saw the objects as

than a carbon based (form) experience. all my life until now, when i have told close friends about this, none who believed me, i have called it a ufo. but as i study about spiritual phenomena, i now liken the experience to seeing a bright orb. my friend and i had no fear, were sad to see it leave, and felt love for it. it was a love experience if that makes sense to say.\r\n\r\ni was in about 8th grade. a friend came over to go trick or treating. we were a little old to be going but wanted to go one last time. so it wasn't a group of us, just two. we were walking down a street, my recollection says a westerly direction, when she said \"look at the moon, it's so bright!\" i looked up and said \"that's not the moon, that's a street light\". that's the last conversation as it was over us, hovering. so i feel it came in fast...From a moon perspective to a street light in front of us, to over us.\r\ni have a picture in my mind of where we were when we noticed the bright light. the next picture in my mind we are in the middle of the street looking up and it leaves in a different directional path, and we run through the side of a house's driveway to the backyard but it is gone! we wanted to chase it. we immediately rang the bell of that house and excitedly told them we saw an object but they yelled at us that it was too late to be trick or treating, to go home, and closed the door in our faces. when we returned to my house, my mother yelled at me that we were home too late, to go to bed and she drove my friend home. i think i was grounded for a bit and we never seemed to have talked about it. i'm sure i tried, but wasn't believed. \r\n\r\ni have no recollection of actually being abducted, only this memory of being yelled at about the time. i don't really know if any time had passed or not.  i only know that it was a bright white light, we had no fear, it was over us, close, and perhaps 3-5 feet diameter.\r\n\r\ni don't really care if anyone believes me or not. i know what i saw. i just wanted to put out the thought that maybe some of the ufo's people are seeing are of a spiritual nature. maybe these things can change form from pure energy to form. i don't know.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then

take a picture of this unusual event.  i have a nikon cool pix camera which uses an sd card.  when i scrolled back to look at the picture i was frightened half to death at what i saw.  whatever it was

started shaking, then i deleted the photo.  i wished later that i hadn't deleted it.  i tried to find someone to go through this sd card and retrieve it.  i found one company that does work for nasa but they wanted $500 - $1200 to find a photo that has been deleted.  i got on facebook and asked a friend of mine (pete creel) who is an photographer if there was someone close by that could try to retrieve this photo.  he said he would get back to me but i haven't heard from him ( i think he thinks i'm crazy).  i am 67 years old, a retired civil service (navy - supship pascagoula) employee, i'm
