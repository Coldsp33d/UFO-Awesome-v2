the hills and straight towards the hospital. i first thought of a late night flight to goose bay airport.  i then noticed there weren't any starboard or port lights, it was just glowing silver ovoid.

12 years old and walking back from warrs pharmacy on hamilton river road in happy valley. i was walking along back to my home at the lower end of hamilton river. it was a friday night about 7pm, a clear, starry december evening. what made me look up towards the evening sky i don't know. i never heard a thing and this thing was huge.It dwarfed the two riverside homes it hovered behind. it was cigar shaped, tapered at the ends, and had a silvery glow and had eight windows. from those windows came a brighter light and first thing i thought was they didn't have curtains to keep out the cold. second was that something was looking at me through those windows. it just hovered there while i watched it about 15 seconds.\r\n\r\nit then moved in five jerky parallel movements, each about 100

dog, who is usually quiet, started to growl and ran upstairs and wanted outside.  i went upstairs and let him out.  it was then that i noticed two red lights traveling from the ne to the ssw and the red lights slowly pulsated.  i watched as the lights traveled in a straight line at what appeared to be at a low altitude, i thought this is strange because i am a private pilot, a soldier, and a paramedic and rely on staying calm while observing things.  when the two red lights were almost out of sight, i saw a longer line of about 6 lights, the front 3 were red, the 4th was bigger and white and did not pulsate like the red lights, and the remaining two red lights followed.  it did not make any noise that i could hear and was not like any aircraft that i have ever been exposed to.  when my wife came home a few days later i told her about this event and she thought i was pulling her leg.  since the sighting i have gone outside every night trying to see them again so i can video the lights to prove what i saw.  the whole time the lights were present i just kept thinking that this is strange and fascinating at the same time.  i made mental notes of what i saw and what i did not see.  i did not notice any strobes as on modern aircraft, i didn't see any trail of any kind, and i noticed that the lights appeared to be traveling slower than the other aircraft in the area at the time.  the other aircraft were singular and had the red, green and white strobes while the lights i saw pulsated slowly, except for the white light on the second set of lights which never pulsated.

eisenhower road and oakland park ave. there i met my friend who had come from his house. we were going to the local drug store to have a milkshake. i pointed out the object to my friend who saw it moving. we watched it for maybe 20-25 seconds when a small prop plane approached from the south heading northeast. this plane had it's wing lights blinking and we could hear the engine. when the plane was in close proximity to the object the object just disappeared. it was like watching a light bulb that was bright and then the light bulb was turned off. \r\n\r\nwe continued on to the drug store and had our milkshake. we was there for about 30 minutes. when we started walking home we began to hear jet aircraft zooming around in the sky. i was an air force brat so i knew they sounded like jet fighters. it should be noted that lockbourne afb, was located on the far southeast side of columbus. where i lived (north side of columbus) i had never heard military aircraft in the air before that night. i felt that they must be looking for the object that i had seen. when i got home i told my mom and dad what i had seen and heard. my dad was a 20 year retired air force officer. he said that it was very odd for jet fighters to be flying over our end of town because that was not in there flight pattern. my dad had been stationed at lockbourne before retiring. \r\n\r\nbeing 16 years old i was

i grasped for air and said \"yes\" we didnt know what it was, we saw a ballon like object, round in shape with a dark bright redish color in the rim around it and as you looked towards the midle it was a glowing orange/yellow color that remained steady without change in color. my wife suggested it was a helicopter, i said no because 1) there was absolutely no sound and 2 it did not have a flash on the tail of waht would be a helicopter. then she said a small aircraft, again there was absolutely no sound and it moved too smoothly and slow to be an aircraft of our known experience. all of the sudden a guy behind us screamed wtf! we are being invaded and took off running but my wife and i ramained frozen looking at the object when all of the sudden another replica of that same sphere seemed to have came out of the one we were looking at, same size, shape and colors, then anither and another and anither till we saw a total of about 5-7. my wife said to me film it with your cell phone as other people stood in amazement, others panicked, so i did, i tried to catch a footage. as the objects flew kver us the distance from the ground up must have been that of maybe 100 floors up. the objects were seen very clearly and even seemed at times as if they were floating east bound very slowly. suddenly the object as it continued its straigh path moved towards the beach, (east) and the lights behind it that were in a cormation of 1 on top other lower on bottom started to gather together connecting each other, kind of like if they were going inside each other until we only saw 2 lights and disappeared over the target building. i heard people saying, \"did you get that\" but amazingly and weird my phone nust like others had a black screen with no sound or image, kind of like if my cell phone was turned off. we never understood what it was, we told our family and they thought we were crazy, other members said \"u never know\" interestingly an uncle suggested it could of been a paper ballon like the ones asians make but if that was the case ut would of flew up and not accross, there was no wind, and 2 it wouldnt of had the colors of glow we saw that day. my wife and i brushed it off for a while because we even thought we must be seeing things from our imagintion but about 8 months later as we were watching tv news briefs we saw a news that sid \"caught ufo's footage flying over the sea of south florida. when we saw the inages we saw exactly the same thing we saw that night and ever since then we became aware that we have seen somthing. what did we see?

looked up at the sky toward the sw (239-degrees magnetic) at about 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon. i noticed a white-yellow light which i initially assumed to be a planet setting in the west, due to the size and brightness of the light.\r\n\r\ni nearly turned away when i noticed the light was actually two lights that blinked simultaneously. the lights were situated in a left-right orientation and blinked about every three seconds (i did not time the interval). i noticed that this pair of lights appeared to be moving, but very slowly. i used our laundry line post as a reference to the lights' motion and was surprised when the lights blinked directly over the post corner and upon the subsequent blink were located about a foot to the right of my reference corner. every subsequent blink the pair of lights was sighted at a different location: back to the corner, a foot to the right, or right between the two location points. i was standing perfectly still. i could not determine any shape of the craft(s). the flashing lights moved very slowly to the west. \r\n\r\ni went into the house to get a pair of binoculars and re-acquired the lights out my back living room door. i could

at first, i thought it might be the light atop of mt. tamalpais, but my wife said no, it is too big, closer, and you cannot observe the top of the mountain from our vantage point. it seemed out of place, and my second thought was it must be a plane or helicopter. we pulled into the safeway parking lot, got out of the car and while walking inside, i looked at the light again to take note that it was still in the sky about the same distance as before. we went inside and shopped for about 20 minutes at the most. we got back into our car, and headed south again on nave dr toward marinwood. we saw what appeared to be the same light in the sky again, south of us, only it appeared to be closer and larger. while my wife drove, we asked each other, \"what is that?\". i rolled down the window to observe the light as we drove. my wife turned left onto main gate road and into a parking lot on the right. we both got out of the car and observed the light in the distance, hovering. it looked closer than our first observation, but still high up and in the distance. it was high enough in the sky not to be obstructed by the surrounding hillsides. i was very excited and curious as i watched the light pulsate an orangish, red, yellow. we observed the light for about 45 seconds once we were out of the car. the light than abruptly disappeared, it seemed to shut off. i thought i saw a smaller light greyish colored object move west at the point where the bright light was, until i could see nothing but empty sky. i considered taking a cell phone photo of the light but did not want to be fussing with my phone and miss the opportunity to observe the light. i felt a sense of extreme curiosity and excitement to see this light. having observed the iss and other satellites on several

just discovered the mufon site. \r\n\r\nit was around 10 p.M at night, and me and two of my friends we're hanging out by a fire in my buddies backyard. somehow i remember the conversation turning to u.F.O's and the existence of aliens and the such. at the time, i had just begun to dive headfirst into researching everything about their existence, and within the year before this incident i had already seen upwards of a dozen u.F.O sightings while attending the university of miami as a sophomore. many of which i had been able to summon via directing out loving thoughts to the cosmos and to various races of et's (pleaidian , arcturian, andromedan, etc). yes, i summoned them with my thoughts. this isn't some b.S ego trip. i would think loving thoughts and send them out towards the cosmos and spend night on the rooftop of our apartment complex staring out into space. and every night i'd do this, at least one ufo would appear in some shape or form. \r\n\r\nanyways, once my friends said they were non-believers, i simply mentally asked  our galactic family to show up and prove that they do exist. i didn't expect them to actually show up, especially for the sheer amount that they did. i'm not sure how unique this ability is, but needless to say it worked repeatedly and consistently. \r\n\r\none by one, in an almost choo-choo train like fashion, seemingly out of nowhere, we spotted at first one large, glowing orb that was pulsating white and yellow. if you were to hold a golfball up to the sky, i'd say that would have covered it.  it was moving really slowly about several hundred feet over my friends house, moving east to west. then about somewhere between 35-50 feet behind the first one, appeared another... then another... and another... i estimate that there was somewhere between 30-50 u.F.O's in this line altogether, each following along the same distinct pattern, all moving slowly in unison, hovering along in one line. they all shared the same white/yellow pulsating color pattern as well. none of them sped up past on another. it reminded me of the macy's day parade, as if each orb was a float, just parading right overhead us.  this went on for about 10-15 minutes, until they stopped appearing, finally fading out of site to the west of us. \r\n\r\ni still kick myself to this day for not thinking to record it on my phone, but i think i was too dumbfounded and in awe of the sheer beauty and love i had felt upon witnessing so many u.F.O's. my friends were in disbelief to say the least. it felt that the u.F.O's were intentionally hovering by so slowly as if to say to my friends, \"do you believe now?\". out of all my sightings, this was by far and away the most incredible spectacle i have ever seen.
