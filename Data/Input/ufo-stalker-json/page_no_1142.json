disappeared in perfect sync, down to the millisecond. i'd estimate it was about 1/2-1 mile away. during the event, i didn't feel anything other than amazement and awe. after the event me and my father

when i noticed two red glowing objects hovering over the corner of el camino real and valparaiso avenue.  i immediately made a left hand turn on glenwood ave and parked my car.  at first i thought they were low flying helicopters. i got out of the car and started filming the orbs.  the first of the videos were two glowing red, with a tinge of pink, with the center having a very orange glow.  when looking at these, the red was so intense that it appeared to look laser-like in the sky.  almost as if the light was beaming.  when i reviewed the film, the red glow and beaming red light was difficult to see, but they looked rather white and orange on video.  the two orbs did not cross over el camino real where i was, but stayed on the west side then crossed over el camino near santa cruz avenue and continued southbound till the lights slowly faded into nothing.  then another orb came out and did the same exact thing. this happened maybe four or five times, and every time it was one orb at a time.  one of the videos shows an orb tracking a plane which was above the orb, and then the plane continue on its path and so did the orb.  the last time i saw something with this glow was back in 1997 in san jose, ca, which came out of the monterey area.  the weekend before this, i took a trip to monterey, ca and reminisced that sighting i had in san jose, ca.  the following day i returned from my trip, i had this recent sighting.  my feelings after i had this recent sighting were amazement, excitement, and joy.  prior to this recent ufo sighting, i had been experiencing extreme intuition and clairvoyance.  however, during the time of intuition and clairvoyance, i was also feeling a lot of frustration and introspective thoughts regarding relationships and loved ones.  i understand this all sounds strange, but before every ufo experience there always seems to be emotional conflict on some level within myself and loved ones.  explaining the sightings with others seems to clear up all conflict and harmonize all negative emotions.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

was a cloudy night, close to midnight.  i had just stepped out of my car to get some fresh air as i waited for a friend to come out of the house.  as i often do, i looked around the environment for any interesting signs or patterns which i could derive meaning out of in connection to my life experience in that moment.  syncronistly, earlier that day my daughter put a picture, drawn and colored with crayon, she found while cleaning her room, on my desk which, to me, looked like a ufo against the dark night sky and give me a feeling that my first, very anticipated, ufo sighting was at hand. so, with these feelings brewing inside me, i looked around for a sign.  after a few seconds, i found, in the dirt behind my car, what looked like a shape drawn into the dirt, closely resembeling the ufo in the picture my daughter gave me (triangular shaped with a smaller triangle hovering seperately).  as soon as i saw it, a thought and feeling came upon me, urging me to look up.  so, i did and, sure enough, there it was.  i thought it might be a plane at first with its lights set and blinking as it flew its path, but as i observed it, i noticed a red center light with blue lights at either sided which began to circle the object as it moved along.  then, as the reality set in that this could actually be a real ufo, my inclination was confirmed as i watched it stop in mid-flight and begin to manuever in ways that only a ufo can, as far as i know.  it came slowly back towards me then quickly changed direction and went back the other way again.  then, it hovered for a moment and descended- i could not tell how far down because there was a big two-story house in the way.  full of wonder, amazement, and gratefulness, a hurried back towards the road to get a better vantage point from which i might see it.  then, i began calling out quietly but with a firm focused intent, \"i'm here, i'm here...\" (i remembered learning that raising ones vibration to be more in tune with theirs often brings them back).  it worked!  it came back up and moved towards me, close enough for me to hear a pulsating hum coming from it, as if to acknowledge that it was aware of my presence and my awareness of it.  then, it did something truly amazing! it hovered back to where it first descended, but this time it shot straight up into the clouds to where all i could see was a dim reddish glow - it looked like a star.  \"is this how they camaflauge themselves at times?\", i thought.  then, it descended back down again and i had a feeling the experience had finished.\r\ni am so grateful and honored to have been given that opportunity to be witneess to the grace and spectacle of that amazing extraterrestrial craft.\r\ni will definately be looking forward to seeing them again if and when our vibrations once again align.  thank you. thank you. thank you.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then

bright the sky looked. my wife and i decided to spend some time in the hot tub. we both enjoy watching the skyline gazing for shooting stars and meteor showers. as i was looking up into the skyline, i noticed something flying right above us. it appeared to be in transparent form. i only witnessed the object for a few seconds as our house sits very close to the hot tub and by the time i noticed it, it was pretty much over our house and out of site. the object was flying south to north. i asked my wife \"do you see that?\" followed by \"what is that?\" she didn't notice or see anything. she replied \"what did it look like?\" stunned and almost speechless, i stated \"very odd���looked like a cluster of stars flying in triangular, transparent like formation\"\r\n\r\nshe said \"if i were to tell you that same story, you'd think i was crazy\" \r\nshe's right, i would have!! lol\r\n\r\nbut the fact is, i saw it!! \r\n\r\nthere was no sound and no sign of any vapor trail. it appeared to be very large and flying at an altitude of approx. 10,000-15,000 feet, maybe even lower. i did see what appeared to be a traditional commerical  airline, with blinking lights, flying at a higher altitude of 30,000 or higher, right above this transparent object. the unidentified object appeared to be flying at a much faster speed than the airplane. \r\n\r\nin closing, i'll admit, i'm a skeptic when it comes to ufos. i have witnessed several shooting stars, meteors, satellites, fireballs and even the space station. until tonight, ive never witnessed what i thought was a ufo. but what i saw tonight was like nothing ive ever seen before. i can't explain it, but it truly changed my way of thinking... \r\n\r\nplease help explain!!

name of bastendorf.Its about 2 miles south of where i live.The beach is all sand,a quarter of a mile long ,faces west,jetty on the north ,water to the west,rock wall to south,enterace road and small trees(about 100 yqrds)then a 75 foot bluff extense all.My experience is not a sighting of a u.F.O. but a contact(that i believe)that i had with about 60 human like entities.I was not drinking and was about ready to go home when a friend wanted me to go with him down the beach with him even sayed he'd been looking for me and this was inportant.So no big deal,thought we were  maybe chasing girl's or something at another group of people down the beach.(this is hard for me so please excuse my grammar and detail,i just feel now it is important  for me to tell others,and it's starting to affect me schycologically.)this is where it gets strange.It was suppose to be a party around a camp fire.But they werent \"around \" the camp fire,more like,or exacatly like a tear drop shape,with one side of the tear next to the fire.I'll send illustration.There was a d.J and table with a stereo about 100 feet up the beach from the fire.Not one person near or dancing.All were gathered in the shape of a tear drop next to fire,with most of them facing in ,and standing really close to one another.No drink's in hands or anything to that matter.My friend took me to the group,around one side and into the groups center.They just kinda sepparated and let us in.He introduced me to a coulpe of people who smiled but did not speak.(this was happening all in a couple min.)after shaking a couple peoples hands,a darker complexted maybe indian or part mexican person with a backpack on reached his hand out to shake,and my friend steps in points his finger inches away from this persons face and say's \"we don't know him\",but he was obviously in the group.At that time i followed my friend out the side of the gathering where we had come in.I could here him wispering to someone\"hey you got any girls ready to go right now?\"the other person pointed towards the end of the tear drop,thats where we went,where there was a girl my friend grabbed her from her(person she as with a man\")arm and sayed your coming with me,she sayed allright,we started to leave a guy came and sayed no your not and grabbed her back.It as all really strange at that point we left.It was like my friend knew exacatly why and who they were and was stealing a woman from them for me (?)i as just along for the ride (walk).This really frightened me but have never told anyone that.I have confronted my friend and all he sayes is yea that was cool huh.Allthe people there were all dressed casual and were looking like rich yuppies or kids of.The way it was like a \"hive\"is what scarred me the most,and the fact my friend has something to do with it.The way they were gathered and how they acted and stood was not normal.I've been to a lot of parties on this beach and do drink on occation ,not this night.I'm gonna try to draw an illustration of the group,for now i'm done getting upset,thank's for listening.Jon oxford,nautical art and photography.(ex-commercial fisherman for over 20

white orb on the video.\r\nthe fireball orb proceeded in a straight line toward the southwest, i followed it with my camera while walking west on the sidewalk. my camera battery died soon after; only got about a minute and 1/2 of video.\r\nthere are large trees on the street adjacent to mine and the orb past over them - i thought i was going to lose sight so i decided to cross the street for a better view - a car was coming so i trotted across to the next corner. after the car had pasted i looked over toward where i last saw the object. i couldn't see it because of the large two story

from the location and never have seen them again.

stars,one remained stationery,and one changed direction and darted around,when we got closer i noticed that i could see what appeared to be very large windows and extremely bright light emmited from within the crafts,the craft themselves looked similar to a very large posh caravan but with what looked like very plain and bright inside, as we where watching both of these crafts,i turned to get a better view and one of them had disappeared and only the stationary one was left which then started moving,they moved as if they where a gyroscope so it could change direction in any manner necessary,it darted off and out of my view quicker than anything i have ever seen move,within minutes n military chopper flew past in the same direction it was a chinoock helicopter,very distinct and loud i could see that as clear as i saw the crafts,there have been many in my area recently and this has got me asking questions,i hope one day il get

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":" unfortunately, it is part of my personality that i do not usually make special note of dates and exact times. i have seen this aircraft twice, maybe a year apart. i know it was early spring or late fall on both occasions,(first in 2012 and then early in 2013) because in the early morning hours the weather was very pleasant following pretty cold weather,   and i was comfortable sitting on my back porch enjoying a cigar. on both occasions i was restless and unable to sleep so i got up, put on some clothes and went outside to smoke a cigar. after a short time, about half of the cigar, a light above me caught my eye. i looked up and saw an aircraft. it surprised me because there was no sound and the plane seemed to be flying very slowly and at a low altitude. whoever was piloting it did not seem concerned about being seen, maybe because of the hour. it was just coming into view passing over the building i live in and moving in a straight line to the east/north east, toward interstate 81. i actually had the thought that i should go inside and get my phone or video camera, but i never moved, wanting to keep watching to see what would happen. it almost seemed to be gliding, but i felt that it was moving under power because the speed and altitude did not change while i was watching it. it did not take off with great speed or disappear,  it just flew slow and steady in a straight line until it was out of sight. i've been looking for and waiting to hear other reports of similar sightings and have found no such reports.\r\n\r\n  as i said, it was shaped like an airplane but it did not look normal to me. what was instantly obvious was the long rectangular light or maybe lighted window on the bottom of the fuselage that ran from the nose about 1/3 of the length of the vehicle and the only wings i could see were at the far rear of the fuselage and they each had a large , white light on the end. even though the three light sources seemed quite bright, and the aircraft was flying quite low, i did not notice light being cast to the ground from them. i saw no propeller or exhaust, and although there is a railroad track a block from my building there was no train or other sound to drown the sound of this aircraft, but i heard nothing.\r\n  \r\n  my first impression of this vehicle is not that it is extra terrestrial, but i've never seen anything like it. the sketch i attached is an approximation of the appearance of the aircraft. i don't remember the exact length of the rear wings or the rectangular light relative to the length of the body. i have waited to report this sighting because i expect to see it again, maybe this coming spring and i wanted to have an actual photo or video to present. if that happens i will certainly send it to you.  \r\n\r\n  if it is a known aircraft, i would be happy to be educated about it. it seemed large for any drone i've heard of, but that was my thought, some kind of surveillance vehicle.
