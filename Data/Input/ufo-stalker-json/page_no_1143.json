morning. i firstly noticed a bright red light up ahead but obscured by trees.I believed i was going to pass an ambulance or fire truck as i rounded an s bend before i headed over the bridge and up the hill. as i straightend my car i observed a very large cone shaped object ahead hovering over the bridge. to my utter disbelief at what i was witnessing i couldn't make a rational decision as to what i should do.I didn't want to drive under it, i knew i couldn't stop as i was on a major highway and there was no where to pull over.In this brief moment of indecision the craft just seemed to disappear. i got the impression that it went west. i never saw the red light again that first alerted me that there was something up ahead. a local radio station had been contacted regarding this incident, there were 2 farms within view of the bridge. i didn't contact the station as i had no proof of what i had seen.Listening to the radio station over the coming day's they related over the radio the story they had envisioned what we saw.They claimed what we encountered was a truck coming down the hill sending off static electricity, this is totally incorrect as i never passed a truck or any other vehicle on the road. the next explanation was that it could of been a hologram. this is quite impossible as it was on a bend and nowhere a hologram could be set up. i  related my story to close friend who lives close to the sighting. she lives on a property and claimed to of seen the craft on several occasions. i told her i never saw the red light again and to my astonishment she told me that the red light i first noticed is the back of the craft. she said it was like an exhaust system. there is no doubt in my mind that what i saw on the night was a space craft.","distance":"20 Feet or

always leaving me to wonder if my eyes are just tired and playing tricks on me, however it's happened too many times now to just brush the experiences off as merely being tired. i've had many sightings of actual ufo's in the skies over phoenix arizona, again most of the sightings occurred during the daylight hours and almost always with at least one witness on hand as well. i know that i am being monitored by something that doesn't come from this planet due to certain 'feelings' or intuition that i can feel strongly when i am being 'watched' by either an implant or some type of mental telepathy method. one night about 5 years ago i was in my backyard star gazing at around 9pm at night when i saw a bright 'star' in the western sky that i just 'felt' was not really a star but a ufo disguising itself as a star(they love to do that !). i mentally projected to the ufo that i can see that it isn't really a star but i did thank it for being observable by me. i also asked the 'star' to flash a light at me if i am correct in my assumption regarding it's true nature and the ufo/star flashed an amazingly bright white light right down on me for about 3 seconds and then it dimmed way down so that it blended in more uniformly with the other stars in the sky that night. it was so exciting to have that happen to me and i always thank the ufo's that i see (mentally of course and with deliberate intent for 'them' to 'hear' my thanking them). nothing would please me more than to someday soon make personal face-to-face contact with a benevolent ebe/entity and ask for their help in bringing a non-polluting energy source   to this planet so we can start to help bring this living planet back to a healthy level again. i find all of this wonderfully exciting and as someone who has seen so much evidence of their crafts in our skies, i have no doubt that we are surrounded by many many et's, most of them in cloaked form (usually surrounding themselves in a cloud-like vapor to blend  in with the other clouds). keep your eyes open and pointed to the skies and hopefully more of us will see this evidence and mankind will somehow make it known to the et's that we are ready now to meet them and become an active part of the interstellar community that obviously exists all around us, and in many dimensions. peace to all of mankind...Put down your guns and open your arms and eyes to the hidden reality that is within reach - right now !","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":54174,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.28732612523204,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02202014-0008","longitude":-110.9804131413055,"occurred":1392807900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1392902879000,"summary":"Bright flash nade me open my eyes and a small orb floated past my face and into a wall","tags":["flash"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"85705","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Tucson, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:197352"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Tempe","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At midnight heading back towards the house from the mailbox i looked over the mountains to the west. i noticed a double-light object headed north by northwest--in the direction of downtown. i knew immediately this wasn't an average craft. i could not hear it and i could see no typical blinking beacon lights, nor was there a contrail. these lights were all white--brighter than a plane or satellite. as far as i could tell, just two lights, one following another--one object. as the object moved n by nw the light seemed to lose their intensity and almost seemed like the two lights developed red haze/halo around them. i saw this same effect occur when the iss drifted towards the horizon. i would have to say this object moved 3-4 times faster than a helicopter. 5 times as fast as a commercial jet, faster than a fighter jet. my immediate reaction was that i needed to document this sighting. this wasn't usual as compared to the typical air traffic in the area at this time of night.

did have illuminated \"trails\".  i observed this strange, exceedingly bright white \"light\" grow brighter and dimmer for about 2 minutes or so, and then it was gone.  what was very interesting about it was that immediately following it's sudden disappearance, a commercial airliner began it's approach to the local airport (about 8 miles from here), and 3 additional jets came very fast from the east, appearing to follow the exact same course...And with their \"trails\" illuminated, as well. whatever that exceedingly bright light was, it was clearly not a jet, a plane, a star, or a planet. i observed the last 3 jets going very quickly to the west, and did not see anything else. i watched until dark, and did not observe any other unusual things.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

only describe as out of this world.Hovering in the night sky were two ufo's. triangular in shape one just in front of the other, the rear one just to the left of the one in front.Thy were very illuminated with ice white light on the upper and lower sides of the craft and a vivid blue band of lights that separated the upper from the lower part's of the craft. on the underside of the two crafts i observed three circular power motors. they were glowing in a redish orange glow.I estimated the distance from myself and the craft to be around three hundred meters at the most.And around five hundred meters off the ground.I have never seen anything as beautiful in my life.Truly breath taking.Just above the blue band of lights i could see a line of windows but could not see inside them.As i watched them in the night sky they started to move in formation just to the right over my head. there was no noise what so ever.They moved slowly towards the west still at the same height.As they passed over head they looked more pyramid shaped as though they had sat up instead of lying flat.I then lost sight of them as they moved behind the house.If these craft were of our world then i would be proud of what we had engineered.But in all honesty,they were truly awe inspiring craft to behold. i feel very privileged to have seen them.Every evening now i keep an eye out for others.

in particular, just enjoying being outside. i remember that it was sometime around my high school graduation, but not on my exact graduation date...Maybe shortly after. summers are hot here, so it's only comfortable to be outdoors before sunrise or after sundown. the time of day was...Getting dark. when the even started it was pink-ish/orange-y sky time, and when it ended it was definitely dark out.\r\n2. what made me notice the object was that they appeared in the sky right in front of my eyes. it was cloudy - i could only see solid cloud cover in the sky, but not dark rain clouds. as i stood there watching, six circular lights appeared above the house i was facing. high above, not low or in close proximity to the roof. i saw the outline of the circle-lights against the clouds in the sky. but there was no shadow of any object (such as an aircraft), and no beams of light going into or emanating from the light-circles in any direction. there are several car dealerships nearby, many of which liked to aim search lights into the sky (from the ground) at night, to attract attention for business (i guess). it was a popular thing for the dealerships to do at the time. those searchlights always had a prominent beam visible from the ground, and the circles of light they gave off always warped into ovals at sky level. they also used to rotate them around so the search light beams swept the skies. the circle-lights i saw that night had none of those properties. they were perfect, unwarped circles against the clouds with no visible beams (or source) that i could determine.\r\n3. i didn't have any particular ideas of what the lights were, other than just lights. i knew they weren't search lights like the dealerships used. \r\n4. there were six of the circle-lights in the sky and they appeared in a circular formation. if i held my hand up to the sky, i'd say the size of each circle-light was maybe tennis ball sized (for what that's worth). the lights began to rotate around in a circle, sometimes stopping, sometimes switching and rotating in the opposite direction, sometimes clustering together into a tight circle (sometimes converging into one circle) and rotating/spinning rapidly and sometimes spreading back out into a wider circle, rotating/spinning slightly slower.  i think i watched this for about twenty minutes before the lights suddenly disappeared.\r\n5. my feelings were of amazement, amusement, a bit of fear, but mostly i felt as if i were watching them (the circle-lights) play or dance","distance":"21-100

grandson's birthday party.  i looked at the clock in the pickup as i got into the passenger side as i didn't want us to be late.  it read 7:12 pm (1912). as my husband was backing out of the driveway, i looked out of my opened window and noticed in the southwest sky, a formation of five very bright, larger than stars, objects in the sky.  three of the objects formed a triangle with two more at a distance, one to the right and above, and one to the right of that one and below it.  the clock read 7:13 pm (1913).  my son's house is about eight minutes from my house.  during the drive i observed these objects until they disappeared completely at 7:19 pm (1919).  during the drive the first five objects were joined by two more.  the objects changed configuration five times during the drive from the original sighting at 7:13 pm.  however, the triangle stayed the same the whole time.  each change was just an appearance of another object, usually at the right point of the triangle, kind of like a tail of a kite. there was no movement when this happened, they just appeared. so there ended up being the triangle of lights, two additional lights at the right end of the triangle and the same two lights as described above (at 7:13), further to the right, one above and the other one to the right and one below.  there was never any sound or movement during these changes.  i observed a total of seven objects.  at 7:17(1917), the lights started just blinking out at the right (tail) end of the triangle, one by one, until they all disappeared by 7:19pm (1919). it was a clear night with no clouds. you could see the stars clearly.  that is why these objects or lights were much larger and brighter than the stars were.  i did make a sketch of the configurations and the times that each change happened.  in 1997 my husband and i lived in northern arizona.  on several occasions i observed the same type of lights although in different configurations.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":54156,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":26.9974845427152,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02192014-0009","longitude":-82.04086117342452,"occurred":1392606780000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1392851546000,"summary":"I
