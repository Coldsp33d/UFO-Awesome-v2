but with homes around.  i headed down boulder rd and parked the car (did not get out).  this road is essentially an overlook where i can see all of silicon valley.  i looked up an was lucky to see the green lighted object - which i realized was clearly now a triangular shaped craft.  each point of the triangle had a yellow navigation light.  but in the middle of the triangle was another triangle - a lighted red triangle.  the light was also strange looking.  imagine a huge computer monitor with the screen red and with an occassional video noise - sort of like interference on a screen.  i know this sounds strange.  as i was watching this thing i also noticed that it was ascending up into the clouds.  it took off.  at the same time we noticed two other lights one with red strobes and the other yellow moving southward towards the evergreen district of san jose.  from my vantage point i could see everything.  the yellow light moved to a certain location and remained parked over the area for over an hour.  the light then became bright - very bright, and changing colors, white, red, green, blue, sometimes changing very rapidly.  i arrived back at my house had dinner then told the family my experience.  after dinner, i noticed that the one light was still visible from my office window.  this is the extent of this report.  as i am writing this my daughters are telling me that the light is actually moving around.

it was hovering over the san fernando valley. it moved closer to our direction and i began snapping pictures. the pictures show a white-ish orb with strange patterns and a blueish aura. it kept appearing as if it were two objects and than a whole again. when i went to take a video it shot upwards into the sky and the light disappeared simultaneously. \r\n\r\nthe second one i saw the next night as i left my home in northridge on my way to west hollywood. i was driving north towards parthenia and noticed a very bright orange spherical object in the sky that was moving. it was not emitting much light but it was very bright nonetheless. i parked my car in the middle of the street. my first impression was that it might have been some kind of lantern. then it started to pulsate between bright orange and bright white. i immediately started snapping pictures and a video. once again it appeared as if it may have been two objects that kept separating and re joining. the pictures make it look as if it was doing quick turns but that very well could have been exposure. a lady asked me to move my car because i was blocking her driveway. when i moved it the object shot off at an almost 90o angle westbound and i lost sight of it.\r\n\r\nthe first two pictures are from the first night. the next three are from the second night. \r\n\r\nthere were no sounds or light being emitted

large ship, i knew this was no plane or blimp or anything ive seen in my life. it was so shiney like fresh polished crome and was triangular and had a smoth curve on the top that was shiney but very dark like black. there were red lighs that stayed on and white lights that were so ultra white on the sides,it seemed like it only illuminated the craft, nothing around it was illuminated, and the relection from the white like pulsated off the craft as well as green lights that did the same but at the bottom. when i was further up the road the lights seemed to span out in the air, when i was stopped it was just the craft pulsating, there was no noise at all. at first i was confused and when it sunk in what it wasi was in awe then felt very uneasy, i got nervous. its a very dark road and i saw headlights in both directions so keeping my eye on it constantly looking back i made u turn to go back and tape it, i looked away for a few seconds to make the turn and it vanish, i felt alittle scared. i drove all the wau back down the road very slowly there was nothing in the feild or in the sky, not even a light in the distance, there were two people who were walking down the road who were now running. i was completely freaked out at this point and turned around and went back down the road again to go home, still not a thing in sight. there were 2 people walking atleast 3 other cars passed theres houses on the road and also a high school, i hope more witnesses come forward, it was truley an experience to be so close and get such a good look, i have goose bumps writing

straight above the susquehanna river, to my northeast, also, in the direction of watsontown, pa, i saw two bright white lights. they were probably about 1.5-2 miles away when i first saw them. maybe even slightly farther. i thought it was an aircraft that had taken off from montoursville regional airport, heading south. but as i drove further, i realized the lights were not moving. i would describe them as very bright white, large-looking headlights. they appeared to be pointing towards the river, as a beam projected from them straight down. i would guess the beam only projected about 25-40 from the craft, which was around 600-800 feet above the river. the entire duration of seeing it was probably about 3-4 minutes or so. i slowed my speed from 55-60 to low 40s once i realized the object was not moving. the truck seemed to drive itself as i got \"lost\" watching this. this may sound odd, but i had an overwhelming feeling that \"nothing was going on\". that's the best way i can describe how i felt. \r\nthere was nowhere for me to pull my truck over until a mile or so down the road, where i know of a small diesel station where i have been before. in hindsight, i regret not pulling into the shoulder to film it. i was able to capture a 20 second iphone5 video of it. the video is shaky because i was still driving, and using elbows to steer. the object appears to be moving because the phone is bouncing everywhere. the object was definitely not moving though. when i pulled into the diesel station, trees and a ridge blocked any view i could have had. \r\ni also pinned on an iphone map where the object was. it is the purple pin, not the red pin. red pin denotes the town of dewart, pa, which i simply searched as a starting place to pinpoint location. i am born and raised about 15 miles from this location, i drive the roads often, and am very literate with maps.  the purple pin is an accurate location. \r\nbefore i filmed, i zoomed iphones video camera because with no zoom it probably would not not have picked up the lights. although the zoom does increase blurriness, it was necessary here.

found very curious, and what attracted me to it even more was that there was a white blinking light, and a red one too, that blinked nearby the large yellow one hanging in the sky, and the small white & red lights that seemed to travel all over erratically, unlike the blinking lights you see on the tail end of some small aircraft. the blinking lights traveled around in small circles, disappearing and reappearing all over the place, but in the same general location of the large yellow light. it seemed that the small lights were designed to distract ones attention away from the large yellow light.  eventually, the large yellow light that was star like moved toward where i was watching it on my porch and the hung itself above and in back of a tree out in front of my building, but i watched it park itself through the branches of the tree, right in between the branches of the tree. i went inside to get my iphon 4, and when i went outside, i saw a craft that appeared to be round, in the dark, with no lights on it, travel low, across the back side of the parking lot across the street, and because it appeared to be really nearby, i tried to shoot video of it, but when i went back in the house to see what i had captured on my iphon video, it appeared that the video never happened. i went to call someone and noticed all of my phone numbers that were there earlier in the day, had been wiped out, and i had to recharge the phone, which was strange because it was charged all night long, and i really had not made even one call on it all day, or used it for any reason. i went outside on my porch with binoculars, around 8:00pm, to look for the object that i had tried to capture on video, and i saw more irregular small blinking white lights and when i looked through the binoculars there was a gold star like object that appeared red too, which was irregular in shape as it hovering above the church, near the college. i watched it for at least 4 mins while talking on the phone to a friend, who i had on speaker phone. suddenly, the craft that was hovering started to move and it moved toward me very, very slowly, but i continued to watch it through the binoculars and it took the shape of a boomerang, somewhat like a stealth, but not quite and one side of the craft had a red light on it, the other side had a green light and the center glowed yellow, it turned really smoothly, and flew around the corner of my building, i ran inside and opened the shade and shut the lights off and watched it through my binoculars, as it disappeared from my sight, because i did not want to put the window up, because it was freezing cold outside. i continued watching, where the craft had hovered for some time, and there were other blinking lights, and another craft that was unlit in the sky that i could see through my binoculars. it was really cold out, i watched it for a while longer absolutely fascinated, and then i decided to come in.  because i have seen, so, much ufo activity in the sky from my home, from december, until now, in february, i feel that it is definitely time to say something. i cannot be the only person seeing these lights materializing into air craft. i do not have any photos of what i saw this evening, but i do have photos of the same type of light object that i saw this morning around 5:30am, but that photo is not related to tonight's occurrence which was absolutely incredible.  i could not believe my eyes, but i do believe it!","distance":"101-500

nearing st. louis.  we saw a few moving lights and unordinary shapes near the setting sun that appeared to be very far away. they were all hard to see and hard to differentiate from other more stationary objects, as it got darker we tried to keep an eye on them and they would move and disappear and re appear in a different location. we stopped for gas outside of the city and continued watching the objects, at dusk the lights started becoming more defined and irregular. they would become very bright and then completely dark.  at one point the light stopped and i was able to make out a dark object against the sunset.  then multiple lights came back on blinking in very irregular ways and moving around  each other at what appeared to be very fast speeds. as it became dark and we

brighter than any star i'd ever seen. as i continued to look at it, it grew in size and shape. it went from a round shape of a normal star, to a large oval shape. it had an aura around it. almost like a fog. it moved slowly from my left to my right. as it sped up the shape got flat. so much so that during the last few seconds it was totally flat. after around 2 and a half minutes it just vanished. i was in total shock. just after i lost sight of it, my dog started barking at seemingly nothing. i stayed outside for another 5 minutes or so and saw nothing after that.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
