glowed like a star. it was my female cousin, male cousin, my brother and i. we were walking up 160th st. in washington heights. my aunts apartment is halfway up the block between broadway and amsterdam. when we got to the front of the building my female cousin spotted the object over the roof line of the school up the block. we were not sure of what it was at first. we thought it was either a plane, helicopter, star or moon. we mentioned it all. then i noticed the intensity of the lights, the shape of the object, and the way it moved in the sky and determined that it was none of these things we thought of. i saw it so clearly for a few seconds. it appeared to be spinning but i could also notice some patterns on its edges. i then decide to record it. i have to admit, after watching the video i can tell you that the images do the sighting no justice. it was clearer with the naked eye. but i decided to record it for proof that this thing was there and not to prove what it was. i still don't know what it was.\r\nmy female cousin was very nervous and thought that the object could somehow land on us, but i knew that even if this thing crashed we were at least a mile away. the object move over the roof line horizontally and vertically. at one point it descended out of our sight behind the rooftop of the building. i then moved to the top of the front stoop to gain height and re-spotted the object. i saw it move for a few seconds and then it descended further out of sight. at this point we all decided to run up to our building's rooftop to get even higher off the ground in hope to capture it on video again. when we reached the top of our building we saw the object again. it was hovering in one spot and then it started to ascend. then it moved to our right. then it appeared to move in our direction slightly. that is when i saw a glare of pure white light with a tint of blue. i have seen something similar to to this glare on the hid lights of some cars. we observed the object move in a straight line to our right and then back to the left. it ascended and hovered and then descended behind the same building it was flying over. there were many things that helped distinguish   \r\nthis object over its surroundings. the clouds, lights on top of buildings, airplanes flying by, background city noise, even airplane engine noise. this thing made no sounds that we were able to pick up. i hope that you can help us explain what it was. we thought to call the police to report it but that would have required to use my our phones. none of us wanted to do that for fear of missing out in recording it. i realized after the fact that one of our companion at our roof top was a person that was not with us at the time we spotted it downstairs. this kid recorded it also. my brother asked if he could use his phone to report it but this kid said his phone was low in battery. when the object did not reappeared we left the roof top. we never reported it. i thought fro certain that someone else somewhere else had to have seen this and immediately started to search for online reports of it. i was unable to find anything about this event so far but i have posted it on my facebook and on youtube. after seeing this the reaction has been mixed for me. i know that it was not something i have seen before. i know that nothing i have seen before can move so quickly or can be so bright. this thing moved as if it had independence and will. i live near newark airport and a smaller airport where there are news helicopters. i know what this things look like in daylight and at night. this object was neither of those. of course, my question remains the same. what was it?","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

lights in the first picture i took but it was a bit blurry, so i focused on the lights of the house and took another picture. it took about 15 seconds to take the second picture, i could not see the lights clearly because they were behind the clouds but the shutter speed on my camera can pick up stars behind the clouds so i believe the ufo was behind the clouds hovering. i took a third picture and that took another 15 seconds and the green lights were still hovering in the clouds. without changing my settings i took a fourth picture and the lights were completely gone. the whole craft hovered for about 45 seconds unless it had hovered before we got there. if it was a flare from the lens i believe it would have showed up in the fourth picture since i did not change positions or any

divisions of light and dark, but that also may have been the effect of a solid light seen through trees. at first, i thought it was a super moon because that was the only logical explanation for a light that size in that direction. then i glanced to my left to see the moon and knew that this light was clearly something else. as i stated earlier, i was driving down a hill; when i reached the

light again, but i couldn't.\r\n\r\ni began to run through the various things it could have been. it was the wrong position for the moon. it was too low and well lit to be a known aircraft. it

county/usc hospital when i first noticed the object. i thought it was an airplane. \r\n\r\nas i kept driving north towards glendale on the 5 fwy, i noticed how the object was completely lit. like a light bulb glowing against the dusk sky. the object was completely lit, like a glow in the dark sticker, but not green, instead it was white. but it did not radiate light, like a flash light. by now it was around 6 pm and i was driving near dodger stadium. by then the object was traveling my way and it seemed to glide in the sky. perfectly gliding. as i drove towards it, i noticed it looked a little bit like a football shape, and like i said, the whole object was glowing like a glow in the dark, white color sticker. by then i could definitely tell it was not an airplane, nor helicopter and not a blimp or a chinese lantern or a kite or a remote control toy. \r\n\r\nas i drove, the object was on the other side of the 5 fwy near i would say the atwater village area. then, the object stopped and hovered over a building. there are lots of factories around there, near the la river area. the object was hovering i would say no higher than a 40 story building. then, it appeared to freeze in the air. it was perfectly still. it was amazing. i rolled down the window and i could not hear a sound. note: i was on the freeway but it was congested. i was traveling no more than 5-10 m/p/h and that's why i was able to see it for so long. another thing, this was the closest i got to it and i would say that the object now resembled a saturn shape. but the edges were kind of fuzzy. also, i noticed a small red light on the bottom of it, that pulsated every few seconds. so maybe it was a drone? i am pretty sure the object was the size of a mid sized car.\r\n\r\ni've lived in the burbank/glendale area all my life, i've seen lots and lots of airplanes, helicopters, blimps, toy airplanes. but this was not one of those. it turns your life upside down when you see stuff like this.

(i have the 2 jets and airplane on video but havent yet seen the object) i thought it was a satellite with the sun reflecting off of it (the sun was coming down) but it looked just like the two jets. i continued to watch the jets go across the sky and i began to realize that it seemed the object,  i thought was a satellite, was following behind the two jets. i looked down at my camera to see if it was picking up the object, and as i looked back up it was gone. nowhere in the sky while the other two jets were flying away. the film i took was 2:47 minutes long, so i watched the object for about 2 minutes. it was completely visible the entire time as well as the two jets, but was gone after i looked back up. about 5 minutes later i'm walking down a street where you can see a nice horizon. i saw a bright light over the horizon and i stood in the middle of the street to watch it. it went upwards into the sky and disappeared into the clouds. i already had called my brother about the first ufo, so i didn't even bother tell him about the second one. i'm tired of seeing stuff and not getting it on film. \r\n\r\n\r\nnote: also in the video i have the 2 jets and an airplane flying across the sky as well that i was comparing this object to. the way i judge my ufo sightings is this. anything normal in the sky is boring. anything that's not boring to me is a ufo. this was brighter than the jets (the sun was reflecting off the jets) and it was abnormal. \r\n\r\n\r\ni also still haven't figured out what this object is i witnessed with 2 other people. no noise and it was very low but had 4 lights and had flares shooting upwards out of the top of it every couple of seconds. we watched it for about half a minute. i wokeup the next morning searching the news for a plane crash, but nothing

my 5 million candle power light with me when taking her out at night due to coyotes and bobcats. shined my light around the back yard as i always do and once i was looking in the northeast direction i noticed almost right away (3) craft with (4)large bright orange/ reddish lights each,traveling from the northeast, traveling directly over my back yard heading southwest towards phoenix. thought, in the first couple of seconds, that the lights were a type of aircraft, but realized quickly that these were not our aircraft. the (3) craft were in loose formation, not exactly a perfect triangle, but close together. each craft, on the underbelly, had (4) bright orange/red glowing lights forming a square about the size of a (2) car garage.Estimated these craft to be at about 1500 feet to 2500 feet above ground level. as they traveled directly over my back yard i noted that there was no noise from a propulsion system, completely silent. crafts were moving faster than a balloon or blimp but much slower than a plane and were in a controlled flight pattern. went back inside home and pulled wife out of bed. when she saw them she asked what they were. i commented that they were unidentified flying objects. she told me to get my camera and get some pictures. ran in and got my camera. took quite a few pictures and pictures do show orange/red glow. one of the (3) crafts sprinted ahead of the other two crafts and turned off its lights when it got close to phoenix. pictures that i took show (2) orange/red glowing orbs. after approximately 6 minutes the last two crafts were so far to the south west that we couldn't see the lights anymore. my wife is my witness and the pictures that i have show (2) glowing orange/red orbs.Both, my wife and i were amazed by the sight of these objects and had a hard time believing what we had seen. but did get it on my camera. not good enough to show any detail but does show (2) glowing orbs.

orange color and not the normal colors of the other aircraft in the vicinity. also there was no strobe light or any of the other kinds of lights that i usually see on aircraft. \r\n i watched the object for a few seconds as it was traveling under the cloud cover and then i grabbed my pair of binoculars and observed what appeared to be a sphere being lighted from underneath by an orange slightly pulsating light. being night time though it was hard to establish with any certainty the shape in addition to the fact that it went through the cloud cover. though i watched for several more minutes i did not see it again. the flight path of the object was not much different than any other aircraft but it made no sound that neither my son or i could hear. when i looked at the other aircraft that were in the area at the same time, it was obvious that those were aircraft and we could hear the sound coming from all those aircraft.\r\nalso, when we first spotted the craft it was approximately south and moved in a northerly direction. as it entered the cloud cover it was approximately east by north east. the time it took the object to move that distance made it seem to moving about the same speed as the commercial jets. it did not behave as a balloon would.\r\n i am an amateur astronomer and also spent several years working on jet aircraft in the us air force. i have also

easy to do considering what it was doing i.E., (hovering, slow flight w/o falling like a rock, no noise, ect.) i am still in the very exited and mystified emotions of seeing one. i am a avid fan of shows like ancient aliens, and fully believe that biengs other than us humans exist. and to see something like this satisfies me. i see alot of planes and helicopters out of my window daily especially because the way my window is made. as soon as i seen this object it stunned me, and knew there was not much time. so i ran outback, and watched astoundingly. after it started moving i was loosing sight of it, so i ran threw the house out to the front to try to see it for a little longer to see if it was going to do anything differently. it wasn't but a few moments later, i could not see it anymore. \r\n6. i lost sight of it behind the sky line. \r\ni am entering this report to see if anyone else seen what i saw, and can inform me if and what happened after it left my line of sight.\r\ni would also like to thank m.U.F.O.N. for it's hard work and dedication to this cause.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

a computer game at my friend's house and he was watching me when all of the sudden he got really excited and said he saw a shooting star. his house is on a hillside just above a flat area, so we had a good view of the sky and were just above eye level with the tree tops as we looked out his window. anyway, i was too into the game and figured it would be gone by the time i looked so i didn't. i thought he was too excited for just a shooting star anyway. then he kept seeing them and getting so excited that he finally wrenched me away from the screen to look. at first i was nothing, he said to wait, and then i saw a bright flash of light and i told him that it was definitely not a shooting star. the closest i can get to describing it is like the flash of light from an \"artillery shell\" firework, the ones that make the loudest bang and just emit a flash of light. looking for a logical reason i told him that it was just the neighbors lighting off fireworks, even though i didn't see the faint light as it shoots up that i usually see due to the wick burning. i was standing right next to the window and thought it was strange that i couldn't hear the noise from it, it was easily close enough to hear through a window, and i started to mention this to my friend when i looked down and realized the window was wide open but there was no noise to be heard beyond the usual forest sounds. that is when a creepy feeling came over me and all sorts of explanations went through my head, a weather balloon seemed like it might be able to do this. but then, after several seemingly random flashes with several seconds between them, the light flashed once more and then dimmed but did not go out entirely. it stayed dim and began to fall fairly fast, then it got brighter again and stopped a little ways above the tree line, at which point less than ten smaller reddish light separated from it and they all disappeared. we wondered over it for a little while but then kind of dismissed it and went back to playing computer, we were only 17 and 16 years old.\r\na few minutes later my friend stopped me again telling me to come look at the shooting stars. this time they actually did look like shooting stars, hundreds of then shooting around. my first thought was that it was a massive meteor shower but as i continued to watch i became convinced otherwise. first of all they were not appearing and disappearing like other shooting stars i had seen, they were constant lights, and secondly they were moving not only down and across the sky but also up, diagonally and every direction. they moved in fast-moving erratic paths, many changing directions in an instant. as i was trying to figure out what these lights were, my friend started telling me be could see actual objects moving around and reflecting the moonlight slightly. i have bad night vision but i could also see things moving when he pointed them out. we decided to go outside to get a better look at them, so we went and laid on the hill. my friend was seeing them much more clearly than me but then one of these crafts floated in front of the moon and there was no mistaking it this time. i didn't believe my eyes so i asked my friend what he was seeing in order to confirm what i was seeing and he told me he saw a triangular shaped black craft with smooth corners just as i was seeing. as i watched that thing silently glide overhead, i couldn't help but get a creepy feeling like someone was watching us. i had a hard time seeing them after that one was no longer between me and the moon, but i could still see the lights and we continued to watch them. then, slowly, clouds rolled in and the lights began to disappear behind then. about !5 minutes after they all had disappeared the clouds rolled away and the sky was clear in the moonlight as though nothing had ever happened. we were a bit unnerved by this but eventually went to sleep and woke up and fold his dad the next morning. then his dad told us about some other strange things like electrical interruptions that had been happening at their house but they could be completely unrelated. i would like to think that this was part of an experiment by the air force but the motions of the crafts suggest a much higher technology was being used than is available to us. they were all changing directions quickly, even 90 degrees, and without a sound. the sheer amount of them together without a crash suggests a level of skill that would not be attainable with our current technology. i have been wracking my brain for years and cannot come up with an explanation that doesn't involve advanced technology. if anyone has a logical explanation please let me know and do not assume that i believe in aliens.","distance":"501 Feet -

nervous. our dog was barking at the light. we then all saw something moving beside the light, where it was at its brightest. i tried to take a video with the mobile phone but it got incredibly warm to touch. i pressed the button to snap a picture and the phone shut off. in a matter of seconds, the light ascended towards the sky and in about 5 seconds, it was totally dark outside. we don't know what it was but we are all terrified. we got home wondering what this could have been. when we got back inside, nobody talked, we were all wondering what this was. we looked at the phone and saw the picture of what seems to be a 4 or 5 foot tall entity directly in front of us. it was standing next to the red-orange light. please get back to us because this event scared us and we don't know what

to the backyard and frontyard to call our cat to come home. that's when he discovered the snow crop circle. he yelled i have never seen anything like this and had the camera taking the pictures. there were no footprint in & out of the yard, the circle is almost perfectly round. i walked up take a closer look and took more pictures. it contains couple more circle within it.\r\n\r\nthe next day morning, my husband took more pictures when the snow had melted a little more. the rings of circle appear more clearly like showing multiple layer of the bottom of the ufo or the ufo was hovering close to the land and slowly landing on the yard that made that rings of circle imprinted on the snow. we really can't think anyone would have done it. the day was really cold and it's dangerous to go
