into the night sky to observe the stars when i was drawn to the brilliant star-like ufo that i always associate with previous sightings/photographs.  this was high in the sky, in a northerly direction, but 'brilliant white'.  i was then able to capture around 15 images that night of the ufo  it was stationary, but also in the sky i noticed a further two 'star'like' ufo's in an easterly direction low in the sky (too low for them to be stars)- but they were not as glowing, or as bright as the object further in the sky, and which was the focus of my attention.  i was excited, as always, because from my past sightings/experiences and from the images captured with my digital camera, i could see that, at long last, i was able to obtain further images of the ufo, but in greater detail and purporting to be, (which i have always believed) to be a mothership of the smaller ufo crafts that i had obtained images.  the sighting lasted for three and a half hours before the 'star-like' ufo suddenly became less bright (dimmed) and then just disappeared.  i have observed in all my sightings of these 'star-like' ufo's, that this is the way they all disappear from view.\r\ni have formed my own opinions on this, which i will be happy to share with you at a future date.\r\n\r\nthe next night the star-like ufo returned again, very bright, but this time it was not as far up in the sky and it's position was focused more at the bottom of the street where i was living.  it was around the same time of night, and again i was able to take a further 15 or so images of this craft, and to my amazement when i checked the images i found that i was able to capture this ufo craft at very close range, hovering above the rooftops of the homes at the end of the street, and during the time of taking the photographs this craft was not visible to me, which was incredible, considering the size of it, and on some photos, actually obscuring the homes at the end of the street, and the night sky obscured by all/some parts of this craft. therefore i have images of the craft at different angles. \r\n\r\nsince i obtained these images, i have sent 6 of them to a digital forensics expert in the u.S.A. (because of their spectacular nature and taken with digital camera)to confirm the authenticity and the fact that these images are 'real' and have not been manipulated, or altered in any shape, or form.  i have his report to hand confirming this.\r\n\r\ni am very well aware of the unique nature of my photographs and therefore would like my case to be investigated at your earliest convenience.  i have had many more sightings of this ufo craft(s) from which i have further amazing images since my initial sighting of it over lockerbie at the end of july, 2007.  i have now amassed a collection of more than 1,000 photographs over the past six years and along with my sightings/experiences i hope in the near future to be able to write about these.  meanwhile, it is my wish that these photographs (because of their spectacular nature) be brought out into the open, so to speak, so that they will help the case of ufology and hopefully go some way to changing the minds of the ufo skeptics.\r\n\r\ni look forward to your confirmation that you have received this report and it will be investigated by the mufon (uk) office, under the directorship of mr chris munns, whom i have written to, and he has advised me to report this sighting on the official sightings report.  i am attaching a copy of my letter to him, for your information.\r\n\r\nmeanwhile, i would like to take this opportunity of thanking you for your kind assistance in this matter, and hopefully in the near future i will have the opportunity of meeting up with an investigator and to giving him or her an account of my past experiences/sightings and sight of the collection of photographs from each sighting.\r\n\r\ni intend to file another sighting report in relation to one of my latest sightings here in scotland, and from which i have been able to capture even more amazing photographs of the same 'star-like' ufo craft. \r\n\r\nkind regards,\r\n\r\nyours sincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nlisa marzi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncopy of e-mail to mr chris munns, national director, mufon uk office.\r\n\r\n\r\ni would like to report multiple ufo sightings and photographs, since my initial sighting of ufo's over lockerbie, scotland, at the end of july, 2007.\r\nplease note that this was the start of my 'journey' with ufo's - which has taken me over a period of six years now.  mine is not the 'normal' ufo sighting, random and with sketchy photographs.  this is why i have been reluctant to bring these into the 'open' so to speak, because i realise the uniqueness of the photographs and indeed my particular case - which still scares me - to this day.\r\n \r\ni did e-mail a mufon representative in scotland but unfortunately, owing to the fact that i have had changes of employment/locations within the u.K, it was not possible to meet up with a mufon representative.  i was, and still am, reluctant to send my photographs via e-mail, preferring instead to have a face to face meeting with one of your representatives, so i can have the opportunity to show him my photograph collection, gained over the years.  the most recent, taken in january of this year, depicts the mothership once more, in the sky in fife, scotland.\r\n \r\nbriefly, i would add that i am on the verge of seeking publication for my photographs, and consulted a copyright lawyer some years ago, realising the uniqueness of my photographs at that time.  since then, i have been able to capture many more, close range shots of a huge mothership hovering over the roofs of homes near my home in northumberland at the time, and these, in my opinion, (a sequence of 30 plus photographs, taken over a two night period) in january, 2011.  \r\n \r\nhowever, now i have been able to obtain some more spectacular shots in january of this year, depicting a stationary ufo craft, on a section of the mothership, along with two smaller crafts, in motion, depicting their power trail in the sky.  actually seeing is believing!    i have not sent in an office mufon report to date, along with photographs, for the reasons stated above, as it is my intention to write a book regarding my experiences, incorporating the best of my photographs. i would like to make it clear, that my photographs are not just 'blobs' in the sky which could be interpreted as something other than a ufo craft, but a mothership of immense proportions, hovering in the sky, at night.   \r\n \r\ni would like you to know that i am a seasoned expatriate, having spent over 20 years of my life living and working in the middle east, mostly the kingdom of saudi arabia, where i used to frequently camp out in the desert at night, and have a wonderful view of the stars overhead.  this, (along with a culminatjion of other factors) led me to realise that the star that i was observing from my loung window in lockerbie in 2007, was not a star, and led to me taking a sequence of photographs.  afterwards i sent these photographs for analyzation to a scientist dealing with ufo photography in texas, u.S.A. who informed me that these photographs were unique, real, and in his opinion depicted two separate ufo crafts in the sky.  since then, i have also submitted another six of my photographs for forensic digital analyzation to an expert in u.S.A.,  (because of their spectacular nature i would assume that people would have doubts about their authenticity), and of course his report states that these photographs of the mothership, at close range, have not been altere or manipulated in any way.  they are real, just as they were when i took them over northumberland in 2011.  \r\n \r\nnow i feel that the time is right to bring these photographs to the 'world stage' so to speak, as they are so numerous now, and of immense scientific importance in the field of ufology and hopefully will lead a lot of non-believers and skeptics, to realise that there are in fact ufo's - it is just that it is so difficult even to capture one good photograph of them, let alone the 1,000 i have been able to amass.\r\n \r\ni would love to have the opportunity to speak with you regarding my case, as there are many more things in connection with these sightings i need to advise you about.  could you please therefore contact me via hotmail, or to try and arrange a meeting with a representative in edinburgh region - by phoning my work number which is 0131-536-0337 (reception of royal hospital for sick children in edinburgh) - .\r\n \r\ni look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.\r\n \r\nyours sincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nlisa marzi\r\n \r\n \r\nps none of my photos have been published to date, and very few people know of their existence\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":54079,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":54.983152,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-02152014-0007","longitude":-1.61249,"occurred":1295231400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"England","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1392475749000,"summary":"Sighting of three 'star-like' ufo's in u.K. over to consecutive nights in 2011 -

parked my car in the street, and as i walked home on the side walk i first saw one object that at first seemed to be a star, but after observing it a few minutes i realized it had multiple lights that were changing colors and seemed to be flashing. the only reason i felt this was not a plane, helicopter, or blimp is because it was absolutely stationary, and they never moved left to right nor got closer or further away. i stopped at the best vantage point i could find and kept a few stationary objects in view next to the ufo so that i could tell if the object was moving or not. after i set my view up, i glanced around and saw that there was an identical object just north of the first one, perhaps 3 degrees higher off the horizon and farther away. i was not able to tell exactly how far the objects were or how high as i had no point of reference and i could make out no actual shape. i would guess they had 4 or more visible lights there were flashing in my view. they seemed to be slightly circular in shape but from that distance they could have been flat on the sides i could see. i watched these objects for approximately 20 minutes before i decided to go in my home and get my cell

evidence but i am making this report in hopes that i am not the only one to make this sighting. please let me know if there were others that reported this since these objects were plainly insight of all of southern california. thank

was on the january 23, 2014 around noon. i was cooking in the kitchen and a light was beeming from my balcony windows directly in my kitchen; it made me look outside and i noticed a shimmering object. i went out in the balcony and i was perplexed by this object because i have seen it until now alredy three times. this time the object had a big tail and i was thinking that it was ison. i took a few digital fotos. soon the sun appeared partially from behind the left side of my building, from east. i could observe with my binocular moving things around the partially appeared sun and some of those objects were very bright and changing colors and appeared like ladders to me. i took my video camera and i started filming but was so hard to look at the sun even with sun glasess, so at one point i filmed without looking at all at the sun. the sun appeared to have a dark halo and between halo and sun were a lot of movements of bell shape objects.  i was looking to the object which was shimmering like a rainbow and had a long tail which appeared to be joing another object to the west much smaller.  some of those objects coming from behind the sun in the halo seemed to me that were going in and out from the shimmering object. i made very short videos because i felt my hands were burning from that light and also was bitter cold. i could not here any distinct noise but in the video if i am not mistaken is a strange sound but i do not know because the 401 is very close as well.\r\ni was astounded seeing for the fourth time the same object. i watched this phenomenon until the shimmering object faded away and than i stopped filming. the sun was very bright that day around noon. in my videos are many, many objects swarming in that dark corona of the sun if that was our sun. i felt that i am blessed to see such phenomenon which does not happen every day and to every one. i can forward for now just fotos and snap shots from videos.\r\nalso i have pictures of the moon and the same shape of bell objects flying close to the moon.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":54072,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.659746,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-02142014-0015","longitude":-79.3806943,"occurred":1390503540000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,

moved over the general area. i was wide awake and lying at the foot of my bed. there is a large window cracked open on the side of me and a small square window above the head of my bed, so from where i am i can see out of the square window. it was 12:40 am and i witnessed an unidentifiable object with gold and red lights glide behind said cloud. i decided to stay up ten or so minutes to see if i anything else happened. at 12:50 ish i was slightly facing my large window lying down and i heard a sound as if something was descending from the sky, similar to an airplane but much quieter and less muffled. i turned a fraction of an inch towards my square window, thinking sarcastically \"what if that is a ufo,\" and to my surprise i saw a cross section of a ufo directly in front of me through the window. i jolted out of bed to the head of my bed and was staring directly at a ufo. it had gold and red lights in a repeating order circling it about 1/3 up the top of it. our streets have the houses facing inwards to each other so there is not much space for things to fit in between. it was a very small looking ufo, approximately 12 yards diameter, completely circular. i stared at it for about 15-30 seconds, completely horizontal from it as it was hovering, and then it tilted a bit, glided up over the houses slowly, made a right behind a few trees and was out of my vision.Mind you i was wide awake the entire time, it could not have been a dream in the slightest, only other object i felt could possibly be it is a drone, but i feel that is far more unlikely, given it's appearance

in fort pierce fl. and one summer day i was working in indiantown helping a friend install a clutch in a big ford dump truck that was getting ready to be put in to service. we finish the job just before night fall. we decided to drive the truck to stuart were the truck was going to be park and put in to service. while we were driving on indiantown rd toward stuart we notice a rare sighting. first we saw a hole bunch of deer al sizes more than 10. i never seen so many deers together  in my life. we almost run over one of them. a few minutes later we saw a big, huge light twice the size of our dump truck hovering over the trees. west or n west kind of following the curve road. the light was huge it was rectangular in shape kind a look like a big harmonica. it seem like it was standing still but it cud not be because we were moving in a dump truck about 40 to 45 miles per hour. we tried to decipher what this huge light was, just hovering over the trees. we have never seen nothing like it. we kept going for a few minutes and the light was just there. al of the sudden the light started to get brighter like when a rocket is just getting ready to take off . a huge expansion of light, like a bum, kind a like when you throw a rock in to a calm pond race trough the dark sky.  the object just hovered and stayed at same speed. a few minutes later it did it again. my friend and i cut not believe our eyes and we cut not figured out what the hell that light was. we were in a loud dump truck we cut not hear any noise, and y can not remember if there were other cars or not. there most a bin others cars. we were to busy looking at that huge light and trying to figure out what it was and what it was doing. a few minutes later the road curved towards the east and the huge light just keep hovering towards east n east, and eventually we lost it from our sight. today i still don't know what that huge light was.  but i m certain that it was no plane or rocket or helicopter i ever seen. hope this helps to ad another little grain of sand to the idea that we ere not along in the universe.
