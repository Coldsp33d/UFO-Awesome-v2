been numerous pictures taken by different game cameras that i've put out that catch funny looking lights as well as fog like things we cannot understand. i first put out the camera to try and catch something that was getting chickens that were caged. i have pictures in my laptop of these funny looking lights. one is kinda like a small spinning object. i've kept 2 of these photos of the one that was spinning. there are pictures of streaking lights, one a mule is staring at. it was in the middle of the night. there are so many different types of things that seem to be going on. one night i called my boyfriend that was at his house at the noted address and ask him what he was doing and he said laying here in bed watching lights shoot out of what looks like a star. he said i was sure missing a light show. i hurried over to his house and saw the same thing happen only twice. he said it had been continuous before i arrived. i layer in bed starring at this star like thing that was above the tree line for over 2 hours and i finally went to sleep because it was just sitting there doing nothing. there is a security light near where this was happening and it was located above and to the west of the security light. there are no other lights where this thing was. the fields i filled out above describe not one sighting but this one plus all the other streaks of light we see on the game camera. there are several i have of a fog like object taken in the pen i had the game camera located in. i was still trying to catch whatever had been taking the chickens. i moved it around several times and seemed to always get something weird on it. one picture shows large  lights like something from way above is shining down on the area of his house, pens and shop, like four or five illuminating., like four or five fingers of light coming from the sky. i also have one picture that shows four lights or funny illuminating right in front of the camera between the chicken pens and the game camera. we have also seen an orb of some kind bouncing around in the bed of my new pickup truck when we parked and were checking out the pickup bed camera. seeing how it worked. it was dark, parked in front of his (boyfriends house) and stationary. this light basketball size object was in the bed of the pickup moving around then out of the pickup bed when he turned on the camera that shows the bed of the pickup���.We both freaked out as to what it was. i really don't know what all these things are that we've been catching on my game cameras but it doesn't  seem to matter what camera i put out it catches streaks of light and some appear to be coming from not only the side of the camera, across the field of view, but also from the ground up. one pic shows his mule looking at one of these streaks. the next picture shows the streak in a different place like these streaks of light are moving and are all around his place, in front yard, in the pens, etc���.He was working in his large shop one night and saw a flash of light and thought wow there's a thunderstorm coming up he thought it was lightening. then he walked out the door to see and one went right by him very fast. he was telling me about it and said not only do the cameras catch these funny things but i saw one in person. so���.There was only one time there was a stationary object that had shooting objects coming from it. the other times are ongoing that show light objects that my camera catches. the fog looking thing it took picture after picture of and i have them here on my laptop. i can send these to you as well as some of the other funny looking lights. i didn't have the dates written down so just filled in the above with any time. the camera i have on his front porch right now has the date and time set correctly. the pic's of light streaks on it will be correct. it is like we are in a vortex or whatever black hole or something where these things are happening because it is ongoing. i finally think it is time to share whatever is happening with you. game camera pictures. the below pictures on #2 and #3 have the correct time and date.  picture 6 i have numerous pictures taken in

13 years old, it was somewhere between 1994-1996 or smth) i saw something which, for most of my life i thought was just a weird meteor, until recently when i saw a documentary that showed something similar and i was like...Wtf\r\nanyway, back then, my parents being engineers and working at a hydro plant and dam that was being constructed, we lived for a part of my childhood near the construction site (i don't know the english word for the living quarters which are constructed specificaly for employees to live in) in the mountains, placed in a river valley surrounded on both sides by mountains, \r\nit was basically a mini-village built for the employees.\r\nanyway, one evening i was on the football field with my brother and 4 (i think) others, we just finished playing because it got dark and we were just passing the ball around to each other. i remember i turned to get the ball and then we saw a...Thing, well, a tear shaped green object with a bright green round core that fell behind the mountain, at an angle of about 45deg from horizontal. it fell from my left to my right, so from where i was standing, aproximately from northwest to north.\r\nafter it dissapeared behind the mountain there were two successive green flashes of light, like a halo (almost 1 second between them and each lasted about half a second) raising above the mountain and treelines. also, there was absolutely no sound to the whole thing, nothing.\r\nanyway...That was about it, the whole thing lasted only a couple of seconds...Maybe 4. i remember we got very excited because we saw a meteor, got home, told parents and the next day we got up the mountain to search for it, but it was very steep and we got too tired about half the way to the top and returned home.\r\n\r\nanyway, about the shape...You know the tear-shaped pinpoints that mark locations on google maps? that is exactly how it looked like. it didn't have a long tail or anything and the bright core was round and clearly delimited.\r\n\r\nthe colors...Outside, green (something similar to color code 02c122 or 00cc00) and with a bright-green (like bright neon-green, can't really find a color code that fits) round core in the middle. it didn't have many shades of green, overall...It was quite uniform, same color for the outer part and same color for the core)\r\nit didn't glow very much, i mean, not like that meteor in russia that light up like the sun, it was maybe a bit brighter than the moon at night, for comparison.\r\n\r\nthis is the only weird and unexplained thing i ever witnessed. unless it was just a meteor, in which case it wasn't at all weird, but judging by the size of the thing i think it would have obliterated the entire area if it was really a meteor...Or at least make some sort of sound so...I don't know.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:00:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

there towards the east. it was around 2:30 in the afternoon and could not be a star. i tried my hardest to keep the small object in my focus. it stayed still, hovered for a time (probably a few minutes) before the object started to move towards the south. it must have been low in altitude, because i could still see it plainly in front of the white puffy clouds it passed in front of. the clouds, i am sure, were fairly low in altitude as well. it moved slowly at first but seemed to gain speed as it moved. its movement was very slow. then, just a sudden as it started to move it stopped and hovered again. it hovered again for about a couple of minutes, then began to move in the same southerly direction at about the same speed that it was moving before. it moved slowly for about another 5 minutes before i lost sight of the object towards the south east after it passed behind some trees in the parking lot. i went outside to have a cigarette after this and looked in that

(we have already met, and i intend to become a georgia field investigator.)\r\n\r\nthe date and time of this report are approximate.  i was nineteen years old and my fellow witness was around the same age.  \r\n\r\nin january of 1998, i was with a friend returning to ruston, louisiana, from monroe, louisiana.  it was late in the evening, but i do not recall if it was before or after midnight.  \r\n\r\nthe weather was quite cold, probably just above freezing.  as shall be discussed, we observed the sky to be very clear.  so much so that a comment on the clarity of the sky was made by my friend shortly before the observation.\r\n\r\nhere is the narrative:\r\n\r\nmy friend and i were traveling west on interstate 20 between monroe and ruston, louisiana.  approximately halfway into the trip (which usually took about thirty minutes), my friend looked up and commented on how clear the sky was.  i, who was driving, looked up and agreed.  i observed a bright white light at my eleven o'clock just above the horizon.  i do not recall the elevation, but it was quite low.  i agreed with my friend's comment about the clarity of the evening and went on to note how bright venus was.  \r\n\r\nmy friend, who is an eagle scout, looked at the light i had observed.  he disagreed with me, however, and said that the light was not venus.  having some knowledge of lights commonly in the sky, i argued that it had to be venus because of its brightness, clarity, and constancy.  \r\n\r\nwe both continued to observe the light for some minutes as we drove westward.  eventually, we both observed that the light was not staying at a relatively constant position, as a distant object would appear to do.  in other words, as the highway curved, the object was observed to change position relative to our point-of-view.  very soon, we knew that the object was much closer than a star or planet and that we would pass it.\r\n\r\npass it we did a few minutes later.  as we approached, the light was astonishingly bright, clear white, and utterly constant.  i slowed the car but did not stop.  here is the heart of the observation:\r\n\r\nwhile driving west on i-20, my friend and i observed a large object of triangular shape hovering (or evidently hovering) just above the trees.  the object appeared dark, although i cannot say with certainty that it was black.  i can only guess that it was around fifty feet across, but it could have been far larger.  i doubt that it was much smaller.  it had a massive white light in the lower center.  that light reminded me of a xenon light.  i did not discern any blue tint to the light, as one would expect from an hmi or similar light.  at each apex, a red light was visible.  these red lights were also constant and not as bright (not nearly) as the center white light.  \r\n\r\nwe appreciated no sound, however the sounds of driving could have obscured any sounds coming from the object.  we appreciated no movement, however our movement (at a very slow rate of speed) in a westerly direction could have masked some movement.  no rotational movement was observed, nor was any change in altitude appreciated.  \r\n\r\nafter passing the object, we drove into town where we knew some friends would be.  we collected those friends and drove quickly back to the location of the sighting.  the object was gone.  \r\n\r\nduring the sighting, there were some other cars on the highway.  we did not observe any stationary cars.  we did not observe any other aircraft at the time.","distance":"101-500

was around april-may of 2013 early in the evening  just after supper. i went outside to the back patio to have a cigarette. it was dark out and i was watching the stars and the planes in the clear night sky. \r\n\r\nas i was watching one of the low flying planes heading north, a small bright blue perfect circle appeared that seamed to be ahead of and higher the plane in the lower half of the north eastern sky. of course it could have been much further than that but it's difficult to tell when looking at the sky.\r\n\r\nthe electric blue circle suddenly grew larger and had a lighter outline and a small dark centre. it grew to about the size of a quarter if i held it up against the sky. as i watched in amazement, i then saw a shooting star-like object about four times the size and way brighter than a star, fly into the centre the circle and disappear. then the circle shrank to nothing just before the plane passed by it.  it all seamed to happen in slow motion. my first thought was that it was an explosion of some kind. i didn't see the star-like object at first because the plane was blocking my view of it, so when the star-like object flew into the blue circle, it looked as if it was coming from the plane. to me it looked like the plane had shot something at the circle. \r\n\r\nthe plane continued on it's path north and all was normal again. all i could think of was that i had witnessed something amazing but wasn't sure what it was. i thought maybe i had witnessed a supernova  but it didn't make sense. can one see a supernova with the naked eye? i did a search online to see pics of supernovas and they didn't match what i had seen. but somehow i knew it wasn't that anyway. it was way too close, too big, and too blue. \r\n\r\ni was so excited that i ran into the house to tell my husband what i had seen. i kept thinking about the people in the plane and wondered how they felt after seeing this. how could they miss it? i searched the internet and found reports of electric blue portals with crafts entering or exiting them. but these where blue gas-like shapes. mine was a perfect electric blue circle, crisp and clear. it was not a spiral. and it was

staggered a bit. they were moving ever so slow and slightly upwards. i grabbed my cellphone and was able to get a real good picture. to my surprise i was able to catch two more star like lights in the

before my eyes. it seems unbelievable it really does. picture tells the story. it was a beautiful sunrise that morning. i wonder where they were going. the large like saucer could of been the

just in case something was there. i have a veho full spectrum camera. i went out my front door, which faces north, turn right to the east and sure enough there was a huge bright ball hovering. i thought it was a helicoptwt at first- i am practical and didn't want to jump to conclusions. but then it shot upwards and started almost dancing in the sky. it was abive the treeline in the distance-it appeared to manuever in all manner of ways i have never seen any plane or helicopter do. my husband thought it was an rc copter because we heard a buzzing. he went back insidee kept hearing the noise long after the object disappeared. i determined it was actuallu a drill being used and had no bearing on what we witnessed. a neighbor was outside as well filming the whole thing. we talked about what we saw. he had a better vantagr point and confirmed it wasn't making any noise. it seems it was to far away for us to heaf anything even if it did make noise. it was far away-i had to use my zoom feature to film it and my camera kept going out of focus. i am still not certain what i filmed- i call it an ufo in the most literal sense of the term. finally it seemed to go behind some trees and disappear. the nieghbor, my mother in law, my husband, and myself are just confused but also think its kind of cool. i have never seen that before so it was hard to grasp. but i have it on camera! you can hear all of us discussing the incident-i believe my neighbor called the police too. my computer does not work so i cannot upload video until i get to a friend's

the driveway i noticed a jumbo jet flying low and slow in the sky. i thought the speed of the plane was odd and that's when i noticed the object in front of the plane. at first i thought it might be a bird until i noticed it wasn't moving. the object looked like a dark, short line. similar to a coin laying flat. it was much smaller than the plane, or possible further away, as i could make out the details of the jet easily (wings, engines, etc). the object was too small, or far away, to see any details. it had no discernible lighting of any kind. it just looked like a dark line. despite the craft's size it was still clearly visible as there was nothing else in the sky besides the plane. i continued to watch it as we drove out to the main road. as the plane moved past the object, the object then rose upward from the position it had been hovering in to follow the plane. it was as if the object was moving out of the flight path of the plane when it rose upwards before following. i lost track of both the plane and object as we turned onto the main road. it was surprising but exciting as well. i have an interest paranormal and unexplained things but i don't immediately jump to that conclusion when i see something strange. this isn't my first experience seeing a ufo but the first in this state. living near a major airport, i see numerous planes flying around all the time but nothing like this. unfortunately my friend didn't see it as he was driving but i was describing it to him as i watched. i only wish i could've got video and/or pics.
