to take my dog for a walk, as i do every night. i saw what appeared to be 2 (two) satellites of different sizes, and brightness. they almost appeared as if they were moving in tandem. these objects were what looked like that they were above most communication. the lead object appeared about the size, and reflective brightness of the international space station. the trailing or following object appeared to be the size of a communication satellite. i asked my son if he was seeing the same thing that i was watching. he responded with a yes. they passed between the first 2 (two) stares in the handle of the big dipper as they moved toward the east. they kept about the same distance apart. the lead object made a change in its course from west to east to an east-northeasterly direction the following object also made the same change in its course, as they passed through cassiopeia. just after they passed through cassiopeia, the trailing object sped up slightly, and shot something at the lead object. which got a whoa response from both my son and myself. it looked like it hit the lead object, but there was no apparent change to the object. at least there was not any visible damage from the ground. like i stated before these objects were way up there. the entire event took only roughly 45-50 seconds a minute at the most. i watched both objects until they flew out of sight. they appeared to be at an elevation slightly higher than normal communication satellite, or at least they appeared to be. i live in a town where there are less than 135 people. even though it is lit up fairly well you can see more stars than in a town or city with a larger population. therefore, i watch the night sky on regular basics i know what satellites,   aircraft, both fixed wing and helicopters, meteorites all look like. as stated previously stated these objects looked like satellites. i have never seen satellites act in this manner before.

noticed two reddy orange lights rotating and climbing at 45 degrees, over the river but a long way off.Southerly direction.\r\nit was very windy, with high cloud cover. occasional light rain squals.\r\ni looked away thinking it was probably two chinese lanterns tied together, but on reflection the weather was so rough a small paper lantern would not climb like that or stay alight.\r\nso i looked back and where the lights were climbing up to, there was now four stationary lights high in the sky, same colour as before and same size widely spaced very high in a perfect rectangle. possibly a mile or so up river. i knew they weren't really close up as their aspect didn't change during the whole traversing of the bridge which is three quarters of a mile long.\r\nthe wind was gale force i do not believe it was an aeroplane, helicopter, weather balloon, fireworks or any man made flying object, the weather conditions were extreme, even the car i was in was being buffeted by the strong winds. these lights were perfectly stationary.\r\ni observed them until the car passed through a cutting in a hill side and they were then out of view.\r\nthis observation unnerved me, i am an engineer by trade and aviation enthusiast, i am fully aware of the characteristics of man made flying machines.\r\ni am convinced these \"lights\" were not of this earth, so much so even though stories of ufo's have always fascinated me, i was always sceptical i wish i hadn't seen it.\r\ni firmly believe we are not alone.","distance":"Over One

was standing under a tree when he noticed a powder grey object off to his left in the air. at first he thought it was an owl flying.\r\n\r\nhe doesn't know why he kept watching it (peculiar intuition?), but then as it was arcing horizontally the object slanted a little onto its side and turned a white light. that was when he realized it wasn't an owl.\r\n\r\nabout five seconds later, the light faded and the object was powder grey again. but, less than five seconds afterwards, he witnessed the object entering what appeared to be a'vertical slit' in the night sky.\r\n\r\nseconds before it smoothly entered this opening, he could see the front of the object literally becoming--or appeared to be--sparkling pieces of light. once it fully entered and was gone, the night sky was its normal vast darkness with scattered stars.\r\n\r\nhe knows what he saw and observed, but was in wow...He didn't know what to think or say to anyone about having just seen a ufo!\r\n\r\nthe whole viewing lasted about one minute from start to finish.\r\n\r\nwitness also notes that, from the slightly 'parallel angle' he was at, he could almost see inside the vertical slit. the opening had a 'blue / pure glitter' to it from top to bottom, which was similar to beveled glass.","distance":"101-500

cigarette outside. just a regular day... \r\n\r\ni heard this extremely loud rumbling of a sound, almost like a thunder storm but, deeper pitched. it was then i was looking up and saw the sky ripple and change color all in a second or two. the sky changed from a neon purple to an amber color, and then back to normal all in the same moment. it looked like the sky changed for a second. the best way i can describe the way the sky moved, it was like a boat creating a ripple/wake as it moves through water, in the same way i saw the sky ripple. the whole sky, not just the sky directly overhead of me..... the whole sky...\r\n\r\ni instantly knew this was something extraordinary. i looked around me to see if anyone else saw what i had just seen. no neighbors were outside, no cars driving by. i knew this was something big in the sense that it had to have been seen by everyone outside at the moment. it left a greyish orange trail behind it... astonished at what i had just seen i went onto my laptop to try to figure out what it was..... \r\n\r\ni couldn't find much information at all about what i had just witnessed besides what's known as a sonic boom from a jet. but it was not the same as a jet sonic boom. it made a loud rumbling sound followed by a fading crackle sound. i just knew this had to be seen or at least heard by more people than myself. \r\n\r\ni got back online around 9 or 10 to see if a news team had anything on what took place that late afternoon... no story at all. \r\n\r\ni do not know what this was. i experienced this a couple years ago now, and it still bothers me that i do not know what it was. \r\n\r\nif you guys have any information as to what this may have been i would really appreciate it. i have only told a couple people about this. just looking for some kind of explanation. thanks again.\r\n\r\n- chris mullen","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

red object. we all later agreed we were witnessing a ufo.  the light was travelling too slow to be a shooting star or a plane; it was silent as well which discounts any type of aircraft at the
