there was no ice or snow the night before. i could tell the ice was very thin for anyone to be on the ice. isaw a dense fog rolled in on top of the lake so dense that i cannot take pictures of the lake  and minutes later i returned to see that all of the circles and snow melted in the fog was gone.I was in my apartment at the time. i first noticed when i looked out of my back patio window. when i first saw it i thought it was warm water coming from pipelines that was melting the snow in straight lines until i saw all that the lines did not coincide with the pipes going to the lake.They were also circles in various spots around the lines in it.Because of the lake was so big i had to get a higher vantage point to take pictures and it took me several pictures to make a panoramic view of it. seeing the fog rolling in remind me of the movie the fog on how it came in and vanished. it was frightening. i even feel anxious about wrighting about it now.The first and last time i try to contact someone about these pictures and sent it to them i got no reply the pictures were erased from my computer.I did not erase these pictures. i still have these pictures . value them very much and if you

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Well where do i start. i will be detailed but brief since i could practically write a book regarding what i have experienced since the year 1995.  there were incidents before, one being an experience with a ufo in the late 70's at mt rainier national park.. i actually reported this incident to this same website a few years ago.  now i realize their were situations prior to this that started in the 60's but in the state of maine.  \r\nbut let me get back to the 1995 incident. there were actually two incidents within a few months of each other but it is the 2nd incident which forever changed how i see what we define as reality.  \r\nit began as any other day but changed approximately around 10 pm.  i was in my bedroom just talking with my now husband.  i was sitting on the bed and my husband was sitting in raised closed, (a closet with large drawers underneath so that you can sit on the bottom of the closet when opened).  all of a sudden everything seemed to freeze in time and i experienced what i considered to be a direct communication with some type of entity of unknown origin. the communication was all consuming yet i could see my husband sitting slightly slumped over with his hands now covering his face yet seemingly outside of my experience.  the communication came hard and very fast, i remember saying over and over again \"wow and slow down\"  the communication was so overwhelming fast, similar to like a computer download.  i have no memory of how much time transpired, nor what happened afterwards. my next clear memory was awakening in the morning. my first statement was \"everything looks the same but something is different\". then i was overcome by my senses to the point of anxiety and fear.  i saw how everything is connected, patterns in nature, representations, etc. i was physically shaking and so overwhelmed, this is when i asked my husband what he remembered about what i thought was last night. he remembers hearing me say wow and slow down over and over again but nothing else except awakening in the morning next to me. \r\ni wont go into all the details as to other unexplained events, but here is just one sample.  there was a brand new large projection tv in the living room which my stepfather had received for christmas.  one evening i awoke and was compelled to go into the living room to see the tv on close caption with a blue screen it had a 4 line mathematical equation with some symbols that i have never seen before. i remember just standing there studying it trying to memorize it.  i thought write it down but before i made my first step to do so my stepfather entered the room and asked me what i was doing and when he saw what was on the tv he promptly turned it off. i again saw the equation at a friends house conveyed in the same way. both televisions were on cable at the time. weird stuff just happens, so lets fast forward. mathematics is the language of the universe.  i have been working on what we currently refer to as the theory of everything but from a totally unconventional direction. having some success but my problem is i need a physicist, i have been self teaching myself with varying degrees of success but i can see it reflected in language, patterns and connections.  so i need a physicist to help convert it to a actual equation.  also i would like to know if anyone else had ever experienced anything similar.  well thanks for your time hope to hear from you, susan

a black oval shape object in the sky. the object looked like it was far from me a large distance but as i started down the hill coming to a four way road not sure of the crossing road.But there was a old white little building looked like a closed gas station on my right side.The black oval object seemed like it was getting closer and closer. now, there was still light on the horizon and before i new it the black oval shape object was hovering over my car in perfect silence. i looked for other cars coming in front and in the rear but i was the only car on the road at that time which i considered very odd during that time of day. as, i slowed my car down to about 3 to 5 miles per hour i stuck my head out the car to get a real good look at this strange object. i notice that the object did not make a sound plus it had 6 rows of pulsating lights like a whitish,orange,red color.Then when i thought to my self at time this must be a ufo i lost some time because all i remember that i was driving looking back and the black object was still in my rear moving real slow to my left. then when i got to my destination i realized that it was around 9:15 pm and trip should only

this thing was an object.  it was between two trees that had a good gap between each other which gave me a good view of the object coming toward me.  at first i thought this thing was just a regular

object was also going really slow.  i was startled at what i was seeing. the object suddenly turned itself to my left to go in a new direction and now i was seeing the side of it but the two lights in front of the aircraft were still visible. i then went out to the back deck to get a closer look since this object was now behind a line of trees in my backyard, but i could still see the object through them since the two lights were very bright. i hurried back into my house to grab my jacket being that it was about 20 degrees outside. it only took me about 3 seconds to get back outside. but i could no longer see the lights through the trees. i was still convinced that this thing was still there since it was going really slow and because i have a very big backyard. i hurried quickly to my neighbor's backyard that was behind the trees where this thing was flying over. it was gone, i was very disappointed being that this was my first ever sighting of a ufo. i have no idea how it

towards wendover avenue.  i looked at the clock in my car and it said 1:59 and it was afternoon.  as i drove north i saw a large passenger jet that had taken off from the greensboro airport.  as watched the jet i saw farther off behind it another flying object.  the jet was traveling south west(ish) and climbing.  the object behind it was higher and farther away and appeared to be a disc shaped craft.  the disc shaped craft was traveling due west, flat and level.  the jet crossed in front of the disc from my perspective.  the disc was traveling slow, slower than the jet.  part of this has to do with relative distance but, i believe that the disc was, in fact, traveling slower than the jet.  i began to think that the disc was just another jet appearing to be a disk due to distance and angle.  then the disc sped back over the path that it had just come down and a very high rate of speed and was gone in an instant.\r\n\r\nwhen i saw this i was shocked.  even though i had seen it as a disc shaped object i didn't expect it to actually do anything unexpected and out of character with a normal flight behavior.  when i say it went back from the way it came i mean that it was like a whip action.  it was cruising along and then in the blink of an eye went back the direction from which it had come and was gone.\r\n\r\nthe jet was probably a mile or more away as i watched it.  at the time i was just watching it and trying to figure out what airline it was from the paint scheme (never did figure that out).  the disc object was quite a bit farther behind the jet, maybe another mile away.  it was about the size of an aspirin held at arms length.  if it had not changed directions and sped away so fast i suspect that i would have ignored it.
