pulled up to a stop sign and observed what i thought at the time was an airplane spinning out of control like it was rolling over and over. i say this because the object had lights spinning in a circle but vertically not horizontally. my thought was it was a plane out of control about to crash. it appeared to be headed downward so i went out to where i expected to see a crashed plane. the speed and downward direction i thought it had to have crashed. drove out to where it would have had to had landed but nothing. this was out in the dark of the country it's a rural area. parked and turned my engine off to listen. no sound. couldn't figure where the object could have went. still thinking i had seen an out of control airplane cause i just didn't think ufo. just assumed an out of control airplane rolling over and over real fast causing the lights to rotate. looking back it didn't look like an airplane at all but at the time that's what i assumed it must be. drove back into town,about a mile, went to tell my friend about what i had seen. he was sheriff of our county. as we stood in his yard, you could hear this awful noise coming. as it approached there were trees between us and this noise. but you could see the lights. that scared us because it looked so big like one massive ship. but as it come over the trees it was in fact 5 jets flying in formation. just above the tree tops it seemed. could literally see the interior panel lights reflected on the front of the pilots face shields. that's how low they were. they were headed in same direction that the spinning craft went.  we thought that was weird but oh well. shrugged it off went ahead and drove down to my mother in laws where my wife was staying. this happens to be the exact direction of both the spinning craft and jets went.  this is where it got crazy. i witnessed nothing more but they had seen these events just before  i got there. \r\naccording the my, now ex-wife, she heard the first craft come over and why out to see what the noise was. when she got outside she could see an object hovering just down the road with lights spinning all around the bottom if the object. said once she was outside there was no longer any sound from it. as she walked out toward the road toward the object trying to see it better, she heard the noise of the jets coming. at this point she said the object went from a standing still hover and shot off to her left and was gone almost instantly. she said 2 of the jets accelerated and followed the object and that the other 3 jets actually turned and went another direction. i show up now after all this, and find her completely petrified and shaken up. her mother had actually gotten her bible and was hugging it. said she thought something was crashing into her home. the noise of all the jets had scared her terribly. anyway, i've always wanted to tell someone about that. it was odd. doubt anyone reads this but was nice to tell the story.

left to go home (northern va area) at about 3:30 pm.  the roads were very crowded and so our travel was very slow. within 15-25 minutes our travel was stopped because all the cars nearby had stopped and people were out of their cars looking to the left. i tried to see what they were looking at when the sun glinted off an object to my left.  i was astounded to see a disk-like ufo hovering at just over tree level.  i thought it must be some kind of joke or something but by this time people were screaming and honking their car horns.  i continued to view the object as it hovered.  it seemed to wobble as though riding the air currents.  i did notice something unusual about its outer surface.  the bubble on top did not move but the lower part of the ufo was spinning. it also seemed the upper and lower parts might not be joined completely.  it made me wonder if that might be part of how the craft operated. i didn't hear any noise from the craft but then people and cars were making a lot of noise.  the sighting first startled me, than amazed me and finally i admit i was a little frightened.  my poor friend was so freaked out she was crying and just said over and over \" i didn't see anything. there is no such thing as a ufo.\"  to this day she refuses to admit she saw it.  it terrified her.  after a few minutes (around 3 min from the time i witnessed it hovering) it suddenly slipped to the right and slightly higher in elevation and then shot to the clouds. it hovered there a few seconds and disappeared into the blue beyond. i had never seen anything move so quickly. it was a blur of movement from the clouds until it disappeared.  i don't remember if it affected the radio transmission or not.  i just know that the radio had been playing as we drove but i was totally unaware of it during the sighting.  once the disk was gone i became aware that the dj was excitingly talking about all the calls he was getting about a ufo.   i felt compelled to make this sighting known because recently i have combed the ufo sighting reports looking for the report just to see it in print. but i was surprised that i could not find one report in that time frame or in that area.  i am truly baffled because their had to be hundreds of people who saw it when i did and it was even on the radio talking about it.  i know what i saw and when i saw it so i just wanted to make sure it was put down in print.  i know it has been many years since the sighting but i doubt i will ever forget it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the main road (county road r). walking to the north there are fields as far as the eye can see to my right and a few scattered houses to my left. it was a calm late summer night and we were giggling about who knows what when out of the corner of my eye off to my right i could see a faint light pink light glowing in the distance. it was incredibly small at the time, so i assumed mars was having a bad night. as our walk continued i started to notice it getting larger and indeed closer. i asked my boyfriend what he thought it could be. the light was quite bright and though i couldn't hear anything, i could tell it was beginning to close the gap between us. my boyfriend had been watching it as well with the notion that something wasn't quite right. our conversation turned to other similar events. we even joked that aliens were observing us. when we had reached walmart, the light pink orb was at its largest, probably a bit like a nickle at arm's length. compelled to not lose

became as small as a star, then before i lost track of it, it took an unexplained left accent and was gone. the remainder of the night was filled with my boyfriend and i discussing the possibilities

my house.  after a few minutes i looked to the south when i noticed a bright white object traveling at a high rate of speed along a path above the horizon (55 degrees) traveling from my right to left (west to east).  thinking it was a shooting star initially, but it never faded and it kept the same light intensity.  then it stopped!  no movement, just a solid, bright white light, looking like any other star in the night sky but without the light bending, twinkling effect.  it remained stopped for 10-15 secs, then made a small but fast move downward and left to about 50 degrees above the horizon and stopped again for about 15 seconds.  then made a move upwards to the left and stopped.  it remained in a stationary position for about 30 seconds, then took off upward toward the atmosphere until it disappeared.  on it's departure, it accelerated until it was out of sight, turning from the bright white to grey, it's size decreasing until it disappeared out of sight.  this was not a movement over the horizon, but an acceleration directly out into space.  the object appeared to be intelligently controlled.  definitely not an airplane or a weather balloon.\r\n\r\ncurious about this, i walked outside the next night about the same time..And saw the same thing occur.  same appearance, same moves although with different maneuvers, and the same departure.  this did not happen the third night, or ever again.\r\n\r\ni decided to report this now because i recently viewed a nasa film about a particular shuttle flight and a strange object seen with it's cameras. while watching the film, i noticed a similar object following the shuttle on it's starboard side, matching its speed, then it suddenly accelerated off into space the same way i saw my two objects disappear.\r\n\r\nif drones existed in 1978 and can follow a shuttle in outer space, perhaps what i saw in 1978 was a drone.  that's the only object i can imagine that can maneuver the way i saw my objects move.  but the acceleration into space looked very real to me, and not man made, and definitely not a drone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

triangular craft pretty much directly above the houses, i would say maybe 3am, it was bright underneath and my eyes where in lots of glare,  the craft tilted slowly almost as if whoever onboard knew i was watching, i watched as the angle slowly tilted down at the front point and as the angle changed and light focused more down at the rooftops,  i could clearly see the shape of a floating triangle object in the sky. i was feeling all sorts of things, i don't know why i didnt grab my phone, i was on the floor kneeling at the window on a mattress on the floor. . i think i was in shock i don't know. after it finished tilting, it was  basically posistioned as if the driver was looking directly back at me although i dont rememerb wat i saw exactly in detail (i don't recall windows) but i very clearly saw the shape of the dark triangle and lights on the 3 points and also i think running along the ship in succession. the craft very slowly floated backwards and towards the right slightly. i knew straight away the direction it was heading, back to the pennine mountain  range north of bolton. it shrank in size as it drifted back into the moonlight, \r\nit must of been very clear because i watched it dissapeared to the size of a dot   i \r\n\r\nafter that experience this is the strange events after. \r\n\r\nsome months after that event i moved back in with my parents before i left for
