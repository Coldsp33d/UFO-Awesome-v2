enormous, round and was completely silent. \r\n4) all we could see were one row of red lights along the outer edge all the way around the disc. one light was like a chaser light, sort of like kitt from knight rider but it moved clockwise around the craft, not back and forth. by the time this chaser light got back around the craft the one ahead of it was only about 10% illuminated. the lights illuminated like pixels, the brightest light jumped from one light emitting fixture to the next in sequence. the craft disappeared after stopping on top of us, matching our speed of approximately 110km/h. my car did not have a sunroof so it wasn't visible for about 5 seconds. as soon as it became visible in my rear view mirror i accelerated as hard as i could, to around 180km/h and it did not pursue.\r\n5) for some reason i wasn't scared of it. it all happened very fast and very early in the sighting it was clear that although it had changed direction in response to our presence it chose not to pursue us. however now, writing this i am very emotional...\r\n6) the object was hovering over the highway motionless or moving very slowly. looking back the rotational movement of the red lights was less apparent, likely due to the distance between us and it. it looked more like it was pulsing / flashing red and every time it would flash its angle / position was different. left, right, left, right, etc. it eventually disappeared around a corner, it was hovering very low and was completely obstructed by trees. a few moments later we drove into an eerie fog and a squirrel appeared to be frozen on the right shoulder in mid stride, it was very strange. it wasn't dead, it had bright eyes, just as if it was frozen in time. i don't think the position it was in should have been possible, it was almost like it was leaping out onto the road and froze mid-air. i feel like our trip took much longer than it should have. we left halifax around 6:30 or 7 and we arrived in yarmouth after midnight. my girlfriend who was with me that night disagrees on this and maintains we left halifax later and that the times add up. i am positive we left at sunset. this took place within minutes of the greenwood air force base. i would love to hear from you. this was a spectacular experience and i have a witness. we have never used drugs.","distance":"21-100

witnessed the bright (white) lights of what appeared to be a low-flying aircraft.  we first noticed it as we drove under jimmy carter blvd overpass in norcross, georgia, turning a slight corner in the highway. at first sighting, we both assumed it was a low-flying airplane.  because of the bright white lights (and also because it seemed to be stationary), we both assumed the aircraft was flying directly toward us.  as we approached the lights, we both noticed the strange, rectangular row of lights, commenting that it wasn't an airplane (that it was too low) and nervously joked that it was a ufo because neither of us could identify the type of craft.  as our vehicle approached the exit for indian trail-lilburn (the next exit from jimmy carter blvd), it became clear that it definitely wasn't any known aircraft because it was hovering and completely still.  the craft was hovering near a short tower right before indian trail exit, and as we passed underneath, i glanced up to see its triangular shape.  the craft was pointed north to northeast, had several white lights along the bottom side of the triangle's perimeter, including the rear side, which also had a single, red light at the rear. because i was in the left-most lane (not including the hov lane), i didn't have time to traverse the number of lanes to my right in order to take the indian trail exit (to get a better look at the craft). i had to take the beaver ruin road exit, which was 1-2 miles away.  we kept our sights on the craft via the rear and side view mirrors of the vehicle, but lost sight of it once we were too far away.  i took the beaver ruin exit, making a u-turn of sorts, and got onto 1-85 south.  we searched the skies for the craft, but by the time we had made the turn-around, the craft had already disappeared.  i'm still in disbelief as to how stereotypical the craft appeared, and a bit haunted by how close to the ground it was.  i am curious if anyone else reported seeing this same craft, and i would like to be contacted if someone reports such.","distance":"101-500

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At the time, it just seemed like a rapid series of small events attributed to the heat, but....I know better.  and my colleagues know better.\r\n\r\ni was painting inside my new home, an old turn-of-the-20th century model with no air conditioning and no fans.  i had one of the windows open and several unopened jugs of water, but the heat was stifling.  after a while i worried i'd get heat sickness, since i was slick with sweat (and i never sweat), so i set the brushes down and went downstairs for water.  again, i had not opened the jug previous to now, so i was surprised that the rim tasted kind of sweet.  the back of my mind whispered that something wasn't right, but i ignored it.  i didn't have hot water in the house yet at that was fine with me, i wanted the cooler (not cold, just cooler due to the heat around the pipes) water to help stand the heat.  \r\n\r\ni was able to handle the water for about.....One minute.  my skin burned, and i found myself screaming at the pain and barely able to stand up.  my vision was blurry, and i knew i was about to pass out, so i quickly turned off the water, stumbled to my bed (that was right by the bathroom), and collapsed.\r\n\r\nthe last thing i remember before waking up, and it felt like that hazy part of a dream in those few seconds before you wake, was a man setting me down on the bed and standing behind me.  i liked him, as in i felt safe with him there.  i felt my body sink onto the bed, like i actually had just been set down, right before i opened my eyes.  over two hours had passed when i checked my phone....And it was then that i found three smallish red marks on the back of my hand.\r\n\r\nto me, i'd just had a very minor heat stroke and a wild dream, but i felt very unsettled.  i felt terrified, actually.  i quickly called my best friend (now boyfriend) to see if he could come over immediately, which he did.  i told him the story, omitting the \"dream\" about the man.  he took one look at my hand and his face went grim.  we have mutual friends and colleagues involved with certain sciences, and the first theory he had was that the grays had taken me.  of course we set that aside and had an esthetician (skincare specialist) look at the back of my hand, and i was told that it could very well just be bug bites.  but she had to admit, this was very symmetrical and perfectly aligned, rather unusual for insects.  if they were bites, then the marks would be gone in a matter of days.  if the marks remained there longer, then....She was honest.  then it would mean that my chances of abduction skyrocketed, no pun intended.\r\n\r\nthe marks were there for over a month, far beyond normal insect bites.\r\n\r\nthis happened last august, and i did a very good job of shoving the incident aside.  but then a few nights ago (feb 3 at 1:30am) i had just finished a movie and shut it off when i heard a low, pulsating, mechanical noise surrounding the apartment building.  i now live near a major road/highway, so i looked outside to see if there were any semis or vehicles driving by.  there was absolutely nothing, and as i looked, something inside me screamed to get away from the windows and stay the hell inside.  i sat on my bed for a moment, trying to figure out what the hum could be...And i was beyond terrified.  i don't get scared easy, and i have seen some messed up crap in my life, and as a christian i have not only been trained in prayer battle, but i've exorcised demons and faced off with truly scary people.  but right at this moment, i was shaking, crying, and clutching my bible for dear life.  it came to a point where i found myself curled up in the bathroom shower, praying for that stupid hum to go away!  during this i kept trying to call my boyfriend, but he never answered.  i did have a friend on facebook who prayed with me, and who understood the gravity of the situation.  i blasted worship music on youtube and then pandora, and it helped dim down the hum (i could still hear it, though).  the second a song stopped to transition, though, the hum pulsated louder like a revving engine.  every now and then the window would vibrate and tapping sounds could be heard.  only once did an actual vehicle drive by, closer to 2am and a completely different sound.\r\n\r\nfor three hours i stayed awake, trying to read my bible amidst the cacophony.  deep down i'd long since realized that i'd heard this exact same hum the \"night the water burned\" in august.  and all i could think, all that was chanting in my mind was, \"keep the lights on.  stay awake.  pray.  keep the lights on.  stay awake.  pray.\"\r\n\r\nfor three hours.  then at 3:45am, it stopped.  and at that exact moment, three states away, my boyfriend woke up.  he'd noted the time because he never wakes up that early on his own, and when he checked his phone he was shocked to see that not only had i called him dozens of times, but he hadn't heard any of it.  \r\n\r\ni went the entire day completely shaken.  i didn't go to school, i didn't even leave my room unless it was to use the bathroom.  he wanted to know what had happened, but it was several hours before i could even speak, at all.  finally i told him, and the whole time i did my heart raced and my body trembled, and i prayed it wouldn't happen again.  even though he reassured me it probably won't happen again, he did confirm the whispered fear in my mind: the m.O. fit the description of the grays.  he promised to contact our colleagues to see if there is any further information to help, but as of right now, as i write this, we have heard nothing.  \r\n\r\nhe is the only one who knows the whole story.  i debated on whether to report it or not...But the activity is something that needs to be recorded, and perhaps i am not the only one in the area to experience this.  even now as i write this, there is a tapping at my second floor window that has me playing worship music just in case.

so slow...I looked and saw what i thought was a big passenger jet but then realized it had no wings... it was as long as a 747 and the same diameter in the center...With a hump at each end like the 747 has..I realized as we got closer they it was only a few hundred ft. off the ground and was stationary. it was just north of i-80 and just east of i-180 a few hundred ft. we were very close and could see it was smooth.. no seams..White or very shine chrome color with what looked like a dark black window or door in the middle. i was so busy trying to figure out what it wasn't that by the time i went to get my cell for a pic it was gone. i don't know if it took off or disappeared.. just gone and no traces of it anywhere. im very observant and really didn't believe what i saw at first. but i know it wasn't a plane..Blimp..Cloud..Or anything i've ever seen in the sky..Or the ground for that matter! afterwards i was very upset about not getting a pic but can see now why many wouldn't. a

road in the country near my grandparents. like i said, i was 3, my brother was 4 and my sister a newborn. it was around 6oclock in the evening in march. from the kitchen window you could see across the dirt road into a field that had no trees. my mother went to the kitchen sink to warm a bottle for my sister. she glanced out the window and seen a huge object hovering in the field. she said it never touched the ground but set silently hovering for about 20 minutes. she said it was pulsating a pinkish light all over. she kept saying that is was huge and it was nothing like she had ever seen. she went out onto the porch to get a better look at it. me and my brother followed her and she sent my brother next door to get my grandparents. they came over and stood on the porch with my mother watching this thing. it never moved other that pulsating this light. there were no windows that my mother or grandparents could see. she said that the object was bigger than a plane and never made any noise. she said they stood there just staring at it trying to figure out what it was. finally, my mother said she had to feed my baby sister and my grandparents went home and we went in the house. she picked up my sister and went back to the kitchen window and it was gone, all in about 2 minutes that it took to get my sister picked up. she said nothing else ever happened and there was no missing

fall asleep when i noticed a bright orb (which i initially thought was a star) standing in the middle of the night sky. i watched it for a few minutes. after 4-5 minutes, the orb suddenly moved. it shifted downward at incredible speed, moving down and then left and then right. it did this for several minutes. \r\n\r\nthe movements it made could not be done by any man-made aircraft. that's how i knew it was a ufo. i watched the orb for a good 25-30 minutes in the night sky. around 10 minutes after i first spotted it (and after it made a bunch of shifting movements), it hovered again in the night sky.\r\n\r\nthe orb seemed to be moving around in a limited amount of area in the night sky, as it hovered over the neighbourhood adjacent to my neighbourhood. from my personal estimate, i think the orb was at an altitude of somewhere between 3,000 - 5,000 feet over the bloor and fieldgate area.\r\n\r\nthe orb would continue to shift direction and move incredibly fast from left to right to right to left as well as up and down and down to up. in a sense, it acted like a pinball moving from one spot of the night sky to another.\r\n\r\nabout 15-20 minutes after my first sighting, that's when i noticed a second craft. this second craft appeared almost triangular shape and pitch-black in colour. however, the rear of this craft had 5-6 lights on it, and they flashed in a sequential sequence. i remember seeing 2-3 orange lights flashing simultaneously on the back of this craft, before 2-3 red lights did the same. the craft moved east over my neighbourhood, with its lights switching from red to orange every 2-3 seconds. \r\n\r\nthis craft was at a much lower altitude than the orb and moving slower than it. it was moving at the same speed an aircraft or helicopter would make, so it may in fact have been an airplane, but from the odd shape of it and the mysterious light formation on the back of the aircraft, i don't believe it was a man-made aircraft.\r\n\r\nwhile the second craft was moving across the night sky over my neighbourhood, the white orb appeared stationary for a few seconds before it quickly shifted its position again to the right. when the second craft was out of my view, the orb continued to shift quickly to the right and move higher in the night sky. by this time, it was around 12:40 a.M. i took one last look at the orb and noticed it was now just hovering again in the night sky. it did not move for a few minutes. \r\n\r\nbecause i had been up for almost 16 hours, i was quite exhausted and fell asleep. i do not know what happened to the orb or the second craft, but from my experience seeing these 2 crafts in the night sky, i personally think these were ufos. \r\n\r\ni have not seen them since my first sighting.
