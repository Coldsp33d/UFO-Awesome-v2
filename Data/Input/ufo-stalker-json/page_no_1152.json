sound, punctuated by a loud, but muffled boom. sometimes the boom only happened once or twice. other times, it would sound a number of times, in rapid succession. this went on almost night for over a month. it then became several times a week, and continues to this day. i heard it this morning, at about 4:30am, and listened to it for an hour. there was no boom today...Just the deep-pitched droning sound. my husband has even heard it a couple of times.\r\nas for the direction of the sound, it seems to be from above, kind of in an \"umbrella\" sort of way.\r\nover the last month or so, i have contacted patrick air force base...Nasa...A tech person who works for a local gas company...The 2 local airports...None of these folks had an explanation for the sound. however, the nasa person said that i was the 3rd or 4th person to call nasa about a \"loud, deep humming sound and some weird explosions\". i have reported this already to my local mufon investigator...Dinah lechner...And we have been working on it together. i would like to have her remain my case investigator.\r\nthank you for any help you can give with this mystery.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":53891,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.601094592028755,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02032014-0004","longitude":-81.1594032428374,"occurred":1387450800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1391460559000,"summary":"Deep

phone when i started getting strange noises on my phone and then the call dropped. thats when looked up to the sky (which i do every night to look at the stars) when i noticed at a very close range (tree top distance) red lights in a formation (in a line) with one white light that did not blink or anything. the white light was consistent. my first thought was jets flying in formation until i realized there was no sound and also that i could not see the object that the lights were coming from at all. it was as if the whole thing was invisable except  for the lights.  i then started to follow the lights (which were not traveling fast at all) as far as i could to the vineyard behind my house, which allowed me to see this at a greater distance. it was huge, like five times the size of our airplanes today. at a distance over the clearing i could see how it was actually a sphere shaped object based on how the red-orange lights moved around it. there were six red-orange lights with one white in the center and the way the lights faded in and out was not how any of our planes do today. plus, the size and color was different. i was never the type of person who never believed in ufo's until like i always said \"if i see one\" and now i did. the other thing that was strange was this event only lasted about ten minutes but after it all i noticed my dog was gone for over an hour which was very strange. he is a well trained dog and never runs off. after this though i have been getting some of the worse headaches ever and a sense that their (ufo) presence here on earth is more then the human race understands. i have this unknown knowledge as to why all of this is happening and why it is actually occuring a lot more at an alarming rate. these things communicate at a much higher frequency and know things that only one humans internal (spirit self) would know, but even then the human would not know this if they are not in tune within themselves. i know this all may sound strange but \"we\" as the human race should see their presence as a clear waring as to what is ahead for all human kind. i will say this that it is very close to that time and the world will not see it coming nor will we ever see anything like this again. i know a lot more then depicted within this email but the facts are the facts and its at a point being closed minded is exactly why were all are in this predicament. there are some though who walk this planet who know exactly what it is that i am saying. some who will try there best to stop it from occurring, while others push for the happening. all i can say is the truth of everything all the way to the one question to it all is this.... we the human race needs to know why it is we are all here today and why we may not be here tomorrow. its a very deep and intresting journey.

i stand up turn around and looked out my back window.Approximately 30 to 50 feet away from me and a little to the left i see the most colorful scary beautiful object i've ever seen. under my breath or in my mind i said oh s*** they're real. as soon as i said or thought that a super thin bean shot out of the craft through my next door neighbors trailer and directly to my rights it's slowly started to move towards me and i thought to myself i should probably move. but i could not i was paralyzed i could move my eyes i could breathe but i could not move. the beans slowly move towards me and as soon as it hit my eyes i was laying on my floor looking straight up at my ceiling with my eyes open still paralyzed. i mumbled under my breath for my girlfriend to help me.She heard the distress in my voice and instantly started to shake me, and say my name and asking me what was wrong.Her touch broke me free of the paralytic state. i gave her short description of what happens she was kind of freaked out but not seeing it herself i'm not sure what she believed. for some strange reason i didn't talk about it for a long time didn't even think about reporting it or ask anyone else about it. but ever since that day there has been this small bb like object just underneath my skin on my right upper thigh. but there is no mark showing how it got in there. a few times since then i have had the paralyzed sensation but never seen anything like that again. the question of whether or not aliens exist or whether they are visiting this planet has been answered. there is absolutely no earthly explanation for what i saw.I am willing to take a polygraph to prove that what i am saying is truefor those who try to tell me that this was a dream. let me tell you that there was nothing unusual or out of the ordinary to make me believe that this was a dream. even if you have a dream about a real life event there's always something very peculiar in the dream like a chicken wearing a tuxedo or something just not real.Some might even say that the ufo itself was the strange thing.Say what you will but i know the difference between a dream and real life and i'm pretty sure i would have had another dream or something like that in my 42 years of life.Lucid and vivid dreams do happen but are easily discernible from real life. this was my trailer this was my backyard this was a ufo.I would very much like to know what this thing is in my leg and would love to have it removed. thank you for your time. david","distance":"21-100

miles off in the distance went from green and red to white, as it approached. once it reached, its maximum distance from us, it hovered. the lights changed from white to colored again and seemed to follow a clockwise, circular motion around the craft. it began very slowly and then picked up speed. the lights were blue and red and yellow and green. it seemed to me, i was being distracted. a feeling of dread began to come over me, as we stared at it. it was an oval, shape. the lights came from the outer edge of the craft, in the middle. those lights changed from colored to white as it approached us, and then to color again as we stared at it. the craft itself appeared, flat grey, metallic. it seemed to be about a mile or less away. i would say that it was about 20 to 30 feet in diameter.\r\n   as we watched the light show...I had a disturbing feeling of foreboding. i felt as though we were seeing something that we shouldn't be seeing. my little dog began to growl at the same time that feeling took hold of me. my friend yelled we see you !!! and i quietly said, let's get the hell outta here!! she didn't argue. which felt like a relief, because i was becoming uneasy and actually quite terrified. \r\n  as we pulled back onto the highway. i asked my friend if it was still there, and she said it was gone.\r\n  this was the only time i had ever witnessed a ufo. my friend said she sees them all the time in beausejour, manitoba. i have also spoken to 2 other friends who say they see them all the time. i have noticed a military presence in the area at times, and have wondered about it, as there was no reason for them to be there. no flooding, natural dissters, etc. and furthermore, no military base either.\r\n  i cannot provide any other evidence, but the area should be explored. i am going to start an investigation. i will be arming myself with cameras, and will diligently record times sizes distances and locations. i have no doubt i will get evidence.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

helicopter's tail. however, upon turning off my music and rolling down my  window, i was unable to hear anything at all, aside from the cars, and i expected that  something as large as this thing

moved, i was able to see that it  was actually shaped like a kite. it flew in such a way that had the longer sides of the 'kite' up  at a higher level so that one light moved higher than the other three. the red lights  appeared to be on the bottom, rather than higher up as it had originally appeared.\r\n\r\ni glanced over to the left periodically (i did not pull over), and watched as the

the  area.\r\n\r\nthe object did not actually move at any point when i was looking at it.  instead, it started pulsing in a way that reminded me of how a flashlight  looks when it's going out - it

there is a wooded area behind our house. i saw three circular red lights in the distance.\r\nthey weren���t moving like planes, so i assumed that they were perhaps military helicopters. i\r\nestimate that their altitude was perhaps 2,000 feet. the other reason that i thought they were\r\nhelicopters was that they seemed fairly close together, as opposed to how planes would be. there\r\nwas cloud cover and the lights were below the clouds.\r\n\r\ni didn���t think much of the lights until i noticed that they weren���t moving. they were in a triangular\r\nformation with one light at the top, another light below it and to the left and a third light to the\r\nright of the second light and a bit below it. i still thought that they must be helicopters at this point\r\nand i kept watching because it was unusual to see three of them flying together. \r\n\r\nat that point, the uppermost light moved in an unusual way. from my viewpoint, it moved down\r\nand then to the left, toward the second light. it remained there for just a couple of seconds and then\r\nwent to the right and up to it���s original position as the top light in the triangle. this movement was\r\nvery fast and struck me as being unusual for a helicopter. both times that it moved, both going down\r\nand back up again, it followed what could be described as a reverse ���l��� shape. for example, it moved\r\ndown and then moved to the left at a 90 degree angle. after that, it followed the same path in reverse,\r\nmoving quickly to the right and then moving up at 90 degrees to get to it���s original position.\r\n\r\nafter seeing that movement, it finally occurred to me that they might not be helicopters. other than\r\nthe top light, the other two had not moved for over a minute. i thought that it would be unusual for\r\nthree helicopters to maintain position for that long. also, there were no blinking navigation lights.\r\njust solid red lights. i listened carefully for any noise of helicopters, but there was none. three helicopters that close and at that low altitude would have made noise.\r\n\r\ni grabbed my iphone that was nearby and started taking what i intended to be a video, but as it turned\r\nout, there are just still photos. i have three photos of the lights and also the trees in the foreground. i went inside to get my girlfriend and have her look. i was inside for perhaps 10 seconds. when we both\r\ngot out to the deck, only one of the lights remained. after a few seconds, it was no longer visible. my\r\nthought was that it went above the cloud cover and could no longer be seen. the other two lights may\r\nhave done the same thing while i was inside. the photos show three very defined circular red lights.\r\nthe defined circular shape was another thing that made me think they might not be helicopters because\r\nnavigation lights would be blinking and have more of a starburst type effect as opposed to being circular.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet -

the objects were in the same exact line of sight. i tried to focus my eyes as much as i could to see if i could tell what they were made of or if there was something hanging off of them. there was nothing to distinguish them. they were high up and looked small and round. they looked dark like maybe they were painted black. \r\ni thought at first balloons or something like that and we were all laughing.. but as time went on.. everyone started getting chills... we left about 25 minutes later but the two objects were still there.. the man recorded the event but i never got his number.\r\nbefore we left one of the guys thought they were getting farther but i thought it was just clouds covering them more. honestly they were so hard to see unless someone pointed them out... that was a weird day indeed what were the chances we would see that when we should of been rushing to work like everyone else. we left and they had never moved i wonder if someone else saw these i wish i could have stayed until they left i was very  excited and wanted to see how they would move.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":53868,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.163893,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02022014-0003","longitude":-118.521333,"occurred":1391241600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving along highway 39 out of klamath falls, as i was entering the town of merrill when i noticed a pure bright white pointy edged kind of rectangular light emanating from an object (to me seemed to perfect of a light to be a kitchen window light) silhouetted by the houses behind it in a field about 50-60 feet away from me off the main road. although it was dark out still i could make out a pie plate shaped object about 20 feet in diameter with a sort of dip missing from one side. it was on that side i noticed more than two but no more than four smaller persons around it. i got the impression they were working, i did not pay too much attention to them as i slowed to make out what i was looking at. suddenly i got a stabbing feeling in me the people around the object were alarmed i had noticed them and now i was staring. i could not make them out because of the dark but i thought maybe they were a mix of children and teens or possibly women because of the height and frame, they stopped what ever it was they were doing and stood still. i entered town and lost sight temporarily. i was driving a u-haul truck and towing a car trailer, it was difficult but i made a u-turn to take a longer look at this weird object. when i returned after a time lapse of maybe 3 min. tops most likely less, it was no longer there only a kind of haze or fog remained. i scanned the sky hanging my head out the window. i noticed a blinking red beacon for aircraft like the kind all over the area on mountains and towers. this beacon was about maybe 50 feet above a closed sore or business, i stared at it realizing nothing was holding this \"beacon\" up, like it was trying to mock the other beacons all over the area. the flashing stopped then red and white lights came on all around the outside of the craft then began to go around the circumference of it in sequence, white then red then white... i knew it was definitely a disk at that point. the front (or what i assume was the front) tilted downward about 20 degrees and began to slowly fly off at a casual helicopter speed. i assume in order to throw me off by mocking a helicopter now. this made me laugh because it was nothing like a helicopter. i listened intently for any noise as it made no noticeable sound at all. first it flew south east, then about a mile away from me it changed direction toward where i estimate mt. shasta is from my spot along the road where i had parked, then continuing at the same speed flew out of sight from me. at that point i drove around a bit investigating the edge of town where the craft was landed, i noticed a couple of things i considered strange that may or may not have relevance to the sighting. like a man in the house closest to the landing site sitting in front of a large pain window with no blinds being completely oblivious to my accidentally getting a giant truck stuck on his front lawn when i attempted another u-turn, almost as if he were some kind of hypnotized or something. i continued on my way. once i got to the wooded area of the drive by the lava flows monument my truck lost power and slowed almost to a stop for no apparent reason at all. most of my attempts to make calls or texts were stopped short by no signal in areas signal has never been a problem for me. i felt both watched and not alone the rest of my drive to reno and occasionally still feel watched and not alone even as recently as this morning. since i have felt weary to be alone outside in the early morning dark, i don't understand why when i wasn't frightened by the event. my new camera that unfortunately didn't have battery's at the time this happened does not work anymore even after i replaced the battery's a couple times. it makes me think this thing somehow broke it.","distance":"21-100

event occurred on january 31st, 2014. \r\n\r\nmy husband was working outside the area. he was supposed to come back on february 6th. \r\n\r\ni was watching tv, alone at home. time was 7 pm. it's winter here in quebec so it was dark at this time. i noticed a flash of light, much light lightning. there was no storm outside, sky was clear and i did not hear any thunder. a second flash of light lighted the whole area for at least 5 seconds. at first, i thought that the nearest electrical transformer failed because i've seen transformers fail a few time before. but no, this was not a transformer because we still had electricity. \r\n\r\nthat did not bother me at first. i resumed watching tv. suddenly, i seen a shadow walk across the living room. i asked \"richard, is that you?\", thinking my husband came back from work. i looked around and nobody was here. i walked around in my house but could not find richard so i checked the parking and there was no car parked. i told to myself, i am tired. i must have been hallucinating. \r\n\r\nthe movie i was watching ended. i decided to watch another film. it was about 15 past 10 pm and i was getting sleepy so i decided to do my nightly routine, brush my teeth and prepare my bed. i went to bed and fell asleep almost immediately.\r\n\r\nafter a few minutes, i woke up with a feeling that somebody else was inside the room. i slowly opened my eyes and saw a silhouette staring at me at the feet of my bed. i couldn't notice any feature so i snapped a picture with my phone. i was not sure if i was awake or dreaming so i closed my eyes and feel asleep for the rest of the night.\r\n\r\nnext day, i was browsing through my phone. i found out a picture taken the day before. the silhouette i saw was in fact a small humanoid being, about 4 feet tall, big eyes, staring at me. i felt sick when i remembered that i really took a picture of this being and that i immediately fell asleep after snapping this photograph. i don't remember what happened after.\r\n\r\ni decided to post this on mufon and i wish to talk to people that witnessed the same thing that i've witnessed. i don't know what happened, because i fell asleep right after the encounter.\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

drove to when i drove to the center of our pasture.The light beam was bright white around 10ft. squared and coming directly toward me.When it shined on me i all i thought of was u don't want me up there with u i'm to crazy.The light ascended up again showing its size an only stars around it.When it moved away from me i watched how it had no affect to high grass or trees.I sat in total shock
