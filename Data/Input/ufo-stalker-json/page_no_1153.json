should be reported while i am still alive. it happened during the summer following an afternoon thunder storm. it may have happened as late as the summer of 1941 but probably in the late 1930s. location observed was from the northeast shore of bryant long lake which is located in the northern portion of what is now the city of eden prairie but then was a township. eden prairie is a second tier suburb southwest of minneapolis, minn. \r\nafter the thunder storm passed & the sun came out, i remember running outside to see the rainbow but instead saw a multitude of straight laser like lines of various colors against a very dark stormy northeast sky. i ran inside our home to tell my mother asking what they were & she said they were the reflection of street lights & traffic lights from minneapolis. however i never saw anything like that prior to that or at anytime since then. i don't think laser was invented until well after ww2. this was not a ufo, i think, but something i have never seen again in my life & in retrospect do not think my mother was correct but gave me the most logical explination she could think of. \r\nyou asked a number of questions in your check list

been birds, they looked more like ghosts, plus they glowed.  there was no sound whatsoever.  the lights were solid with a tint of glow, almost like what some would say \"a ghost-like glow\".  i was hoping the object would go in front of a star so i could determine if it was solid or not, but id did not happen.  i compared it to the stars in the background and the stars were a sharp in contrast, but the object lights were clear but translucent or glowing (hard to describe).  it flowed through the sky from east of my location towards the los angeles area within 3-5 minutes.  it was not speeding but a slow hover.  i've seen picture of the tr-3b astra and there's a possibility that, that's what i saw. i did not think it was extraterrestrial, but perhaps u.S. made craft.  who
