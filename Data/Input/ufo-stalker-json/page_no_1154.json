���it is just that! not little green men! all i can do is tell you what i saw! i now have a private pilots license and i know airplanes! i know flight paths too! i can tell you that too this day i still don't know what it was! this was not just some fast moving light in the sky a long way off ! it was quite close and i have only seen this one ! it happened ���mcalester���oklahoma back in the late 60's ���maybe 70. it was a nice clear day spring or summer about one hour before sundown! i was at d's mom and dads house standing in the front yard looking east! the house was on south street that runs east and west! it is about three miles north of the city airport! the airport is small but can handle small jets! with the wind out of the south a left down wind will put you east of the run way and turning base will head you west! i first noticed what looked like the landing light to a small cessna turning base in the pattern! maybe 900 ft ��� ��� a g l . i stood just a little west where it should turn final! almost under the turn! i was. use to watching ���the little aircraft make this maneuver ! this light on base was strange because i only saw the light and not the aircraft ! that is what got my attention first! ���i kept looking but saw only the light ! its speed was consistent with say a cessna 152 in the pattern!\r\nit kept coming and still nothing! i yelled at d that's a u f o get a camera! she rushed in the house but quickly came back and said she didn't have one ! by this time i should have seen the aircraft clearly ���in the bright sky but only this light! no sound ! cessna's at that hight ���make a lot of engine noise ! nothing! when it should have turned final it did not! it did not change course ! it was now directly over my head and the light had changed ! with out a blink or even fading down i could clearly see not one bright light but four it was a seamless transition the one light looked just like four locomotive main head lights bulbs on dim ! that kind of orangish color and the grouping was just the same also in a tight diamond pattern . but now i could see the lights were in the center of something about 60 feet across that was spinning around like the blades of a helicopter. but i could see them but could not see them! it was like looking through the thing !No aircraft body and no sound ���and the four lights! as it passed slowly over the four lights again appeared as one bright light again and the spinning part was unseen also ! still no sound ! i watched as this light continued west about the same distance as when i had first saw it east of me! i was a bright light against a well lit clear blue sky! then twice something flashed out pure white not like a gas but a plasma burst ! then it blinked out and was gone!���\r\nfor what it is worth a man who d worked with and lived about one mile north said that he was working out in his yard about the same time and noticed a silver cigar thing ! he said he only saw it but did not pay anymore attention to it! d saw it too! and that's my u f o story !\r\n \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":53826,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.167824,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01312014-0003","longitude":-95.775608,"occurred":-21142800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oklahoma","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,   Circle,   Disc,   Flash","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1391167185000,"summary":"Bright light first over head 4 dimmer orang lights same place looked like disk back to bright light flashed out","tags":["landing","lights"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":16346,"locationName":"Indianola, Oklahoma","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:202233"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Wasilla","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Wasilla, alaska: we were driving home from an awards ceremony at the middle school... driving west on the parks highway to lake lucille, where we live. the night was clear and full of stars. we became aware of two orbs in the sky near our home. they appeared stacked and about 200 feet apart,a bit offset and not moving. the orbs were orange and glowing. when the orbs were first noticed, my wife asked, \"when did they put in a new tower?\" there are no towers near our home - new or old. i pulled over to have a closer look. we got out of the truck and watched as one orb left. as it began to move, the orb changed color from orange to red. it moved rapidly to the west and disappeared in approximately five seconds. the second orb followed suit approximately 30 seconds after the first disappeared; same color change, same direction, however, the second orb disappeared within approximately 3 seconds (much quicker than the first). no sound, no emissions, no strobes from either orb. we live in alaska and are accustomed to a wide variety of military aircraft, aurora borealis,and fireworks. the objects had no commonality with aircraft nor did they look like stars or planets (besides they were too close). the orbs were not frightening or disturbing, but does cause us to wonder - what are they? where are they from? where are they going? will they return?","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":53825,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":61.5825276,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01312014-0002","longitude":-149.6362034,"occurred":1391142900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alaska","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1391160963000,"summary":"Two orbs, glowing orange, stationary, hovering, approximately  a mile away/above. both left within one minute of each other. no sound, two to three seconds to vanish - to west.

up. it appeared to be about the size of a big van. i couldn't tell the exact shape because it was blurred or morphing like. as i spotted it, as asked my only sober friend(the rest of my family was drinking and though i was joking when i yelled ufo) if she was seeing it to and she was. so i knew i wasn't just seeing things. we watched it for about 30secs then i slowly took off over the houses going north. it made no sound at all. then about a half mile it vanishes.  either it blinked  out or took of so fast i couldn't see it.  i know for a fact it wasn't a helicopterair  or airplane. i

camera's back then.At this stage we got concerned an started to leave,as we did it blinked out and reappeared 10sec later in the same place and remained there until we got the hell out of there,i'm not ashamed to say it scared the hell out of us,i remember it like it was yesterday.Its still a mystery,as i said there was no wind that night it was completely calm and no sound from this object either....That's my up close and personal encounter...Thanks \"d\".","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

pulled up to my condo and their it was hovering right on top of a peak we call el toro,so i jumped on top of this fence to get a better look, now the craft was a blueish green color what a awesome color!!! it shined a blue light on me, i could see my shadow on my gorge door,when it did that it gave me a weird fealling,the only time i had that same fealling was when i was a 49er game,it was the 49ers against the falcons, a nationaly televised game,every time that camera would come in contact with me it gave me that same weird feeling,anyway i pulled out my buck knife and raised it up and yelled i knew you fuckers were out there,at that same time i herd a helicopter coming so i looked up at the craft and it slowly duck behind the peak so i jumped down from the fence and watch the copter fly by to my amazement after the copter was gone the craft came back up so i jumped back on top of the fence at this time tommy was totally freak out so i yelled calm down it did not work.I turned around and tried to get a better look at the craft but all i could see was a blue light just like the video the guardian,it was the same craft now i here car coming down the road fast the craft ducks down behind the peak again so i jump down and i see two black cars fly by now that i think about it the copter flat black anyways after the cars were gone the craft came back up now i had to get
