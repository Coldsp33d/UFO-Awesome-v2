almost looked like a cloaked craft of sort, basically invisible except for the triangle lines that formed. since then, i have noticed more and more unusual objects in various photos i have taken.

night smoking a cigarette when we saw a visibly solid object disc shape descend slowly from the nw and stop - the object became stationary.  all the while we observed pulsating red orange yellow redish lights that were visible around the perimeter of the object - the lights pulsated as if in a cycle.  after  several seconds of what appeared to show the object to be in a stationary position - we could tell it was stationary because the object held its outline against the tops of the trees without moving.  the event occurred  a short distance from our home which we observed directly across a field adjoining our property.  as the object began to slowly move again, it appeared to dip slightly and very slowly descended behind the trees and it was then no longer visible.  within a few seconds of the object disappearing behind the tree line we saw a helicopter (we think it was) since we often see helicopters flying over the area at night and are able to recognize these, flying quickly in the direction of the object.  the helicopter had normal red flash lights.  this too disappeared behind the tree line.  the object was so large we assume that there must be other reports since this is somewhat of an urban rural area and it just could not have been missed since it was so apparently clear in the sky.  we were both amazed at this object and somewhat shocked to see this.  my husband ran to our kitchen to get his iphone in order to get a picture but the object did the slight dip and descended behind the tree line before we could pull up the camera app.  this one was the most clear and strangest object we have seen ever.  i hope someone else saw this too and reported it because it was amazing and somewhat awesome to see. we can't imagine that no one else would not

ends seemed squared off. i had thought they may have been some one's christmas lights blowing in the wind, when it started doing the dripping thing again from its bottom edge. my wife went in after

from my bedroom window to the sw. i got my binoculars and observed that it was flashing bright colors - white, red, and blue every 1/2 second. through the binoculars i could see that there was a dull grey spherical object with lights spinning around it from right to left. i went outside to the street in order to observe the object better and noticed that there was a second similar object to my right (west). the object to my right then disappeared after a few minutes while the one to my left remained in the same position. i had to go in to bed and did not see the second object return but the first object remained. later that night at about 4:30 a.M. i was awakened by a bright light coming into my bedroom window. i was confused as to what could have caused that as it has never happened before and i could find no cause for it the next morning. the strange thing was that i went right back to sleep without investigating the light at the time. i don't know if that was related to the lights in the sky or not.  the next two nights i looked for the objects again but they did not reappear. i looked online to see where the planets were and there should have been none in that area but this did not look like a planet at all, and planets do not flash in exact timing or have spinning lights. i wanted to report this but must remain anonymous due to my job.

a panoramic photo of the sunrise.  while taking a series of 3 photos i noticed a curving brighter line in the clouds.  i assumed it was part of a contrail and paid no further attention until it came time to process the 3 photos into a panorama a day or two later.\r\n\r\nafter loading the 3 digital olympus raw file images into my computer and into photoshop the bright curve caught my attention again.  when i blew the image up to 1:1 pixel view i was astounded to see that my \"contrail\" was actually a sharply defined disc resting in the clouds about 15-20 degrees above the horizon.  the disc was tilted toward me, the top partially obscured by the clouds but the bright edge of the disc very clearly visible.\r\n\r\nthe image was taken with an olympus om-d e-m5 using an olympus 14-150mm lens at 14mm.  the e-m5 is a micro 4/3 camera and the short side of the image at 14mm covers approx 45 degrees.  by laying a grid over the image i was able to determine that the diameter of the disc was covering approximately 2 degrees.  guesstimating that the object might be as much as 5-10 miles away i concluded that the size of the disc might be about 850-1700 feet.\r\n\r\nthe image of the disc appears on two of the three overlapping images i made for the pano.  there are only a few seconds elapsed between the two images and the disc shows no apparent motion.\r\n\r\ni am attaching the

office in somersworth n.H./she had business with the state office of some kind. i remember her licsense plate read hounds on it but i dont remember her name. we had just left the lee traffic circle heading east passed durham nh / to get me home when we saw the craft. i new right away that it was something id never seen before it was very large and had lights that seemed to revolve/rotate on the underside but the upper part of the craft seemed to be sationary only the underside of the craft was moving /the lights as i recall were red and possibly green or blue .It was in and open area of durham n.H with the the unh horse barns just behind it and the rt#4 which we were traveling i dont really remember for sure but one of the lights were defintitly red. as i looked a the craft it occurred to me that the lights were moving with the bottom half and appeared to be switching from  one side to the other side of the ufo  but i realized that they were just rotating on the under side . this craft was very large and it looked like a feeris wheel on its side ,it made no autable sound other than a low electrial sort of hum and current you could feel on you skin and it kind of reminded me of the sound a jump rope makes when it breaks the air around it as you are jumping that low whooping sound but not really a sound maybe a vibration. when i got home i called the dover pd and they laught at me, so i called the pease air force base i  portsmouth n.H. they told me that it was probably a helicopter. i also called the durham police station and when they took my call they( the dispatcher)  didnt want to talk becauce they(other officer/police employees)  were witnessing the ufo themselves and she wanted  to get off the phone and see the ufo for herselves.  at the time this occurred i didnt have a phone in my apt. i had to use my neigbors phone. they were a husband /wife and child that lived right next to me .  the husband was in the air force and worked at pease air base   after i made the calls from his phone he was call back to the base for some purpose unknown to me at the time and that he would not discuss with me because i asked him if it had any thing to do with what i saw . he would not give me an answer and left to report for work. but it seemes very odd to me. i still wonder about this and would love to talk with other who might have seen the
