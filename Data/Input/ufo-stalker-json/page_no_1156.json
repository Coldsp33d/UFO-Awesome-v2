were fireworks and sky rockets as one might expect, i noticed a light that i thought was a helicopter that traveled from the nw towards the se from my vantage point. this light then stopped at about 11 o'clock from my position and hovered, a second object then appeared below the first and hovered below it. the first object then ascended higher and higher while the second object remained stationary. i walked to the front of my driveway and observed two more objects far out to the west and appearing star like and much smaller. through all of this i thought what i was seeing were either flares or chinese candles, keep in mind it was just after midnight on new years eve. i watched the objects for at least several minutes, i thought they appeared out of the ordinary but given the circumstance ( new years eve 12:03 am )i thought they were probably flares or chinese candles. i returned inside my house and after a while i went to bed. i was not drinking and let me state that clearly, i had no alcohol although it was new years eve. the next day there were news reports of these same objects ( by description of media reports )on the news. this got my curiosity right away. looking into it i found a video from the hollywood hills on the internet and it was exactly what i had witnessed. what really got me was the fact that i am at least 25 miles south of the hollywood hills. how do you see the same flares or chinese candle from a location separated by that distance in a major metropolitan area. the news reports described these objects ( eyewitness accounts ) exactly as what i had witnessed. these same objects were seen from canada to n.California ( shortly before i seen them ) and also in texas and n.Carolina. it was only then after seeing these reports the next day that i was convinced i had seen something completely out of the ordinary. they were a pinkish orange color and their movements were very odd ( not way out whacky but just how they seemed to glide )turns out a whole lot of people seen them in a whole lot of places. that's a true honest account and what i seen i have no idea what they were. i took a photo with my cell phone and it shows nothing.

dimmed out and was no longer visible. i honestly thought there was going to be some kind of ufo invasion or something.  i have never seen anything like this before.  i had a sighting about 7 years ago but it was only a single orb.  however, the orb i saw 7 years ago and the ones i saw tonight were of the same color, size, and behaved very similarly.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

we noticed several star size lights randomly blinking all over the sky, at times there may be one and other times at least 10 of them. about 7:15 we both witnessed a sphere like white light suddenly appear about 30 degrees off the horizon and straight in front of us heading north, after maybe 10 seconds it went out. a couple minutes later another white light appeared, possibly the same one, and split into two separate lights, one kept going in the same direction the other turning east, after about 10 seconds they went out.  around 10 or so minutes later we saw a rectangular object, we could clearly see 4 square sections that resembled windows and the entire thing was glowing white and horizontal to the ocean, it lasted a little more than 10 seconds before it went out. we both described to each other how it looked just like windows in amazement. a few minutes later the rectangle object appeared again except it was vertical to the ocean and in within 10 seconds went out. just south of us a single white light appeared over the water that light up the cloud above it and cast a light on the water, after a few seconds it went out. we watched between 6 or 8 of these white lights appear and within seconds go out.Around 7:35 or so we observed a red pulsating object north of us and at a high altitude heading east over the ocean, it was to far away to tell its shape. after a couple minutes it just disappeared. at about 8:00 another red object flying the same path did the same thing.\r\nwhile watching these lights we heard no noise of any type coming from them.\r\nwe have watched these and other types of lights on previous nights, usually between 7 and 8pm and every time we see the star like blinking objects all over the sky we see strange lights like we did on this night.\r\ni've been in the military and in law enforcement and have been around a lot of different aircraft, flares and even seen chinese lanterns before and no way possible it could be any of these things.\r\ni tried several times to take a photo of these lights but they would go out before i could focus my camera, or they would go out as soon as i turned my camera on. i will keep trying to get a photo of these lights.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:45:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

ever seen, realized it couldn't possibly be a star as it was too close and far too bright with no defined perimeter. i couldn't take my eyes off of it, i wanted to tell my travel companion but i didn't want to look away to tell her. orb stayed in same position to aircraft for several seconds and suddenly descended straight down extremely fast leaving a tail of white light. after the orb has disappeared from sight i kept looking for it, i then looked around the plane to see if anyone else seemed sort of stunned and excited.  i turned to my friend, with an odd look on my face i suppose because she immediately asked me \"what? what's going on?\" i excitedly told her what i had just seen.","distance":"Over One

pm. there was no cloud cover, which is unusual for this area. i saw what i thought was an airplane because it was bright, and i kept seeing flashes of color, mostly red flashes. i waited to see which direction the aircraft was flying. i noticed that it was moving slightly but it didn't move continuously in any direction, with the end result being that it stayed in the same relative position. then i though it might me flying towards me, but it didn't get larger. \r\n\r\ni would take my eyes away to do other things, then looked back. i kept seeing flashes of color, and couldn't think of an explanation for those. at one pont i saw a small moving pont of light fly into, behind, or in front of this brighter light and i didn't see it reappear on the other side.\r\n\r\nthen i decided to look at it through binoculars, and to ask my husband to look at it also. it seemed strange enough that i should pursue it somehow. he looked at it with his eyes, then with one eye through a single eyepiece of some binoculars. i asked him if he thought it looked strange. he said, \"yes, very.\" he described it as looking like a little christmas ball with colored lights flashing around it. it appeared to him like it was moving towards him. he gave me a better pair of binoculars and when i first looked through those,  i  was really surprised to see multiple colored lights in a clump, bight primary colors: white, red, green, and blue. i also saw black space in between the lights. the whole bundle of lights seemed to be moving slightly...Up, down, back and forth, and i saw trails from the colored lights. i watched this for several minutes.\r\n\r\ni turned on my \"sky watch\" app, pointed my phone in the general direction of the light. the only thing that seemed to correspond, position-wise to what i was looking at was the star sirius. it was downward and to the left of the big dipper. but even if i was looking at sirius, a binary star, how could that explain the multiple colored lights that we saw? and if it was one of those new drones that are out there nowadays, it seems like it should have moved off at some point.  so i was stumped. i tried to photograph, then take a video of it but those didn't reveal the interesting details.  the light was still there an hour later when i got tired of looking at it and went to bed.
