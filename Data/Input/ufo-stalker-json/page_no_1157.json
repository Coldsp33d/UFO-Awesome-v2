beating too fast. i looked at my phone and it was 10:34 pm. reassured, i told myself that i had probably dreamed of this observation. \r\n\r\ni instinctively looked out the window. what i saw completely hurt me. there was a total of two beings standing, looking at me through my window. they were about 4 \r\n\r\nfeet tall, big heads, big slanted black eyes, no nose, only nostrils. they looked at me with a terrible stare. i could feel anger towards me. i was sweating cold \r\n\r\nwater. i was terrified. suddently, they disappeared in a matter of seconds. i felt reassured for a second, until something cold grabbed my legs and my arms at the \r\n\r\nsame time. i couldn't move, they were holding me tight. i could feel something cold inside my skull, as if someone was touching parts of my brain. it was a really scaring experience. a really uncomfortable feeling. everything went black and i passed out.\r\n\r\ni woke up next morning at 09h52, with a terrible headache.

my doubt is not about what i saw, it has more to do with whether or not you will want to hear what i have to say.\r\nanyway, here's my story.\r\n\r\nin 2006 i was living in illinois but, working in washington state as a plumber.\r\ntowards the end of june or july i had arranged to meet a longtime lady friend of mine in illinois and after which we would then fly to my home in england.\r\ni left washington on new year's eve with the intention of driving back to illinois during christmas's itself and was well on my way when the following occurred.\r\ntraveling east i had passed the northern part of yellowstone then going south i went over the \"bighorn mountain' and going through a crow indian reservation south of billings, north of the montana\\wyoming border.\r\ni was in the middle of nowhere. there were no lights visible, not even the loom of lights from a distant town, nothing.\r\ni can remember looking at my watch, it was 6:30 pm.\r\nit was then a light in the sky caught my eye.\r\nlight appeared in the windshield on the driver side of my vehicle about 2 inches down from the top of the windshield and it then traversed across to the driver side of my vehicle where it stopped about 2 inches down from the top and 2 inches in from the left.\r\ni paid little attention to the light at first thinking that what i was seeing was just the jet engine of a plane and carried on my way.\r\nit was around 6:45 pm when i glanced at my watch again and then at the object in the sky. it was at this point in time i realize something was not quite right.\r\nknowing the typical speed of commercial jet is between 500 and 600 miles an hour, and the speed of an f-15 fighter, one of the fastest jets in the sky is mach 2.5 or approximately 1400 miles per hour.\r\nusing the slower airspeed of a commercial jet traveling at 600 miles per hour, in the 15 minutes since i first observed the object, the object should now be 150 miles away and at such a distance it would not be visible to me.\r\ni then wondered if the object was a star in the sky but, looking up and around i discovered the sky was overcast and no stars were visible.\r\ni then thought maybe this was a and in anomaly in the windshield of the truck or maybe some strange reflection of one of my dash lights in my glasses.\r\nso, i pulled over, got out of the truck only to discover that with my glasses on or off the light was still visible.\r\ni got back in my truck and carried on my way still wondering what this could be.\r\nmy next idea was maybe this was a helicopter with a search light but very quickly discounted that idea. helicopters with searchlights do flyover towns and cities but not out in the middle of nowhere besides, again there was no loom of a light visible.\r\nmy next idea was maybe this light was fixed to the top of the tower and then up in the distance i spotted three red lights that were on top of the tower..\r\nthe red lights were on my left as was the white light which was some distance ahead.\r\nlooking out across this vast expanse of open land i could clearly make out the silhouette of the ground rising and then leveling off forming what one might call plateau and it was upon this plateau that the tower with the three red lights sat.\r\ni thought i'd figured it out as i passed the towel with the red lights but, the silhouette clearly showed the landmass dropping back down\r\ni then reasoned if the white light was on a tower then such a tower would've been placed on top of the plateau and that the position of the light was such i was sure they don't build towers that high.\r\nit was one hour and twenty minutes when the object moved.\r\nthe object went straight up and i have never seen anything move so fast from a standing start...\r\ni couldn't believe what i had just observed\r\nthis was not a shooting star, or a meteorite and what happened approximately 15 minutes later confirmed that.\r\nat 8:05 pm the object reappeared in the sky some distance ahead of me and travel downwards an approximate 45��� angle and went right back to the position in my windshield (2 inches from the top, 2 inches from the side) were is an been for a little over one hour and a half.\r\nshortly afterwards as i entered a town i lost sight of the object due to the loom of the street lights and i never saw it again.\r\n\r\nthat's my story and it is one i haven't shared with too many people\r\ni did try and tell my lady friend what i had seen when i got back to illinois but, she laughed it off saying \"they were probably looking for you after all, you are an alien\"\r\n\r\nthank you.......... fred chapman","distance":"501 Feet - 1

quietly went out the front door to investigate. when i looked around saw three bright orange orbs enclosed together with a large circle. i saw a silhouette around the orbs. they were spinning counter clock wise. there was a stream of water going to the craft apparently it was sucking up water. being familiar with ufo phenomena i knew it was getting fuel.I then said \"i wonder if theres anyone else around\" thinking aloud. i then hear the voice of a female i looked around and saw a silhouette near a tree. she  message from a nearby zeta or grey to not be alarmed, i told her i that i was not and that i knew of others who had seen beings like her before. she asked me if i knew what her race was called i guessed and told her that i thought she was a grey or a zeta. she nodded and asked me to come closer. i walked closer to about 10feet of her, she walked a few steps closer and i saw what she looked like in the moon light i told her some of the things that i know and she seemed to be surprised about how much i knew and what i knew. she said that she could keep in touch with me and speak to me my mind. i asked her \"how she can you do that\" she replied and told me that my brain was wired differently than others she humans she had observed. she asked me why this was, imtold her i had adhd, then she proceded further by asking questions about my age, gender,(probably because i was wearing a hoodie with the hood up and my face was shadowed) my weight, my height and if i had a quote on quote\"mate\", i then asked her what she ment by mate. \"a female that you are coupled with\". i replied with \"oh you mean a girlfriend, no i do not\". \"interesting, thats unusual for males your age that we have observed\" she said. i know that and its only because i cant find any females that seem appealing to me that aren't already  coupled with another male i told her trying to say it so she would understand what i was saying. i then heard a buzz from the craft. she looked at it and turned back to me and said she must go, but if at any time i needed to contact her to just say her name. i asked her what it was, she told me it was (al-tar-a). she then turned towards the craft and held up a light device and flashed a pattern at the window where is saw two more occupants. she turned back to me said she was glad to have met someone so knowledge able of her kind in such a un visited place. she then told me because i was so knowledgeable that she would not block the memory from my mind. i asked her if her race were a clone race like some of the other greys that i had read about. she replied with no we are not and we do not serve any other species like the others do. then she pushed a button on her wrist device and i felt a pain in the back of my neck and then i blacked out. when i woke up i was in my bed. i looked out the my window to see her where she was standing before waving goodbye to me. i waved back. she then pushed another button on her wrist device and a beam of light shot from the craft directly to her when the beam shut off she was gone. i then said her name, she replied with what is it is something wrong? i said no, i just wanted to know how i was back in my bed. she told me they teleported me and that there should be no side affects from it. i then thanked her and told her i would talk to her soon. she then said goodbye, i replied goodbye. the craft then shot off southwest. i looked at the clock and it was 4:20 in the morning.I talk to altara the last day of every month. i ask her about her race and her home world and she asks me about mine, we have a conversation for about an hour then i goto bed. i have become much more knowledge able thanks to her","distance":"501 Feet - 1

flickering to the southwest over everett, wa perhaps, or over the puget sound. it hung out for about 45 minutes, slightly moving to the left then back to its previous location and then circling around very subtly. i thought it was my vision so i sat in an outdoor chair very still to see if it still moved around, which it did. it looked like a wand with three diamonds flickering in the night sky making beautiful colors of blue, green, and perhaps red erratically but mostly seemed to shimmer a brighter lumen than the brightest night stars.  i got a pair of low power bird binoculars which showed it as a blue orb, but then concluded that it must be the lens of the binoculars that was making that shape as i could see one and then two starlight objects moving within the orb, as it looked different without the binoculars. i tried taking photos but all my videos and photos were black except one. interestingly, everything in the photo is black except the one speck that appears to be the object at a particular point when it was glimmering. not a great photo for an iphone5. i invited my wife outside to see it as well. she remarked on the colors it was emitting.\r\n\r\ni went inside, then, after 20 minutes or so, checked the night sky from a skylight inside my home and saw that it had moved and was now an 75 degree level west-nw, much higher in the sky and i could only see the bottom of it - didn't appear cylindrical anymore and could see the sides, just the flicker at the bottom end. after a few minutes, i got bored and went to bed.","distance":"Over One

colorado blvd overpass going east on hiway 7 towards brighton, co.  the day was sunny and the sky was a beautiful blue with little or no cloud cover.  i observed an airplane that was ascending after taking off from denver international airport.  it was one of the larger planes.  one minute it was ascending and the next a huge bronze colored round saucer, that had no windows, and a solid dome, appeared as if out of nowhere.  one minute it wasn't there and next it was.  it happened quickly but in that time i was witness to a near air collision with the plane.  if the pilot had not had good reflexes i would have been a witness to one of the worst air collisions ever witnessed by anyone. i screamed and pulled my car over. luckily the pilot missed the saucer by descending fast and hard in a downward direction. the saucer immediately  swerved and changed directions upward in a south west direction and was gone in seconds. the airplane ascended and proceeded in north west direction.  when i got home i called dia but there was no information about a near collision.  there was no other traffic on the hiway and i was the sole witness to this event.\r\n\r\nthis event has stayed with me and is as clear as if i had just witnessed it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Path with directional
