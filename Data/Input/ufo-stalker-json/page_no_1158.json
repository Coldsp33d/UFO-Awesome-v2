around july 16, 2013, i was laying back in my pool looking at the stars and watching meteors around 12:30am. i do this a lot as i am an amateur astronomer. i saw a streak of light enter the atmosphere from the east and thought that it would be an awesome meteor display as huge as it was. it left a huge long trail as it slowed to a crawl. please forgive the following description but it is the only thing i can think of to describe it, it looked like a ship dropping out of \"warp\" if you watch the syfy channel. the craft slowed a lot then maintained a level flight path, to the point our aircraft would fall from the sky. it traveled in a easterly direction for a ways then turned to the south west where it continued to travel for a minute or so. it then started to gain altitude and climb until i could no longer see it. the craft looked all white, like it had a glow to it or something but still looked obviously solid, and was a crescent shape. it made no noise that i could hear and didn't leave any trail after initially entering the atmosphere and slowing. the whole sighting lasted about 3 minutes, maybe 4. i've tried to debunk it myself but there aren't any objects that i am aware of that can travel like that and meteors don't deliberately change direction then rise in altitude. i spend a lot of time looking through a celestron c8 telescope so i know exactly what all the planets and moon look like. i was pretty shocked, but i personally feel this object was not ours. of all the times to not have my telescope out with my camera attached, :-/\r\ni was hoping to make a cgi representation of the object and path but i don't know how to do it.

Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I woke up very early that august morning & for some reason i sat up in bed & got up right away,i went straight into the kitchen of my flat in worthing.Looking back i dont know why i got up right away & i didnt even go into the bathroom first as i normally would.I reached for the kettle & went to fill it up at the sink which was right by the window & that was when i saw them,my jaw dropped because right in front of me directly above the rooftops of the houses behind my flat were six craft in two rows of three.They appeared to be extremely low in the sky & only just above the rooftops,i feel that they were very close to me indeed as the houses behind my flat were not very far away from my building.They were oval in shape & white/silvery in colour but what was most striking was the dazzling sparkle of each one,i can only assume that they had a highly polished mirror like finish on whatever they were made of that was sparkling in the bright sunshine.This was a very sunny morning with a virtually cloudless sky,which was unusual because the summer of 2012 was very cloudy & rainy.The two rows of three were seperated diagonally ie one row was above the other but diagonally off to the right & the three craft in each row were so close together that they appeared to be touching eachother.I could hear no sound atall & i plucked up the courage to go out on my balcony to see if there was any noise for sure,i could hear nothing & they were completely motionless just kind of hanging there.I didnt stay out on the balcony for long(i was living on the second floor)i came back in because i felt really uneasy/scared of what i was seeing.I first noticed the craft at 4.55am & i stood watching them for about fourty minutes until 5.35am i felt that i couldnt take my eyes off of them & i could not believe that this was really happening but it was i was wide awake & i even pinched myself several times to make sure that i was awake.I really wished that i had taken photos or woken my sons up to show them but i felt kind of rooted to the spot & i was also afraid that if i went away they might disappear.At 5.35am it suddenly occurred to me that they might be watching me,infact i became convinced of it & i felt suddenly very afraid & decided to go back to bed.This is something that i now really regret because i didnt see them go or anything...When i got up again at about 7.30am they were gone & have no idea now how long they stayed there or how they moved off etc,this i will always regret but i had become overcome with fear in the end & felt convinced that i was being watched.I did not report this incident at the time but i told my daughter & her husband about it also my two other younger sons,i think it rather scared them all.I have wondered & worried about this incident a lot since it happened & have now decided to inform you of it....I know that this did happen,i did see what i saw & i cant explain it.I know a fair bit about aircraft as i was born into a family of aviation enthusiasts & many people on my dads side of the family were in past & are now employed in aviation with de havillands at hatfield & lockheed in the usa as well as the rae at farnborough etc.My dad had been in the raf & was very interested in aeroplanes...I was taken to aerodromes & air displays from a very young age & i know a fair bit about airplane design & aviation & so i feel certain that what i saw were not man made craft,they wouldnt be considered aerodynamic i dont think.I cant believe that no one else in worthing saw what i saw that morning even though it was very early,i just want to know what i saw & what or who it was & what do they want?I feel sure that i was drawn to my kitchen window that morning,thats how it felt to me then & it still does...Looking back i was drawn to the kitchen window & i have a strange feeling that i was meant to see what i saw that morning & that bothers me very much.","distance":"21-100

look at them only to see that these stars were moving.At that point i noticed other star-like lights all moving to the northwest. at first i thought them to be satellites, but figured they could not be as they were flying much too close to each other.Upon looking around i also noticed in the south direction 3 lights lined up in a 45 degree angle all evenly spaced flying as if in unison, with other lights around them flying in the same direction. after a couple of minutes i got my wife to come and look at this to prove i was not seeing things. shecame out in time to confirm what i had seen

(maybe 75 yards from where the car was parked) \r\nwe had both stopped in this spot. so being the jokester i am, i turned off the flashlight for maybe 1 minute at most, it was probably closer to 30-40 seconds. well when i turned around to look behind me, i was encountered by a tall green glowing human like figure. and it was right there in my face. it could not have been standing any more that 6 inches away from me.  i was staring nose to nose with this thing.  i could not distinguish any facial features.  but it had the outline of a human, i could see legs arms and a head. it was glowing so bright it looked like just the outline of a person. no sound no movement just standing there over my shoulder.  my friend who was standing right next to me saw the same exact thing. we were not on anything, we had not been drinking. so in pure terror we took off running as fast as we could down the trail to the car. i don't remember ever looking back to see if it was still there. as we were driving away a felt like a burst of energy go through me. my friend did not feel this too.  i was immediately overcome by the worst headache i have ever had. out of pain i put my hand on my head, to feel that my forehead seemed to be protruding , like a golf ball sized bulge.  my friend could see it at first glance, and drove me directly to the hospital. by the time we arrived there 5 minutes after the incident, the bulge in my head was gone and the headache had subsided. so i decided not to go in to the er due to fear of being locked up in a mental institution.\r\n\r\n this occurred in 2002. just a few days ago i ran into my friend after over a decade later.  he told me he was there the following summer, (summer of 2013)and had witnessed the same thing in almost the same location. to this day i have no idea what we saw. but i have never been so scared in my life.","distance":"20 Feet or

and watched as the sky got darker. the object looked round and seemed to have a bright spot on the lower left side. it continually got dimmer and kept moving at a steady rate across my field of view due to the earths rotation. as time went on it got dimmer probably due to increased atmosphere getting between me and it as the earth rotated. i called a friend in hawaii and said to keep an eye out

thought shooting star. only it looked like a green orb, not off in the sky but pretty close to me, and was not moving fast enough to be a meteor(ite). and was basically falling at a constant speed, not unlike a flare or the end of a large firework. only there was no noise and it gave off no smoke or sparks or any sort of trail. it fell straight down, i'm talking perpindicular, no variation or blowing with the wind, and the light it gave off was a constant orb which never variated and didn't appear to illuminate my surroundings. from my vantage i would have to guesstimate the orb of light was about the size one of the big medicine balls. it fell from what i would guess to be about 400 ft high, and appeared to me to be about 4 streets over, so maybe like 800 ft away. it took about 2.5 seconds from when i looked at it to when it would have landed. it fell behind the treeline and at the time it would have landed, there was no crash or flash or anything. i do not know if it was moving around before i went outside (there have been similar sightings in the same neighborhood), but i'm fairly sure what caught my attention was a flash, so it may have actually somehow formed, or what have you, while i could see it. it was unlike anything i've ever seen and i'm a pretty avid stargazer. could have been a drone, but the light it gave off was eerie and not like an led or
