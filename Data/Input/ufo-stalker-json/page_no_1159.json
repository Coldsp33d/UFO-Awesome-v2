occasions including today @ 1:30.I was told by a ufo reporting center this was a optical artifact...The only problems i have w/this explanation is the movement of the object,the beam stops at the object and the fact it is being photographed in soft x-ray not optical.It appears at times when i update the image sometimes the the sdo eve instrumentation is focused only on this object, this reorientation has occured four times since november,the mission is very stuctured and any adjustment to the satellite is well documented yet these movements do not correlate with the mission timeline.After a couple months of watching this and getting my friends views(i must appear insane)we have all drawn the conclusion the object has mass hence the nonpenetration of x-rays.My initial feeling was that of powerlessness and shock that was soon replaced by awe and conjecture.The objects size is on the order of a large planet being several times larger that of our own.It is stationary, only ascending and descending, not orbiting, this would prove to be extremely power consuming.It is not visible in the visible spectrum only soft x-ray.I understand this is alot to take in and i am probably not the first to question this object but from the standpoint of how x-rays work and a knowledge of advanced physics i am imagining stellar lifting taking place on our star but that is pure

one year to make.I was walking down r.B. av. on my way to the shop about 5 oclock late afternoon, when i noticed everyone , thousands of people all looking up at 3 ufos hovering right above us on the

momentarily to look at the reaction from all the people who were also witnessing them and everyone was just sort of in a daze staring ,many with mouths open and noone talking . so there were three of them quite close to each other about 150 feet apart just hovering the object in the middle of the other two ufos ejected a blue light, similar to a lightening bolt, shooting out from the object about 70 feet,and then it looked like it retracted the light back into the ship. then a second later another bolt of a deep blue light shot out but this time adifferent length. this happened several more times  all with different lengths of light or more like lightening bolts of light. no sound  i stared at them and all the people watching them then, the three just flew so fast away they were gone in

just above the trees and roofs two houses down from mine.  it seemed unusual so i stayed in the truck and watched as it slowly turned and flew over the neighbors houses and also noticed the irregular light blinking pattern which seemed atypical to that of other planes and helicopters.  during this time i searched for my cell phone to take a picture and then it was over my house and i stepped out of the vehicle and realized that there was absolutely no noise or emissions coming from this craft either.  i was able to obtain some kind of video, but by the time i was able to gather myself, the video i captured did not show all of the lights and their distinct pattern.  as the craft flew over, i noticed it was the clear shape of a triangle and was a combination of black as well as a grey, with somewhat of a pattern or what seemed like lines which met in the center of craft out to the corners, and within each of those triangles had lines connecting the edge of the craft to the lines coming from corners to meet in the center.  as mentioned earlier, i did obtain some video, but it unclear of the shape and all three of the lights blinking pattern, but as soon as i got back into the vehicle, it was higher in the sky and it seemed to by flying at a faster rate that before when going over the houses.  i then got back into the vehicle to try and follow the craft.  i was able to for about two or three miles, turned onto an upcoming street, and then it just disappeared and could not find it anywhere, in any direction nearby or off in the distance.  i then went back to the house and kept watching out the window every so often to check if it would happen to be out and nearby again, but that was the last i saw of the craft.","distance":"21-100
