incredible speeds then suddenly stopping and changing complte direction in an instant, the g-forces would crush a numan pilot.\r\nvarious shaped ufos, even the triangle (stealth bomber shape)\r\nthe manouveres are all kinds of different flying acrobatics..Free falling and flipping , cat n mouse games, somne looks like erratic drunk driving even, then accelerating to high speed in an instance, also some footage of chemtrails from ufo's, some nights there are 100's of craft in the night skies, all cloaked and invisible to the naked human eye, and via night vision they are all over the place.\r\none closer encounter was on the ground, an alien pilot triggered the motion detector on the deer camera and stand, and the suprised expression on the aliens face as it peered into the camera at the moment the motion detector triggered leaving a very suprised look on the aliens face, the cameramn was also asleep or blacked out in a deer blind approx 15m away from the deer camera at the time, he says he lost time that morning in the early am hours around 4 am one morning, there are enhanced photos of two 3 ft tall aliens standing next to the deer blind where the cameraman joey was laying inside the blind at the time of the photos and the motion detector being triggered, also enhanced pictures of a smaller flying craft, cloaked or transparent with a ladder exiting from the craft, 3 aliens in one shot, one at the deer camera the other tow at the deer blind where joey was laying unconscious.\r\nall footage is taken in real time in this year 2017. the craft have been filmed nightly over the past two years and are still just as active today as they have been from the copmmencment of filming.","distance":"21-100

  whilst staying at the sequoia hotel eurodisney park i was sitting on the outdoor veranda at about 5:15 pm with my wife and few other guests. i noted that there were quite a few aircraft passing over the hotel heading apx east to west over the hotel, and climbing as they departed the nearby charles de gaul airport. i was able to identify some of the aircraft by their tail and engine colouring's etc.   \r\n   my attention was draw to an unusual object travelling south to north, long and thin and rectangular in shape (apx 10/12 x long as wide) with a blunt leading edge, and very bright white in colour. it appeared solid but did not seem to glow or reflect the sun, with a constant speed apx 3/4 times as fast as the aircraft i had previously been watching (therefore if an aircraft would be travelling at just over 200 mph on its assent after take off, i would estimate its speed at about 500 mph +). it had no wings and made no noise, and the rear of the object seemed to shimmer/flicker or 'flap'/phase quickly as it moved. i could not make out any visual markings, and oddly it appeared 'ribbon' like (ie: no light or shading for its sides to indicate a 3d shape to it) and i had no visual reference to determine how high the object was, however it appeared to be longer than the aircraft i had been previously been watching. \r\n   i drew my wife's attention to it and we both watched it pass from the south, directly overhead heading towards and over the disney park in a northerly direction in a straight trajectory. i stood up and watched it as it heading over toward the park and beyond, until it disappeared into the horizon. the event took apx 50 seconds. \r\n   the sky was clear with no clouds and the sun dipping behind some trees which cast some shade over the veranda to the west.\r\n   i confirmed that my wife had seen this event, and made eye contact with the other guests who also looked puzzled.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

our usual shortcut home, down haas rd., and were having an ordinary conversation when he interrupts me and says “what is that in the sky?!?” i thought it looked like a helicopter from a distance, and automatically thought there may be an accident or construction up ahead. as we got closer to it we knew it couldn’t be a helicopter because there was no sound coming from it. we then thought it was a drone, but as we got even closer, we noticed it wasn’t even hovering, it was just “there”. it was just stationed to the west of someone’s house in an open pasture. as we were passing the object, i was able to get a good look at it from underneath. i saw a massive craft, much larger than any drone i have ever seen! it was about the size of a passenger airplane. it had four massive lights on it. the lights were illuminating a yellow color, casting a small amount of light on the craft, but the craft was still very dull and dark to see. i did not notice anything from the lights, besides the size of the craft. the lights were not shining down in the pasture or in any general direction. we were both freaking out and shocked at what we just saw, but my fiancé told me to hurry up and get a picture. luckily, i had my phone in my lap, picked it up, and snapped a picture of it as quickly as i could. we were traveling about 50-60 mph, so everything happened rather quickly, but the object never moved the entire time it was in our sight. i wanted to turn around to get a better look and picture, but my fiancé suggested we leave it be and get home. we were so amazed, yet confused at what we saw, and talked about it until we went to bed that night. from how my fiancé describes what he saw, and from what i know i saw, we both saw the very same thing! we took the shortcut the next morning around 10am and saw nothing but blue sky. we have not seen anything since. we are still curious, confused, and concerned about what we saw. i have not been able to look at the picture on my computer yet, but i’m anxious to see if i can adjust contrast somehow and maybe get to see the craft better! it was dark so my iphone camera only seemed to pick up the lights from it. if anyone here can do that, i would love to see it again! also, we had a full (i believe a harvest)  moon the night before this encounter! i wonder if that could that have anything to do with it. if you have any info, explanation, pictures, etc. that could help us figure out what this was, please share! thank you!","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

Coig","country":"Argentina","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Estábamos cubriendo una nota sobre turismo en comandante luis piedra buena, argentina, referida al corredor argentino chileno de turismo para la emporada 2017/18 cuando nos enteramos de la publicación de mufon que expone el testimonio de un viajero que avistó una entidad al medio de la ruta en la zona de coy aike.\r\ndecidimos viajar al sur y nos detuvimos en el paraje le marchand que es parada obligada de camioneros y viajeros; allí nos enteramos que el día anterior una familia había tenido un encuentro con lo desconocido en puerto coig, que está en la misma zona de coy aike aunque hacia el lado del mar.\r\nvimos que mufon reprodujo estos casos y entendemos que el evento duró más de 4 horas desde el 19/10 al 20/10 y creemos, sin haber podido confirmarlo que los sucesos se extendieron mas en el tiempo hacia altas horas de la madrugada del día 20/10.\r\nen le marchand hablamos con varias personas, camioneros, locales y viajeros ocasionales, si bien muy parcos y desconfiados nos aportaron los siguientes datos sólidos: 1) la familia que tuvo el encuentro en puerto coig estaba muy asustada; 2) en la madrugada del 20/10 hubo movimientos inusuales en la zona, de vehículos, helicópteros y personal enfundado en trajes de seguridad como los usados habitualmente en investigaciones científicas; 3) los pasos a puerto coig fueron cerrados por personal de seguridad por varias horas pero no se dieron explicaciones del por qué; y 4) varios entrevistados señalaron que debíamos hacer averiguaciones mas al centro del territorio provincial para encontrar la verdad.\r\ncon estas, otras pistas y un croquis detalladamente dibujado por un transportista de cargas local seguimos camino hacia puerto coig por la ruta larga que baja de le marchand siguiendo la rp 57 que sale al sur desde la rn 3.\r\ncon sorpresa en medio del páramo y a mitad de camino nos encontramos a unos 10 km con dos personas que nos recomendaron no avanzar por el estado del camino luego de la torrencial y breve lluvia de la noche anterior, pero no encontramos retenes en el camino como los descriptos por quienes entrevistamos.\r\nsin poder llegar pegamos la vuelta y decidimos seguir la pista del croquis, ésta indicaba que una caravana de vehículos todoterreno de alta gama, color blanco e identificados solo por un símbolo (dibujado en detalle por el chofer transportista) que asemeja un círculo atravesado verticalmente por una línea y de color naranja rojizo.\r\ncomo una anotación, nos interesó el tema pues el lugar, puerto coig (o coyle por su nombre indígena), está mencionado en muchos documentos tanto argentinos como extranjeros referidos al avistamiento de ovnis, actividades sospechosas en la época de la segunda guerra mundial e incluso suposiciones del asentamiento de bases submarinas.\r\nvolvimos sobre nuestros pasos 70 km hacia el norte por la rn 3 hasta el cruce con la rp 9, tomamos esta ruta que va hacia el oeste siguiendo el croquis provisto y al hacer unos 60 km por el camino más solitario y árido nos encontramos con un vehículo blanco con el símbolo antedicho en una de sus puertas a un costado de la ruta.\r\nsu presencia fue como si estuviera en otro contexto, el desierto patagónico gris cortado por este vehículo de alta gama totalmente impecable, desaceleramos pero seguimos la marcha; por el retrovisor vimos cómo nos empezaba a seguir a una buena distancia, cosa que hizo durante unos 20 km.\r\ndecidimos detenernos en un punto abierto, casi panorámico desde donde se ve la meseta y el valle del río santa cruz, mis compañeros y yo éramos cuatro y visitantes de esa región argentina donde en apariencia solo había desierto, viento y más desierto.\r\nel vehículo que nos seguía tardó unos minutos en llegar hasta donde estábamos, se bajaron del mismo dos personas, un hombre y una mujer muy altos, más de 2 m de altura vestidos con impecables trajes de color claro de una tela similar a la de los trajes de gala de noche que tenían un tono tornasolado según los alumbraba el sol.\r\nse presentaron por sus nombres de pila y cuando íbamos a hacer lo propio nos dijeron que ya sabíamos quienes éramos y nos llamaron por nuestros nombres.\r\nesto fue impactante, en nuestro país nos conocen pero del otro lado de la cordillera y en medio de la nada que alguien sepa nuestros nombres, datos personales y qué hacemos para desarrollar el periodismo abierto es muy raro y hasta un poco intimidante.\r\nmuy parcos pero muy educados nos preguntaron si podían ayudarnos en algo, dudamos por un momento y mi productor web fue totalmente sincero, que nos pareció lo más apropiado en la ocasión.\r\nle dijo que buscábamos información de lo ocurrido en la ruta 3 y en puerto coig sobre el avistamiento de entidades y sucesos extraños.\r\nagradecieron nuestra sinceridad y se tomaron un momento para ir a su vehículo, del cual volvieron para decirnos que podían \"colaborar parcialmente\" con nosotros pero que debíamos dejar nuestro vehículo en el lugar y ellos nos llevarían.\r\nasí lo hicimos, nos subimos a su lujoso 4x4, el viaje habrá durado unas 3 horas y tal vez recorriéramos unos 100 km saliendo de la rp 9 hacia el sur por caminos vecinales que a veces desaparecían entre la vegetación baja y otras cruzaban extensos pedregales.\r\nnuestros anfitriones no dijeron una palabra en todo el viaje, solo nos ofrecieron bebidas y algo de comer; algo nos resultó extraño a los cuatro en el viaje, en un determinando momento tuvimos la sensación de que el camino cambiaba de dirección, sentimos desorientación y al mismo tiempo esa sensación en la boca del estómago cuando se desciende rápidamente por una pendiente.\r\nllegamos finalmente a una construcción típica patagónica mimetizada con el paisaje gris fuera de la cual estaban estacionados otros dos vehículos iguales a los que nos transportaba, nos invitaron a descender, estirar las piernas y luego acceder a los sanitarios.\r\ncualquiera de nosotros no habría esperado encontrar en medio de esos páramos baños revestidos con piedra de porcelana y agua fría y caliente, toallas blancas y perfumadas y un ambiente climatizado, pero así fue.\r\nhabía en el lugar cuatro personas más, dos parejas también de alta talla que cuando ingresamos nos saludaron con corrección y luego se marcharon en sus vehículos.\r\nnuestros anfitriones nos indicaron que debíamos esperar unas horas y que las instalaciones estaban a nuestra disposición, nos mostraron la cocina equipada a full donde todo era eléctrico, curioso pues no habíamos visto ni paneles solares, ni molinos eólicos o grupos electrógenos afuera, y nos invitaron a prepararnos una cena a nuestro gusto lo cual hicimos agradecidos.\r\npasaron no menos de cinco horas y ya se estaba atardeciendo cuando por la ventana vimos como aterrizaba a menos de 50 metros un gran helicóptero totalmente blanco y se bajaba de él una sola persona quien ingresó a la casa.\r\nal hacerlo nuestros anfitriones nos extendieron un anotador papel y un par de lápices, entendimos para qué era pues en ese momento nuestros celulares, portátiles y cámaras de fotos perdieron su carga de batería, una sorpresa mas que con sinceridad no esperábamos.\r\neste hombre de unos 60 años se presentó con cada uno de nosotros estrechándonos las manos y nos indicó que teníamos 30 minutos para elaborar cinco preguntas que él contestaría con gusto.\r\nal rato y ya entrada la noche cumplimos y el resultado fue este.\r\npregunta 1: ¿qué ocurrió en puerto coig y en la rn 3 entre el 19 y el 20 de octubre?, respuesta: ocurrieron una serie de anomalías no naturales acompañadas de un evento de duración prolongada con diferentes estadios de actividad e influencia sobre una docena de testigos entre los cuales se encuentran viajeros nocturnos, choferes de transporte y campistas ocasionales; todos han sido contactados y están recibiendo la debida asistencia y asesoramiento.\r\npregunta 2: ¿cayó un ovni en el lugar, y las entidades vistas fueron extraterrestres?, respuesta: ningún artefacto se precipitó a tierra en el lugar, las referencias ya publicadas en algunos sitios son inexactas y de detalles difusos, hay que tener en cuenta que las percepciones humanas en la noche se ven afectadas por la disminución de sus sentidos y en cierta medida influenciadas frente a lo desconocido y sorpresivo.\r\npregunta 3: ¿el helicóptero visto en el lugar y descripto por los testigos es el mismo que se encuentra afuera, y su personal intervino en estos eventos?, respuesta: no es el mismo, y sí nuestro personal participó de los estudios en el terreno de estos eventos, estudios que se siguen desarrollando.\r\npregunta 4: ¿ustedes son una organización de investigación regional, a qué se dedican, y es ud. su titular?, respuesta: no, somos una organización global, nuestros laboratorios ocupan sus recursos en investigación aplicada en diferentes rubros, yo no soy el titular aunque él sí se encuentra en la patagonia.\r\npregunta 5: ¿podemos conocer en persona su centro de operaciones si este existiera, de dónde surgen los recursos para toda su actividad y han podido detectar pruebas de actividad extraterrestre en la patagonia?, respuesta: anualmente se realiza una publicación en la prensa donde se invita a enviar antecedentes personales para quienes quieran conocer los laboratorios, esto se viene haciendo hace mas de cinco años, después de la selección la visita dura dos días; los recursos provienen de aportes personales e individuales de bajo monto que rondan el valor de un litro de nafta aportados por muchos usuarios de nuestros servicios alrededor del mundo; finalmente la actividad no humana en la patagonia y el resto del mundo está mensurada por un sistema de medida y evaluación que no es el que habitualmente usan las personas para desenvolverse en sus ámbitos diariamente sean cuales fueran estos, el uso del término \"extraterrestre\" es paradigmático si lo comparamos con muchos elementos que no son locales como meteoritos, partículas, influencias planetarias y estelares entre otros que inciden sobre nuestro desarrollo y evolución como raza al igual que con el resto de las especies vivas en la tierra; la generalidad discute, especula y rechaza la presencia e influencia de lo no humano inteligente en el planeta, muchas veces lo hace con miedo por aquello de los procesos de extinción pero en el caso no hay peor motor de extinción de especies que el ser humano, tan solo hay que ver la cantidad enorme de especies extintas en el último siglo por su mano; los elementos de prueba en este sentido no son circunstanciales pero hay que tener en cuenta que quienes se dedican a estas búsquedas se adentran en un terreno pantanoso pues en su caso estas inteligencias no humanas aparecen sin la voluntad de querer ser expuestas y si debiéramos el debido respeto a otra inteligencia podríamos comprender porqué muchos ufólogos terminan atrapados en un espiral de egos e invenciones, y otros atraviesas la barrera de la cordura y terminan exponiéndose frente a sus seguidores con largas túnicas hablando sintónicamente como los antiguos profetas de distintas religiones. en el concierto de las posibilidades mientras la humanidad observa y busca, al mismo tiempo estas inteligencias opuestas hacen lo propio pudiendo tal vez influenciar el razonamiento colectivo de formas imperceptibles.\r\nno pudimos agregar nuevas preguntas frente a sus respuestas que nos dejaron aún más dudas en el tintero, pues este caballero se retiró siendo ya casi medianoche.\r\nnos invitaron a pasar la noche con el aviso que no debíamos salir de las instalaciones, nos indicaron nuestro dormitorio e incluso hasta pudimos tomar una ducha que nos permitió pasar una noche tranquila y de descanso.\r\ndespertamos al día siguiente cerca de las siete de la mañana y nuestros anfitriones sin apurarnos nos permitieron higienizarnos y desayunar con tranquilidad como si estuviéramos en nuestra propia casa.\r\nsalimos cerca de las nueve de la mañana rumbo a nuestro vehículo al cual llegamos cerca del mediodía en otro viaje totalmente silencioso, al hacerlo nos encontramos con otro de los 4x4 blancos que aparentemente había pasado la noche guardando nuestro transporte.\r\nse despidieron de nosotros con cortesía, nuestros aparatos seguían con sus baterías descargadas y curiosamente las baterías de respaldo que teníamos en nuestro vehículo también estaban descargadas, no así la batería del mismo.\r\nhicimos el viaje de regreso a chile de un tirón solo cargando combustible y turnándonos para manejar, esta tarde se cayó el servidor de nuestra página por lo que demoraremos varios días en ponerlo nuevamente en línea, pero no queríamos tardar en compartir esto con quienes nos han seguido todos estos años, motivo por el cual elegimos a mufon para hacerlo en la cuenta que es un referente mundial a estos respectos.\r\nnuestra conclusiones de este viaje aún las estamos definiendo, pero la principal en la que todos hemos coincidido es que tenemos mucho que aprender de la realidad que mueve estos temas pues allí afuera hay mucho que no conocemos, y hay personas que perdidas de las cámaras y micrófonos de los medios masivos de comunicación van por sobre quienes están en lo alto e indudablemente saben mucho mas de lo que imaginamos y lo abordan con tecnología y recursos que tal vez ya les han dado las respuestas que muchos de nosotros aún seguimos buscando.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 101-500

newer digital camera.. left work at around 1am.. 45 minute country ride.. very dark in the sky due to not having moonlight these past few nights..But clear skys..No cloud cover..As i always do when i am driving home from work at night im always looking up..This was not my first sighting.. i called my neighbor and ask if she could go outside because i see something and i wanted to know if they could see it also.. when i got home my neighbors were already outside looking up in the sky.. 2 of my neighbors brought out chairs and were watching in their front yard.. nine of us know exactly what we witnessed..But it was not a drone..Or a satellite..Or any military plane i have ever seen. whatever it was was hovering at a certain altitude..Then out of the blue it would drop or descend what looked like 100's of feet in a matter of seconds..Within the last year i have seen numerous sightings and each time i would call or text my neighbor so i would have someone besides me seeing these anomalies.. i live within 10 miles of deleware air national guard and also pse&g nuclear power plant.. the sighting that we witnessed the other night looked like it was hovering directly above pse&g..Gonna attach a few pics of the light in the sky.. zoom in on the pictures.. u can see a dark shadow or siloutte of what appears to be the classic representation of what we were brought up knowing as a spaceship.. we were outside for over an hour watching this object.. all of a sudden the light went out and just disappeared..","distance":"Unknown","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":87533,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.068193799999996,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10232017-0016","longitude":-74.3971012,"occurred":1508553000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

girlfriend by car. it was windy and very cloudy, very strange, never had that weahter after like a storm that does not begin. rain dropped every 30 sec a drop, this for hours at this evening/night. i came by car and saw the 3 lights over the church. first i thougt guys playing with lamps around. then i noticed that the lights came from top down (beam angle of a lamp)!!! i stare at it about 15 min. no other car passed no persons available on the streets it was like estinct. and the weather was so strange like never before like a thunderstorm that does not start, windy and very rare rainy drops during this time. \r\nsuddenly the lights were gone from the position of the church. and i saw them  seconds ago hovering over the clouds again the 3 lights. the special thing was, that the lights rotatet and all 3 lamps rotated as well, like a circle, really strange. and i think at this time no helicopter would start or even was used at the border to france from the gouvernment, military or the border police. i mean 1991 a long time and the techniques were not that high like today. \r\nso i saw the ufo (more the lights, because i could not identify a object behind the clouds but it was grey darked nighting, hoovering away from the church and really slow motion like gliding over the clouds direction to france over the hills direction sw (rodersdorf). the object stopped at the hills againg some more seconds to replay his circle lightning for about 30 seconds, then slow motion like flew away, so i could not see it anymore. i tried to contact friends, which lived there, they just asked me, what did you drink??? well at the end i must say nothing, of course, but it was more than mysterious...\r\nhope you can use that and please do not hesitate contacting me if you have more questions.\r\nbest regards\r\npascal ","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

again, maybe it's just weather balloons (no ufo blasphemy intended!). also looking at one of the pictures with the sun in it, there appears to be a small rectangle or square in the direction of the sun. i know it's not my reflection because it's too far away. what is it?\r\n\r\nbecause we were indoors during this phenomenon, we didn't hear these things make any noise and since we didn't notice any ufos/weather balloons until after we saw them in the pictures, we didn't see them move; we didn't see them with the naked eye, period.\r\n\r\ni haven't been scared, freaked out or had any other

colours in different parts of the object as it continued  to stay still and flash off all of its colours. i was amazed and shocked at the same time and i told my mum as she saw the object as will during the event i was just amazed to see something like this. after the event i didn't think much of it as i went to sleep. i didn't lose of the object it just stayed there for ages i eventually got
