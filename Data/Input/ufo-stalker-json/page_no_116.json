incredible speeds then suddenly stopping and changing complte direction in an instant, the g-forces would crush a numan pilot.\r\nvarious shaped ufos, even the triangle (stealth bomber shape)\r\nthe manouveres are all kinds of different flying acrobatics..Free falling and flipping , cat n mouse games, somne looks like erratic drunk driving even, then accelerating to high speed in an instance, also some footage of chemtrails from ufo's, some nights there are 100's of craft in the night skies, all cloaked and invisible to the naked human eye, and via night vision they are all over the place.\r\none closer encounter was on the ground, an alien pilot triggered the motion detector on the deer camera and stand, and the suprised expression on the aliens face as it peered into the camera at the moment the motion detector triggered leaving a very suprised look on the aliens face, the cameramn was also asleep or blacked out in a deer blind approx 15m away from the deer camera at the time, he says he lost time that morning in the early am hours around 4 am one morning, there are enhanced photos of two 3 ft tall aliens standing next to the deer blind where the cameraman joey was laying inside the blind at the time of the photos and the motion detector being triggered, also enhanced pictures of a smaller flying craft, cloaked or transparent with a ladder exiting from the craft, 3 aliens in one shot, one at the deer camera the other tow at the deer blind where joey was laying unconscious.\r\nall footage is taken in real time in this year 2017. the craft have been filmed nightly over the past two years and are still just as active today as they have been from the copmmencment of filming.","distance":"21-100

  whilst staying at the sequoia hotel eurodisney park i was sitting on the outdoor veranda at about 5:15 pm with my wife and few other guests. i noted that there were quite a few aircraft passing over the hotel heading apx east to west over the hotel, and climbing as they departed the nearby charles de gaul airport. i was able to identify some of the aircraft by their tail and engine colouring's etc.   \r\n   my attention was draw to an unusual object travelling south to north, long and thin and rectangular in shape (apx 10/12 x long as wide) with a blunt leading edge, and very bright white in colour. it appeared solid but did not seem to glow or reflect the sun, with a constant speed apx 3/4 times as fast as the aircraft i had previously been watching (therefore if an aircraft would be travelling at just over 200 mph on its assent after take off, i would estimate its speed at about 500 mph +). it had no wings and made no noise, and the rear of the object seemed to shimmer/flicker or 'flap'/phase quickly as it moved. i could not make out any visual markings, and oddly it appeared 'ribbon' like (ie: no light or shading for its sides to indicate a 3d shape to it) and i had no visual reference to determine how high the object was, however it appeared to be longer than the aircraft i had been previously been watching. \r\n   i drew my wife's attention to it and we both watched it pass from the south, directly overhead heading towards and over the disney park in a northerly direction in a straight trajectory. i stood up and watched it as it heading over toward the park and beyond, until it disappeared into the horizon. the event took apx 50 seconds. \r\n   the sky was clear with no clouds and the sun dipping behind some trees which cast some shade over the veranda to the west.\r\n   i confirmed that my wife had seen this event, and made eye contact with the other guests who also looked puzzled.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

our usual shortcut home, down haas rd., and were having an ordinary conversation when he interrupts me and says ‚Äúwhat is that in the sky?!?‚Äù i thought it looked like a helicopter from a distance, and automatically thought there may be an accident or construction up ahead. as we got closer to it we knew it couldn‚Äôt be a helicopter because there was no sound coming from it. we then thought it was a drone, but as we got even closer, we noticed it wasn‚Äôt even hovering, it was just ‚Äúthere‚Äù. it was just stationed to the west of someone‚Äôs house in an open pasture. as we were passing the object, i was able to get a good look at it from underneath. i saw a massive craft, much larger than any drone i have ever seen! it was about the size of a passenger airplane. it had four massive lights on it. the lights were illuminating a yellow color, casting a small amount of light on the craft, but the craft was still very dull and dark to see. i did not notice anything from the lights, besides the size of the craft. the lights were not shining down in the pasture or in any general direction. we were both freaking out and shocked at what we just saw, but my fianc√© told me to hurry up and get a picture. luckily, i had my phone in my lap, picked it up, and snapped a picture of it as quickly as i could. we were traveling about 50-60 mph, so everything happened rather quickly, but the object never moved the entire time it was in our sight. i wanted to turn around to get a better look and picture, but my fianc√© suggested we leave it be and get home. we were so amazed, yet confused at what we saw, and talked about it until we went to bed that night. from how my fianc√© describes what he saw, and from what i know i saw, we both saw the very same thing! we took the shortcut the next morning around 10am and saw nothing but blue sky. we have not seen anything since. we are still curious, confused, and concerned about what we saw. i have not been able to look at the picture on my computer yet, but i‚Äôm anxious to see if i can adjust contrast somehow and maybe get to see the craft better! it was dark so my iphone camera only seemed to pick up the lights from it. if anyone here can do that, i would love to see it again! also, we had a full (i believe a harvest)  moon the night before this encounter! i wonder if that could that have anything to do with it.

Coig","country":"Argentina","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Est√°bamos cubriendo una nota sobre turismo en comandante luis piedra buena, argentina, referida al corredor argentino chileno de turismo para la emporada 2017/18 cuando nos enteramos de la publicaci√≥n de mufon que expone el testimonio de un viajero que avist√≥ una entidad al medio de la ruta en la zona de coy aike.\r\ndecidimos viajar al sur y nos detuvimos en el paraje le marchand que es parada obligada de camioneros y viajeros; all√≠ nos enteramos que el d√≠a anterior una familia hab√≠a tenido un encuentro con lo desconocido en puerto coig, que est√° en la misma zona de coy aike aunque hacia el lado del mar.\r\nvimos que mufon reprodujo estos casos y entendemos que el evento dur√≥ m√°s de 4 horas desde el 19/10 al 20/10 y creemos, sin haber podido confirmarlo que los sucesos se extendieron mas en el tiempo hacia altas horas de la madrugada del d√≠a 20/10.\r\nen le marchand hablamos con varias personas, camioneros, locales y viajeros ocasionales, si bien muy parcos y desconfiados nos aportaron los siguientes datos s√≥lidos: 1) la familia que tuvo el encuentro en puerto coig estaba muy asustada; 2) en la madrugada del 20/10 hubo movimientos inusuales en la zona, de veh√≠culos, helic√≥pteros y personal enfundado en trajes de seguridad como los usados habitualmente en investigaciones cient√≠ficas; 3) los pasos a puerto coig fueron cerrados por personal de seguridad por varias horas pero no se dieron explicaciones del por qu√©; y 4) varios entrevistados se√±alaron que deb√≠amos hacer averiguaciones mas al centro del territorio provincial para encontrar la verdad.\r\ncon estas, otras pistas y un croquis detalladamente dibujado por un transportista de cargas local seguimos camino hacia puerto coig por la ruta larga que baja de le marchand siguiendo la rp 57 que sale al sur desde la rn 3.\r\ncon sorpresa en medio del p√°ramo y a mitad de camino nos encontramos a unos 10 km con dos personas que nos recomendaron no avanzar por el estado del camino luego de la torrencial y breve lluvia de la noche anterior, pero no encontramos retenes en el camino como los descriptos por quienes entrevistamos.\r\nsin poder llegar pegamos la vuelta y decidimos seguir la pista del croquis, √©sta indicaba que una caravana de veh√≠culos todoterreno de alta gama, color blanco e identificados solo por un s√≠mbolo (dibujado en detalle por el chofer transportista) que asemeja un c√≠rculo atravesado verticalmente por una l√≠nea y de color naranja rojizo.\r\ncomo una anotaci√≥n, nos interes√≥ el tema pues el lugar, puerto coig (o coyle por su nombre ind√≠gena), est√° mencionado en muchos documentos tanto argentinos como extranjeros referidos al avistamiento de ovnis, actividades sospechosas en la √©poca de la segunda guerra mundial e incluso suposiciones del asentamiento de bases submarinas.\r\nvolvimos sobre nuestros pasos 70 km hacia el norte por la rn 3 hasta el cruce con la rp 9, tomamos esta ruta que va hacia el oeste siguiendo el croquis provisto y al hacer unos 60 km por el camino m√°s solitario y √°rido nos encontramos con un veh√≠culo blanco con el s√≠mbolo antedicho en una de sus puertas a un costado de la ruta.\r\nsu presencia fue como si estuviera en otro contexto, el desierto patag√≥nico gris cortado por este veh√≠culo de alta gama totalmente impecable, desaceleramos pero seguimos la marcha; por el retrovisor vimos c√≥mo nos empezaba a seguir a una buena distancia, cosa que hizo durante unos 20 km.\r\ndecidimos detenernos en un punto abierto, casi panor√°mico desde donde se ve la meseta y el valle del r√≠o santa cruz, mis compa√±eros y yo √©ramos cuatro y visitantes de esa regi√≥n argentina donde en apariencia solo hab√≠a desierto, viento y m√°s desierto.\r\nel veh√≠culo que nos segu√≠a tard√≥ unos minutos en llegar hasta donde est√°bamos, se bajaron del mismo dos personas, un hombre y una mujer muy altos, m√°s de 2 m de altura vestidos con impecables trajes de color claro de una tela similar a la de los trajes de gala de noche que ten√≠an un tono tornasolado seg√∫n los alumbraba el sol.\r\nse presentaron por sus nombres de pila y cuando √≠bamos a hacer lo propio nos dijeron que ya sab√≠amos quienes √©ramos y nos llamaron por nuestros nombres.\r\nesto fue impactante, en nuestro pa√≠s nos conocen pero del otro lado de la cordillera y en medio de la nada que alguien sepa nuestros nombres, datos personales y qu√© hacemos para desarrollar el periodismo abierto es muy raro y hasta un poco intimidante.\r\nmuy parcos pero muy educados nos preguntaron si pod√≠an ayudarnos en algo, dudamos por un momento y mi productor web fue totalmente sincero, que nos pareci√≥ lo m√°s apropiado en la ocasi√≥n.\r\nle dijo que busc√°bamos informaci√≥n de lo ocurrido en la ruta 3 y en puerto coig sobre el avistamiento de entidades y sucesos extra√±os.\r\nagradecieron nuestra sinceridad y se tomaron un momento para ir a su veh√≠culo, del cual volvieron para decirnos que pod√≠an \"colaborar parcialmente\" con nosotros pero que deb√≠amos dejar nuestro veh√≠culo en el lugar y ellos nos llevar√≠an.\r\nas√≠ lo hicimos, nos subimos a su lujoso 4x4, el viaje habr√° durado unas 3 horas y tal vez recorri√©ramos unos 100 km saliendo de la rp 9 hacia el sur por caminos vecinales que a veces desaparec√≠an entre la vegetaci√≥n baja y otras cruzaban extensos pedregales.\r\nnuestros anfitriones no dijeron una palabra en todo el viaje, solo nos ofrecieron bebidas y algo de comer; algo nos result√≥ extra√±o a los cuatro en el viaje, en un determinando momento tuvimos la sensaci√≥n de que el camino cambiaba de direcci√≥n, sentimos desorientaci√≥n y al mismo tiempo esa sensaci√≥n en la boca del est√≥mago cuando se desciende r√°pidamente por una pendiente.\r\nllegamos finalmente a una construcci√≥n t√≠pica patag√≥nica mimetizada con el paisaje gris fuera de la cual estaban estacionados otros dos veh√≠culos iguales a los que nos transportaba, nos invitaron a descender, estirar las piernas y luego acceder a los sanitarios.\r\ncualquiera de nosotros no habr√≠a esperado encontrar en medio de esos p√°ramos ba√±os revestidos con piedra de porcelana y agua fr√≠a y caliente, toallas blancas y perfumadas y un ambiente climatizado, pero as√≠ fue.\r\nhab√≠a en el lugar cuatro personas m√°s, dos parejas tambi√©n de alta talla que cuando ingresamos nos saludaron con correcci√≥n y luego se marcharon en sus veh√≠culos.\r\nnuestros anfitriones nos indicaron que deb√≠amos esperar unas horas y que las instalaciones estaban a nuestra disposici√≥n, nos mostraron la cocina equipada a full donde todo era el√©ctrico, curioso pues no hab√≠amos visto ni paneles solares, ni molinos e√≥licos o grupos electr√≥genos afuera, y nos invitaron a prepararnos una cena a nuestro gusto lo cual hicimos agradecidos.\r\npasaron no menos de cinco horas y ya se estaba atardeciendo cuando por la ventana vimos como aterrizaba a menos de 50 metros un gran helic√≥ptero totalmente blanco y se bajaba de √©l una sola persona quien ingres√≥ a la casa.\r\nal hacerlo nuestros anfitriones nos extendieron un anotador papel y un par de l√°pices, entendimos para qu√© era pues en ese momento nuestros celulares, port√°tiles y c√°maras de fotos perdieron su carga de bater√≠a, una sorpresa mas que con sinceridad no esper√°bamos.\r\neste hombre de unos 60 a√±os se present√≥ con cada uno de nosotros estrech√°ndonos las manos y nos indic√≥ que ten√≠amos 30 minutos para elaborar cinco preguntas que √©l contestar√≠a con gusto.\r\nal rato y ya entrada la noche cumplimos y el resultado fue este.\r\npregunta 1: ¬øqu√© ocurri√≥ en puerto coig y en la rn 3 entre el 19 y el 20 de octubre?, respuesta: ocurrieron una serie de anomal√≠as no naturales acompa√±adas de un evento de duraci√≥n prolongada con diferentes estadios de actividad e influencia sobre una docena de testigos entre los cuales se encuentran viajeros nocturnos, choferes de transporte y campistas ocasionales; todos han sido contactados y est√°n recibiendo la debida asistencia y asesoramiento.\r\npregunta 2: ¬øcay√≥ un ovni en el lugar, y las entidades vistas fueron extraterrestres?, respuesta: ning√∫n artefacto se precipit√≥ a tierra en el lugar, las referencias ya publicadas en algunos sitios son inexactas y de detalles difusos, hay que tener en cuenta que las percepciones humanas en la noche se ven afectadas por la disminuci√≥n de sus sentidos y en cierta medida influenciadas frente a lo desconocido y sorpresivo.\r\npregunta 3: ¬øel helic√≥ptero visto en el lugar y descripto por los testigos es el mismo que se encuentra afuera, y su personal intervino en estos eventos?, respuesta: no es el mismo, y s√≠ nuestro personal particip√≥ de los estudios en el terreno de estos eventos, estudios que se siguen desarrollando.\r\npregunta 4: ¬øustedes son una organizaci√≥n de investigaci√≥n regional, a qu√© se dedican, y es ud. su titular?, respuesta: no, somos una organizaci√≥n global, nuestros laboratorios ocupan sus recursos en investigaci√≥n aplicada en diferentes rubros, yo no soy el titular aunque √©l s√≠ se encuentra en la patagonia.\r\npregunta 5: ¬øpodemos conocer en persona su centro de operaciones si este existiera, de d√≥nde surgen los recursos para toda su actividad y han podido detectar pruebas de actividad extraterrestre en la patagonia?, respuesta: anualmente se realiza una publicaci√≥n en la prensa donde se invita a enviar antecedentes personales para quienes quieran conocer los laboratorios, esto se viene haciendo hace mas de cinco a√±os, despu√©s de la selecci√≥n la visita dura dos d√≠as; los recursos provienen de aportes personales e individuales de bajo monto que rondan el valor de un litro de nafta aportados por muchos usuarios de nuestros servicios alrededor del mundo; finalmente la actividad no humana en la patagonia y el resto del mundo est√° mensurada por un sistema de medida y evaluaci√≥n que no es el que habitualmente usan las personas para desenvolverse en sus √°mbitos diariamente sean cuales fueran estos, el uso del t√©rmino \"extraterrestre\" es paradigm√°tico si lo comparamos con muchos elementos que no son locales como meteoritos, part√≠culas, influencias planetarias y estelares entre otros que inciden sobre nuestro desarrollo y evoluci√≥n como raza al igual que con el resto de las especies vivas en la tierra; la generalidad discute, especula y rechaza la presencia e influencia de lo no humano inteligente en el planeta, muchas veces lo hace con miedo por aquello de los procesos de extinci√≥n pero en el caso no hay peor motor de extinci√≥n de especies que el ser humano, tan solo hay que ver la cantidad enorme de especies extintas en el √∫ltimo siglo por su mano; los elementos de prueba en este sentido no son circunstanciales pero hay que tener en cuenta que quienes se dedican a estas b√∫squedas se adentran en un terreno pantanoso pues en su caso estas inteligencias no humanas aparecen sin la voluntad de querer ser expuestas y si debi√©ramos el debido respeto a otra inteligencia podr√≠amos comprender porqu√© muchos uf√≥logos terminan atrapados en un espiral de egos e invenciones, y otros atraviesas la barrera de la cordura y terminan exponi√©ndose frente a sus seguidores con largas t√∫nicas hablando sint√≥nicamente como los antiguos profetas de distintas religiones. en el concierto de las posibilidades mientras la humanidad observa y busca, al mismo tiempo estas inteligencias opuestas hacen lo propio pudiendo tal vez influenciar el razonamiento colectivo de formas imperceptibles.\r\nno pudimos agregar nuevas preguntas frente a sus respuestas que nos dejaron a√∫n m√°s dudas en el tintero, pues este caballero se retir√≥ siendo ya casi medianoche.\r\nnos invitaron a pasar la noche con el aviso que no deb√≠amos salir de las instalaciones, nos indicaron nuestro dormitorio e incluso hasta pudimos tomar una ducha que nos permiti√≥ pasar una noche tranquila y de descanso.\r\ndespertamos al d√≠a siguiente cerca de las siete de la ma√±ana y nuestros anfitriones sin apurarnos nos permitieron higienizarnos y desayunar con tranquilidad como si estuvi√©ramos en nuestra propia casa.\r\nsalimos cerca de las nueve de la ma√±ana rumbo a nuestro veh√≠culo al cual llegamos cerca del mediod√≠a en otro viaje totalmente silencioso, al hacerlo nos encontramos con otro de los 4x4 blancos que aparentemente hab√≠a pasado la noche guardando nuestro transporte.\r\nse despidieron de nosotros con cortes√≠a, nuestros aparatos segu√≠an con sus bater√≠as descargadas y curiosamente las bater√≠as de respaldo que ten√≠amos en nuestro veh√≠culo tambi√©n estaban descargadas, no as√≠ la bater√≠a del mismo.\r\nhicimos el viaje de regreso a chile de un tir√≥n solo cargando combustible y turn√°ndonos para manejar, esta tarde se cay√≥ el servidor de nuestra p√°gina por lo que demoraremos varios d√≠as en ponerlo nuevamente en l√≠nea, pero no quer√≠amos tardar en compartir esto con quienes nos han seguido todos estos a√±os, motivo por el cual elegimos a mufon para hacerlo en la cuenta que es un referente mundial a estos respectos.\r\nnuestra conclusiones de este viaje a√∫n las estamos definiendo, pero la principal en la que todos hemos coincidido es que tenemos mucho que aprender de la realidad que mueve estos temas pues all√≠ afuera hay mucho que no conocemos, y hay personas que perdidas de las c√°maras y micr√≥fonos de los medios masivos de comunicaci√≥n van por sobre quienes est√°n en lo alto e indudablemente saben mucho mas de lo que imaginamos y lo abordan con tecnolog√≠a y recursos que tal vez ya les han dado las respuestas que muchos de nosotros a√∫n seguimos buscando.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 101-500

photographer who was closely related to a friend of my mom, in spite the fact that i do not know who he is. it had been taken around the years 1978-1979 or maybe 1980, on christmas eve, with a camera set to automatically shoot photos of the illuminated gurgel christmas tree.\r\nthe camera was placed at the gurgel factory front yard, alongside washington luis highway. the old car company was located in the city of rio claro, state of sao paulo, brazil. i do not think this installation exists anymore, and i do not live nearby.\r\ni have never shown it to anyone or made it public.\r\nas i watch some tv shows about ufos, i thought it was the time to show it to experts, so i decided to send you a copy of it. i do believe this photo is for real, and do not want to attract any media attention over me.\r\nactually, it would be better if you do not ever mention my name to anybody, because i have my concerns about men in black and this kind of thing.\r\ni digitized it with an epson scanner, 600dpi, 24 bit colour. i hope you enjoy this sample. may it be useful in your research about alien life and alien

newer digital camera.. left work at around 1am.. 45 minute country ride.. very dark in the sky due to not having moonlight these past few nights..But clear skys..No cloud cover..As i always do when i am driving home from work at night im always looking up..This was not my first sighting.. i called my neighbor and ask if she could go outside because i see something and i wanted to know if they could see it also.. when i got home my neighbors were already outside looking up in the sky.. 2 of my neighbors brought out chairs and were watching in their front yard.. nine of us know exactly what we witnessed..But it was not a drone..Or a satellite..Or any military plane i have ever seen. whatever it was was hovering at a certain altitude..Then out of the blue it would drop or descend what looked like 100's of feet in a matter of seconds..Within the last year i have seen numerous sightings and each time i would call or text my neighbor so i would have someone besides me seeing these anomalies.. i live within 10 miles of deleware air national guard and also pse&g nuclear power plant.. the sighting that we witnessed the other night looked like it was hovering directly above pse&g..Gonna attach a few pics of the light in the sky.. zoom in on the pictures.. u can see a dark shadow or siloutte of what appears to be the classic representation of what we were brought up knowing as a spaceship.. we were outside for over an hour watching this object.. all of a sudden the light went out and just disappeared..","distance":"Unknown","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":87533,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.068193799999996,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10232017-0016","longitude":-74.3971012,"occurred":1508553000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

girlfriend by car. it was windy and very cloudy, very strange, never had that weahter after like a storm that does not begin. rain dropped every 30 sec a drop, this for hours at this evening/night. i came by car and saw the 3 lights over the church. first i thougt guys playing with lamps around. then i noticed that the lights came from top down (beam angle of a lamp)!!! i stare at it about 15 min. no other car passed no persons available on the streets it was like estinct. and the weather was so strange like never before like a thunderstorm that does not start, windy and very rare rainy drops during this time. \r\nsuddenly the lights were gone from the position of the church. and i saw them  seconds ago hovering over the clouds again the 3 lights. the special thing was, that the lights rotatet and all 3 lamps rotated as well, like a circle, really strange. and i think at this time no helicopter would start or even was used at the border to france from the gouvernment, military or the border police. i mean 1991 a long time and the techniques were not that high like today. \r\nso i saw the ufo (more the lights, because i could not identify a object behind the clouds but it was grey darked nighting, hoovering away from the church and really slow motion like gliding over the clouds direction to france over the hills direction sw (rodersdorf). the object stopped at the hills againg some more seconds to replay his circle lightning for about 30 seconds, then slow motion like flew away, so i could not see it anymore. i tried to contact friends, which lived there, they just asked me, what did you drink??? well at the end i must say nothing, of course, but it was more than mysterious...\r\nhope you can use that and please do not hesitate contacting me if you have more
