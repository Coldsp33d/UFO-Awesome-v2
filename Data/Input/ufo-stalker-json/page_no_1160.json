1988,( as far as i know).It seems like i have been aboard a 'craft',several times,over the years,with the most recent being approximately 2 weeks ago.I lived in georgia when it began happening.I now live in kentucky and it's still going on.I've only told my\r\npartner about this.These 'dreams' were true,concerning what happened to my (now deceased)husband,and my niece.Since this site can be read by the public-i decline to give specific details.But if someone from your research team contacts me,i'd be more than happy to share information.Also i would be willing to take a lie detector test-just to get to the bottom of this.I am now 67 years old,and finally have the nerve to talk to a professional about this.My family doesn't know what's been happening to me.\r\nit would only be my word.But i can describe the insides of the crafts,that i really do believe  i've been on.It has always been the 'grays',that i've seen.I was working on what appeared to be an assembly line,with them.I don't remember seeing any babies,however,it's possible that i did.I have seen many other humans,with me,in these dreams.I have awaken with my clothes,not put back on like i had them when i went to bed,and i 'saw' a gray standing by my bed,and i felt like i belonged to him,somehow.I used to dread going to bed when this first started,and as a result i started taking medicine to put me to sleep faster,becaude i could tell when they were coming.'i'll explain this to whomever i talk to.But over the years,i,somehow,lost that fear.I've also heard the humming of a craft leaving,after bringing me back.I will end this by asking for your help,to find out the truth.I have noticed that my every day memory,is getting worse.I also almost constantly hear a sound in my right ear,that appears to be a s strange sound wave.( only way that i can describe it)also,i did not keep dates and times,as i was too busy raising my children,taking care of my elder mother,and working  full time job.I just didn't tell anybody else about it.","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":53628,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.20410848399803,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01212014-0010","longitude":-88.16931267253183,"occurred":584776800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kentucky","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1390351064000,"summary":"Did

were all outside talking, pointing and looking at the sky, and one of them had binoculars. so i went out to see what was up. \r\n\r\nit was noon and the sky was absolutely clear of clouds. i observed was a spherical object moving across the sky, coming from the se, headed in a nw direction. it was moving at a steady speed, slower than a satellite, maybe as fast as an airplane that was really high (so i am guessing around 500-800 miles per hour). the object appeared to be higher than most aircraft fly around here, but still definitely within the atmosphere. it was extremely shiny. it glinted a lot as it reflected the bright noon-time sunshine. the light it reflected was white, which gave me the impression that the object was silvery and metallic. it was hard to make out any details other than light, but because it was so evenly reflective, it seemed like it must have had a smooth surface.\r\n\r\nthe object moved at a constant speed across much of the sky, all the way from the se horizon until almost to the nw horizon, in about 5 minutes time, until it stopped and just sat in one spot for about 10 minutes. it still seemed round and very shiny. i thought it was a single light, but my husband and my daughter thought they could sometimes see two \"lights,\" very, very close together. it glinted a lot, like the object or the surface was moving ever so slightly, even while seemingly standing still. there was never a time when there was not light reflecting from the object; it just changed in intensity, like a silver beaded windchime blowing in the breeze (but without any visible change in direction).\r\n\r\nafter a bit, the object started to move again, toward the south, at the same speed as before. it soon went behind my neighbor's trees, from my vantage point, and the object was so far away and it was so bright outside that i couldn't find it again. after a bit, the neighbors lost it too and went back inside. \r\n\r\nduring the sighting, there were no other aircraft in the sky (which is not very common around here, since the spokane airport and fairchild air force base are only about 10 miles away). however, about 10 minutes after the ufo disappeared, i noticed two airplanes in the sky (with an obvious airplane shape to each of them, as opposed to the ufo), and both left distinct contrails. the ufo had left no trails at all, even though it was traveling at jet speeds.\r\n\r\nthe ufo did not give off any sound that was audible to me, but neither did those two airplanes, so it doesn't mean the craft didn't make noise way up high. if i were to guess, i would say this object was larger than a boeing 747, but not more than twice as large.\r\n\r\nafter the sighting, it seemed like there was more airplane traffic than usual, but it may just been because we were looking to the sky more than usual. again, we live close to an airport and a base, so airplanes are common in our skies.\r\n\r\nthe thing that makes this sighting stand out to me is the fact that the object had been moving in a nw direction, stopped and hovered in one spot for several minutes, and then started moving in a s direction.\r\nno airplane i have ever seen can hover like that, nor does it look round. drones have wings or arms for rotors, so they should look more irregular than a sphere, and they shouldn't be as large as this was. no helicopter i have ever seen appears to be silver and round and that large when that high in the air (one would have been a speck). the iss and satellites do not stop and then change direction.\r\n\r\ni have never before seen a ufo and i was so shocked by this sighting that i watched, dumbfounded. i was worried i wouldn't be able to locate it again if i went for my camera, plus i wasn't sure if my camera would capture more than a glinty speck because the object was so far away. after the fact, i regret that i didn't dash quickly for my cell phone and get a video of this so as to share it with friends and family.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

previous day, and my normal sleep routine had been interrupted thanks to the long 4-day weekend.  i was having trouble falling asleep, and found myself tossing and turning for about an hour from 2-3am.  at about 3am, something turned my attention to the window.  i generally have a very view of the sky because my window directly faces a middle school which typically does not pollute too much light, therefore i'm used to seeing all sorts of things cruise by each night that i am readily able to identify.  that being said, i think that it's also important to note that i have always been a ufo skeptic--which is why it was hard for me to believe what i was seeing.  at about 3:05am i saw movement in the corner of my eye.  i got out of bed and gave my full attention to the object.  i shook my head for a second and rubbed my eyes because i thought that the unusual flight path of the object was being caused by having just sat up out of bed or some strange visual adjustment my eyes were doing.  that wasn't the case, as i witnessed the same flight pattern long after i gave my eyes sufficient time to adjust and focus on the object.  my mind could not make sense of the event because the object didn't follow any flight path i've ever witnessed--including meteorites and the like.  the light emitting from it was not static, and seemed to change intensity with the fluid shifts in direction the object was making.  it wasn't erratic, it was an almost fluid-like dance that seemed to obey some sort of intuitive yet beyond comprehension law of nature.  that's the best way to describe it.  it's movement didn't seem to be efficient relative to my basic understanding of physics, yet there was a powerful sense that it in fact was more so.  \r\n\r\nit's movement was this pattern: __|--|__|--|__|--|__ and lasted for about 25 seconds after which the light gradually faded and i lost sight of it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the object was bigger because it was way closer than the i.S.S. i have no doubt of what i saw. it was not an airplane, satellite,  shooting star, etc. i saw it clear as day through those lenses. if

or something falling from the sky on fire. it looked\r\nlike a bright fire bal, but it never diminished and kept moving at a\r\nconstant speed from north to south across the sky. after about 8 to 10\r\nseconds another silent bright orange round object came overhead going in the\r\nexact same direction at the same speed as the first.  after another 8 to 10\r\nseconds a third object just like the others followed behind them. they\r\nhad to be several miles apart, but appeared to be forming a triangle shape\r\nas they moved away from us to the south. after a 10 to 12 second interval a\r\nfourth object followed the same path then another for a total of five\r\nobjects. they were all visible for a good 30 to 40 seconds before they\r\ndisappeared behind a tree line. the entire event

through pflugerville toward fm 685) at 7:20pm. i know the exact time because i was on my way to pick up my daughter. there was a car already stopped in the right turn lane, a silver lexus(?) with two adult women in the front. as soon as i stopped, i noticed in the sky ahead of me, around 45-50 degrees above the horizon to the north east, lights in the sky off in the distance. it only took a second or two to see that they were lights scattered around the edge of a triangular shape whose darker silhouette could be made out against the sky. it appeared to be slowly rotating as if almost standing on end and turning it's flat edge toward me. i rolled down my car window and pointed up at it, turned to the two women in the car next to me and asked if they were seeing it. they indicated they had been watching it for a minute or two already. i watched for a few more seconds, then the light changed and i drove forward and took a right onto 1825. i could still see it in between the buildings of the elementary school for a few seconds then it appeared to vanish. i thought i'd have a better view of it once i turned left onto 685 toward hutto, but there was nothing to be seen.\r\n\r\ni'm having a hard time describing the lights around the edge. they were not like regular bright pinpoint airplane lights, they were more whitish orange, and seemed larger. the object itself appeared to be around a mile away, and very large, however it was kind of hard to judge distance so it could have been more. i did have an impression of immense size however, like something moving pretty slowly, that was very big. i wish i'd had the presence of mind to try to take a photo or ask for the two women's contact numbers, but i did not. the lights on the object were one of the reasons i thought it was far away - they looked very large, and indistinct as though off in the distance, plus i could see the darker shape of whatever they were attached to in-between them.\r\n\r\nthe other reason that i'm pretty sure about what i saw is that i run a lot at night, and can always see planes in a holding pattern or approaching to land near and around where we live, and over toward taylor, hutto and parts of pflugerville. these lights were nothing at all like the plane lights i'm used to seeing - they were lower, moving slower, were larger and completely different in terms of brightness. it was a very bright, clear night.\r\n\r\ni've attached a map showing where my car was stopped, and the direction i was facing when i saw it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

lauderdale florida, and to put some miles on my brand new red corvette  \r\nwhich was equipped with t-tops. a friend came with me , and we took shifts driving, so we could make the trip in 24 hours straight. it was a lot of fun to drive from the connecticut cold winter snow and ice,right into the warm summer-like sunshine of south florida. i had never been there before, and the beaches were so beautiful.\r\n for the trip back home, i drove up to daytona and drove around on the beach just like a dune buggy. i suddenly got stuck on a mound of sand . then some friendly citizens pushed me off the hill of sand, and we all had lots of laughs ! we heard that the apollo 14 manned mission to the moon was lifting off at the kennedy space center that evening. we were heading that way  so we decided it would be really cool to witness this in person ! there was so much traffic going up there, and so many crowds of people when i arrived there. there was a great feeling of anticipation and a greater feeling of excitement when  saturn v launched at around 4;00 pm. with powerful fires blasting from below, the rocket spacecraft lifted up into the sky. the intensity and magnitude of the thrust generated that propelled  the space craft upward, ascending into the heavens as it loomed so high, continuing until it was so far out of sight. it was breathtaking to witness! it was all so very magnificent!\r\n when leaving ksc it was very tough dealing with all of the crowds and all of the traffic. i got a kick out of hearing cousin brucie, a new york radio host, on my radio, but my left leg was aching because of constantly depressing my heavy duty clutch ! the traffic lightened ,and the night got darker, \r\n i headed up north interstate 95 into georgia, traveling through a very heavily wooded area. my co-pilot was sound asleep and there were no other cars on the road. around midnight, as i was driving up the lonely road, i suddenly noticed southwest to my left, the moon appearing full, and bright white,like a toy marble high up in the very dark black night sky. as i drove ahead, i could see the silhouettes of the tall trees, dancing across the moon, which peeked out and flickered from behind the branches. what a beautiful sight!   \r\n the moon kept attracting my attention, and i alternately kept looking to my left at the moon, and then looking forward up the road ahead. as this continued, it seemed as though the moon was keeping up with me as i drove. when i looked again, in the clearings between the trees, the moon looked not only like it was following me, but it appeared to be getting closer and closer, as it descended, brighter and brighter, in stark contrast to the deep black night sky ! each time i faced it, the moon was getting closer and closer, bigger and bigger, now it was still oddly silent  heading straight toward me and the earth ! i thought this was the end of the earth, and we were all going to die ! the moon had grown in size to about what looked like 100 feet across in width and diameter, casting a blinding white light surface. i panicked, overcome with fear, i jammed my right elbow into my friend's arm and i shouted , \"wake up, we're going to die, because the moon is going to smash into the earth right now !\" i have never been so terrified in all my life! i was so overcome with the emotion of fear and dread that i was swerving the car from left to right driving up the road looking left at the site and again forward up the road, but thankfully i maintained control of the car!   \r\n suddenly i heard the sound of a siren from behind my car, and instantly i looked in my rear view mirror, and to my amazement i saw the flashing lights of a police car following behind me !  instinctively, i slowed  down, and pulled over and stopped the car !  immediately i noticed all signs of the giant-sized bright white \"moon\" had totally vanished without a trace. i was shocked at how fast it was gone, and the doom of the impending colossal disaster was over ! i breathed a grateful sigh of relief. in a moment, i wondered what is going to happen now with this cop?\r\n although the overwhelming event seemed done,i was still highly charged with the emotions of fear and astonishment. i suddenly realized that what \r\ni had just experienced was a ufo sighting, and the possibly of alien contact, or worse, an alien abduction! i was very grateful, and still very excited and highly emotional.\r\n  turning left to the rear, i watched as the patrolman approached my car. i lowered my window and he said to me \"let me see your license and registration boy.\" still very excited, i said \"did you see that?\" he said, \"see what?\" i said \"it looked like the moon was going to smash into the earth and we were all going to die!\" he said \"no, i didn't see that. what i saw was you driving side to side down the road. that's why i pulled you over and stopped you.\" i then said \"i can't believe you didn't see it? what do you think it was?\" the police officer said ,\"what you saw was probably a rocket they shot off down south. i'm going to let you go, and just drive carefully.\" i said, \"thank you officer\", and we parted ways.\r\n that was it, the ordeal was totally over. i asked my friend if he saw it? and he said yes, he did see it.I did not want to argue with the police officer, but that was no rocket, as i had seen one fire off that very same day, and it was absolutely not anything alike.\r\n whenever i told anyone about it, they respond in a very uncomfortable way for me and they have a way, of dismissing the incident as never happening, and addressing me in a condescending patronizing manner, condemning my real life experience as nothing, and that i'm wacky , and the whole story is very laughable. i keep it quiet because it's a real drag getting disrespected.\r\ni think people are conditioned by the main stream media and the government propaganda machine to not take this seriously.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
