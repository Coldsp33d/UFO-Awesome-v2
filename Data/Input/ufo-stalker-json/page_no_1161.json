sky moving erratically and asked me what it was.  i then pulled off the highway and parked the car in a parking lot. a bright light was observed and i began to take video. i tried to describe the object that was moving in an unconventional manner thinking it was a model aircraft at first, but changed my mind later, because nobody flies models at night. i have been building and flying model planes and helicopters for over 50 yrs. and never saw anything like this object. \r\n\r\nthe object was very bright, circular, changing brightness as it moved erratically about 30-40 degrees above the horizon. no noise of any type. no position, landing,or strobe lights noticed. the object would hover and move in sharp angular directions. the sky was clear, unrestricted visibility, and no wind. i tried to keep the tree line in the frame for reference.\r\n\r\nthe object descended behind the trees. i decided to drive two blocks to a known grassy field where i have flown models before to see if anyone was there. we arrived approx. 2 minutes later, but no one was in sight, leaving me to think that no models were flying.  i then called the palm sprigs airport control tower and asked them if they had any traffic visually or on approach control radar, and they reported \"negative\" on traffic in the area.\r\n\r\ni hold a commercial flying lic. having over 50 years experience as a pilot flying helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. during this time,i have accumulated over 4000 hrs. flying as a naval aviator for 23yrs.,and was selected as co-pilot of swim i helicopter on the apollo 14 recovery team of allen shepard and crew. i continue flying today as a private pilot observing thousands of helicopters and fixed wing aircraft,and i never seen anything that performed maneuvers as this object performed.\r\n\r\nmy video is some what grainy due to my phone camera, but still gave a good presentation of the object, along with clear audio as i describe the object. my wife can be heard in the background. \r\n\r\ni hesitated to submit this report earlier due to others might make negative comments about this incident, but after trying to figure it out, i feel somebody else in the area saw what we saw and could explain what has happened. \r\n\r\nanyone from your organization can view the video in person from my computer and confirm my credentials, but i do not want to release it to the public at this time for copying. i assure you this is not a fraud.

describe this event.\r\n\r\nplease see jan 17, 2014 event already reported. this is a continuation of that event (24+ hours long). no nighttime viewing in order to 'confirm' that the objects never left, but they were still here yesterday... and more of them. one main object, many secondary objects....\r\n\r\ni had a trip scheduled for jan 18, yet all got pushed back due to what i saw and furthermore captured on 'film'. i promise to offer more details at a later time. but for now, i offer pics of what i captured on jan 17 and jan 18 here right above the ucla/los angeles area. \r\n\r\ni do not know what is going on.... but jan 17 marked the 2nd time that i saw the same thing that i saw back in nov 2013 (reported). same place, same thing. only this time, it was here for 2 days. and this time, i've proof of what i saw, including this time secondary objects that i saw come 'from' the main object.\r\n\r\nunsure what to think, but i'm truly starting to wonder that if something playing around directly above my head (and ucla) does not want to 'interact' with us here on earth, that perhaps we really should be afraid of just what they are. \r\n\r\ni do promise to update fully, but for now i really would like to take my birthday trip (even if 2 days late). so for now.... a brief description above and pics to document all of the last 2 days. \r\n\r\ni've got 10 pics to upload... here's to them actually making it up. i've actually got 'gobbs more' but these are the ones that 'count'.\r\n\r\nfor those of you in the los angeles area, please keep your eyes to the sky towards the ucla area.... look high high up and survey slowly. i would love to hear of others in the area who just might have seen what i have the last 2 days. think reflective, shiny and h-i-g-h up. however with binocs, you'll def notice more that what meets the eye. you must scan high and slow though in order to capture sight of what appears to be a white 'something' that is extremely reflective at times(the sun just bounces off this thing). \r\n\r\nyesterday, day 2 of the same sighting.... 'they' were much higher up than the day before. but day 2 offered even more than day 1 --- for day 2 glimpses thru binocs captured secondary 'things' coming from the 'main object'. what appeared to be 'box kite' objects actually 'came' from the 'main' object. all objects were stay stationary at times, or roll and tumble around, but never without a lack of direction. while the clouds blew east, the objects seen did not blow east. they would wobble at times a short distance, they would disappear and then reappear. and the strangest thing is: what i saw with the naked eye and binoculars appeared to much more that only the pictures would prove. the secondary objects appear to be numerous... very numerous. while i saw a red and white secondary object come from the main object... apparently there were many many more. i swear to god folk, i know what i saw, and something is going on here. \r\n\r\nmight it be something at ucla? \r\nmight it be something associated with sfo's known to use the ocean channel here between the coastline here and catalina?\r\n\r\nwith that said, tally ho for now, i must prep for my postponed trip... with a promise to be back and update fully in the 'comment section\" of this report :)\r\n\r\nps: my 3rd attempt to upload my report mufon!!!!!I mufon --- you need to delay your 'time-out' for those of us with just under your 2mb limit). who wants a scraggly

'describe' their 'moment'.... so yes mufon ---- increase your time-out sessions..... we do not want to start over again with our reports 3-4 times!!!\r\n\r\nthe last 5 photos had to be uploaded into

first thought was a small helicopter to the west of me. it was roughly 300 feet above the bow river and was moving slowly from west to east following the river. i dismissed the idea of it being a helicopter because it appeared like there was air turbulence around it. i then thought it might be a large black garbage bag that had been caught up in a wind vortex. however, because it appeared to change shape i stopped my car and walked over to the river bank which was roughly 100 feet above the river and observed a craft moving slowly towards me. it came right overhead, between 100 - 150 above me moving slowly and moved to to the se of my position gradually gaining altitude and finally stopped in the air and remained in that same position all the while that i observed it. i estimate it stopped at roughly 1500 feet. i had the feeling that it was waiting for me to leave which i finally did about 20 minutes later. it remained stationary in that position during the whole time i was observing it. if i had to estimate the distance from me at that time i would say about 1000 feet. \r\n\r\ni managed to take a picture on my cell phone. as stated it was dead quiet but, the air around it seemed to be boiling and slowly circulating around the craft. it was this movement of air that seemed to make the craft change shape when it was further away from me but, as it came closer i could clearly see it was a flying object. \r\n\r\nour city had a major flood a few weeks earlier and from what i observed, plus the appendages attached to this craft, it appeared the craft was mapping the river and the river valley. it seemed to know that i had spotted it and moved away until i left. \r\n\r\nit was clear to me that whatever was powering this craft, was not a jet or prop driven vehicle and was employing some kind of magnetic or anti-gravity device. \r\n\r\ni transferred the picture to my asus tablet and was able to do some minor editing to zoom in and get a bigger picture to see the shape of the craft. i noticed on one of the editing tools that i think produced a negative effect that there was a light halo around the vehicle which was what i observed. the best way to describe this aura was that it looked like the heat waves coming off a highway in the summer.","distance":"101-500

august. i don't really remember if it was cloudy or clear, but it must have been cloudy, as evidenced by what follows. \r\nas i drove, i noticed a sign that said, morah 16 miles. it may have been 12 miles or 18 miles, but something like that. this prompted me to look at the clock on the dash. it was about 2:15 am. i remember thinking, \"good. i will be there in time to get a few hours' sleep.\" \r\ni noticed that the sky lightened in the distance, and i thought, \"good. rain coming. people won't be able to work in their yards and gardens, which will make them more likely to attend the show.\" from my experience, snow keeps people from a show, while rain increases attendance.\r\na minute or so later the sky lightened (lightning) very near me, and i saw the sphere above me. it was probably about 12 - 20 feet off the ground, which made it very near my windshield - maybe 3-6 feet. it was huge, flat gray, no visible features. it is hard to estimate size, as it was so close to me that i could not tell where it started or ended. it was just a big ball, moving down the highway with me at extremely close range. \r\ni was quite excited. i thought that i would pull over, so i slowed down, applied the brake, and began to pull off onto the shoulder, but then i got scared and pulled back out onto the highway. i went on to the show and arrived there about 4 am, or later, in the morning. i am a bit confused about the exact time, but i am sure of the time of the sighting - 2:15 am. the time when i arrived in morah, approximately 15 miles away, was a lot later than it should have been. \r\nstrangely, i don't remember the thing leaving, or lifting off, or disappearing. i just drove on. a weird coincidence was that a womon who set up directly across from me at the show was a member of nebraska's mufon, and was selling klingon dolls. she talked a lot about ufo's and i am sorry now, that i did not tell her about the sighting. i was afraid that she would think i was making it up.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":53576,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.8809231,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01192014-0010","longitude":-93.2921552,"occurred":681030000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Minnesota","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1390151483000,"summary":"Observed a sphere directly above my vehicle as i drove. it hovered over and moved with me down the highway.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":8207,"locationName":"Mora, Minnesota","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:205727"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Carlsbad","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On january 18, 2014, my son and i took a drive down the coast in carlsbad, california, a few miles from my home. it was around 1:00 am when we pulled over by the beach and were talking and watching the waves. at 1:45 am we saw a large, amber-orange, glowing object. it appeared to come from somewhere right on the beach less than a mile from where we were sitting, getting our attention by its size and brightness. the object ascended in an arc, westward over the ocean, then continued its ascension on a straight path west. at its closest,when we first saw it, it was big enough to cover a penny held out at arm's length. at its furthest, when it was further out over the ocean, it was the size of a pin-head held out at arm's length. it's ascension was extremely smooth and quick. when it reached its highest and furthest point, it hovered momentarily, zig-zagged four times, then stood perfectly still for several seconds. the object then headed back toward the beach, descending in a straight line but at an angle towards the water. it kept the same path and quickly got close enough to the ocean for us to see the orange glow reflecting off of the water, then close enough to have landed on the water. but instead of landing, it kept going, straight into the ocean, then it was gone and we didn't see anything more. the duration of the entire sighting was just over one minute and there was no sound at all. we were amazed and stayed there, watching the spot where it had submerged, seeing if it would come back to the surface or affect the surrounding water in any way, but nothing more happened and we left after fifteen more minutes had elapsed. all we could do was stare at each other and then back at the water. on the way home, we tried to come up with different aerial vehicles that we know of that it could have been, but couldn't think of any. i have lived on or near air bases for most of my life and am quite familiar with all kinds of fighter jets, cargo jets, different types of helicopters, etc. and this was nothing like anything i have ever seen or known of. i am very intrigued and would like to know what it was that we saw and if there are more of them.

dispute about something i cannot recall, outside on the porch. \r\n\r\n2) we observed a very bright light emerge from the top of picuris peak to the southwest of us, and move slowly and soundlessly towards the sangre de cristo mountain range to the southeast of us. we noticed it because it was very bright and was definitely not an aircraft, it looked more like a star. there was nothing that appeared metallic about it, it did not blink, it did not make sound, it just hovered very slowly and emanated a red glow.\r\n\r\n3) we didn't think much about what it was, it was so surreal and out of the ordinary we just stopped arguing completely and watched silently. speculation later as to what it could be led us to numerous possibilities but we were unable to come up with a legitimate

heard. running back outside we saw jets, helicopters, and a very large helicopter (the source of the deafening sound) that flew right over our house in the direction of the orb. the large heli appeared to have two or three blades, maybe more, and almost looked rectangular. i had never seen such an aircraft before or heard a helicopter that loud, and assumed they were pursuing the orb-like object.\r\n\r\ni have yet to identify what it was we saw. if the military was chasing it, as it appeared to be very urgent to them, i can only assume it was a foreign craft or object that was invading us airspace. it could also be something else entirely. this has been one of the most significant events of my life because of how surreal and intense it was, and because we still have no idea what we'd witnessed.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then

could see that it was not a helicopter and had a metallic surface.\r\n\r\n i started to point it out to my daughter and it stopped and seemed to hover and move eastward. my daughter spotted it and said maybe its a balloon, i said \"no balloon moves at the rate of speed this thing was moving at us\". i would say when it was traveling at us it was moving at the speed of a helicopter and about there flight path. then my daughters next words were it looks like a triangle and i said yeah it does! at this point it started to move westbound and climbing in altitude. i pulled out my i-phone and started to take pictures. in the pictures the shinny object is moving west.\r\n\r\n at 1715 the doors open for the karate lesson so i watched it as we walked in and five minutes later i returned alone

Netherlands","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"One evening in 1988 me and my brother were playing outside , i was on a skateboard while having a rope attached to my brother's bike so he could pull me forward. it being a bit late around 7 o clock it was twilight and i coincidently look up and saw a simular to the phoenix boomerang ufo (albeit much smaller in size) flying up only 1 meter above the rooftops of the houses. we were less then 20 yards away from it, in astonishment i shouted my brothers name and said \"look!!!\" , \r\n\r\na boomerang shaped ufo, with lights surrounding its edges that were clearly turned off , the boomerang ufo was pitch black and it floated without making any noise in a straight line over the houses to the east over the city of volendam in the netherlands. me and my brother tried to chase it to no avail, the two of us running back in complete panic back to our parents house we slammed the front door open while screaming \"ufo ufo ufo\" my mother burst out in laughing she said \" yeah right,you saw little green men with antenna's on their head didn't you? \" , begging and pleading it was true what we saw, it's 2014 and she still doesn't believe us, after that time i shortly believed even my own mother was conspiring with the aliens to conceal their existence, luckely my father was showing more compassion by saying \"well it could be that they saw something right?\" \r\n\r\njust days after they broadcasted a ufo documentary on the television, i was terrified from watching that but none of the ufo's looked like the boomerang ufo me and my brother saw, months later i read about a boomerang ufo in a book only to be terrified and confirmed that what we saw was really real. \r\n\r\nmany years later i was astonished by the phoenix light sighting once i saw about it, and the many simularities it had, except the size and the lights, the phoenix lights were gigantic and the lights were turned on, in our case it was in comparison a 10 yard small pitch black boomerang , the only reason i noticed it was because it was much darker then the twilight sky and caused a contrast as such, also unlike the phoenix ufo all of its lights were turned off. i really had the idea it was a sort of spy investigation ufo , i couldn't believe how advanced it was.\r\n \r\nit was noiseless, i mean i first thought it was an american spy plane or something but that didn't make any sense since i live in western europe and americans nor the russians possesed that kind of technology (now that i think back about it, i actually was an avid military airplane picture collector as a kid) all the airplanes i know make noise,\r\n\r\n and in 1988 drone useage wasn't as extensive as it is now, and as far as i know most drones make noise, and it's design was so akward, none of it matched anything i've seen before, so i am better at sleeping then at drawing picture's but i'll try to give a basic picture of what i've seen.\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line
