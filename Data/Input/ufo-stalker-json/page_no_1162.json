ran out of the back door, i landed on the last of three steps so hard that it broke in two and i fell on my knees. it was there long enough for me to snap three photos with a kodak 135. only one of the three developed, the first, which only caught about two-thirds of the object. the other two were blank but for a small white light. as i knelt there, i encountered a bone crushing vibrational

must apologize in advance for any run-on sentences in this report as the comma key on my laptop is broken.\r\n\r\ni was inside the house i lived in at the time in the basement using the computer.  i came upstairs to the kitchen to get a drink at approximately 8:30 pm and while i was doing that i looked out the large kitchen window and noticed the light.  it was significantly brighter than anything i'd seen in the sky before so i went outside to get a better look at it.  i wasn't really sure what to make of it.  it seemed to be pulsating or flickering like a candle flame.  when i came back in i pointed it out to my parents and my sister.  they all thought it was odd and none of them had seen it before either.  however they didn't make anything of it and went back to what they were doing.  i continued observing it for a few minutes more and it seemed to be moving albeit very slowly from left to right in my field of vision. shortly thereafter the light seemed to flicker out.  i then went back downstairs and continued using the computer.  \r\n\r\napproximately one hour later at roughly 9:30 pm i came back upstairs and out of curiosity i looked out the kitchen window again and the light was back in the same spot i had originally seen it.  i remarked to my parents who were nearby that the light was back and my father who is somewhat skeptical of such things said \"maybe it's a construction light of some kind or something\".  i grabbed my digital camera and went back outside to try and get some pictures of it however i wasn't able to keep my hands steady and they were all terribly motion-blurred.  i then struck upon the idea of balancing the camera on the windowsill outside the kitchen and was able to successfully get some photographs.  at this point with the object still in sight i decided to walk to the end of my road (approx. 1km away) to see if i could get a better angle on the light.  while walking down there i lost sight of the light and when i got to the end of the road i was not able to locate it so i returned home.\r\n\r\nroughly an hour later again at 10:30 pm i sighted the object a third time in the same area as the first two sightings.  i took my camera outside again and this time tried to get a video of it.  the batteries in the camera were dying and the camera refused to record for more than 10 seconds or so.  i ran back inside and changed the batteries and was then able to successfully record the light however i was only able to capture it for approximately 90 seconds before it went out/disappeared.  upon coming back in from filming my father said to me \"if it comes back again we'll take the car and go see if we can find it\".  i was awake until about 2 am but i did not see the light again that night.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

passenger side. the sky was clear, when suddenly i saw bright lights south of my location quite high in the sky. i suddenly hollered at my wife too look and she did, and exclaimed wow! i then slowed down, realizing their was no traffic near me, and then it flashed again with 7 bright lights. ihave been on high alert because of incoming meteor showers as a result of comet ison. i then suddenly told my wife their was a meteor shower, then i realized they werent streaking across the sky. they was stationary. i had too go take a whiz anyway so i pulled over, and looked in the direction of the (at this time i realized it was a craft of some sort),craft.Suddenly it lit up again, and stayed lit up for about 4 seconds.Then it went dark, when suddenly a second craft lit up to the side of it alittle lower with the exact same light configuration, then it went dark and the origonal one re-lit for lack of a better term. i was tremendously excited at the time and dont know why. i was terribly saddened because the trip was a sad one over a death in the family, but for some reason i was elated! i am a navy veteran, and was trained too spot objects. this totally freaked me out, and i really wanted to go to it for some strange reason, but i had too get home. my wife is handicapped and was saddened over the death of her brother. i just wanted to get her home, but i really wanted to go towards the lights which out here in rural kansas wouldve meant driving over pasture ground. at first glance of the lights i thought the object was in the upper atmosphere because i was expecting seeing meteors, and i guess my mind was prepared for that. its weird for me though, my first thought at seeing the first object, was that it was high in the atmosphere, but i shouldve realized  it couldnt have been. i waited for the lights to reappear but they didnt. i found myself looking back to the west as i went east repeatedly even though not safe to do so at high speeds. the lights of the object were mostly yellow but the middle lights were whitish. it appeared to have sides where the otherlights were so it had a slight hexagon shape i would guess. btw if this is the same lights ive heard about from my mother shes been seeing them for some time. she lives over 14 miles from them. she told me about them about a week ago, and said they go up about 500 feet or so light up good then go back down. this is a regular occurance according to her. i know pretty dang close where they appear then. i dont know if its a new plane of the government or not but i felt elated at the time of the event, and got depressed afterwords, dont know why.My wife said they was

to rotate side over side in place.  i didn't see an actual craft because it was too dark out at the time but the lights stayed in perfect distance from each other the entire time.  hovering with no directional motion.  the three lights were white and stayed on the entire time.  no pulsating or flashing and no other lights of any color appeared.  i took video of it on my phone that lasted probably about thirty or forty seconds.  when i went to show the video to my wife it was no longer there (not the first time my phone has not saved video or photo though).  it was huge.  it was much, much larger than the buildings under it and was very low.  this was near an airport and there were several planes in view at the time.","distance":"101-500
