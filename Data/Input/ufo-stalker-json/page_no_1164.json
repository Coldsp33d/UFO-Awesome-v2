smoking a cigarette and waiting for his ride.  we simultaneously noticed a large aircraft over the ne horizon, seemingly proceeding sse.  i immediately recognized it as fitting the description of the ufo reports that had been coming out around the area through the preceding hour.  this was a relatively widespread sighting i had seen reported via social media before seeing it, myself.  one may conduct their own twitter search using the keywords \"ufo\" and \"gardendale.\"  even the prominent weather reporter for our local abc affiliate was discussing this event on his public facebook page.  other accounts report more lights (in a fixed line) and noise, but the distance and angle possibly limited our perspective.  my coworker and i witnessed an extremely massive object which featured two visible lights, one on either end.  i would say it was shaped like a blimp or dirigible, except that it was angled like a ramp or a staircase (at least seemingly, from our vantage point).  the lower end was the leading end, and was demarcated by one dull and steady reddish light.  the higher end was trailing, and had its own light which flashed a more vivid red.  the object appeared solid, but it was so distant and dark that it could very well have been cargo suspended between two or more aircraft.  but this is speculation.  the sheer size of the object was staggering, spanning the apparent length of at least 10 small aircraft.  it seemed to be flying around standard cruising speed for a helicopter, over the subdivision of mountain brook on a course that would have taken it toward the cahaba heights area and eventually the vicinity of the us route 280/i-459 interchange.  we could hear no sound, and it soon disappeared behind trees and buildings.  as a footnote, i decided to report this because it seems no one else in my area did.  when i woke up this morning, i checked the last few mufon reports and there were no birmingham submissions; however, i couldn't help but notice the similarities in the georgia reports from last night.  my opinion, for what it may be worth, is that this is some large-scale military exercise, cargo haul or experimental aircraft testing.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

left and along with many aircraft flying all over the sky with their blinking lights i saw a huge formation of lights in a long line.   there were at least 10-15 red lights in a row pulsating but sequentially. they were very dim and almost looked like it would just fade out any minute. when i spotted it i immediately said \"what the hell is that\" and i never say hell. immediately i thought...Wait, maybe it is a string of lights over a production plant (because there were several in the area) that i never had noticed befor. i thought it was part of a tower even though the lights were horizontal. so i thought maybe they were on the top of a very tall fence or strung across something. it looked pretty close and low.  when i went down hill, it went behind the trees and when i popped up it had moved. this continued and i continued watching it move steadily across in front of me and continue to my right. i was travelling due west and it went from south to north so now i knew it was not stationary lights but it moved so slowly it was hard to tell it was not stationary. also now i could see it in relation to planes flying overhead and could tell it was much further out then they were. i kept saying in awe...\"what the heck is that???\" \r\n\r\n \r\ni was driving so i couldnt count the lights and study it for a long time. i had to keep looking at the road so i wouldnt wreck and i didnt want to pull over on a narrow shoulder on this dark road. i noticed that it looked like it was in fog so i thought the sky must be hazy but after i got to where i could no longer see it, i looked up and noticed that all the planes and stars were very bright. the sky was crystal clear with a very bright moon.\r\n\r\nthe reason i lost it is because i came into my town which not only was brightly lit but i couldnt see beyond the tree line now. it was too far to the north and trees were surrounding me.\r\n\r\ni was thinking this thing was either a formation of many crafts or it was one huge craft that had many lights outlining it. it really looked like it was probably a massive craft with lights on it. i got that impression because there was also a light in front of it (not red) and also because the lights stayed in such a perfect straight line. it moved very very slowly and if it was so far away that it looked hazy and slow, then that means it was far bigger than i thought. one of the red lights was not much smaller than the planes in the sky so if you can imagine at least 10-15 red lights in a row that is one big ufo. \r\n\r\neven if i had taken a picture, it wouldn���t have turned out because the lights were so dim, not at all bright like the planes. \r\n\r\ni was really amazed the whole time and was very hyper when i got home telling my husband all about it and emailing my mom. i told my so as soon as he got home. i am still stunned and will keep checking our local area to see if anyone else spotted it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

in a straight line from ssw to nne direction. first two went by one following the other; i jumped out of my hot tub and got my cell phone and took on picture of them with the flash on. (by the way, i do not drink and was fully awake and alert when this took place.) then 5 others equally spaced on the same trajectory passed by with no sound. i tried to take pictures with the flash off and zoomed the samsung galaxy siii camera using my fingers on the screen. i took several, three or four, more pictures but thought i did not get anything until someone else helped me a week later zoom the black pics until the objects appeared. the objects appeared to the naked eye as all having yellow pinwheels from the outside to the center of the bottom of the disc; at the center of the bottom of the disc, were three of four different colored lights including red, blue and green inside a small circle. however, the disc objects appeared in the pictures entirely different than they appeared to the naked eye. the pictures show a circular object with a plasma like coloring with none of the shapes or colors that were vividly seen with the naked eye. one picture appears to catch the edge of one disc or it is a multiple exposure of one disc that appears as a curve. most importantly, these craft had no wings, no running lights like normal aircraft and made no sound. but the trajectory of these brightly colored disc was the same as military transport aircraft flew the day before i saw these objects. these objects appeared to be the same altitude and were twice the size of the multi-engine transport military aircraft and were gaining altitude similar to the military aircraft as they crossed the horizon from ssw to nne. again, these objects clearly were circular, with no wings, or tails and no running lights like all aircraft have. i have not reported this until now because i thought they may be some type of new military disc craft because they were flying in the same flight path of military transport aircraft heading nne. but watching a mufon show about sighting in bucks county, pa, i thought everyone should know these disc objects crossed the central new jersey sky. again, the pictures appear to show plasma like circular objects, while looking at them with the naked eye, they were clearly outlined as circular disc with yellow lights in a pin wheel and small colored lights in the center of the disc. perhaps the roswell craft has been reversed engineered and we now have this new secret capability.","distance":"Over One

i was trying to sleep in the east basement bedroom next to my friends room. he was already asleep. i always had a hard time sleeping away from home. i was laying on the couch under the window and heard a tapping on the glass. i looked through the blinds to see a disk around 4 to 5 inches in diameter that had a bright neon green glow to it. it tapped  on the window 3 or 4 times and flew out into the front yard and flew around for a minute. it was a little erratic and very fast zigging and zagging around the yard. from somewhere nearthe center of the yard it shot straight up and flew over the house. i ran into my friends bedroom where he was still asleep and looked out through his blinds where i watched the object erratically fly around the back yard. this lasted around a minute and it shot straight up into the sky until it was out of view. i remember thinking someone was messing with me at first and i felt a little scared but fascinated. the feeling that someone was messing with me only lasted a second because once i saw how agile and fast this was i knew nothing man made could accomplish what i was seeing! this thing could move 10 feet or more effortlessly in the blink of an eye and stop in mid air on a dime! it was faster than anything i've ever seen! i couldn't hear any sound as i was inside the house and the object was outside  but i'm not sure it made any sound at all. i realize no proof can come from this and i have no proof that this even happened. i also realize how this sounds being as it is coming from a childhood memory from someone that was trying to sleep at the time. i know this happened and i remember it almost like it was yesterday. i just mainly would like to know if anyone has ever had a similar experience? has anything like this ever been reported? i don't want to waste anyone's time with this and i don't expecta response but if anyone has heard of something like this happening and could respond i would love to hear back. thank

the middle of a summer night, the sky was clear. we saw what we thought was a fireball coming from the horizon, but when it hovered over us we knew it wasn't. it glowed from within, made no noise and hovered for 5-10 seconds then droped straight down very fast and took off very fast to the east. my husband was not a believer in ufo's so the whole time it hovered he was saying \" what the hell is that?\" i said a ufo. i was very excited because it confirmed my believe that there are ufo's.I just saw a show on the \"botswort\"(?) incident not sure of spelling. i saw what we saw, so i decided to contact you. what i really would like to know is if others saw it. i'm sorry this is so vague, thought i'd take the chance.","distance":"21-100

smaller than the moon, but larger than any aircraft i've witnessed. the objects would suddenly pop up, and they would sit for minutes or even longer before they moved. i've witnessed this about 5 times now, and i've had witnesses with me 3 of the times. i knew these weren't stars or any type of aircraft i've seen since the first encounter. the sphere like shapes are bright gold/orange like a street light. they hover for minutes at a time, flashing on then suddenly disappearing... then multiple would appear in the same area in perfect formations, often triangular. the flight pattern is what throws me off. they have the ability to hover one way and change direction immediately and shoot off like a rocket, or drop up and down in the sky in a way a plane or helicopter could not. it has been pretty exciting yet nerve racking each occurrence. it's frustrating because nobody takes me seriously. the first time i saw this was when i was living in sonoma and my mom was with me and saw everything i saw. it was late at night when we went for a walk and i pointed the object out that was glowing like a street light. i knew it wasn't a star etc and we were near sonoma high. we were on the outdoor basketball court and i used the back board of the hoop to compare the light in the background to something stationary. i could clearly see it bobbing up and down and my mom wanted to go because she thought i was crazy. after convincing her to stay and watching for at least 10 minutes, it approached us and flew right over us. my mom was so convinced and scarred she hid us under a tree line. shortly after we noticed there were at least 5+ of the same lights scattered throughout the sky. in the last year i've witnessed this same situation but haven't had any fly over to where i could describe the detail of the noiseless craft that was very close above us. each time i've seen these they didn't disappear. i watched as long as the people i was with could bare or it'd be late at night and couldn't stay all night to watch. i don't have a video camera and my iphone wasn't able to pick up the footage in the dark. i hope you guys don't think this is bs i just got done watching your show.
