 but the object that i witnessed didn't make any noise at all, and furthermore as far as i know fire flies don't exist in california.  i had spent nine years of service in the united states air force and for part of that time, i was stationed in the mid-western united states.  sure i saw fire flies all the time out there in the mid-west but never have i seen any fire flies out here in california.  also during my nine years of military service, i have seen and witnessed almost every type  of  air craft i can imagine, but i have never seen an orange colored orb flying over an air force base before or anywhere for that matter.   the orb continued to fly almost due east toward the sierra nevada mountains and i kept my eyes locked on it until i couldn't see it anymore.  it must have flown completely over the mountains.  although the entire incident only lasted for about 30 to 60 seconds, it left an indelible impression on me.  to this day i still don't know what it was, but i would like to know.  is it possible that what i saw was actually the space shuttle still flying in orbit?  after all, the space shuttle did land at edwards air force base on june 22nd, only one day after i had witnessed the orange colored orb passing by my home, and that would certainly coincide with the easterly direction of the orange orb i had witnessed.  but what of the skipping motion of the orange orb passing by--could atmospheric anomalies make the space shuttle appear as if were skipping across water?  and, what of the orange glow, is that what the space shuttle looks like when its traveling above our atmosphere, just an orange glow?   and what of the incredible speed that it appeared to be moving.  it only took it perhaps 30 plus seconds to cross the entire valley area before it reached the mountains, is that the speed of the space shuttle?  and, did the space shuttle just by coincidence happen to be crossing near my home in that part of california at 10:00 pm on june 21st 2007?   if the answer to these questions in no, then i have to consider that what my daughter and i witnessed that night was not of this earth.   \r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":53464,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.807806162690156,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01152014-0013","longitude":-119.6955946820646,"occurred":1182409200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1389830110000,"summary":"It flew high above me extremely fast from west to east like a light-orange glowing fire fly then disappeared over the sierra nevada mountains","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"93612","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2400,"locationName":"Clovis, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:207185"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Mesa","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My husband and i witnessed two gigantic orbs hover for 5 minutes next to each other dim out and come back on several times in the same spot. the color is like nothing i've ever seen flying in the sky also this is my second report. still have not got an answer for what these are. they aren't fireworks or planes/helicopters. they are everywhere and if they they are extraterrestrial they're trying to be seen. also seen them 1/14/14. an amazing sight to see.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":53463,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.4203143,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01152014-0012","longitude":-111.8221824,"occurred":1389672120000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1389826827000,"summary":"These orbs are everywhere. super bright orange and will just dim out. they are huge and stay informations usually i have witnessed just one but seeing them in the formations are truly amazing. what is going on","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Mesa, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:207186"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"DeLand","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My father and myself were on the way to the store and upon getting into the car we looked up and saw two glowing objects coming from the east and headed west.  we called my mother to come and take a look.  the best way to describe the objects is a bubble of fire.  these objects were moving slowly.  my father and i continued in the car to the store and saw 3 more of the same objects coming in the opposite direction.  from the store we saw the 3 objects merge with the other two which formed a v formation.  once the v was formed it appeared to have six of the glowing objects making the v.  we also observed a helicopter hovering and looking in the same direction of the objects. there were also people stopping in their cars to watch.  we watched the objects for about 9 minutes, went into the store and when we returned, they were gone.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"09:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":53461,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.033098,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01152014-0010","longitude":-81.3013479,"occurred":1388550840000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval,   Sphere,   Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1389823329000,"summary":"First saw two bright glowing objects comming from the east to west then saw 3 more comming in opposite direction and they seemed to merge into a v.

and said very excitedly to come with them (her & my stepdad).  my stepfather was in the car waiting with it still running, when i got in they told me they had been on their way home to minerva from canton traveling east on route 30 when they saw two shapes in the sky.  they claimed to have pulled over and had watched them for about 15 minutes and decided to come get me to also witness.  i thought they were playing a joke on me.  we drove approx. 4 miles west on route 30 to the same spot they had pulled over to previously.  it was a small parking spot for a small engine repair & sales business.  at approx 9:15 p.M. while looking north the 2 items were immediately apparent and visible.  i made fun of them as on initial viewing they were just a couple of spotlights, then i thought they were just helicopters (this all in the first 10 seconds). then it was very very evident that what we were watching were not spotlights or helicopters.  the two craft that had been kind of going in a slow synchronized path stopped midair and in an instant shot straight up.  they reappeared more to the east, they were around 45ish degrees in the sky, looked to be around the size of a large helicopter or commuter plane.  they emitted an overall white yet not bright light, similar to a glow. the light was emitted from them.  we watched them for over an hour occupy a large area of the sky, go in and out of clouds, go far off and return closely.  they flew at times in a synchronized pattern at times close and far apart from each other.  they also flew in a seemingly individual style even at times very very far apart and even alone at time when one would go too distant or high for us to see. after about 1:15 minutes around 10:30ish they had been flying very rapidly they stopped, hovered, about 200 or so feet apart they hovered toward each other stopped and then in an instant shot up and were gone.  we stayed for about 45 minutes to see if we could see them again, they never reappeared.  during their time in the sky these glowing spheres made every conceivable type of maneuver.  they flew fast, slow, hovered, made abrupt directional changes.  my mother called the police when we got home, they told her they had received some calls already.  we didn't talk too much with other people about it, but we were all in agreement about what we had seen.
