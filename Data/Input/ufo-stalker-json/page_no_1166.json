(this was before my 11th birthday on august 19.) for some unknown reason, dad decided that we would stop and visit mt. capulin, an extinct volcano in the northeast corner of new mexico. mom stayed in the tourist center while dad and i climbed up the side of the volcano and down into the crater. then we returned to the center. i had a desperate need to go to the bathroom.\r\n\r\nas i was walking through the center, i felt myself stop in mid-step. i felt my mind lift out of my body, and drop straight through the floor. how deep, i cannot imagine. my \"drop\" ended in an arched tunnel deep underground; the tunnel was lighted with orange lights.\r\n\r\nstanding in front of me was a smallish being/entity that i now know to identify as a reptilian. i would estimate its height at somewhere around 4 feet tall. it was wearing a grey-color robe with long sleeves, and a hood. the most i could see of its face was \"intense, oversized dark eyes\". in its left hand (number of fingers unclear,but definitely a thumb) it held something that we today would describe as an ipad or the like. in its right hand it held some kind of stylus.\r\n\r\nit looked straight at me, and with mind-to-mind talk, said (testily), \"what are you doing here? we're not ready for you yet!\"\r\n\r\nthen my mind zoomed back up through the ground and back into my head, where i stood in the tourist center. immediately, i double-timed it to the ladies' room, and \"got relief\" just in time.\r\n\r\nsince then i have lived, wondering when the \"we\" that this alien/entity represented, would be ready for me. i have had other encounters with ufo-related entities, like the mib dressed in a black warrant officer's uniform, driving a yellow mini-cooper, on the military base near keflavik, iceland. he told me, \"go home\" and pointed towards the southwest and north america.\r\n\r\nmaybe the aliens/entities have visited me, and i don't remember it. thanks for letting me post my story.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":53427,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.5244602,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01142014-0008","longitude":-105.8624801,"occurred":-327913200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Mexico","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1389726209000,"summary":"Reptilian tunnels under mt. capulin, new mexico","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":19880,"locationName":"New Mexico","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:207865"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"North hollywood","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My son in law was driving, i was sitting in the back seat. my daughter who was up front noticed first. she said out loud, hey you guys, do you see that?

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I lived with my parents out in the country from waco, texas back in 1970-1971, teaching school.  somewhere around 11:00 p.M. i turned off the television in the living room, and went to my bedroom. my parents had already gone to bed, and were fast asleep. as i stepped into my bedroom i heard our border collie barking outside.  i didnt think much of it because he oftentimes barked at possums or some other little varmints. anyway, i turned out the light and got into bed.  he continued to bark for some time, so finally i decided to peek out the window to see what he was barking at.  we had a fairly long driveway from the house out to the dirt road that ran in front of the house.  much to my surprise i saw two bright lights, like bright headlights on a car, at the end of the driveway.  i thought a vehicle had started to turn in, but stopped.  i kept watching for maybe a couple of minutes trying to see the outline of a car behind the lights, but all i could see were the \"headlights\".  then suddenly the lights went off, and there was no car there.  i just stared in amazement for a minute, and i noticed that the dog quit barking. i let the drapery go, and lay down in my bed.  i lay there thinking about what i had just seen and heard, and trying to figure out just what i did see.  suddenly i heard footsteps coming from that area, through the yard, headed right for my window.  i could hear the crunching of the leaves. it was in the fall of the year. the sound of footsteps came up to my window and stopped.  i could not move at all, and i was extremely frightened.  i felt like if i peeked out the window i would see some creature staring back at me. i wanted to scream, but nothing would come out. the head of my bed was between two windows.  the sound of the footsteps then walked from that window over to the window on my left side, and stopped.  i still could not move.  then i heard the footsteps walk out in the yard until i could no longer hear them.  at that time i thought about jumping out of bed, and running down the hall to my parents room to wake my dad....When suddenly the sound of footsteps started coming toward the house again.  they came back to the second window and stopped.  i was paralyzed again.  then they walked back over to the first window and stopped.  i still could not move.  i couldnt even holler for my dad.  the footsteps then started walking back out toward where i saw the headlights.  everything was quiet, and i found that i could move again.  i leaped out of bed, and ran into my parents room, waking them up.  my dad grabbed his gun and started for the door.  i begged him not to go outside, but he did anyway.  it seemed like forever before he came back.  he told me he saw nothing, and for me to go back to bed.  needless to say, i couldnt sleep that night.  the next day i went out front and called our dog to me.  i closed my eyes so i could hear the way he sounded walking across the leaves.  i also listened to my dad walking across the leaves.  there was a definite difference in the sound of a 4-legged creature and a 2-legged creature walking on fall leaves.  \r\n\r\nif there had been a car behind those lights i would have seen it.  we had a full moon that night.  the yard seemed lit up all the way out to the road and beyond.  this event occurred about 43 years ago, and is still vivid in my mind.  i told some family and friends about it over the years, but they just laughed like i was telling them a funny story.  i remember my fear, and that was no laughing matter.  i never paid any attention to \"ufo\" stories before, and dont remember ever thinking about what the \"grays\" or other space creatures might look like....So i thought it strange that part of my fear, when the sound of footsteps stopped at my window, was the sight of one looking back at me.  that was really frightening.  also, some people have suggested that i might have been dreaming, but dreams are always distorted in some way or another.  my room looked exactly what it looked like...No dream.  i have often wanted to go to a hypnotist and see if there was any thing else that happened to me that night.  but ...I havent.  im telling my story now because i am 63 years old, and dont care any more if i am ridiculed.  i have played and replayed this exact scene over and over and over in my mind all these years.  i havent altered anything.  i just wish i knew what it was that i saw and heard that night.","distance":"101-500

Hill","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving south on i-77, near rock hill, south carolina. we had beautiful, clear skies, and i was enjoying the sight of three or four commercial airliners with impressive contrails, all in different positions in the sky flying southerly courses. it was an interesting sight because they were the only aircraft in the sky, yet given their positions and their vectors (implied by their contrails), i guessed they must be flying toward the same airport. perhaps tampa, or maybe orlando. this spectacular view kept me casually watching the sky.\r\n\r\nat this point, another object became visible, seeming to instantly appear, as an incredibly brilliant point of light in the sky. the object appeared about 30-degrees above the horizon and just east of my southerly course. initially, i thought i was witnessing a star nova, so i paid attention with some excitement, expecting it to disappear just as quickly. however, after only a few seconds the object dimmed/dulled, and took a southwest vector. my next thought was that it must be a military aircraft, and perhaps i noticed it only because it caught the sun angle well-enough to create such extreme reflectance. i reasoned that it must have been flying toward or away from me at first, preventing me from perceiving any change of its lateral position in the sky. there was nothing unbelievable about its change in direction; the object simply started tracking southwest on an ascending vector. i was surprised to see a fighter jet there, and i speculated it must be doing maneuvers. so again, i kept my eye on it. \r\n\r\nits difficult to explain how i lost visual. the objects change in vector, as well as its dimming/changing solar reflectance, were consistent with a fighter jet having high reflectance and then low reflectance as it proceeded through a maneuver. however, even with ultra clear skies, the object seemed to just ..Escape. the entire observation might have been 10 whole seconds, with perhaps three seconds spent in the escape vector.\r\n\r\na handful of details remain inconsistent with the possibility that i witnessed fighter aircraft. 1) i cant imagine how an aircraft could have presented such a reflective surface toward the sun while flying directly toward or away from me (recall at first i believed it was a fixed position in the sky). if enough of the aircrafts body was tilted in a way to have created the sort of reflectance i observed, it would had to have been banking, which would have meant considerable lateral movement, and certainly enough not to mistake it as an object in a fixed position. 2) there were no other military aircraft in the vicinity doing drills, nor did i see others later, which i might have reasoned were the same aircraft. 3) i could not hear anything consistent with a jet aircraft. admittedly, though, i was in the car, and with the windows up, i might not have heard such an aircraft to begin with.\r\n\r\nultimately the most intriguing detail was the manner in which the object went out of view. for a military aircraft at such an altitude, i believe i could have watched it for several more seconds before it was no longer visible to me. but this object seemed to just escape, as if it left the envelope of the atmosphere at a fantastic speed. perhaps not by flying straight up, but by flying away from me at an insane rate of travel, yet along a vector similar enough to my own, so that it did not seem to move very much laterally. \r\n\r\ntrying to understand how it could have been a military fighter aircraft, i googled for video of f-16s at a great distance. the one i found, below, does show movement in the sky similar to what i observed; however, the remarkable reflectance at a seemingly stationary position, the lack of other aircraft doing maneuvers, and the ultra-rapid disappearance after just a few seconds are extraordinarily difficult to explain.\r\n\r\n[link moved to fi section/cms/tg]\r\n\r\nhopefully someone else saw this curious object and will add some comments to help validate or disqualify my observation.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

due north and as i was by the pool i caught two lights traveling across the sky from the north east heading in a southwest direction around 6:20am. they were high up in the sky around 70 degrees off the horizon. the second light was on the same exact path as the first but following at a separation of about 5 seconds. i watched them for about a minute thinking they were satellites but then the second one stopped and reversed course for about 10 seconds and then just stopped. prior to the second one reversing course there was a quick red flash behind him but i couldn't see what did the flash. the second light had reversed course and went back to the area of the red flash and then just became stationary.This would have been at a heading of around 270 the first light continued on for about 10 seconds then it also stopped and became stationary. i watched for a few minutes but nothing else happened. i went in to the house to make sure my son was getting ready for school. after that i went to the west side of my house to take the garbage can out and when i went to go back in my side gate i caught a light moving from the same direction the first one had stopped. this light had now continued on but had changed its course to a east to south east heading and came almost directly overhead of me. as it was moving a quick white flash occurred in front of it about 2 seconds distance of the object. it was almost like a camera flash. i have a small camcorder i keep in my jacket pocket so i flipped it back on and recorded this object moving. when i went to review my video this morning it didn't record anything accept the last few seconds as i lowered it to turn it off. it was like it was never running until the last few seconds but i know it was because my red recording light was going plus i have two seconds of recording on it. very weird and this is a new camera. so nothing i filmed on this object including the white flash which i knew i captured is on my recording. i should have had at least 20 seconds of video not 2 seconds. i can't say for sure this object was the same object as the first one but when i looked at the area that it had stopped at i no longer could see it so i am pretty sure it was the same one. had the second object not stopped and reversed course i would have been sure they were satellites.

hurstville, sydney australia, i looked over to the south eastern part of the sky attracted to a red flashing light approximately 45 degrees above land. there were two of them in fact,one slightly higher and further back from the other. estimated about 8 to 9 kilometers from my position. at first i immediately thought this was not normal. perhaps i might have thought helicopter but as i continued to watch it was obviously not. they just appeared to float even though movement occurred by them, but they never moved more than a kilometer either left or right or backward it seemed. the objects stayed for an amazing twenty minutes. then on the first occasion one moved back at speed then just vanished. i say first occasion because this event took place over the next four nights at exactly the same time,2100hs. the second one appeared for two nights the other nights there was only one. using google maps i worked out quite accurately i believe that this object (lights) were over the water at kurnell off the sydney coast line. the lights flashed, blinked and changed rapidly from red, green, yellow, blue, violet and the most amazing richness of the colours was 'mind blowing' and nothing i have ever witnessed. on one occasion a bright yellowish whitish light flared up and went out quickly leaving me speechless. i grabbed my friend who couldn't explain what she was seeing and thought it was not possible to be anything we could name. at this stage, still not quit convinced, i called my brother to describe what i was seeing and as i did an amazing thing happened. a small round white light appeared and started circling the coloured lights. as if that wasn't enough, that light became two out of one as if by magic and i then witnessed two of these small white lights dancing around the coloured lights (object). conveniently i had binoculars in my car and proceed to use them. the use of them only convinced me more that what i was seeing was not of anything of this world in my opinion. although, the binoculars did not help to define a shape or physical nature (solid) outline. this event did unfortunately stop after four nights and while i did attempt to film this, my camera unfortunately could not pick this up at that distance in low light conditions. each night after twenty or so minutes the lights would descend and just fade. i have researched as much as possible to see if anyone else had reported this and i found only two people. one who was driving on a road close to where i saw this and one who was on a pushbike much closer to the object. neither had provided much detail but had mention the unusual lights. i have found no other explanation for the lights. the nature of their movements and colours and the vanishing acts were something that no 'man made' objects that the general population knows of, could achieve. \r\n","distance":"Over One
