the hub on saturday 1-11-14 around 8:40 pm. it was a crystal clear night with a half moon (which was behind me at the time of the sighting). i looked up as i always do on a beautiful starry night and thought i was seeing a long line of birds or geese. the line was moving when i saw the long line start iluminating a pulsating light and i realized i was not seeing a line of birds but a long cylinder or cigar shaped craft of some sort. the light was coming from inside it appeared. as the light pulsated i could see what i would describe as black hash marks or slashes like this /   /    /    /    / all along the shape but spaced out. the object made absolutely no sound.!!!!! it was very long and blacked out stars as it passed in front of them. it disapeared for about 5 seconds and then started iluminating again only to appear much further away and not nearly as long in length as before. it still had same characteristics as before....Just much smaller.....Then it was gone. the entire event lasted about 20 seconds. i have been around airports and aircraft all of my life.........I have never seen anything like it. it should not have been up in the air based on my knowlege of flight. this was not some atmospheric anomoly. it was not birds or a light reflecting off something. this was a craft of some sort. i can not tell you what it was......I wish i knew. i can only describe what i saw..............You tell me !!!!! i have no pictures and i have no proof other than i told my dispatcher seconds after the sighting. the dispatcher can verify that. i also told a friend when i arrived at home around 11:15 (2315). those are the only 2 i told about this because i do not want to bring attention to myself.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

we entered our subdivision in the southwest side of lubbock we noticed bright lights in the sky.  these lights were multiple colors and very bright.  they almost sparkled!  unlike any kind of aircraft lights we have ever seen.  the lights appeared to be coming from only one sort of flying object and appeared to be moving west.  it almost sparkled like a large star that appeared to be getting close to us.  we stopped in the car to get a good look at it and noticed it appeared to be moving closer to our direction.  the lights were bright and the colors appeared to be flashing randomly and not in a pattern like you would see on a helicopter or commercial flight.  we were just a few blocks from our home when we noticed this in the sky.  my son said that he saw the object move at a very high rate of speed and then appeared to just stop in the sky.  we were so amazed at what we were looking at that we quickly parked in the parking lot at a nearby school to watch the object.  at this time now the objest appeared to move to a se direction and stop in the sky.  we did feel excited at what we were seeing because we had never encountered a flying object that moved and had colors like this.  after watching this for approximately 10 minutes it appeared to travel to a certain point and then appeared to move away from us.  what was so unusual was that approximately at this time there was a plane that flew in front of us traveling north in the distance and we compared the two objects.  the plane had a red flashing light with a pattern  and this object had multiple lights that did not appear to have a set pattern.  also, we used a street light as a reference to the approximate angle of where this craft was at this time and it stayed at almost a perfect angle even when it appeared to be getting father away unlike the plane that was flying north at this time.  it also appeared to stay at one point for some time before appearing smaller, yet at the same angle.  we pulled our phones out and attempted to record what we were seeing, but we were unable to get a clear image of this object.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

was tidying my  mom's kitchen and went to straighten the covers on the 2 chairs by the window. i looked out the window and noticed 6 red lights above the mountain side facing north east. they were large enough that i could make out a shape. they were large orbs. i looked at the time as i thought it was oddly early to see such a sight. it was 10:15pm. the red orbs seemed to be placing themselves in to patterns. i thought it looked like constellation shapes. after i got over my surprise, i ran and got my husband from next door. praying they wouldn't leave before i could get him a window. we ran to our son's bedroom window because the view from there was ideal. we also brought our telescope but decided that it was easier not to use it at that point. we saw at least another 6 to 8 again starting by hovering in the treeline, ascending into the sky at airplane level (maybe slightly closer), then purposely moving into various angles. when a new orb moved up another orb would flicker, move into another angle and then disappear. it was all very methodical and purposeful. no random movements at all. no smoke or light streaks, just simply vanishing. the orbs eventually stopped at 10:49pm. i have tried to look for the lights each night since but have not had the good fortune of seeing them again.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

myrle was up and about taking pictures out for the bedroom window of the fireworks over las vegas which is 16 miles away from our home. we have an unobstructed view of the entire las vegas valley. fyi, we do see the mountains and sky and valley from our bed.\r\n\r\nshe alerted my attention to a glowing orange red ball coming over sloan canyon southwest of us. the direction was from california to utah. the object was flying low at approximately 2000 feet.\r\n\r\ni got up from the bed and we both watched as the phenomena passed by us and then went up into the sky and disappeared. \r\n\r\nas we were trying to figure out what we just saw another one came over the exact same path. this was very close to us, less than a mile and at about 2000 feet altitude. it was round, and i saw the pulsated energy with in and flames evenly over the top as if it were from a gas burner on a stove. they were blue, red, flames that appear to be 5 feet tall spread evenly over the top of the object going up as the object floated peacefully through the valley past our house and then changed direction going up into the sky and disappeared at approximately 8,000 ft. the second one was very close, and as i watched in disbelief, a lot of things went through my head and i do not know what i was looking at, i stared deeply into the object. i followed the entire path. we are 11 days later and i am not ok about what i saw. i have emailed, called and spoken with peter davenport twice, nasa, faa, nellis, george knapp, and henderson executive airport. we did not see lights dancing in the sky; we saw the objects close and with certainty. i am loosing sleep and i want to know what i saw. it is not a possibility that someone does not know what is going on. two many people saw this on new years and it s about time that we are told what this was. i can say with certainly, if i grabbed my medium format camera, we would have pictures that would reveal a ufo. personally, having been given the phone number from nellis and the faa to call peter davenport seems to me that this is a poor excuse to get rid of the people reporting and shunning any responsibility to be accountable as they have to
