(the locals call the area junction.) i noticed some lights low over the road about 200 yards ahead. at first i thought i was seeing some sort of reflection of lights on top of a railroad structure that was in the area. as i got closer i realized the lights were too big and shone too far across the road to be the railroad lights. at this point there are railroad tracks crossing the road and i had slowed down (there is no signal there, just the x crossing signs.) i realized i was seeing something huge hovering over the road about 100 yards ahead. it extended beyond the road to the left and right. i could see it had large lights (i remember them being green, red and blue. the blue one closest to me and then a red one to the left and green one to the right. my memory is a little unclear about this.) the object was triangular. it just sat there over the road and it was huge. it appeared as i approached to be just hanging there. i rolled down my window as i approached and slowed to probably 15 to 20 miles an hour. (maybe slower i did not look at the speedometer.) i began to pass under the object and realized it was triangular at this point. i passed directly under the point of it. it appeared to taper off to the left and right, as if parked with it's center directly over the road. (a little backtracking here to describe the terrain.) after you cross the railroad tracks going south on washington street. the road dips 10 or 12 feet down for maybe 50 yards or so. possibly a 100 yards. then it rises up steeply raising about 20 feet in elevation. there are houses on the left and right of the road at this point.) as i passed under the point of the object i became aware that the bottom of it had a circular window that was at least as wide as the road itself. i could see that the other points of what appeared to be a triangular object were over the railroad tracks on my left (behind the house.) and beyond the house to my right. maybe 300 feet total. (possible bigger.) i was looking directly up into the object as i approached the rise in the road. i could see the top of someones (somethings?) head moving rapidly around the windowed area. i could see the windowed area was surrounded by what i assumed was the back of some sort of panels. i got the impression that whoever was moving around up there was almost panicky. they were rapidly moving from one point to another as if in a great hurry. i only saw the top of their head. it could easily have been a bald person, but i could not tell. as i came over the top of the rise i saw what i can only describe as a child standing in the middle of the road. (directly where the center line would have been.) i slowed even more with my window down. up to this point i had heard no sounds other than the wind rushing past my window and my tires on the road. the muffler on the car was good and motor sounds were fairly quiet. i passed directly next to the person standing in the middle of the road. he appeared to be wearing a skintight blue silken sort of snowsuit. he (she?) had a hood which clung tightly to his head. he turned to look at me as i passed him, and his face was less than a foot from mine. i cannot remember the face other than it appearing as if he was wearing a sort of semi see through mask that hid his normal features. at this point i began to be afraid. (i was probably 19 at the time.) i began to roll up the window and get the hell out of there. here is where most people start giving me funny looks when i describe what happened next. a large car coming the other way. (i swear it was a cadillac with huge tail fins.) whether it was due to the reddish light shining from above or the car itself it looked pink to me. i could not see the driver because of the headlights, but the car was traveling i could hear it's engine roaring as he revved it up to get out of there. i did the same. i looked in the rear view mirror as i left. i did not see anyone in the road. and the car i had seen was down over the hill before i looked. i drove to my sisters house in national mine. when i came in the door babbling my story my brother in law (a marquette county sheriffs deputy at the time.) asked what i was on. i drew on a paper plate what i had seen for my niece who seemed to believe me. but my sister and her house guests (playing cards) completely ignored my story. or thought i was on drugs. the paper plates are long thrown away. my brother in law has since died of cancer. i really haven't discussed this with too many people. i do often wonder what i saw that night. i wish i could find the person coming the other way but am not willing to come out with the story for fear of ridicule. since this time i have spent 5 years in the air force. i have only seen one other unexplained light in the sky since this time, even though i look often. so there it is. if you wish to contact me via email please do so. i would be interested in hearing if anyone else has reported similar things from that time.

event i want to describe here occurred in the first days (on the 3rd or maybe 4th) of august, 1986. i, together with 3 other male individuals from tbilisi, was camping out in the fields outside the mountain village of omalo, tusheti, east georgia. actually, there was another group of campers nearby, unrelated to us, consisting of approximately 10 persons, two females and about 8 males in 2 tents. next morning they said they were from east georgian town of kaspi. it was well after midnight, about 1.40 am, and my friends were already arranging something in our tent, preparing to go to sleep. i was sitting by the campfire when i noticed some orange lights just appear above the horizon in the west. their colour was bright orange, like that of an ordinary incandescent electric lamp as seen from a distance. at first i thought it was the lights of some motor vehicle moving on the mountain slope (it was very dark so i could not tell where the mountains surrounding the valley actually ended and where the sky began). but within seconds it became clear that the objects were in the skies, just rising above the horizon. they actually rose, i mean they were ascending (very rapidly, although) like the moon or stars do. their entire trajectory, while we could observe them, suggested that they were orbiting the earth. i cried something like ���guys, look at this��� or so, my friends came out of the tent and we watched the objects rapidly rising over the horizon. there were four of them, apparently moving on the earth's orbit approximately from west to east, but soon they smoothly changed direction (the course change was about 45 degrees) and began to rapidly move approximately in south-eastern direction. now we could well see that there were four of them, arranged rhombically, or in a sort of diamond formation - one in the front, two above and below, and the fourth in the rear. they seemed to glow intensely, but did not shimmer. each of them appeared to be bigger than planet jupiter or even venus, but, unlike stars or planets seen in the sky, these objects were well-outlined, did not shimmer as already mentioned, and seemed rather to glow intensely with orange colour. they were very different from the satellites (we saw one, a dim light soon lost of of sight, shortly before the event). soon we heard voices and cries of our neighbours from the nearby campsite, apparently shocked and surprised by the sight. it was the cold war era, we still lived in the former soviet union and i thought we could have witnessed the beginning of a nuclear conflict or something like this. the whole event or sighting was very brief and took, in my evaluation, no more than two or three minutes, or maybe less. no sound or noise was heard. i thought of my photographic camera in my rucksack, but realized that the objects would be gone before i could fetch it, besides, it was unlikely that the camera could produce any discernible image. very soon, the four objects in a diamond formation began to rapidly descend (or appeared to do so) in the direction of the local village of diklo several kilometers away (which we had visited earlier that day) and mt. diklosmta on the border of chechnya (russian federation), and soon disappeared beyond the horizon. in the last moments of the sighting, they appeared to descend vertically, like the setting sun or moon does, what makes me think they were circling our planet on a near-earth orbit. i was relieved to see no explosions, as i had a subconscious fear that it could have been some ballistic missiles. next morning our neighbours broke their camp and moved out. in a brief conversation as they passed by, they said they were also afraid this could have been the start of some sort of a nuclear conflict (it was back in the 1986, you know). we were sure we had witnessed something very unusual and even extraordinary. however, we have not reported the event to any official authorities and have not even discussed the possibility thereof, as we could see no point in doing so. we had no proofs and the sighting itself was too weird for anybody to believe in it. we almost never discussed the incident since then either. i rarely talk about this to anybody. only my wife and son know about my experience. this is actually the first time i officially report the sighting. i was rather skeptical about alleged ufo sightings before this happened to myself, but since then i am sure, the phenomenon does exist. of course, i do not know whether the objects were man-made or extraterrestrial. their extraordinary velocity however makes it very unlikely that they could be man-made. i am also sure that these objects were some kind of apparatus or craft guided by intellectual beings (i mean, it was not a natural phenomenon like atmospheric disturbance or falling meteorite), as far as they circled the earth in a fixed order, following a single course.  i have no wish to prove anything to anybody but i saw what i saw, we all saw this and sooner or later, i am sure, there will be no doubt that such phenomenon really exists. i only wonder, if the beings who apparently directed the objects, are from the outer space, why they are here and what their objectives or intentions are. i hope that my account will give you some additional information, which you may find useful in your investigations. please be free to contact me for any additional information if necessary, preferably via e-mail.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path

lights appear in the air about a mile distant and a little off to my left, at about 2,000 feet altitude, and for a fraction of a second i thought that they were the landing lights of an airliner that was turning towards me. but landing lights are white, not orange, and the lights then multiplied themselves, forming a random-pattern cluster of lights of different sizes. there were six or seven lights in the cluster. i was slowing for the intersection, when another orange light appeared at about the same distance and altitude, straight ahead, which would have been east of the cluster. after about a second, another identical light appeared to the east of the solitary one, and then two more appeared at evenly spaced time-and-distance intervals continuing east(about 1 second apart) making four in a row that were abreast. i estimate that the array (including the cluster) was about a mile wide. none of the lights moved. the total time of the events was about 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nwhen the fourth light in the row appeared, i had a kind of a 'yee-haw - shades of phoenix!'

cloudless sky. it was an upright shining cloud-like craft i think but with straight well defined edges in what i've read people describe as a cigar shape. it was standing still for a few minutes after i first saw it, not sure what it was doing prior to that, and then it was moving off into the distance in a northerly direction or rather a slightly northwesterly actually. i was at first wondering what the heck a single cloud could be doing in that sky but it was asgain with no fuzzy edges and was so straight up and down the edges and on top and bottom in those small lines too (cigar shaped standning upright) it  was dusk at the time i saw it and it, the cigar shaped cloudlike thing, was glowing white light in a sky only just beginning to get dark. my dad's spirit told me it was an eti craft again, just one unlike the other i'd seen in the past, that one a large disk i could see which was in that case not behind a cloudlike exterior. that was in ireland in the village of kilcrohane over the commonage of a farm on a low mountain in the townland of rhea/reagh.I have had two other experiences but they weren't with craft but rather with visitations by eti. i guess i will now post them here on this site some other time. once was in ireland in january of 2013 and once was in my bedroom in southampton in 2008ish, i don't recall exactly when.","distance":"101-500

thought a lot than looked up and realized it was coming closer in a odd manner i had never seen before so i started my truck turned the towards the road it was on the other side of and watched it come over the road across from my house and me slightly to the right in idle. i cut the engine to see if i could hear anything thinking it was a drone and realized little to no noise was being made and it seemed wobbly i than turned my truck in its direction trying to catch it in my high beams *only like 50 ft in the air... when i done so the object cut its amber light and gained altitude towards the east at a pretty high rate of speed i followed in my truck attempting to see a shape and was left at the time i had hit roughly 70 mph noticing one small blinking light was flashing on the back quickly disappearing in the distance. this is the second time to encounter something of this nature in the same area the first being 1 or 2 years ago. the flight path was nearly the same coming in. i thought it may be a drone but the size climb rate speed and the fact i was in a very rural area on the edge where two counties meet made me second guess b/c the object disappeared completely when it was crossing into the other county making me think to rule out a \"sheriff\" due to being out of their jurisdiction and the fact that i doubt our county has a device that could reach speeds and

brief call concluded, i wondered whether or not i should have mentioned another sighting i had several decades before. here is the brief accounting of that sighting, although the accuracy of the details has faded a bit with time, some aspects remain quite strong.\r\n\r\nit was a late summer night in new york city, from 1979 to the early 1980s. i was in my late 20's, and hanging out with a friend on his soho apartment rooftop on sullivan street and prince street several blocks from my thompson and west 3rd street home. it was probably well after midnight to 1:30 in the morning, and we were enjoying the comfortable summer night air and skygazing from reclining metal and web lawn chairs. the night sky in new york is brighter than most because of building illumination, but many stars were visible. (i know there were many visible stars in the sky because it made it that much harder for me to direct my friend's attention to what i later saw). i recall marvelling at the sheer number of stars and at some point remarking offhandedly to my friend, \"wouldn't it be neat if we could see a ufo?\" within 20 minutes of that silly remark, i shouted \"look!\" and extended my right arm towards the stars tracing a formation of white light dots racing across the sky from west to east. i probably didn't notice them among the stars until they were 20 to 35 degrees above the western horizon travelling at great speed in a straight line overhead from west to east. from the second i saw them and shouted \"look!\" and my friend responded but couldn't see where i was pointing among the stars. he shouted \"what?\" and i shouted back \"ufos!\" and quickly started counting them. this was hard to do as there were anywhere from 5 to 7 of them and they were moving very fast, in the same direction, although their relative distance from one another shifted rather like birds migrating, some moving closer to one another, then farther apart, some shifting forward, crossing over, others moving back. this made it hard to determine the exact number. before i could complete the count overhead with my skytracing arm of one, two, three, four, five...(and verbalize six and seven) they were past my range of vision behind my head and to the east. i recall ruling out planes or birds because they were white only and moved fast enough to have created a sonic boom but were silent. i don't think they were either brighter nor dimmer than any of the other stars or my friend would likely have quickly spotted what i was seeing and distinguished them from the stars. the only difference was that the were moving, and the way and speed in which they were moving.\r\n\r\ni realize that the lack of more specific details makes this report worth very little, but decided to file it anyway.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

12pm i have witnessed some strange very bright amber colored lights rising up above the snohomish valley. these are unlike any normal aircraft i have ever seen. sometimes they rise by themselves, slowly. sometimes they rise up in pairs, and recently i witnessed 3 of them rising up in a arc formation. but they were all very, very close to one another. not something normal aircraft would do. generally they rise up and seem to hover for a minute or two then slowly start heading in a south direction, this is when the bright amber light dims and red and green lights begin to randomly flash like airplanes wingtip lights but both flashing lights are visible along the side of the craft. no noise is ever heard because they are about 5 miles away. i have a vantage point from the top of the valley. i have seen these so regularly lately and i have never seen anything like them, that i decided i wanted to know what these where and drove down into the snohomish valley and tried to get a closer look. this just ended up leaving me more confused. i followed two of these weird acting craft and noticed they seemed to act almost like honey bee's pollinating flowers. they would fly over a residential area, then hover and the amber light would come back on. they would spend several minutes in that same location then the amber light would dim and the green and red flashing lights would turn back on and it would move on a few miles, then stop and hover over some more houses. both the craft i witnessed doing this seemed to stick together the whole time and were never more than a mile or so apart. i was never able to get to more than a mile or so away from these craft, before they would stop hovering and move on. i witnessed this activity for over 30 minutes before i decided to head back home since i wasn't getting any closer to finding out what these where. i reported to local media, but they didn't seem interested.\r\nthis past monday while traveling southbound on i405 near woodenville. i witnessed something similar. this time i witnessed one of the brightest white lights in the sky i have ever seen, just hovering maybe a mile away from the freeway. this thing was blinding to look at and i know all the drivers around me witnissed this also because it was so bright. i saw one person pointing. then the bright white light dimmed and it moved maybe another mile to the opposite side of the freeway and this time 4 extremely bright lights lit up across the side of it. these lights were so bright you had to squint your eyes just to see the road ahead and not be blinded. eventually they dimmed again and fly off slowly to the south.\r\nboth times, the craft hovered and flew maybe only 500 feet above the ground. no noise was ever heard. and the best way i can describe their flight characteristic was like a bee flying from flower to flower. i wasn't going to file a report till this latest incident happened on 405. it was unreal at the time and hasn't left my mind since.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then
