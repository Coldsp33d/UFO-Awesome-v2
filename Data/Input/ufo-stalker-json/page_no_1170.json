noticed three bright objects about the size and brightness of planets (or the iss) in the night sky ��� blue-white in color, twinkling. we have lived at this address for seven years, and have had our hot tub almost as long, and have spent many hours looking up at the night sky here ��� we know what we���re looking at in the sky here.\r\n\r\nat first i thought it was an airplane, as i only glimpsed them through branches of a tree on our property. we live on a flight path to sfo, so we get periodic commercial aviation traffic overhead ��� near enough to distinguish each wing, and the lights on them. this was entirely different. two of the lights were moving rapidly in together, with a third one behind them. distance between them was approximately 3-4full moons.\r\n\r\nthey were heading south, toward the edge of the trees on our property, by leaning over the south edge of our hot tub we could see them emerge from behind the trees. as they did, they joined up with another constellation of 7-10 similar objects that appeared to be stationary, at 280deg w. these objects were oriented in a backwards capital letter ���l��� pattern, with approximately 3 objects oriented horizontally, sloping upward to the south, and a vertical line of 3-4 more going up. they occupied a about 3 full moon���s worth of sky vertically, and maybe 2 horizontally. they appeared to me to be quite uniform in size and color, and were twinkling (or perhaps flashing rapidly). \r\n\r\nat first i thought i was looking at an unusually bright (and severely compacted) version of the constellation orion ��� that was the only thing i could think of that looks even remotely like this. \r\n\r\nas my wife and i watched and tried to figure out what we were seeing, the group of objects slowly began to change shape and appeared to move toward the south, where they eventually dimmed ��� probably fading into the clouds. they still persisted dimly for some time ��� maybe another minute or two. we debated whether to go inside and grab a cell phone to take a picture, but this would not have been feasible in the low light conditions.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path then

green light 5 minutes ago. i assume it was over the far end of fullerton near imperial hwy possibly on the boarder of yorba linda. i was lying in my bed watching a shinobi longplay on my computer when out of the corner of my eye i saw the brightest strangest blue green lighted object speeding east to west. it had a blinking red light which i know planes and helicopters have but the way this thing flew was like nothing ive ever seen before! kind of like a wave like pattern but extremely fast for the distance it covered! and blue green light! too quiet to be a helicopter for sure! (i have seen and heard a helicopter at that distance before and this thing was not a helicopter) and and! there was another regular plane flying in from north east with a white light making a very high speed dive at the blue green lighted object. it seemed to me that the blue green lighted object saw the white lighted plane and stopped its forward motion, dead stopped, and sort of hovered for a few seconds and then descended rapidly toward the ground(at that point i could no longer see the red blinking light). during the green blue objects descent the white lighted plane was pulling out of its dive and by the time the white lighted plane was fully horizontal the green blue object had fully disappeared from my view. i could still see the white lighted plane though and it just continued on its way west but it had slowed down substantially. (i should note here that the only reason i assume the white lighted object was just a normal plane was because it didn't match the green blue objects sudden change in direction and the fact that it had to noticeably pull out of its dive pattern.) spectacular event! i hope i find out what this was. this happened at appx. 10:00pm, monday january 6, 2014! what a spectacular site. any information would be greatly appreciated.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,  Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":53287,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.8902159,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01072014-0001","longitude":-117.8033925,"occurred":1389074400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like,   Other,   Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1389088372000,"summary":"Bright blue green lighted object spotted over yorba linda area jan 6, 2014","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Yorba Linda, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:209971"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Myrtle Beach","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At approximately 9:30 pm eastern standard time on january 6, 2013, i was at my uncles house when i noticed 2 red lights off in the distance. as it gets closer to us i realize that the 2 lights belonged to 1 craft based on how close the lights were to each other. the craft was heading towards a bright white object to the northeast of where i was. the craft that i was able to observe had 2 red synchronized lights, appeared to be under intelligent control, and was the size of at least 2 or 3 commercial airline planes in length. i couldnt determine the width of the object. the craft made no sound and it was a cigar or oblong shape. the sighting only lasted a few minutes. after the sighting, i saw what i assumed was a military aircraft flying in the same direction as the craft i saw.

my vehicles moonroof. it takes about 12 seconds for the plane to go from the top cloud to bottom cloud. planes speed approx. 500/700 mph. then out of the right side of the video comes what looks like a daytime satellite (which i've never seen or filmed before) going e. to w. i've seen scores of night satellites none have been or seemed as bright as this day time ufo. this ufo also looks closer to the earth then the plane did and was traveling at 3x the speed of the plane. it only takes seconds for it to go the distance the plane did? it also looks like it's arching downward a bit in the video.

she would not or could not even respond to my question of \"what the hell is that?\" after she didn't respond, i asked her again, still no response, she didn't move or blink, she just stared at it like we all did, but then i touched her, and it was like she unfroze instantly, like i turned her back on or something,  it made me jump back, she immediately said \"i'm going in the house\" like nothing was happening!  she touched the only other girl there, and they both went inside. neither of the girls seemed scared at all, they were more calm like they knew that thing or something, they seemed unaffected at all and when we brought it up to them that night, they said they went inside and didn't want to watch it. i know they seen it! their calm demeanor scared me, i'm telling you, something about their calmness seemed chilling. when a bunch of men are scared by something we believe to be a ufo and the woman aren't afraid at all, just calm, i just don't know how to understand that. back to the orange cigar, it stayed with us for 5 minutes, directly above the house in front of us, about ten feet to fifteen feet above the house. at this point it had travelled less then a quarter of a mile from west to east along the tree line when it stopped above the house in front of us for five minutes. it seems to be turning, spinning, but it always remained as a cigar shape. it color would get slightly darker and slightly brighter but always remained a sun glowing orange. i tried to convince myself it was anything but ufo, but as it started to ascend north west, it did so very slowly,for at least 10-15 minutes. it was such an amount of time, that i could now just barely see the light. then in a split second, it took off in a raging speed, it left and amazing bright trail and took off in a direction that was more east then north east. it shot off fast as or faster then a shooting star. when it did this, at the end of the trail, it appeared to disintegrated as well but i imagine it was hitting a speed that i couldn't see it anymore, or maybe it hitting an even faster speed. either way it was gone and the trail disappeared as fast as the, light did. i'm still friends with many of the people who were there. none of us have ever spoken to each other about it since that night. \r\n ","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":53279,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.25829984264222,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01062014-0014","longitude":-80.34480256003077,"occurred":857800800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1389074604000,"summary":"March 7th 1997 large group of 18-21 year old witness orange cigar ufo in port st lucie florida","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"34984","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":6149,"locationName":"Port St. Lucie, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:209979"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Montreal","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was in bed about to fall asleep, i was watching the rain out my window when i saw a bright greenish blue light that light up the entire sky in a flash. and then it did it again about 2 minutes later and again another few minutes later. it wasn't a clear night so i could only see it through the clouds, but it wasn't heat lightning as it's winter and it wasn't regular lightning as it was a florescent greenish blue color. thought maybe it was a meteor, but haven't seen anything in the news about one.
