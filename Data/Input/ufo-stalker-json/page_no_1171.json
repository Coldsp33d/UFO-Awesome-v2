(all i saw were the orange lights and i could not understand what an airplane would be doing so close to the ground and in that particular location)  as i continued to look over at it for the next few seconds i noticed it was not actually making a turn. it seemed to be just floating forward. as i was watching it, the light on the left swung in an upward arc about 80 degrees and stopped in a position directly above the other orb. it stopped in that position and both orbs continued to slowly float in my direction. the distances between the two orbs did not seem to change as the one positioned itself above the other. from the time the left orb started to arc upwards until it was directly above the other orb was about 3-4 seconds. my best guess at the distance between them at this point would be between 75 and 150 feet. i can be rather dense at times but i realized that this was quite odd, and since i was in indiana for the holidays visiting family i had kept my camera with me at all times. by then i could sort of judge the speed, and realized i would have time to pull off at the next opportunity and film this thing. it took me perhaps 15-30 seconds to pull into the next parking lot, get my camera out of the case, find the stupid button in the dark, and start filming. i did not look at them during this time. by then it was nearly above me and just to the south east. i filmed both orbs for just over 1 minute as they floated along. i zoomed in and out several times to get some perspective on them. as you can see on the film they were perfectly round and pulsed like they were made of fire. what you cannot see in the film, but which i can see when i play it on my camera is in the last few seconds of the film the building i am next to comes into few and you can get a great idea of the speed they are traveling. in the film it looks like they both just blink out, but in reality they disappear one at a time as they pass over the building and out of sight. i then jump back in the truck to zoom around to the other side of the building and continue filming. this took about 15 ��� 20 seconds. when i got to where i should have seen them they were not there. the sky seemed to be clear at that point and i thought i could faintly see an orange glow far out into the sky. (i could see a multitude of stars also) this is my story. at times i think perhaps someone had launched some sort of x-mas eve light tradition thing, but i will let you look at it and you can tell me. my regret is that you cannot see the rooftop of the building come into view, as the objects pass over it. i could see it coming and purposely positioned the camera so the rooftop would be in view as long as possible. it is very easy to see on my camera. i still have the picture card with the original film. i can send my film with skydrive if necc. when filming i used the following: \r\ncannon powershot xs 150 is \r\n12x optical zoom\r\n14.1 megapixels\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,  Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":53253,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.1093736,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01052014-0013","longitude":-85.0992816,"occurred":1387944060000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1388963367000,"summary":"Two orange pulsating, floating orbs. 1 minute of film.

thought was a plane on fire. i said to my wife \"what the heck is that\".   i have a big panoramic view from our house from denver skyline area to near colorado springs and mountains to the west.  very clear skies.  i went outside to look and saw an orange object headed towards me my wife stayed inside.  appeared fairly low like you might see a light airplane fly.  seemed to have a radiating glowing appearance that i originally mistook for flames.  as it came closer i began to realize it was unlike anything i had ever seen.  it did not appear to have lights per say but rather the entire object gave off light and seemed to have bars of light radiate out sort of like a cartoonish star. my wife described them as bright but they were actually dull orange.  the radiatiing light is what gives the appearance of being bright but it was not bright. it is hard to describe.  it was sort of like seeing an oncoming light in fog where it radiates out in the water vapor.   it appeared roughly round.  no details visible but in recollection it at times looked sort of like a clear jelly fish with orange features.  what i mean by that is that i do remember being able to see features in a way.  not like a window or a plane like feature but rather uneven features within the light.  again hard to describe.  the object appeared to be going about the speed of a jet airplane.  it traveled from the mountains to the west passing over my house in a minute or less.  i ran out the east side of the house and it continued over the horizon.  totally silent.  my heart was racing it was an exciting experience.  i went back in the house and declared \"that was a ufo\"  we sat there talking about it and collecting ourselves etcetera.  about ten minutes went by and we saw another one again through the window.  this time we both raced outside.  the one turned out to be two.  fairly far apart traveling in parallel formation again coming from due west headed east.  i grabbed my phone and took a picture.  hard to do because it was dark and not much time.  again these two objects went directly over head.  looked exactly like the first.  i can say with absolute certainty that these were not known aircraft.  the most striking and odd features where the appearance and the complete silence.  these went directly over head and continued on at fairly low altitude and it was absolutely silent.  again our view offers a big sky line and soon after this event it seemed that there were planes everywhere.  some coming from denver area some from colorado springs.  some headed in roughly same direction as objects some did not.  after this we wanted to see more and i had the sense that we would but we did not.  i looked up the local news expecting it to be a big story as it was that blatant and clear but saw nothing on the news.  the only things i could find was by typing in ufo news and there were similiar sightings in california a couple days before.  i wasn't going to post anything but the complete lack of reports is disturbing  so here it is.  enclosed is a photo i took with my note phone.  i took the photo on zoom and then zoomed in some more post photo to make more clear.  im sure my hand was moving but thats what i have.  i would have to say it is the most amazing thing i have seen.  so far the few people i have shared it with have been insultingly dismissive about it.   it is interesting to be on the other side and see how people react.  one final opinion of mine.  it seemed given the altitude, time of day,  size, and emitted light that what ever else is the case, they wanted to be seen.  that is why i am submitting this.

were returning home to williamstown by car late one night from adelaide cit,y past gawler town, on a country road that we knew very well by sight when my mother and i both noticed a stationary blob of bright shining coloured lights/large object about the size of a combine harvester in a wheatfield in a slight depression. we know that field very well as we pass it four times a week or so.\r\nit was very unusual for any human activity to be occuring in that field at night. we assumed it could have been a farmer with his harvest machinery and their lights on. we arrived home a lot later than we anticipated and were a little confused with the time. i was six years old and not prone to seeing hallucinations.\r\n\r\nonly in 2009 when i read a small publication from the gawler library about the multiple gawler ufo sightings did i consider that what we witnessed/saw could have been what was witnessed by many others over the years from 1950's to present day with a particular 'flap' in late 1969. what was described in the local newspaper matched what we saw very convincingly and the location was consistent with other aerial sightings earlier that same evening within five miles radius of gawler town hall. i have never told anyone this story since that evening except since the 2009 publication.\r\nthe ufo phenomenon has been seen hovering over the town hall and local farmland over many decades. i think that em static ball energy from a local geological faultline may be an explanation, as many sightings have so often been.\r\n\r\nthe edinbugh raaf base is nearby and they have a radar facility that existed in 1969. they will have reports dating back to that decade/time.\r\n\r\nthe object was in a place where no objects should have been at that time of night and it was generating enough warm-coloured lights to light up a football field. it was not a ball, but more of a multi-facetted shape. there must have been over six lights illuminating the field. we did not see the actual object obscured by its light display as we drove past at about 40miles per hour on a remote quiet country road devoid of many big trees just at that point somewhere near sandy creek backroad, not the main road.","distance":"101-500

the night of january 4th, 2013, at approximately 10:50pm, i was brushing my teeth upstairs before going to bed and i walked into my son���s room (he was at his mother���s) to close his curtains. i looked out over our backyard and saw nothing at all. \r\n\r\ni then walked over to our spare bedroom, which is on the same side of the house and faces the same direction. when i went to close the blinds, i observed 6 large, bright red-orange lights hovering and circling around each other about 45 degrees above the horizon. when viewed in the sky, the objects were much bigger and brighter than stars but perhaps not as big as an aspirin tablet. \r\n\r\ni quickly called my wife to come over and we watched the objects circle each other in a large, vertical looping pattern for approximately three or four minutes. they then started to move off one-by-one in a north easterly direction. it took only seconds for each large, bright object to fade away and disappear in the sky.\r\n\r\ni opened the window so that we could see and hear better, and while there was some noise from our neighbour���s house (the kind of humming a furnace makes) the objects themselves did not make any noise; there was no sound of engines or mechanics or anything else whatsoever. \r\n\r\nbefore they were gone, two more lights rose up (one by one) from behind the houses and trees along the sightline of the horizon. they again slowly circled each other in the same vertical looping pattern before flying off, this time one to the northeast like the others and the other towards the northwest. again, the large objects rapidly faded away and disappeared from sight.\r\n\r\ni looked at the clock in my son���s bedroom and noted that it said 11:01pm. my wife and i talked about things for a few minutes, neither of us doubting what we had seen. i went downstairs to call my son and tell him, and when i did i noted that the time on the kitchen clock was 10:55. i realized that the clock in my son���s room was wrong (which my wife later verified). \r\n\r\ni timed the walk from window to window at approximately 10-12 seconds, so the crafts rose into the air in that time and were visible for approximately 3-4 minutes (we estimate). we also estimate that the objects were about three kilometers away, perhaps over the ottawa river. \r\n\r\nwhile i have read a great deal about ufos and such, i have never seen one before (that i know of) and am not given to histrionics. indeed, i am a long time employee of the federal government and have not one but two master���s degrees. not that that necessarily matters, but i like to think it adds some credibility to my account. i have never seen nor reported anything like this before but would have no difficulty talking about it to authorities or investigators.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

#6 zushi exit and the #7 yokosuka exit, i noted an unusual alternating red and white side by side light pattern in the distance.  this lights were within the approach pattern lane for airplanes heading for the haneda airport and i noted other passenger airliners within the airspace around the lights in question.  what struck me as unusual was that these lights were brighter and appeared either slightly larger or closer than the other aircraft in the area.  they did not display characteristics that i  normally noted with planes in an approach pattern.  they were level, side by side, alternating red then white vice flashing, i noted no flashing strobe lights, no running lights, no internal cabin lighting.  additionally, the white light was a brilliant white and lacked the yellowish tinge common to airliner landing lights or cabin lights.They appeared to be lower than the other aircraft in the pattern, however i was not able to tell due to darkness.  i observed them at a distance of what i speculate to be 10 to 16 miles away, based upon the location of the haneda flight pattern from my position on the toll road.  i briefly lost sight of it as i exited onto the #7 yokosuka exit and entered the honcho yamanaka toll road.  i sighted it again upon exiting the a tunnel on the toll road.  it was now generally west of my location and appeared to positioned beyond  the yokosuka naval base.  i estimate it was over tokyo bay, close to the chiba peninsula.  upon first sight, the lights were moving to the left in a se to n direction.  upon last sight they appeared stationary or were possibly  moving away from me in a westerly direction, thus giving the illusion of being stationary.   i am a 22 year navy veteran on active duty and have observed all manner of civilian and military aircraft  during both day and night to include night time carrier approach.  i am very familiar with both military and civilian aircraft patterns in the area and their general lighting configurations.  these lights looked almost like building aircraft warning lights, but they were at a much higher altitude, were brighter, and were moving.\r\n\r\nadditional info:\r\n\r\nnot likely to be a helicopter since i noted no running lights or strobing lights.  additionally it did not look like any military or civilian helicopters that i have observed at night in the

(its a shame we only had a iphone 5 video capabilities @ hand and did not have a high-end camcorder on hand)\r\n\r\nshortly after the incident (prior to reviewing the footage) i proceeded to my roof top in search of the red lights directions and distance however it was no where to be seen. as for the plane (yes i can tell it was a plane as it blinked in normal formation white/red & green pattern like most planes) turned around and flew back in the same direction it came from, which i thought was odd since most plane i witness tends to fly in one direction vs making a u-turn and flying back to the same direction it came from.\r\n\r\nnone the less it was a very interesting night to end the first day of new year. i can't explain what the red pulsating lights were or where the last 2 pulsating red light came from, and i sure as heck cannot explained what the yellowish light was as it was not visible with the naked eyes. initially i thought it was a glare but was skeptical since some of the \"still\" footage continue to shows the yellowish, mirror/ shadow like moving orb flying around. for all i know i could be wrong and it could be very well just a glare or a holographic projection.\r\n\r\ni'm not vouching what i saw nor am i dismissing it. i am simply sharing what i witnessed and experience, its up to you to take it for what its for. im just sharing my 2 cents on

parked, i noticed a large orange light to the east.  at first i thought it was a commercial jet on approach to seatac or a c-17 on approach to mcchord afb but then i noticed a severe lack of movement for it to be a jet.  after putting my lunch in my truck i just stood and watched the object move from the east to the west in a slow, lazy and jagged course.  i describe the course as \"jagged\" because it definitely was heading from east to west, but just like with flying an airplane, or driving a ship, there are always minute adjustments going on and i could actually see these little minute changes.  as i always do, i tried to disprove what i was seeing but for something to be moving that slow it would have to have been a helicopter . . . there was no sound.  i looked for the navigational lights, red for left or port side and green for right or starboard side, and there were no flashing white, red, or green lights.  i stood there mesmerized for a little bit and just saying to myself, \"wow, i get to see another one!\"  besides being a witness to the phoenix lights in 1997, there was another sighting i had down in phoenix that has made me never look at the night skies the same.  i am always looking into the skies at night and looking and searching . . . its almost an addiction if im out at night.  i decided my wife had to see the things i had talked about seeing down in phoenix and ran back to tell her.  before ducking under the carport roof i checked to make sure the object was there and it was.  i ran up the stairs to the second floor, unlocked the door, ran and unlocked the patio door (telling my wife the whole way what i wanted her to see), stepped outside and the object was gone.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

usually airplanes that fly around the same area but these lights were more stationary. about 5-6 of them all near the same area. after a couple of minutes most of them became invisible, not appearing to have traveled anywhere before they were gone. about 2 stayed a little longer than the rest but a minute after the others disappeared, they did as well. as if nothing was there to begin with. i didn't know what to think. my brain tried to rationalize, maybe it had been stars? but they shined brighter and more orange than the stars that were viewable at that time. it was exciting, but a little scary as well because i didn't know what the lights were.\r\n\r\n i heard about people seeing lights in california on new year's so when i first saw, that's what i thought, i think i may have seen the same thing. i seen something exactly the same january in 2009. i don't remember the exact date but the day they had the super bowl, so i can't forget that.
