cool sand of a construction site next to our house. arcadia is a small city that stretches along the main road for about a mile or so. my house was on a hill at the end of the road, enabling me to clearly observe most of the city. i enjoyed looking at the lights of the city in the cool night breeze, and as i sometimes did, i was standing in the cool sand and looked down at the city lights. as i was doing this, i perceived that dogs were barking at the far edge of town. i didn't think anything of it until i realized that the barking was slowly getting louder and closer. this caused me to pay a little more attention and as i looked down at the city i saw a small patch of sky that was darker then the surrounding sky. as i watched, i noted that this dark patch was maybe 300 feet above main st, and coming straight at me moving slowly. i didn't see any lights and couldn't make out the shape until the thing was maybe 100 yards from my position. i began to hear a low ���rum���rum���rum noise coming from it. as the road it was following ended at a ���t��� it turned instantaneously to its left and i could finally see its shape, it looked like a blimp, and maybe a third of the way up it had a row of very dim shimmery round lights. it was somehow hard to see, yet i could clearly make out the shape. it moved on to my right until it went out of site behind a large hill. at that point i couldn't hear it anymore. i never saw it again, but it just occurred to me that maybe 2 years prior to this sighting, a saw a meteor fly over my house so low that we could hear a loud burning roar as it passed almost directly overhead. the shape i saw was going in roughly the same direction, no idea if they are connected.","distance":"101-500

i was playing, my brother came inside to where i was gambling and told me to come outside quickly to look at something. he didn't tell me what it was, he just turned and headed for the door outside. i had no idea what it was he wanted me to see, but i got up from my machine anyways and followed him outside. an employee of the establishment was also following. when we got outside, my brother went into the parking lot, and we followed him, and pointed in the southwest sky and said \"look\". when we looked in the direction he was pointing, there it was, three distinct red lights in the shape of a triangle. the lights were slowly pulsating and then light on the left side of the triangle appeared to move straight up in the sky until it was at the same elevation as the top light in the triangle, and then it moved back to its original place in the triangle. when then light resumed its position, all three lights suddenly accelerated to the south at a speed which i can only describe as faster than anything i've ever seen. the lights just disappeared. at the time of this sighting, the weather conditions were light clouds with a ceiling of approximately 25000 ft. visibility was good. the strangest thing about this sighting was that exactly 1 year to day prior, at almost the same time, my brother and i spotted the exact same thing in about the same place in the sky. i can only say that whatever it was, it was big and it accelerated at a speed that was out of this world. i don't know what i saw, but i know what i didn't see. it was not an airplane, helicopter, flares, a star or planet. it wasn't a meteor, it wasn't fireworks, or any of the other explanations that the skeptics will give. i'm not saying it was an alien craft, but i'm also not saying it wasn't. i don't know

wanting me to photograph it thinking it was venus.  i snapped 4 pictures from my htc one cell phone in dusk light and continued to observe it for a few min.  i thought it was an unusual size and intensity for venus as well as suspecious about its position so i went into the kitchen to get the binoculars.  in the few moments i was away, the object moved to the right and descended to a new position in hover, so that when i returned it was no longer posing over the peak of mt. ashland.  i quickly put up the binoculars to have a better look.  as soon as i aquired the object in view it began to move slightly erraticly, somewhat slowly for the range but the object must have been quite large and in perspective the speed would have been tremendous from an aviation point of view.  the descent was seemingly deliberate, to the right and down the back side of the mountain pausing at tree top level for a moment before it decended from view. i got the impression it knew it was being observed.\r\n\r\nthat mountain peak has a large weather radar dome on its peak as well as several communications antenna that can barely be seen by the naked eye from our house about 20 miles away.  the object appeared to be slightly behind the mountain so some distance greater than the mountain peak.  through the binoculars i could not make out a defined shape as the object began moving as soon as i had it in view but, it had to be huge as it dwarfed the equipment on the mountain, surrounding terrain, forestry and ski lift equipment and was much much larger, brighter and  than aircraft that commonly fly over mt ashland on an instrument approach to the medford (mfr) airport.  of course arriving aircraft do not hover for 15 min and the descent angle i observed was pretty much parrallel to the mointains slope to the right, much much too steep for a commercial aircraft.\r\n\r\nmy wife reports that she and our visiting friend observed an bright orange belt parallel to the horizon illuminate not flash and sustain intensity for a few seconds before she called for me to come and look at it and get pictures.\r\n\r\nphotos were taken from an htc one phone, without flash, in various

rising up from the eastern horizon maybe 2 or 3 degrees south of where the first one had come up from. as the second light approached the first light, the first light turned to fly north and the

the same path as the first 3 lights then it faded out just like the other 3 had done. we knew these were definitely not helicopters or normal aircraft. i figured that if they were not ufo's then they

restaurant when i had the urge to turn around a head west to woodland hills to eat. so i made a u-turn and notice a shinny bright bluish white light slowly coming down out of the sky,burly stopping about 7 story's above the ground  silently hovering in one spot as we past the object it disappeared ,and then further up there was 5 more repeating the same pattern as the first.As we past under the last one my friend who was a total skeptic manage to snap a pic,now shes a believer. as i passed under them i glance and seen a weird triangle shape craft about 25 long was not really big but im sure 2 men could fit in it easy, when she should me the photo after i said its a weird triangle i freaked out. one when we drove under this thing we didn't see 5 lights 3 on each point and 2 in the middle we seen one solid blue bright whitish light,as well as the shape of this thing i never seen anything like this. you be the judge. this is a actually picture not cgi or anything with computers if someone knows what this thing is please inform me.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:05:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,  Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path

evening. after some time with the scope i put it away and was prepared to go to bed but took a last look to the s.E. sky as the earlier reports stated. i noticed an orangish light behaving strangely and watched it for a couple of minutes and then went inside to wake up my wife, she and i watched it for about 40 min. and then she went back to bed. during the observation, we compared the directional details as they happened and agreed every time. it seemed to have what we can best describe as thruster type light or flash emanating from the top occasionally. i continued to watch after my wife went to bed and eventually it faded into just a totally stable small star like light that that dimmed permanently. it was cold and clear the entire time and many shooting stars were observed as were various aircraft in typical flight characteristics with audible motors. no odd noises were apparent. created a feeling of wonder and amazement in both my wife and

soon as i opened the door 2 unusual yellowish lights in the ne, they were lined up, at 1st i thought it was airplanes or helecopters but they looked differant and were just hovering, then a 3rd one appeared and the 3 formed a triangle, i went inside to get my camera, when i came back outside the 3rd one was either gone or the light went out,this is the 1st picture i took,then i saw one large one was rising up beyond the trees in the ne distance,2nd picture,i wondered if these were japanese lanterns but it was a cloudy night-this was just 3 hours before it started to snow, so i wasn't able to see neighborhood fireworks since it was cloudy,i just heard them. after the big one rose in the sky,there were 3 smaller ones again and they lined up in a straight line about the larger one for a few seconds,this is the beginning of what i filmed. then this formation broke up and the smaller lights spread out in a zig zag with the largest one still hovering and moving around in the sky below, more smaller lights appeared, some blinked, the video doesn't show all that i saw since i was zooming in and trying to keep the camera steady, there were a total of 7 accross the sky hovering and blinking, at this point i was a little freaked out so i stopped filming and went inside, so i really don't know how long they were out there, but right before i stopped filming it seemed the lights were starting to go out or they took differant direction and were gone,so when i went inside there were only 2 small ones left in the sky and the large one still hovering below.  i am pretty much a skeptic about ufos until i saw this, later than morning i started looking for sightings online,it was so noticeable i wondered how many other people saw this. i had to wait until i used someone else's laptop to report this because mine won't take any pictures or videos right now due to some kind of problem with it. since i waited until now though i have been checking online and noticed alot of other sightings in other areas on new years morning not long after midnight.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
