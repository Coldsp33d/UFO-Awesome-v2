miles in 10 seconds from the time it disappeared until it reappeared.  previously, it seemed to be moving exceptionally fast, but the speed at which it jumped forwards during the few seconds it was

northwest relatively low to the horizon between a pair of trees. estimated to be magnitude 0 or possibly even brighter, and immediately felt they were unfamiliar in the sky, two stars, that bright, that close together. then i noticed they were slowly moving together against the background, eventually passing behind a tree, emerging out again on the other side of it, before disappearing from my view altogether behind the next set of trees. \r\n\r\nmy initial thought is that they must be satellites, but it was quite late into the evening, and it is the middle of winter. far too deep into earth shadow for a low earth orbiting satellite to be in sunlight. they were also moving very slow for satellites, so i gave some thought to the possibility of higher orbiting satellites, but they were very bright for that to seem likely. i checked a satellite database on my phone which revealed no passing satellites. i checked for iridium flares scheduled for my location, but none were scheduled at this time, and it appears even iridium satellites don't flare that late at night at this time of year here. plus, there were two of these lights. i considered the possibility that these were like the noss triplets. i saw a set of noss triplets in 1997, and this was similar. the noss triplets are out of formation now, but apparently the chinese yaogan satellites fly in formation. i checked their known orbits and they don't seem like they were in the neighbourhood. i also believe their altitude places them too low to be in sunlight at that time of night. i am highly confident that these were not planes. solid white/yellow steady star-like light, no sound, no nearby airports, very little air traffic on this part of the coast at all really.\r\n\r\nhonestly, i am stumped. i

and looked up to see what it was. it was a hot sunny day without any breeze. about 50-60 feet above me was a saucer shaped vehicle hovering and spinning. it caused all of the leaves on the tree to fold and turn downward as if trying to avoid radiation or some sort of emissions. electro magnetic maybe. i was waiting for my grandmother to call me in for lunch so it was probably about noon. the saucer hovered for about 2 minutes and tilted toward me. at that time it moved away from my yard and landed behind some trees blocking it's view from my house. i ran into the house and told my grandmother what i had seen and she just blew it off. i was sitting on my bed looking out the window in the back of the house when i saw the 2 beings passing along the outer edge of our yard behind some peach trees. they were different heights. one was a half head shorter than the other. they seemed to be wearing suits which were rouge red in color. they were walking side by side and moved out of sight from my window. that was my last memory until about 10pm. my grandmother and i were standing in the kitchen in the dark and lunch was still sitting out on the counter. at one point i know i was in the saucer. it had a window and i could see the road below. i think we were over the blue ridge mountains which were visible from our house on a clear day. we were hovering above a car traveling along a winding mountain road. i was watching the headlights from the car flashing into the woods as it went around curves. i think we may have taken them but can't remember a lot. i don't recall any words ever being spoken but they showed me lights off in the distance and said that was where i lived. i had never been in a plane so watching that car below was something i'll never forget.\r\none of them was 5 feet tall and the other about 6ft or maybe a little less.\r\nwhen i realized i was home there was blood on my legs and feet dried. i never felt any pain or had any effects from this and didn't think about it again until i was about 15 yrs old. i had an exam by a gynecologist and i overheard the doctor asking my mother who had done the surgery on me. i had never had surgery or sex. i thought back to that night finding the blood on myself. this has happened more than one so i know thay have some sort of tracking device inside my body. i'm now in florida and they did some sort of scanning on me. i have a lot of details and would even consent to hypnotherapy. i don't mind others knowing but fact is, most don't believe it if you tell them. contact me if you wish and we will go onto further details. i'm 68 years old and am not a nut case.I've never had any mental problems. i have a friend who is an fbi agent and i gave him the written detail as well. thanks

(their power as well as ours was back on) when my husband walked away from the window, that is when i went over & looked out & up toward the sky. (i always was & still am a \"sky-watcher\")\r\nwhen i looked out to the west, i saw a huge black object with many black spheres attached to it. it wasn't making a sound, but it was moving at a rapid pace yet, gracefully into the southwest where it disappeared into a sun-lit cloud. (i hollered for my husband to come back to the window to see it, but just as he got to the window is when it disappeared into the cloud leaving me the only one to see this) when i first saw it, i thought it must have been a group of birds, but i know that wasn't the case. this object didn't move like a flock of birds and was far too large because of the distance. i stood there straining my eyes because of the brightness of the white & well lit cloud, i kept watching anyway to see it come back out, as i was not wanting to believe my eyes. i stood there about three minutes just observing & reflecting on the occurrence. the object never did come back out. it was as if it vanished into nothingness.
