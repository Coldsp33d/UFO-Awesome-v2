live in south eastern poland (about 70 miles from the border with ukraine). on jan 1 2014, a few minutes after midnight my 14 year old son and i went outside our house to see and hear fireworks (new year celebration). as we were looking at the sky, i noticed a red light, brighter than the brightest star, moving across the sky in the direction of north. i showed it to my son and noted that it seemed to be moving much faster than jet planes. we heard no sounds but the night was quite noisy due to the fireworks our neighbors and others in the area were playing with. after the light passed us and we were looking at it facing north, it disappeared about 45 degrees above the horizon.\r\n\r\ni was surprised mostly by the speed of the object and the first explanation that came to my mind was a rocket launched from ukraine.\r\n\r\nas soon as the light disappeared we noticed another, identical red light over the south-western horizon moving north north-west. it was also fast. it was coming from the same direction.\r\n\r\nour attention switched from fireworks to the strange, red lights. we kept seeing more and more of the lights going either north or north-west, all moving faster than jet-planes and all coming from the same point south-east. they appeared pretty regularly, but at one point we saw 3 of them at the same time in the sky.\r\n\r\naround 00:30 we went back home and i asked my wife to come out to see the light. it was the last of the red lights that i saw that night (i waited awhile after that but didn't see any more of the lights). between about 00:10 and 00:30 we saw probably 10 or 12 of those objects.\r\n\r\neven though we didn't see the shape of the objects and they were moving evenly across the sky, the brightness and the speed were very unusual. it made such an impression on me that for the next few hours i kept watching the news channel, expecting to hear about mysterious explosions in western europe or in america. obviously i am relieved no such events were reported, but i am still very curious what it was.\r\n\r\ni should probably add that i don't drink alcohol (religion) and i don't believe that aliens can reach our planet (i guess i should say i don't believe in ufo's).","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

initially appeared to be a large orange \r\n\r\nburning object, high up in the northeastern sky  . i had my sunroof open, had just parked my car in front of a restaurant, turned to converse with \r\n\r\nmy son who was sitting in the passenger seat and  this object caught my eye. for the past few months i had been witnessing strange out of place \r\n\r\nand unusually bright objects in the night sky that had peaked my interest enough to have caused me to purchased some good binnoculars and it \r\n\r\njust so happens that i keep them handy in my vehicle and  not taking my eyes off of \"it\" i reached for the familiar spot and pulled them out. it was \r\n\r\na blazing orange colored glow, getting brighter as the glow area increased in size .It was something big i watched it get even bigger with my \r\n\r\nnaked eyes as i raised my binoculars saying \"that is not a plane it looks as if it is something big and on fire. i  took one fast look before quickly \r\n\r\nhanded them to my (adult) son saying omg you have to look at this thing . he rolled his eyes and turned in his seat( this was not the first time i \r\n\r\nhad asked his opinion on an object of my interest in the night sky)  what does this look like to you? as he is tall he held them up and out of the \r\n\r\nsun roof and  he looked at the object through them, asking me at one point to assist him in keeping them as steady as possible (so i used the \r\n\r\nedge of the sunroof to brace my right hand and the held the right side of the binnoculars steady with my extended fingers) excitement on my \r\n\r\npart was mounting because he didn't hand them right back to me saying \"it's nothing\"  as was often the case.  he said nothing and he continued \r\n\r\nto look.   i started to ask questions \" what is it, its not a plane. is it a plane. is it on fire, are those flames,? he said \"it definatly doesn't look like a \r\n\r\nplane but there... is fire\". i said \"i knew it was on fire, what is it, what does it look like, does it look like it's getting bigger,do you think it's part of \r\n\r\nthe comet debris, or a maybe a meteor ... it kind of looks like...(i was going to say an asteroid but instead i said.)  is it coming  at us..Do you think \r\n\r\nit is aimed this way, is it going to hit us maybe, do you think it might hit near to us ? then i stopped as he turned to me  i grabbed the binnoculars \r\n\r\nand started to focus them while looking up to calculate the positioning and angle i could see the glow was fading. he said \"it looks like its on fire \r\n\r\nbut it looks more like fire from  \"friction\" thinking he was dismissing the event i said \"friction? how do you know its friction. how do you even \r\n\r\nknow what fiction looks like\"?  he responded \"because i've seen friction before\" i said \"you mean like.. maybe from entering the atmosphere kind \r\n\r\nof friction?\" he said \"possibly\"  i raised the binnoculars i looked through the glasses it was hard to find (at first) as it was no longer bright and \r\n\r\nblazing nor orange, the fire was almost out. luckily small portions of it were sizzling on rear facing end. i found it just as the last embers were \r\n\r\nextinguishing. i watched it come closer and closer  i could now see the object  clearly it was in front of me and i was now facing forward in my \r\n\r\nseat but the image was still somewhat blurry and faint and  it was in a tumble, turning this way and that, end over end, and it continued tumbling \r\n\r\nalmost as if in slow motion,  my impression at the time was it appeared to be a rock that was somehow uniform and resembling a cube.  it was \r\n\r\nsquare ..Leaning slightly towards rectangular, but the corners  were curved/rounded. the surface of it was smooth but not flat  what i saw  was \r\n\r\ngray in color...And this is the strange part  i saw a big darker gray circle on one of the sides as it turned to face me, and in some way it  seemed \r\n\r\nsort of transparent like an illusion at this point  i kept it in my sight through the binoculars  and i said to my son, what the hell is that? he said he \r\n\r\ncould barely see it now with the naked eye and he was trying (as it turned out unsuccessfully )to take a photo with his phone  i watched it and saw \r\n\r\nthe circle one more time before the cube shaped rock heading southwest disappeared  behind the restaurant building directly in front of me.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

below.\r\n\r\ni was on my balcony looking west from rancho bernardo california, toward the hills above the neighborhood called westwood. the back ground hills are hills separating north county east from north county west and the coast. something caught my eye as flying toward me below the horizon of the hill. at first glance, and being after dark, i first thought it was an unusually large bird with white tipped wings, but one of the objects changed direction and began to get further away from the other, making it clear that it was not a bird, and getting my full attention. their distance was about half way across the valley, or 1 to 2 miles and level with my line of sight looking toward the hill. they began to glide north and increased altitude just slightly above the horizon. one object again began moving ahead and bit faster than the other object. with the light of the horizon now behind the crafts, i began to get my depth of field and could see the two objects were moving north at an extremely fast rate of speed. in fact all of their movements were incredible fast but also abnormally smooth and steady. they continued to remain between my location and the hills, so their distance was less than two miles away during most of the siting. their altitude continued to be much lower than the ceiling would be for any airplanes in the area. even a helicopter would not fly so low unless it was going to land or drop water on a fire. although these were clearly not helicopters. \r\n\r\ni have never seen a ufo before and there was no possibility that these were airplanes or anything of earthly origin. they were not very large, but they were not extremely small like the orbs occasionally described either. they were moving unusually smoothly and at a high rate of speed even as they began to increase altitude, as if there was no resistance or effort at all involved, and the moved far faster than any aircraft we have and making no sound at all. being so close, there should have been some sound. the movement was much more like gliding, only at an extremely high rate of speed. just after the forward craft began to distance its self from the craft in the rear, they both accelerated and disappeared in a streak heading north. \r\n\r\nthe light omitted from these craft was steady and constant, white or light gray in color with no blinking or other colorations. the craft themselves were dark. perhaps black, dark gray or shadowy, and the exact shape was impossible to make out with any certainty, although against the might horizon opposite from the moon, they appeared to be oval in shape. the lights were much dimmer than i would have guessed from descriptions that i have heard of ufo sightings in the past and even in comparison to other aircraft in the area that were much higher and further away. due to the flight path of planes moving south from los angeles, there were several airplanes in the area, although none in the direct path north, south or west of the craft, and again, all were much further away at much higher altitudes. the sighting lasted roughly 20-40 seconds. i doubt very seriously that i was the only one to see these.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

10:30 pm new years eve. our back yard is situated facing due north. i happened to look up to see if the stars were out yet since i enjoy star gazing when ever possible. i noticed the two bright star like objects (#1 and #2) in the north western sky, at approx. 35 (#2) and 45 (#1) deg above the horizon.  the left most \"star\" (#2) was positioned at approx. 8:00 o'clock from the right one (#1).

\r\nincident:\r\nwhile waling outside a few houses down, i saw a light through the trees (ponderosas); yellow/orange mixed. indistinct.\r\ni moved to the far side of the road to get a little more perspective and move the object higher into the thinner upper pines from my perspective for less obstructed view. \r\ndescription of the object is spherical throughout, but changes as it flew. while low/large it was a fuzzy orb with a nucleus in the upper left area from my position. at this point it was a yellow/orange color. as it ascended, it shrunk in size, became sharper, and transitioned from yellow/orange to orange, to dark orange, and then dark red. no flashing lights. no sound. \r\n\r\n[*i will insert my assumptions as this report progresses.]\r\n\r\n[since the aircraft was obviously low, i initially assumed it was a helicopter with some sort of forward looking light. but the light was not a beam as far as i could see. but at the moment it didn���t occur to me that there was no rotor, propeller or jet noise.]\r\n\r\nthe object���s size was about a third of a full moon at first. it seemed to be approaching my direction because it grew for about 10 seconds and seemed to hover towards my vicinity.\r\n \r\nthen it started to rise, slowly at first. \r\n\r\nit was right around midnight 12/31 and there were occasional firecrackers going off, and i could hear some distant boom fireworks from the town miles away.\r\n\r\n[as the object rose, i shifted my thinking (i was still very banal and casual at this point), that this was now a fancy backyard firework with a parachute, sort of like a military flare, which i have seen before. if that was the case, it would have been 1/4 mile away or closer. plus, normally, you would hear people cheering its launch. aside from that, but why does it keep rising?]\r\n\r\nat this point i realized ���wait a second, this isn���t normal?���\r\n\r\nas it rose, its shape became more solid, switched from fuzzy yellow/orange to orange and finally solid red.\r\n\r\nit gained speed as it rose and arced northwest until it disappeared, still increasing speed. \r\n\r\nit is difficult to assess speed and elevation because i could not tell how large the object was.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

were celebrating new years morning, i watched the fire works and 1/2 a sky of stars. the other half was covered by thick white clouds. it was so quite i could hear traffic from 270, and 55, along with what others were shooting off. after a few minutes 1 very bright orb was viable through easterly trees. it was moving fast and seemed to pulse red/orange to almost white. it was about 2-3 times the size of the lowest flying plan i've seen in the area. so bright the color was the only thing viable. i couldn't see through it so i assume it was solid, or emitting so much light no background star was viable. the speed was incredibly fast too. it covered the flight path about 3-4 times faster than planes that fly in the area. \r\n\r\n   shortly after realizing it was not a firework exploding, and traveled too fast to be a plane i notice a 2n'd one coming from a southern  to north, north eastern direction. both were below clouds, altitude unknown. similar size (brightness), same colors, same type of pulse. synchronized unknown. they were wonderful in color, with out sound, left no trail in the sky, made no beam, no landing, no stop.\r\n   after the first one arrived at the same intersecting level it suddenly changed to the same direction the second one was headed. they both flew that way until they were out of sight blocked by tress, or objects on the horizon. only took 1ish minutes for them to be visible and gone. i'm not a good judge of time when i'm not paying attention, but they were there and gone quick... maybe less than 1 minute. i knew they'd be out of sight before i could fetch a camera so i just enjoyed seeing what ever it may be.\r\n\r\n   i watch single prop, double prop, passenger jets, helicopters, and military fighters& choppers, and i know it was none of the above common types that. i can hear choppers from miles away before seeing it, same with planes at night. there was no sound, brilliant intense light in an orb shape, that was steady and didn't flicker or flash. to even come close to how bright this light was it would take a chopper with a search light opened up, fly low, and even then it would have cast a beam of light viable in such pitch black night sky. i've worked in theater so seen plenty of lights. i could also say the colors were slightly different between center part and outer. but no descriptive words i have would do it justice.  this thing cast no beam of light, but only seemed to be an orb of independent light. no sound, no beam of light, just a steady cycle of colors. would be interesting to recreate it with cg, but i'm not even sure that would be done right... it was unique compared to anything seen thus far.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional
