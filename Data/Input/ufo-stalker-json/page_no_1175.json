110 knots. no unusual maneuvers were observed, the object stayed on a straight and steady course. it had none of the strobe lights that i'm accustomed to seeing on a planes wing tips and tail, and no bright white landing light(s) were visible. the bright orange-reddish glow of the object was beautiful. it also emitted a short flickering flame from the tail. i lost sight of it as it passed to the west due to my roof obstructing my view. at this point i ran to the front of my house and watched it once again as it slowly disappeared into the western sky, still maintaining a steady height, speed, and course. there was never any sound. no prop noise, no jet exhaust noise. dead silence. i am a retired u.S.A.F. security policeman and vietnam veteran. i have seen many different types of aircraft in my life time, but never anything like this.

so i was on my deck waiting for the moon to rise & as i was looking off to the east,southeast a cloud that was on the horizon became very bright & i started taking pics not knowing what i was looking at& with in about 8-9minutes this object came out of the cloud glowing yellow to white really bright. as it was happening i keep telling myself thats got to be the moon but there was no way because it came out of the cloud, it rose-up,it was round like the moon but the moon does not come out of a clouds right? in the pics you can see the cloud hase touchs the object like smoke, you can diffently see the object was coming out of the cloud& the cloud is square in shape which until i looked at the pics i had no idea it has a defined shape.After awhile as i watched it rise out of the said cloud it disappeared into a large system of clouds that had came out of nowhere. it was amazing to say the least. if anyone can explain what i saw please do, but until then i know what i saw & i have pics to prove it.I just wish i video taped it. you ask why i did'nt  i had no idea what i was seeing & it had me mezmorized. like i said i think it had some control of time because what i thought was a few seconds was 8-9 minutes & the only reason i know that is my camera.Thank you ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:08:38","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":53105,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.110746700418,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01012014-0030","longitude":-97.19749815781033,"occurred":1365138060000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,   Star-like,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1388581995000,"summary":"As i observed the object appeared out of what i thought was a cloud but after looking over the film im not sure what i saw. i thought it was the moon but it was way to bright & the cloud it came out of was square. i've got pics, thats were it looks square","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/53105_submitter_file1__IMG3189.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/53105_submitter_file2__IMG3194.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/53105_submitter_file3__IMG31911.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"76226","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":271,"locationName":"Argyle, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:212799"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Apple Valley","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Visiting the family for the holidays\r\n\r\nright after the countdown for 2014 new years several minutes of hearing fireworks, gunshots, etc. then out of nowhere you heard a series of sonic booms. i was already outside when this started happening and looked up when i started hearing the sonic booms. i started seeing in the distance lights lighting up the sky (materializing with each sonic boom) then they started getting in formation while staying stationary in the sky. not like a plane where they are always moving. by then all the family members started witnessing it. after awhile the lights started leaving in their own separate direction. \r\n\r\nwith so many people out there that has already numerously recorded moments like this with all similar experiences there was no doubt in our minds in what we were really seeing. now what did shock us was that when this was taking place we were also hearing the night filled with echoes of police sirens, etc. giving us the impression that this was causing somewhat a panic for the local community. but after calling it in with the local authorities the told us no one called in with similar reports.\r\n\r\nwe are sure we were not the only ones that seen this! this was way to large not to be seen!\r\n\r\nwhat a way to start the new year off for 2014.
