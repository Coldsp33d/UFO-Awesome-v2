west end of ottawa, on.I believe the sighting occured december 12, 2013. it was approximately 6 am and i decided to go out for a cigarrette. many employees were showing up for work at this time. i proceeded out the east entrance and turned right walking south toward the smoking area. i'm an amateur astronomer and study astrophysics so i'm always looking up to see whats going on up there. as i approached the smoking area i witnessed what appeared to be 3 star-like lights appear in the southern sky. my head was tilted a bit so i'm guessing it was around 60 to 70 degrees above the horizon. obviously these star like lights were not stars, but with a quick glance one might mistake the 3 lights for stars. the 3 star-like lights were travelling in unison and appeared to be same distance from each other. they seemed to enter our orbit for about 6 seconds before they instanty disappeared. when i first spotted the 3 star like objects entering the earth's orbit a lady having a smoke who just arrived for her work day looked at me and said what is that you are looking at. i responded that i thought it may have been the international space station, although i have seen the internatinal space station from ground level and this was totally different. i told her i'm really not sure so i'm classifying it as a ufo. i have also viewed comets, meteors, satellites, and several other objects in space from ground level. this was something different entirely. the magnitude of the brightness of the 3 objects was incredible. as said before they appeared to be brightly shining stars, but were definately not stars. the 3 bright star-like objects were travelling in unison extremely fast and in a straight line parallel to the horizon. the objects were not in triangle formation. they were in a straight line formation perpendicular to the horizon. i lost sight of the objects or object as it/they left our orbit. i believe it could have been a spacecraft using the slingshot technique around the earth, but unfortunately i definately cannot prove this to be true. this area of the sky seems to be very active as i have seen many unusual events happen including what appeared to be a star exploding back on june 10, 2013. on this day june 10, 2013 something instantaneously brightened to about the size of the moon then disappeared within seconds leaving nothing behind except the blackness of space. is it a coicidence that this event occurred at the same time i was abondoning a scientific report i was writing on gobekli tepe. this event gave me the inspiration and motivation needed to write a 90 page scientific report on the archeological site called gobekli tepe. i'm not quite sure what i viewed on december 12, 2013 but my expertise in this field leads me to believe it was not natural and not a man-made object. therefore, i'm writing this sighting in hopes that someone may be able to shed some light on this event. as stated before i lost sight of the 3 star-like object/objects as they disappeared which i believe was caused due to the objects/object exiting our orbit. thank you and hope that this helps out in someway. matthew c. simms ","distance":"Over 1

we live less than 2 miles from the downtown of kalamazoo; it was about 15 degrees temperature and snowing steadily.  i became aware of 5-6 orange pulsing orbs moving into view from the south, hovering over the trees between us and the downtown area. we raced out into the field behind our house to see more clearly. the orbs, in turn, gradually seemed to go up and disappear into the low clouds and snow; meanwhile we became aware of another orb slowly coming from the same area of the south, and then another, and another, all following approximately the same path, from the s to the se, hovering in the same general area of the sky over the neighborhood between us and downtown, about 25-30 degrees above our visible horizon.  it took about 20 minutes overall, and we saw/counted 19 orbs.  they at times got close to each other as they hovered, and one by one slowly disappeared up into the cloud cover.  i did hear jets going by a couple of times, and at first thought that maybe the first ones might have been aircraft; but the jets that i heard were above the clouds and moved from north to south (by sound); the orbs had no sound and traveled from s to se.  they glowed and pulsed from an orange-red to a creamy color.  we were amazed to see so many, coming in a rather regular pattern and timing.  even more amazingly, last year we also went outside to watch the fireworks on new years night and also saw orbs - last year there were three, they were closer to us, the night was more clear (low clouds but not snowing), and the orbs were deeper red; they also gradually ascended up into the cloud cover.  we have wondered, only half kiddingly, if they are hanging around to watch the fireworks!!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":53084,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.2998469,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01012014-0009","longitude":-85.5852286,"occurred":1388563200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1388568672000,"summary":"We went outside at 12 to watch the new years fireworks. we saw a succession of at least 19 orange pulsing orbs slowly move from s to se, hovering, changing positions, ascending, disappearing into the snowy sky.","tags":["hovering","pulsing"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"49006","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Kalamazoo, Michigan","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:212849"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Lawndale","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Just got done barbecuing for new years eve (i don't drink).  looked up in sky and saw many stars for a los angeles night.  something caught my eye and it was a large orange light, larger and brighter than any star.  it was moving very slowly about 35 degrees on the horizon from the east by southeast towards the west by northwest.  it looked like an airplane on fire but it trailed no flames and seemed to stay the same orange color. it stayed the same color, speed and direction.  after watching it move very slowly for 3 to 4 minutes, it seemed to slow down, bright orange color became dull, appeared to hover for a few seconds and disappeared.  there seems to be a very tiny white light left but i think it was a distant star. i looked away and could not refind the tiny white light.  my roommate saw the same thing and had no idea what he saw.  i have always loved airplanes, know them very well, and have seen many meteorites.  i have been in aerospace quality for 44 years and been to many west coast airshows. my first thought was that it was a 737 on fire but no particles, fire trail, no anything trailing. with all the years i have watched the skies, i have never seen anything like this.  if it was a meteor, it was headed right at me as it had no tail, no sparks, and appeared to be going very slow.

(approximately 1/4 mile) we observed the object was pulsating and appeared to be on fire. the colors changed from bright orange to red and the object at times moved away from our location and would stop and hover. i'm not an aviator but would guess the objects altitude was between 5000 to 7000 feet as we could see the mountain on which we live and at its top is 3000 ft. we pulled in to a church parking lot and turned off our vehicle and got out. standing in the parking lot we witnessed the object pulsate red and orange in a fiery glow as it hovered then slowly start moving away then would stop again. there was absolutely no sound coming from the object however there were several other aircraft visible in the sky and they all had flashing red/white navigational lights and moved in a consistent straight flight path that one would expect from conventional aircraft. after about 5 minute of the object pulsating and making slow irregular movements (all the time moving away from our location) the object blinked in and out of sight maybe three times the object then completely disappeared. the weather was clear. i did have my phone w/ camera but knew that it was pointless to video the object as the resolution would have made the video unintelligible.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":53070,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.39354755328906,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12312013-0017","longitude":-82.2979017797432,"occurred":1388550600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North Carolina","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1388554429000,"summary":"Pulsating fireball orb hovering in sky for 5 min. then blinked out.","tags":["lights","video"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"28792","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Hendersonville, North Carolina","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:212861"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Hays","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving down the street and saw a weird  thing in the sky i called my bud devin and my phone lost sevice. a thing came down and i drove off","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:18:17","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":53069,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.8740378,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12312013-0016","longitude":-99.2957185,"occurred":1260950400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,   Diamond,   Egg,   Flash,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1388542990000,"summary":"Scary dark big","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/53069_submitter_file1__ufo.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"67601","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1476,"locationName":"Hays, Kansas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:212862"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Minneapolis","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was standing at oak st and washington waiting for the bus at the umn mpls campus, i happened to be looking in the sky watching the path a searchlight (belonging to the business across the street)was making in the clouds. i noticed a long perfectly straight line of light (that i'd guess) was about 50m long and 1m wide just above the cloud cover. i at first thought this might have been from a plane but discounted it when i watched it for about 15mins with no change in it's size or direction. \r\n\r\nwhat also struck me about this object was that whenever the searchlight passed over the line of light, there appeared to be a perpendicular reflection (like one would see if you were to shine a flashlight on a piece of metal). i watched this entire event for a good 15mins, and each time the searchlight passed over this spot i saw the perpendicular reflection. \r\n\r\ni did my best to take a video (but being that it was snowing and nighttime the only thing you are able to make out is the pulse of light that occurred when the spotlight passed over it.) it occurs at roughly the 10sec mark. sorry for the background noise from the nearby traffic and buses.","distance":"501 Feet -
