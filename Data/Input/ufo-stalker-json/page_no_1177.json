happened next was really surprising.....It went straight up into the sky. not fast - not left or right -  straight up. as it ascended it got smaller and smaller and suddenly - and sadly :(

(i was surprised)\r\nsense: a robotic/bio hybrid tech. combination\r\n\"since you are a ufo, would you please consider stopping?  would you stop?\"\r\n* the object stopped. (i think it was here that i heard back: \"we are on surveillance\"\r\nmy comms kept up in repetition:\r\n\"turn around. please come back. im ready. over here.\"\r\n* following about a minute, the object began a slow u-turn. \r\ni took a lot of deep breaths.\r\n* the object stopped about half way to me.\r\nmy comms kept repeating as before:\r\n\"keep coming. im ready. over here. please position above me.\"\r\n* few seconds later, the object resumed movement & took position at 90 above my head. it maintained the same distance.\r\nthe blue/green color seen as it was first observed, had vanished and the object was only a solid round white circle.\r\ni was still standing, with my hands holding the back of my head to see upward & because it was uncomfortable. \r\nsense: this was similar to 2008 & encounter with star like object that received comm & entered atmosphere using short term wormhole with 2 gravitational lines. difference: this was more of a robotic/bio sense in the comm return.\r\ni got prepared for a light beam to be taken up. however, that is not what occurred.\r\ndigital scan:\r\na type of translucent cylinder came down over me containing digits/numbers.\r\nright & left side. cool. unusual odor. frozen. face forward now. hands at side. (similar to other times being held in place with weight like shoes on feet, but this time the whole body was frozen)\r\nnumber in descending order: 8   1   0\r\nright side only. \r\nsecond type scan of energy this time sent down the middle of the body reaching only to the thoracic area & then going back up to the head.\r\nthis felt like something was searching to id who or what i was. \r\nsense: they did not locate a chip or id.\r\n* \"no room\"  ( comm from them)\r\nthe cylinder, numbers, and energy were lifted off and returned back upward like it came down.\r\ni was released.\r\nfollowing the scan:\r\nwalked over to a car in the driveway, put my head against the side of the top of the car and kept looking up.\r\na second star or object was released from the first stationary star like ojbect. it traveled to approx. the same distance where it had turned around. took a stationary position.\r\ni asked: \"is there going to be anymore comm? you arent going to pick me up or give me a ride or purpose as to this encounter? why are you stopped?\"\r\n* \"if we stay still it is harder to be tracked.\"\r\n(at first this did not make sense, but then i referred myself back to the 2008 sighting & remembered that craft seen then was seen at first beside another star and looked like one at first glance)\r\n\"if you are not going to communicate anymore, then i am going home.\"\r\nreturned to car & drove home. sat outside my house for about 15 minutes looking up at the stars hoping that something would return. i also need time to process this incident.\r\nfeelings, reactions, theory:\r\nin awe. new encounter. not familiar with this. familiar with entities and being aboard crafts with or without military. wondered if it would affect me negatively in my physical body. 1)this was our tech. 2) out tech with the ets. 3) et tech only.  whoever and however this is, this one has a hybrid/tech/bio life form which can process telepathic comm. that is amazing. \r\ni feel connected in a new way to a mathematical universe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":53040,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.028592312771163,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12302013-0006","longitude":-81.93592237745237,"occurred":1387267200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1388441431000,"summary":"7pm.Clear. lrg.Starlikeobj.Ne-se. tel.Comm. sloweddn. stopped. chgd.Dir. returned & hovered. digital scan. sent out 2nd star to other location. no pick up. ret. home.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"33803","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":13,"locationName":"Lakeland, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:212920"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"San Jose","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Just after 9:00pm on thursday, december 26, i caught out of the corner of my eye what i thought was a shooting star. i quickly realized it was not a shooting star due to its trajectory and low altitude. it was a very brilliant white light orb heading from the south east foothills over san jose, heading north. it flew over downtown, which is where i viewed this event and continued north. i had a very clear view of it as it flew overhead. it was travelling very fast, which if i had to guess would be in excess of 600 to 700 mph. i watched it till it flew out of sight.","distance":"501 Feet -
