and saw a reddish-orange glowing ball of light traveling south, it was a little higher than the high rise condo next \r\ndoor and actually traveled directly over it. to me it didn't look too big, about 2 to 3 feet\r\naround, roughly.\r\ni went to the walkway at the end of our building that leads to the beach and did not see the\r\nball of light by the time i got out there. a few minutes later another light came from down\r\nthe beach, it looked to be the same size as the previous light, it appeared out of nowhere, it started glowing around the area of apache pier and flew south in a straight line down the beach. it was a little windy and to me it seemed to be under power of some sort to fly that straight. after a minute or two it was almost directly over me and turned east towards the ocean. as it started to go through some low flying clouds it began to fade out but i could still see the object slowly spinning down towards the water. at this point i noticed it was an off white, maybe grey white and it looked like one end had two rounded globes and the other end was smaller but i couldn't make out the shape to well at the other end. i went to the waters edge were i watched it fall about 40 foot out into the water, it was about \r\n2-1/2 feet across and floated. i watched it for maybe 5 or so minutes, when i went to get my wife and came back, it was gone.\r\nat around 8:00 pm or so i was on my back porch and saw another reddish-orange sphere, the same size as the other two and flying the same path. i tried to get it on video but it didn't turn out so good, photography is not my stronger point, as it was almost over the apartment it stopped glowing and turned off white or grey white and continued over the apartment out of my sight, we ran outside to find it but after looking everywhere we could, it couldn't be found.\r\nlater that night my wife and i observed 2 of the same lights together, which we did get video of and she reported it as well.\r\nthe previous night, 12/27/13 my wife and i watched several of these lights appear and disappear, one which flew fairly close to a commercial plane, going opposite directions. she reported those sightings,

a high privacy fence and after the first 5 passed at about a mile away, more appeared following the formation. they were single file at the same altitude, not evenly spaced, some closer to each other and some further apart. i ran into the house to get my phone to take pictures. all that appeared on my screen was a tiny white spot which i will download and have someone more experienced look at. we both knew that we were viewing something unnatural and were yelling and hoping neighbours would come outside as well. there was no sound and no exhaust or blinking lights like a plane has. we are situated 20 miles from pearson international airport and these orbs were not going in that direction. we both stood in the snow without shoes to watch until the last orb appeared, then disappeared from our view into the low level clouds and this observation lasted about 4 minutes from the first formation to the last orb moving out of view. it was the most amazing experience, unlike anything else and i want to see them again. my friend worked at the gtaa and immediately checked flight tracker 24 on the internet and radar only showed two commercial aircraft in completely different locations at that exact time. my friend has always laughed at the thought of ufos, but after witnessing those orbs, he has completed changed his outlook. on my mother's grave, this event happened as i

military craft. this moved very differently. it had three lights total, would move side to side, then descend, then move side to side, then descend. at the final descent it moved very quickly straight

uncommon to see air-liners nearing or, at their cruising altitudes; long vapor-trails crossing the sky behind them. sometimes, like \"this one\", they're still rather low in the sky (for some reason), so i wasn't all that impressed - at first. \r\n\r\nsomething drew my eyes back to these lights, however, and as i began to take my youngest, leashed lab from his \"peeing spot\" to his \"pooping spot\", i kept my eyes fixed on them and, considering their (assumed) altitude & the stillness of the morning, i was surprised i didn't hear anything. pondering that a bit, i paused: watching and listening closely. i had a mid-sized \"mag-lite\" with me (to be sure \"harley\" poops - which he doesn't always do!) and, just for fun, i pointed the flashlight at the lights and \"blinked\" it a few times, as i'd heard (or read) somewhere that \"real ufos\" sometimes \"respond\" in some way or manner. the lights didn't seem to change or acknowledge my light in any discernible way, so, taking my eyes from them for a moment, we made the 20 yard trek to the other \"potty place\".\r\n\r\nnow, i've had (and reported) a few ufo encounters before - one, pretty extraordinary - so, my gaze returned to the lights while harley looked for a place to \"do his business\". we'd only moved a short distance from where i'd originally noticed the lights, but it struck me immediately that they'd either stopped - or, slowed significantly - as they appeared to be in the same spot (or, even back a little!) as when we'd begun moving to where i now stood, watching. as an artist, i understand angles and perspective, very well, and am certain what i'm reporting is true. even if the lights hadn't stopped or slowed, they would have still appeared to have moved farther south, because i had moved parallel/opposite their direction of travel. they didn't.\r\n\r\nthinking back on it (again: this happened only a matter of minutes ago), when i first looked back at them, they truly appeared to have become stationary for a moment - or, even to have reversed their course somewhat. then, when i began looking closely again, though, they continued at their previous... almost leisurely speed - traveling along their original flight-path. and, although i could see them clearly (four, bright, yellowish/almost amber-colored lights with a bright-white strobe in the middle), and they were really quite low (not seeming to climb at all, throughout the sighting), plus, the fact that they \"must\" have been relatively close... it struck me that there was still_no_sound_whatsoever_. none. and i'd \"cupped\" my ears at both spots, too: straining to hear. yet, no sound emanated from the lights - nor, anything else in their general direction. only on our way back inside did a small airplane's sound become audible and i spotted it easily, in the western sky - far away, much higher up and in the opposite direction of the lights i'm describing.\r\n\r\nanother thing which strikes me as odd is that the four, yellowish lights did not change their position, relative to me. in other words, had they been, say, on the nose, tail and wing-tips, their positions and appearance in relation to me (and the strobe) would have changed as they passed from my left to my right. they did not. they remained perfectly spaced and the strobe remained in the center - giving them a rather bizarre and unnatural appearance as the lights traveled in a straight line, not an arc or curving path. i have no explanation.\r\n\r\nnow, i'm assuming they were low in the sky (they were about 40 degrees above the horizon), but i must concede that - given how clear the morning was and the fact the lights did not pass in front of/behind any clouds - it is entirely possible they were much higher and farther from me than i thought them to be. if that's true, however, the lights must have been enormous! thus, i believe my description of the size, altitude & distance from me to be accurate: 100'-300' in length (although, maybe longer as, with my arm extended, they spanned half the width of my thumb). i estimate their altitude to be around 3,000' and feel i viewed from about a mile's distance (at their closest). as they took more than three or four minutes to cross my limited field of view, i'd estimate their speed at around 200 mph, or so. they sure weren't going very fast and considering there is no airport within 30 miles (or more) in that direction, if they \"belonged\" to a large airplane, they should have accelerated and climbed - which they didn't - and again, i stress that there was no sound, at all. heck! if they belonged to a small airplane, they'd have been even closer to me - so, i certainly would have heard something!\r\n\r\nlastly, it occurred to me they might be a helicopter, but the relationship of the lights to each-other seem (to me) to discount that. although the (supposed) altitude and relatively low speed might correspond to some helicopter's flight characteristics, the color of the lights & their exactly symmetrical positions - and utter lack of sound (few helicopters can go that fast and they'd certainly have been audible) - eliminate the possibility of the lights representing a helicopter. i just don't buy it and am at a loss to explain the lights by assigning them to any aircraft i know of (and i know of more than a few).\r\n\r\ni'm sorry this wasn't particularly exciting, but i wanted to be sure to describe everything as it happened because it was pretty peculiar - at least, to me! also, i should mention that my dogs showed no sign of distress or excitement. they were as playful - and obstinate - as ever! as ever, ignorance is bliss, i guess!","distance":"501 Feet - 1
