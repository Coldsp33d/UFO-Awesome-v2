until just now. i was in my bedroom on the second floor, my bed faced the window. the window faced the back yard of my property which was full of tall trees and very woodsy. anyway all of a sudden i was awake for some reason, i had this really paranoid feeling like something was watching me. i lied in bed very still to see if the feeling would pass but it kept getting stronger. after a while of this, there we three flashes of light that came from my eye level (on the second floor) from one of the trees closest to my window. it was almost like someone was sitting in the tree taking pictures of my through my second story window, but the flashes were too large to be from a camera. i was terrified ( and just a kid) so i didn't really move but i watched that tree like a hawk until the morning and nobody and no thing ever came down out of it ( like how you would see tree branches move when somebody is climbing a tree, that never happened in fact the tree never moved at all). also there was absolute silence this entire time, cameras at that time would have made a very loud noise especially for a flash that large and bright .  i didn't ever really see an object i just saw those three flashes, so there was really no \"losing sight of the object.\" the next day, after staying up all night and being just a kid, i just chalked it up to some weird occurrence and i thought maybe my imagination was running wild because i was only like 12-13, i thought maybe i would get an explanation as time went on. but the older i got the more i realized that event was totally unexplainable and seriously disturbing.","distance":"20 Feet or

apartment for a cigarette. i noticed it was a cloudy night with very little could break. as i went to sit down on the patio chair i noticed a bright star to the sw of my location. i then though to myself it is a cloudy night and i shouldnt be seeing a star. now i live about 25 miles from pittsburgh international airport, so my second though was that it was headlights from a low flying airplane. i continued to observer the object and it was not a airplane. it was stationary and looked just like a star sitting there illuminating. after observing the ufo for about 10 minutes i herd a helicopter coming from the ne. it was dark out so as the helicopter passed over heading in the direction of the ufo i could not see the color of the helicopter. as i turned my attention back to the ufo it disappeared right before my eyes. just like someone flipped a switch on a light (gone). at this point i knew what i had seen was a ufo. since this sighting i was curious if anyone else in the area had seen the same ufo. i researched the internet and found that someone on youtube has been recording the same star like ufo. the youtube posters location is sw of my location the same direction i observed the ufo on 12/23. i am certain the ufo video he has recorded from 12/22/2013 was what i seen on 12/23/2013 in the video it looks like a airplane at first but then it stops hovers and then brightens then disappears. this video was not recorded by me but the poster lives 13 miles from my location. poster has a lot of ufo footage from this area for this month. i will also be working on

the sky was very clear and i was looking up at the stars when i noticed a light back over my shoulder.  it was maybe four times bigger than jupiter or venus in the sky.  my first thought was that it was an airplane, but it was moving way too fast.  i called my wife's attention to it and she saw it too.  it was difficult to estimate the altitude, but i would guess it was somewhat lower than where the airliner's fly, but it was moving so fast i kept thinking it was must have been lower to move across the sky like that.  the light was a pale yellow, almost white and it had an irregularity to the way the light looked.  the edges looked indistinct.  it wasn't pulsating, just irregular.  i made an effort to see if there were any blinking lights as they are required on aircraft and there were none.  the whole observation lasted about 7 seconds and then it was gone behind some trees.  from my viewpoint, it covered a 90 degree arc across the sky.\r\n\r\ni would guess it was going 3 to 4 times faster than a airliner, 1500mi/hr or so.\r\n\r\ni then started trying to figure out what it was or wasn't:\r\n1) meteor - no trail, no sparks and flew level, it wasn't coming down.  also too slow for a meteor.\r\n2) plane - too fast and no blinking lights.  perhaps a jet fighter flying low could have appeared to go that fast, but it would have made a lot of noise and this made none.  and i've never seen a plane put out that kind of light.\r\n3)and it wasn't santa or rudolf!  reindeer can fly that fast!  truly, i did think of that in the moment, but this is no joke, this

sun (west).  i looked up at the sky after i turned the garden hose off and noticed a star directly up and ahead.  no other stars were out yet, so i wondered if it was a very high plane glinting with sunlight.  but it really looked like a star, or possibly venus, though i had never seen venus at that location in the sky before. something about it just seemed odd, unusual, and i wanted to look at it with binoculars. i like to watch airplanes, stars, and meteor showers but i usually only use my binoculars to observe birds. i watched it for several minutes, and realized it wasn't moving.  the feeling that it was odd remained. i do not normally have this feeling about stars.  i decided to get binoculars and then come back to my same position to see if it had moved.  i marked my position on the stepping stone i was standing on, and made an estimated 'triangulation' between where the star was and the line of my roof and the gutter.  i then noticed a small plane leaving a vapor trail flying low overhead, from where i was still standing.  i walked around the side of my house and indoors to get my binoculars. this must have taken only about 10-15 seconds.  the vapor-trail plane had advanced considerably and i watched it from near my patio door as it receded towards the hills (east). this probably took about another 15-20 seconds.\r\n\r\n i then walked back down the side of the house to the hose faucet. glancing up, i saw the star still there.  i observed my position and guessed that it hadn't moved at all, and if it had, it was a nearly imperceptible movement.  at this point i no longer thought it was a plane, and thought it was perhaps too low to be a satellite.  there were still no other stars out that i could see.  i looked at it with binoculars, but it was difficult to get a lot of detail.  it was shining with a whitish-silver light, and i could see a general form to it- it was round and a clump-shape, rather than an elongated one.   i could not see anything that suggested wings like an airplane.  it also shimmered, similar to the way an oasis does. because there was a shape to it rather than just light, i now had the impression that i was looking at some kind of object.  i tried to refocus the binoculars and glanced away for a second to ensure that i was still seeing it at the same point in the sky (i was). as i looked at it without binoculars, the light seemed to 'go out', and the object appeared as a dull gray point, as if darkened.  i immediately brought the binoculars up to my face, but i couldn't find it. i put the binoculars down again and scanned the sky, but i couldn't find it at all.  this was confusing because i had a good patch of sky visible and it seemed to literally have just vanished.  i changed my position, moved several times, and turned to face the other way in case it was visible from another angle.  the sky was still quite light out and airplanes were visible here and there (but still no other stars).  the star/object was gone.  this entire episode lasted roughly 5- 7 minutes or so.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,

was a clear night, so i wanted to do a little star-gazing at the bus stop. you know how one shades the eyes on a sunny day to get a better look at something? well, i did something similar with my forearm and hand to block out a bit of street light. i identified orion in the south riding high and the pleiades was to the northwest. mildly satisfied with the view, i dropped my arm and looked to my left and saw there was another person waiting for the bus, too. i went back to my stargazing, but that's when i saw the brilliant yellowish light alternating to reddish-orange coming from the south at what seemed to be fairly low altitude. i said to the other person as i pointed at the object, \"look, look! what's that?!\" i had the presence of mind to take a 14 second video clip. all the while, the other witness and i debated what it could be: not an airplane or helocopter, not a metorite or cometary fragment, or any other space debris. there was no terrestrial running lights and no ionization trail. i suspected it was a ufo as soon as i saw it. the object didn't fly like anything i'd ever seen. i call it zipping along, the abrupt changing of directions. when i saw it, i had a mixture of fear and excitement because i actually saw something that i couldn't explain in the sky. i think about the event everyday, wondering what it was. i do not believe in ufo's because i've seen one!\r\nlost sight of the object because it either zipped away at an incredible speed or it vanished. vanished more like it because it tended to dim to almost invisible at one point. i want to know more about what i witnessed. my outlook has changed quite alot since that night: not much bothers me anymore after witnessing a ufo. although, sometimes now i feel a lot of anxiety when i go outside and i'm constantly watching the sky.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It happened many years ago when i was about 10 or 11 years old. it was nice whether. i went to my friends house. we all went outside to ride our bikes. this was a populated neighborhood with flat streets in tarzana ca. for riding bikes and not much car traffic. there was a long driveway with a graduated slant up, that we could all get our bikes up to the top and then turn around to ride down with some speed and when you get to the bottom where the drivway meets the street you have to go right or left so we always went right and raced each other down the driveway then right down the street back to her house..Just a normal playing on an average day, nothing was different until i decided to go up the driveway one more time by myself for one more ride, as soon as i got to the top i noticed what i thought was kid riding a bike from the main part of the property that was wooded, seemed broken down and deshoveled, you could not see in the area that he came from, like outta nowhere, so i stood there while he rode over to me, believe it or not he was on a boys bike with a sissy bar even, he was dressed in a red penalton shirt with jeans,i noticed he was not very well versed and very shaky on the bike and noticed he had very thin long feet, but as he got closer i saw his head size was hugh, his, what would be eyes were very large and black almond shaped taking up most of his face and up to his forhead, the whole face was like almond shaped. i cant remember a mouth or a nose or even ears, it was grayish white head and face, funny i do remember a hairline type black in color but not hair it was like smooth flush to the face and head, he had a very small frame extremly thin, but then when i looked at this fingers on the handlebars they were very long and thin and distorted not like ours even the hand part from the wrist was very elongated and were the same color as his head. the clothes he had on covered everything except his head and his hands the next thing you know he was face to face with me looking right at me and never looked away, never blinked and had a deadpan look while staring at me. i remember my thougts flooding in to make sence of what i was seeing yet the weird phsysical deformations were not like anything i had ever seen before,then i remember i was frozen, where i stood stradeling my bike, the reason i remember this is because i wanted to flee when i was terrified (kinda like when someone jumps out to scare you) that knee jurk reaction but absoultly i could not move or speak or even make a sound. then next thing i know i was able to break away, i jumped on my bike terrified rode as fast as i could back to my friends house where to my dismay all the kids were in house eating with the tv on and laying around the couch etc... i busted in the door wondering what everyone was doing in the house and eating and stuff we were just outside what happened to everyone, and did they see the freak boy. everyone looked at me like i was crazy and to quit trying to scare them. they all looked at me like i was crazy and said they all thought i went home because they did not see me and that they had been in the house for a long time and were tired of playing, i remeber i could not believe it i was very confused and i do remember feeling sorta like the odd man out all the sudden like i had done something wrong, so i left and rode my bike home, then i had to ride past that driveway and was so terrified i could barley compose myself to get home. that driveway has burned in my memory to this day i can barley drive by it i shutter everytime i go by it as an adult!\r\nthe only other thing i have ever happened to me is one night in the wee hous of driving back to la about 8 years ago in the desert in victorville i was the only one on the road when outta the blue in my rear view blinding bright lights white, red and blue caught my eyes speeding super fast and swooping down on the back of my car, i almost crashed trying to get outta the way, cause at first i thought it was the cops cause i was speeding but it all happened so fast and the lights covered a hugh area, there was no sound. i had no idea what the hell was happening, then that fast they were gone. it freaked me out cause there was no one there, gone as fast as it came.

as it was a beautiful, clear night. i live in a rural farming area in ohio. i noticed what appeared to be a star towards the west approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. upon further observation there was something funny about this \"star\" because for one, it was fairly low on the horizon and two, it seemed to be \"twinkling\" more aggressively than your average star. a few moments later i noticed that it was moving so my initial thought was that it was a plane. however, as this though was quickly discredited as the object began to move in the opposite direction from where it first moved. as i gazed at the object i was astonished to see it bob, weave, and zig-zag very slowly in random directions. the motion of the object was very fluid and smooth, a lot like a fishing bobber floating in rippling water. i was astounded by this object because i look at the stars every night and i have never seen anything as bizarre as this. i was so fixated on this object and the way it smoothly maneuvered, that it had me in sort of a trance-like state, comparative to gazing into a fire at night. this object hovered in the same general area in the sky, like it had it's own section to dance in. throughout the entire sighting this object would slowly change in brightness. like a stove that gradually gets warm, the object would slowly get bright, then slowly get dim, almost to the point where you couldn't see it, only to gradually get brighter again. the brightening and dimming was seemingly random and not timed. about a half hour into the sighting the object moved left out of my view behind a tree, so i moved to the right where i could see it. as soon as i got a good view of it again, another star-like object appeared to drop out of the other one, hover below it for a few seconds, and then dim out to nothing. after this occurred the object returned to its original designated position in the sky. i was so perplexed and fixated on this object that when i finally broke sight with it i realized that there were approximately 10 other star-like objects towards the west, making the same maneuvers, all relatively low on the horizon (between 25 and 60 degrees), and all bobbing around without moving too far away from where they started. i watched these objects until heavy cloud cover blocked them from my sight around 3:30 in the morning. \r\n\r\non christmas day when i returned home from family festivities at around 7:00 pm, i got out of my car and looked back in the general area of my sighting the previous morning. it was much cloudier and i wasn't expecting to see anything but to my amazement i see one of the objects again towards the west but a bit lower, just above the horizon, making the exact same movements. i only saw one object on the 25th but it was there, bobbing and weaving, until i went to bed around 10 (i didn't get much sleep the night before because of these things). i felt compelled to submit this review tonight because this is an ongoing sighting and as i type, there is one light still bobbing around towards the west in the same general area it was in the night before on christmas day. approximately 4 hours ago around 8:00 pm on the 26th, i went outside to look at the light again and there was another one next to it. i watched the other one for a couple seconds until it did something i never saw any of the other lights do. it took off towards the south very fast and out of view. i was astonished by what i saw. \r\n\r\na couple of interesting things that i wanted to point out in conclusion. i know this may sound crazy but the first light that i observed on the 24th seemed to be aware of me viewing it. i found it rather bizarre how it went behind the tree, away from my view, only to spawn the other one that disappeared within seconds. and whenever i moved to the left so the object would just barely be hidden behind the tree from my view, sometimes it seemed to move to the right, back into my view in a sort of \"i still see you\" like fashion. this could all, however, be a coincidence with it's random movements. another thing i noticed on the 24th, is that my dog was whimpering on and off for about an hour through the first sighting. he barks a lot but rarely whimpers and i found that a bit odd. the last thing that i wanted to point out is that these objects made me feel a little uncomfortable and there was something a bit sinister about them. i am completely perplexed by what i have been seeing the past three nights and cannot think of a logical explanation for it.

 my brain first thought \"meteorite\" but as i continued to watch i quickly dismissed the \"meteorite\" theory because the ufo's size, shape, and color were totally inconsistent with all of the meteorites that i've evern seen during my nearly 54 years on this planet.\r\n\r\nthe ufo had a whitish-orange glow, but solid with no tail, it appeared to be at least three to four times larger than the usual meteorite, and the ufo appeared to be disc or oval shaped.\r\n\r\nby this point, my mind definitely had switched to the \"extraterrestrial vehicle\" hypothesis and as i really began to focus my consciousness on the object the ufo suddenly blinked out and disappeared from view, leaving me with the impression that the e.T. pilots telepathically \"knew\" that they were under surveillance by someone on the ground.\r\n\r\ni immediately checked my cell phone for the time (6:14 p.M. est) and took mental note of the direction, distance (1-2 miles away) altitude (300-400 feet), and heading of the ufo that i had just seen.  then rather than going directly into my house i opted to stand in the street for another couple of more minutes scanning the heavens in hopes of getting another glimpse of an e.T. craft.\r\n\r\nnote:  i have noticed how other independent eyewitnesses in the greater richmond area have submitted at least four other ufo reports to mufon this month, including a report where someone videoed a large glowing ufo sphere (orb) that was hovering and maneuvering silently over pocahontas state park on dec. 2, 2013 (mufon case 52571).  furthermore, a friend of mine who lives in a community behind the park had a helicopter hovering and flying low over his house and neighborhood (very unusual) in the same general time frame.  in addition, another friend of mine in the same county photographed several heavily-armed ah-64 apache attack helicopters flying in battle formation extremely low over a nearby church, and the choppers were coming from the direction of pocahontas state park and heading northwest toward the city of richmond.  the apaches were seen at 6:02 p.M. during rush hour on a friday.  these choppers were very unusual for this area and we believe they may have been hunting or monitoring ufos.  last but not least and for the record, the national ufo reporting center (nuforc) has been inundated recently with an historically high number of ufo reports with many witnesses across the u.S. and canada reporting silent orange ufo spheres and orbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":52971,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.55330888889518,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12262013-0019","longitude":-77.5295974931062,"occurred":1388110440000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,   Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1388117898000,"summary":"Silent glowing orange/white ufo disc/oval seen descending at extremely-high speed over richmond, va the night after christmas ","tags":["ufo","disc"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"23225","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Richmond, Virginia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:214307"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Bucyrus","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Rapid descent of triangle shaped object.   leaving a trail of green and then red til it appeared to land at a distance.   zero sound.   initially appeared to be a meteor or similar, due to the advanced speed of the objects descent.\r\n\r\ni was on a farm, doing evening chores.   in looking up at the motion and color, i followed the path.   time it took was under 30 seconds.   i lost sight of the object when it appeared to land as it disappeared under tree lines.   it is presumed the object would have been 4 to 5 miles north of my location.\r\n\r\nnothing i have seen in aircraft moves at the speed that this object moved.
