s.W. sky that seemed to defy logic. the wind was blowing hard in a few different directions as it had appeared in the layers of clouds, but this one cloud that stood out to be different to me had not moved in an hour or more. the sun was begining to set in the s.W. and as it shined it back lit this clud i a srange way . there was a cresent of reflected light within the cloud that i had not seen before i had  onsidered this odd. i had started to video tape the cloudbecause we had noticed a strsnge white orb that was movng on the far right hand side of the cloud. we had noticed that the white orb was not the only thing up near this cloud , there was also an airplane that had been orbiting in a pattern on the far left side of the cloud. from my perspective it looked like the orb was hiding from the black orbiting plane. the orb moved from the top of the cloud did an s- like manover snd headed into a dark spot within the cloud and the orb disspeared . it was no longer visable and the eminating light from the orb was no longer visable. it sermed like a rare coinsidence that the experience we were having was all so familliar to the one we had a year before. in that case we had seen a pop can shaped cylinder in the sky we were baffled as to what it was, and as we were watching the actions of object it had vanished, within 5 seconds wete observed a cf-18 climb in the sky to very much the last seen proximity of the object where the fighter jet had then banked hard to the right and faded out of view.","distance":"Over One

porque somos aficionados a la astronomía y de pasó pasar unas mini vacaciones con nuestros tres hijos que estudian en buenos aires en un lugar tranquilo y respetando el medio ambiente.\r\néramos 5 adultos y como a la medianoche de ayer 19/10/17 empezamos a escuchar un rumor apagado como un ronroneo lejano pero insistente, al principios no vimos nada raro pero el rumor siguió por casi 1 hora.\r\ndespués de ese tiempo vimos una iluminación color azul eléctrico hacia el oeste como si alguien alumbra el cielo con un reflector que salía de un pequeño valle como a unos 500 metros, decidimos ir a ver de qué se trataba pensando que podía ser un sitio de extracción de petróleo.\r\nfuimos los 5 pero antes de llegar al borde de la hondonada como a los 200 metros se elevó un helicóptero grande de color gris muy claro o blanco y sin luces, que quedó sobre la luz iluminado desde abajo.\r\nentonces nos paramos donde estábamos y nos pusimos a mirar con los binoculares con los que observamos las estrellas, el helicóptero no tenía marcas y prácticamente no hacía ruido, el rumor o ronroneo venía de abajo de la hondonada.\r\nen un instante apareció a lo lejos como a unos 80 metros de nosotros una figura saliendo de la hondonada y viniendo para nosotros,era alta y pensamos que era una persona primero, pero mirando con mas detalle con los binoculares vimos que parecía no tener manos ni pies y que estaba como flotando sobre el piso.\r\ntenía la cabeza separada del cuerpo por un cuello fino y largo y en este tenía como un objeto a modo de collar oscuro con una luz que giraba a su alrededor.\r\nsacamos varias fotos con el adaptador del celular (de 40 megapixel) para los binoculares mientras esto pasaba.\r\nnos asustamos mucho y mas cuando esa criatura levantó uno de sus brazos que parecían terminar en muñones sin manos hacia donde estábamos nosotros.\r\nentonces comenzamos a correr como locos para donde teníamos el camping sin mirar atrás, cuando llegamos levantamos todo como pudimos y lo tiramos adentro de la camioneta y salimos a toda velocidad para nuestra casa.\r\nno sabemos qué era todo eso pero unos amigos nos recomendaron a alguien en río gallegos que estudia estos temas, les vamos a llevar las fotos en persona después de las elecciones del domingo 22.\r\n","distance":"101-500

(the site has since been removed and replaced, and is now a location of condos and townhouses. the original building is gone.)\r\n\r\nit was my habit of taking a nap during my shift after having made my rounds. at the time, i was also being treated for a (still undiagnosed) heart condition.\r\n\r\nwhat i recount next is how i told the story to friends for years, since its from the point of view of which i experienced it. i have since come to believe that something slightly different happened - namely that i may have been abducted. (or 'retrieved', as i prefer to put it.)\r\n\r\nanyway, i was asleep, when suddenly i felt an abrupt thump in my chest. i thought that my heart had stopped, and i had died.\r\n\r\nmy immediate reaction was to attempt to leave my body, and i almost did. my spirit exited my dead (?) body, and i was slowly rising up away from it, into and thru the wooden ceiling above me.\r\n\r\nduring the transition, i somehow got stranded in the matter of the wooden ceiling, and got stuck.\r\n\r\nsuddenly, three entities appeared to me, took me by the hand, and gently guided me back into my body, which had already grown cold. it felt very heavy, and very cumbersome to be pushed back inside it.\r\n\r\nthe entities were very gentle with me, and seemed to be proud of me. our communication was not verbal, or even mental, per se, but was more emotional. (i am extremely empathic and psychic.)\r\n\r\nafter making sure i was back inside my own body, they departed, but there was no ship to speak of, just a gentle light.\r\n\r\none other thing: the perception that lingered after their departure was that they were actually me as a man, a boy, and a child with cold hands.(the entity who guided me back into my body had cold hands.)\r\n\r\nseveral years after the event, i changed my mind of what may have occurred. i now think that instead of dying, i was accidentally awakened during the aftermath of an abduction event. (or i woke up by force, i have often awakened during surgical procedures and fought with doctors who had already anesthetized me.)\r\n\r\nprevious to that occurrence, i had had (and continue to have) similar types of events, basically all my life.","distance":"N/A","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":87476,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.83555401551274,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10202017-0014","longitude":-87.63931493340341,"occurred":734498100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1508525993000,"summary":"Physical encounter","tags":["abduction","light","entity"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":1509288749332,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":true,"hail":false,"maxtempm":11,"maxtempi":52,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":8,"meantempi":46,"meanvism":13,"meanvisi":8,"mintempm":2,"mintempi":36,"minvism":8,"minvisi":5,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":true,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":true,"hail":false,"maxtempm":11,"maxtempi":52,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":8,"meantempi":46,"meanvism":13,"meanvisi":8,"mintempm":2,"mintempi":36,"minvism":8,"minvisi":5,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":true,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"60616","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":8958,"locationName":"Chicago, Illinois","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:14317"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Texarkana","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was sitting out by the fire when a strange feeling came over me. i got my phone and started snapping pics as the craft was hovering over me. it made my fire go crazy, it looked like something ejected from the craft, then bbegin to take form through the fire somehow. two days later there was a beautiful rock of all colors , glass like fragments all fused together somehow , in my driveway. i guess it was a gift. they are not scary, inviting actually.

cruz, había salido antes de la medianoche y estaba llegando a la zona del paraje coy aike, que no es una ciudad sino que su nombre se lo da una estancia cercana que ha tomado el nombre de la tradición tehuelche indígena del lugar.\r\neste paraje está a unos 80 km antes de llegar a río gallegos sobre la ruta nacional 3, era de madrugada, estaba oscuro y había poco y nada de tránsito en la ruta, yo viajaba en una suv 4x4, bien dormido y atento al camino por el que circulaba a unos 100 km/h.\r\nen un momento después de la bajada del río coig o coyle veo a lo lejos unas luces sobre la ruta, muy tenues pero lejanas, y a medida que me acercaba se veían al ras de piso, pasé el puente y comencé a tomar la subida cuando de repente veo en el medio de la ruta a menos de 150 metros dos figuras como difusas que no estaban tocando el piso.\r\nlo primero que se me ocurrió es que se trataba de animales sueltos por lo que instintivamente aceleré el vehículo a mas de 180 km/h, cualquiera sabe que es la única forma en la que uno puede salir ileso del choque con ganado.\r\nme aferré al volante y llegue al instante, cuando estaba por golpearlas las luces del vehículo mostraron dos seres o algo así de cuello largo y brazos que parecían desaparecer entes de llegar a las manos, un torso largo y piernas que también parecían desaparecer antes de llegar al piso.\r\ntenían un rostro nada parecido al humano y en la parte baja del cuello una especie de collar como negro muy oscuro.\r\npensé en frenar pero venía muy rápido y sabia que si lo hacía iba a volcar, por lo que solo esperé el impacto, pero el vehículo atravesó a las 2 entidades como si no estuvieran ahí; esto pasó antes de terminar la subida justa en el lugar donde hay unas lomadas, después la ruta da vuelta a la derecha, miré por el espejo y las figuras, fantasmas o entidades seguían ahí en el mismo lugar al medio de la ruta.\r\nseguí algunos metros y paré en la banquina, esperé un par de minutos y me bajé del vehículo llevando el spray de pimienta en la mano, la suv no tenía ni un rasguño, caminé hacia atrás pasando la curva y ya no había nada.\r\nvolví al vehículo y me quedé ahí unos minutos, me tomé unos mates para tranquilizarme y luego seguí camino.\r\nhice unos 10 km hacia el sur y cuando estaba transitando la subida a la que llaman \"subida larga\", un helicóptero blanco atravesó la ruta de este a oeste muy bajo por sobre el camino, sentí solo un rumor y me pareció raro porque estaba muy cerca, eso me asustó un poco así que apresuré la marcha para llegar a río gallegos.\r\nen el puesto de guer aike, 30 km antes de llegar a río gallegos me preguntaron de donde venía y si había visto algo raro en la ruta, les dije que solo un helicóptero, nadie me iba a creer lo de las entidades que vi y mucho menos que las atravesé con la suv.\r\n","distance":"N/A","duration":"00:11:00","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":87471,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-51.1500015,"location":null,"logNumber":"AR-10202017-0010","longitude":-69.5,"occurred":1508469780000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Santa

come up, move around a bit, then go out like a light. i sat and watched 13 come up one after the other. there's no doubt in my mind it is a ufo. it is guaranteed you will see them if you come. i've

pulled over to observe them.  the 3 lights were lighting up randomly, in triangle, orion's belt shapes, lighting up, bam, 1,2,3.   then go out.  triangle would even spin, orions belt would show up, vertically,  then disappear, then show up in horizontal configuration.  then i noticed an 'orb' appear to come up from the ground, or from far on the horizon, it traveled and joined the other 3 orbs pretty quickly.  then a few minutes later, a 2nd one came from where the other one did, it joined the other 4, now there are 5 in the sky.  it looked like, if you ever looked at jupiter through a telescope, one brighter one representing a planet, and the others were dimmer and orbiting it like moons.  they made random formations, and lights came on squentially for at least 25 minutes.  i phoned my mother, and narrated to her what i was seeing.  begging her to get in her car and look.  as i was on the phone with her, a 'plane' came from directly south, and flew, directly over my position,  the plane had 2 stacked 'rings' of lights on it.  only about 500'to 1000' high,  it flew directly over me, and flew directly at the 'main' light.  by this time, the 'orbs' had spread out in the sky, along the horizion, maybe a couple miles apart, and maybe only a few miles from me.   the plane flew to each \"orb\" individually.  now i can see the 5 orbs, and the one plane clearly.  after the orbs spread out miles apart, they came back together in a small group, and spread out again, several times. what i saw in the sky was better than every video ive ever watched, that shows similar lights.  this was the night/day of the 8.5 inches of rain, wind was pretty stiff, the objects were not affected by the wind at all. about 820, the rain had broke, and another storm was on its way,  the objects were between the 2 heavy rain pockets. as i drove from south of sheridan, il to north of plano,il, i could see the 5 orbs and the plane the whole time, it never appeared that i got any closer to the 'orbs' though, even after driving 20 miles closer.  i fianlly lost sight of the orbs and plane, north of plano, where the rain got to heavy, and they just went out of sight. i checked my original position on google earth, and it looks like when the orbs were spread out, one was over, millington, millbrook, plano, sandwich, and sheridan. it took the plane a little bit to travel to each 'orb'.    945pm,  my mother calls me, she has my niece and nephew in the car by wspy tower.  they see the lights in the sky, making triangle formations, and different colors.  they all saw it too!!!!!.  it was real.  if i wasnt on the phone, i would have had the most amazing footage ever taken.  it was real,  i am amazed by what i saw.  now i believe that the most other videos on the net, are authentic.   the lights on the video show up as white, but they are not really white to the eye.  it was about 10pm or a little after, when i lost sight of the objects.  \r\n\r\n\r\nthe attached video is towards the beginning of the sighting.   it needs some enhancement with the lighting, there is more than meets the eye on the video,  the video is before the plane comes along.   i didnt film more because i thought it wasnt going to show up on the video, so i made the call to my mom, desperate for another witness. i would be very interested to see the video enhanced if you guys can do it.   one photo is where i first saw the thing, daylight photo.     the google earth image is where i was parked, with the area of action in red.   thank you\r\n\r\nchris  ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

than a mile off the beach, parked in the north american aviation parking lot observing the stars. earlier it had rained and washed the smog away revealing an incredible sky seldom seen in southern california in the 1960-1970s. it was probably april or may 1973.\r\n  i observed to the northwest at an unknown but very high altitude what initially appeared to be a shooting star rapidly approaching my location. at that time it appeared to be bright white. it rapidly slowed, then came to a stop, probably above 75,000 feet. this only took a few seconds. next, it began to descend at a moderate rate of speed, straight down, coming to a hover less than 500 feet from me. color was dark gray, then began to pulse the same three colors in the same order. it was only a few feet above the munition bunkers at the seal beach naval weapon station. it remained stationary for perhaps ten minutes while i observed it through my 10x50 binoculars--it was so close and so large that i had to turn right and left to take in the rather large space vehicle. i noticed the navy security vehicles keeping a respectable distance from the vehicle. i later determined that the main gate had been closed while the incident was in progress. \r\n   the vehicle did not project light, it merely changed colors. after about 10 minutes it appeared to set up a search pattern over the munition bunkers, very slowly traveling over each row. then it gradually increased speed and appeared to follow power lines toward the ocean.\r\n   i asked dispatch to check with huntington beach and see if its helicopter could assist. i did not reveal over the radio what circumstances lead to this request.  4210 henry (helicopter) was down for the night.  i attempted to follow the space vehicle but lost it as it entered huntington beach city limits.\r\n   i logged the incident and turned the log in at end of shift. the watch commander called me in and i gave him a brief explanation. he did not want me to do an incident report, which would have triggered an entry in the department daily log that was read by journalists on a daily basis.\r\n  weeks earlier 2 lapd officers on graveyard shift observed a space vehicle up close and personal.  they alerted the media which brought in air force investigators which rapidly led to the usual inane nonsense whenever turning back a ufo sighting. so i elected to avoid the nonsense.\r\n   weeks later the orange county register put out an afternoon edition that had a large photo of \"my\" space ship. no article but several lines of print under the photo revealing that a company photographer took the picture of the space ship hovering over power lines just off an orange county freeway--i believe it was the newport beach freeway. traffic had come to a stop, meaning that at least hundreds witnessed, up close, this hovering space vehicle and thousands more observed the photo, page one above the fold.\r\n  many years later, after medically retiring and becoming a journalist a researcher was sent to orange county and spent days going through the o.C. register files.  the space ship photo was not located.\r\n ","distance":"101-500
