(mclane/western ufo sighting if you google it) what i saw was what the other guys saw in the past only the ufo was closer when they saw it last year. they told me they always see stuff that makes them take a second look out there at night. \r\n\r\nthis was my 3rd ufo sighting in my lifetime (28 yrs), 2nd in colorado. 1st was when i was a kid one was 50 foot above our car in nj and my mother forbids our family from talking about it ever and still does, 2nd was about 2 years ago husband and i saw a brown cigar one over the mountains doing zigzag lines than it took off, and now this one when i was alone. i was always semi curious about ufos all my life because of the event that happened when i was a kid and because my uncle used to talk about being abducted but after this sighting i am full on interested and i am unafraid of them and i want to know more.","distance":"Over One

on a unique experimental solar project so i visit the area frequently.  the last time i went at date above had my buddy bill with me and no dogs this time.\r\n\r\ni look for abnormal things wherever i am but particularly so in desert environments because i believe alien cultures visit these areas most frequently due to the lower risk of being observed or chased/captured.\r\n\r\nthe first time any of is saw the lights was a cold night in october this year.  my friend wendy wanted to walk her dogs and i wanted to go to so we went together with the dogs.  we walked from her house north up dennis st then went west on kay st a half block and cut between the houses parallel to the alleyway north to el mirage rd then went west a hundred feet or so then turned north on muskrat ave which is a dirt road here as any \"roads\" are in the area north of el mirage rd or kay st.\r\n\r\nwe were maybe a half mile or so north of the development tract to the south when i looked straight ahead and noticed the lights of many colors dancing across the horizon at what appears to be the foot of hills to the north and then also observed them cross crossing each other in ways with medium speed and no inertia about face maneuvers and evens loop-de-loops starting from what appeared to be ground level.\r\n\r\nlike i said i have seen these lights out here after dark at varying times between after sunset and midnight four of the last five times i have been out there.  they are clearly not cars in the desert because no car could instantaneously change direction like these do particularly on sand.   sometimes the lights look hazy or indistinct like the glow from a cheap led flashlight with multiple leds.  this is when it looks like they are coming at us and going away from is for the most part.  sometimes they look clearly distinct and that is only at a distance from us if our senses are not being fooled.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

around 1990 in a chevy sprint. we had some short range hand-held radios in each of maybe 4 or 5 cars so we wouldn't get separated in los angeles. it was about 2am. we got off freeway 99 out at ave 12 (southern outskirts of madera)and turned left going back over the freeway facing west to take the first guy home when some girls in one of the other cars went nuts on the radio talking about a ufo. i was dozing off in the front passenger seat. the driver and the guy sitting behind me were wide awake. the other guy was completely asleep for this entire experience. when the girls started yelling about the ufo i started to wake up. as we came down off the overpass the driver slowed down as he looked at the object. firstly, i have to say that all i ever saw was a light. my eyes were blurry from sleep. the other 2 guys, who were not prone to exaggeration at all, said that they saw a saucer shape with a rectangular window and 3 or 4 humanoid shapes in the window. again, i just saw a light and it was about 1000 ft away and 1000 ft up. when i first saw it, it was moving very slowly from south to north (my left to right). then it stopped still. all at once, our car's engine and lights shut off. so did the car's stereo and the hand-held radio. the driver just said, \"wow!\" or \"wo!\" or something like that. i asked him what happened, but he just shook his head and said he didn't do it. then the object/light in the sky shot from it's position to about 1000 ft or so to the right (north) and stopped dead still again. it didn't accelerate. it just went from 0 to full speed in an instant then stopped dead still again without slowing down. it stayed there for a second or two then it shot up again, but this time at about a 45 degree angle up and away from us into or through the atmosphere and looked like it shot right into space. basically, when it left it looked like a shooting star going the wrong way. at the same time, the car's lights and the radios both came back on. the driver just put the sprint back in neutral and pushed the clutch in and started the engine back up. the guy that was sleeping was the one we dropped off first and he never even woke up until we were letting him out. i got dropped off 2nd and i ran to my door and almost dropped my keys trying to get inside because i was shaking so badly. now that i'm older i don't believe it was little green men. i'm sure there is some form of life out there somewhere, but i think the military was having fun with us or testing something that night. the only thing that isn't easily explainable is the thing's movements. i often wonder if all i was seeing was some kind of light or projection. it just moved too fast to be believable. what happened to the car was real enough, though. i just wish i had been completely awake and my eyes had been 100%.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),  Unknown","flightPath":"Path then

(exact address omitted).  i was looking southwest.  there was a bright orangish red light almost hovering; but moving toward me.  at an arms length, maybe 2 to 4 fingers above the house roof across and one house south of me.  after watching it 30 seconds or so, two slightly bluish white teardrop spheres of light fell from the orangish red light straight down.  they seemed to be going faster than if they were just falling.  they were not beams; but lighted objects or spheres of light.  these bluish white lights were a color i can not describe accurately; but laser-like would be the closest description.  not only laser-like, but even more vibrant than laser-like.  this light seemed like it had depth or maybe partially transparent; but brilliant.  i have never seen anything like them.  they were not round orbs, teardrop or at least much longer than they were wide in shape.  again, they did not seem the fall; but were propelled downward.   they were not lite all the way down, but winked out before they went below the roof top southwest of me.  anyway, i was excited, to say the least.  the orangish red light then turned in a quick motion and was heading almost away from me, slowly. it started to fade first, and then pulsed on and off and then was gone. it didn't seem to dart away fast; but seemed to wink out.  this was now about 1 minute from when i first saw it.  then 4 minutes later, the orangish red light appeared again.  this time it was slightly further away but moving quickly towards me again.  when it got to about the same place the bluish white lights had ejected from it; it even got a little brighter.  it again, arced away, or turned 180 degrees and quickly went away, or faded out as it moved away.  i was never scared, but i sure have been wide awake and have been thinking about it for the last 6 hours.  i keep thinking about those bluish white lights.  they were such a unique shape and brilliance.  i was only able to fill out this form when i got back to san diego.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":52939,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.762830807799126,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12252013-0009","longitude":-118.03919378737346,"occurred":1387952100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,   Teardrop","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1387986497000,"summary":"Slowly moving orangish red light ejects two bluish white teardrop lights in garden grove","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Garden Grove, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:214999"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Houston","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At approximately 1:40/45 in the morning i was sitting in my truck in a parking lot talking with a friend. he pointed out the driver window and said \"what is that?\" i looked and saw 5-6 small red/orange lights flying in the air. my first thought was reflection on my window so i rolled it down but that wasn't it. we got out and watched as they flew in a loose formation. the lights appeared to flicker slightly not flash or remain constant as aircraft. there was no noise at all. i was watching the brightest one in the back when my friend said the front ones just faded away. a few seconds later the last one faded away as well. there were clouds and they did appear to fade into the clouds but there was no visible light behind the clouds. approximately 10-12 min later i saw the lights reappear again with no noise. again they were in a loose formation and again faded away. they were not simply floating randomly but were directed somehow. there were fewer the second time. video was taken with iphone 5s.

9:15 typical bedtime for me. i was thinking about what room to sleep, the guest or masters. then... \r\n\r\ni woke up on my back, face to ceiling and head facing door, the door rug in front of my head halfway pushed up the door. puzzling, since the rug has non-slip bottom i was about 2 feet away from the door, and my feet were facing other direction, and my back hurt severely. but my head and rest of body felt perfect (having arthritis) was not something i have felt in a long time. almost euphoric.  \r\n\r\ni stood up and went to the bathroom and looked into the mirror and them turned around and looked at my back. there was a large round circle in the center of my back. almost the exact size of dinty more can, or some other can of food. i walked into the kitchen and examined the entire scene, no cans were moved, fell off but still stacked in a pyramid. then i noticed the rug was not only half up the door, but it was upside down and this was very odd. i had swept the floor when i entered the cabin, shook the rug out in and placed it right side up, black rubber bottom and polyester top.\r\nhow can i slip and fall, with my head, feet 8 feet away and angled out of the room? nasty red circle in my back that i cannot reach. i later showed several others the next weekend. that is how long this was there. it did not bruise at all, slowly faded away. \r\n\r\ni have never had any black outs, seizures. so i continued with the rest of the days there. when i got home, i began to have issues with memory, for example, names, places, dates. this affected me as i was a grad student. since this incident, i now struggle with concentration issues starting exactly when this happened.
