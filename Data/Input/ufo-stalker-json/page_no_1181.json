inside. i then decided to take pictures of the object using a camera phone. i took several pictures of the object, before my sight line of the object was hampered by trees and the road going from a hilly terrain to those of lowlands. i noticed an object in roughly the same direction before, but a few miles to the east of highway 46, traveling west. the object hovered as well, but was very reflective, due to the time of d���y(around 1pm) on a cloudless, sunny day. i had at first attributed this object to be a military plane of some sort, due to its proximity to nearby camp bullis and camp stanley military outposts. now, after viewing the second object , i'm not quite sure. both incidents left me nervous. i couldn't believe that an object like that was displayed in bright daylight. later that night after showing pictures of the object with a friend that lives in the area, i asked him if he had noticed any strange ph���nomena in the skies? he replied that he has never seen anything in the skies, but has heard several military maneuvers nearby at the aforementioned camp bullis.","distance":"Over One

& virgil, norma and shirley experienced a form of alien contact. it was between 3 & 4 in the afternoon and they were sitting at opposite ends of norma���s 10-ft sofa. norma was straddling the large, padded, round arm end, of the couch and shirley was sitting in a chair at the other end of the couch. that was unusual because they normally sat close together, as they talked.  norma said they were bored and just making small talk when she distinctly said to shirley, ���you are changing and you have a big head���.  norma noticed that shirley���s face had changed.  shirley���s face was smoky white with a large cranial area that tapered down to a pointed chin that was rounded at the tip of the jaw. the eyes were large and medium gray and covered approximately 1/3 of the face. the face had no wrinkles or hair and she felt the face was like a triangle, large at the top and tapering down to a pointed chin. norma didn't see any ears or eyebrows and the vision lasted more than 1 minute and less than 5 minutes. the being had a small mouth that was closed and it was like a slit or a line with no lips. the attached picture is very close to what she saw with the exception of the nose. she didn't remember seeing a pronounced nose or defined nostrils on the face. in the area of where a nose would be, she thinks she saw 2 small dots. norma did not remember receiving any telepathic thoughts or messages. the face did not move or show any type of expression and though she had no knowledge of what she was seeing it brought her a peaceful feeling. when norma told shirley that she was changing, shirley replied that norma���s face was also changing in the same manner. norma now had a big head and big eyes and shirley was no more frightened by the experience than norma was. when talking about the experience, shirley would say it was all very weird.   \r\n \r\n     norma and shirley would talk about the strange event over the years and neither one could understand what their weird experience was all about. not until the book communion by whitley strieber that was published in feb of 1987 did they have a better understanding of ufo���s and aliens. however, both had very different viewpoints on what they experienced after reading the book.  norma still feels that the experience was positive and is still searching for answers on what she experienced. shirley stopped talking about the event after she read the book.  she became completely silent and refuses to talk about the matter to this day. shirley felt it was an evil presence and as time went on she could barely remember the incident and in time she has completely forgotten the event and will not discuss it. norma had on several occasions and just recently asked shirley about the experience.  however shirley says she no longer remembers the incident and remained silent when questioned about the event.  norma feels she won���t discuss it with anyone else.       \r\n \r\n     i asked norma if she had any prior knowledge of the subject of ufo���s and she had none whatsoever. it wasn't until she read the book communion and saw the picture of the gray headed alien on the cover of the book that everything fell into place and made more sense. norma felt the experience was positive because the face conveyed a very friendly and peaceful appearance. it wasn't scary and it emanated a high level of consciousness as if you were looking at a buddha or another religious deity. it���s as close to a religious experience that she ever felt.   \r\n    she now believes that what happened to shirley and her was an encounter with an out-of-this-world being.   \r\n\r\n \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

north of cardross saskatchewan. my cousin and myself were practising driving. as we went up one of the big hills in the area we seen these three very bright lights in the sky. the lights were about five feet in diameter, with about another 15 or 20 feet in between them. they made a triangular shape and in between the three sphere's it appeared to be blacker then the night's sky it's self. it just hovered there while we we're watching it almost as if we were being watched ourselves. at the top of the hill we stopped and were in awe as well as stricken with curiosity of what could have made such bright lights at this time at night. at first we thought it could have a combine going back to the field or somewhere, but we soon figured that it's may the seed is barely in the ground let alone be harvested. so we knew it wasn't that. after a couple mins we drove down the hill and went to the top of the next hill, which was higher than the first, to get a better view of what we were looking at. when we got to the top the lights had disappeared. we decided to drive around and look for what we had just seen. we went to the end of the road, found nothing. we turned left and drove for about 2 miles, didn't see anything that could have made the lights. we turned around and went back and continued north to go to our pasture. another 2 miles and still nothing. we back tracked to our road but instead of going home we decided to go east and check it out that way. we went all the way to the highway and found nothing, we were stunned that we could not find what it was. then it occured to us that it must have been a ufo. when we got home we instantly told our family about what we had seen our grandfather then told us that other people had been seeing that same thing around the area before. he even told me about his own ufo experience back in the sixties.To this day me and my cousin still dont know what it was that showed its self to us on that night, but we are pretty sure we have a good idea that it was a ufo ","distance":"21-100

it from the lounge and we all ran outside to the front and watched it approach and go over the top of our house, so we ran around to the back of the garden to watch it go into the distance. my husband

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At approximately 10:12 pm on sunday, 22 dec 2013, i was walking my dogs in phoenixville pa on maisfield rd. i had good view of the night sky, however there were tall, 2-story houses partially blocking some of my view of the east and west of the horizon. \r\n\r\ni saw a bright orange circular object come from behind a house in my neighborhood (approximately 38 degrees from the eastern part of the horizon); the house was blocking the view and the object was far from the house. it was much brighter than a commercial jet or helicopter, which i see all the time when i walk my dogs; it also appeared to be bigger, but hard to judge size. as it came into view, it appeared to fly faster across the horizon than the commercial jets i see, in addition, it appeared to be climbing shortly after coming into view. it appeared to be a bright, circular object, possibly orb-like. the object was flying east to west. approximately, 12 second later, an identical object, flying in what appeared to be the identical flight path from the same initial viewing point appeared. another 12 seconds later, a 3rd object appeared following the same path. none of these objects made any sound. i often see commercial jet liners in the sky while walking my dogs and these objects were faster, brighter, and appeared to climb. as the objects moved to the western part of the horizon, they appeared to be up very high in the sky, and took on the appearance of being almost star-like. at first sighting, at arms length, i would say the objects were approximately smaller than a dime.\r\n\r\napproximately 20 to 30 seconds after the 3rd object appeared, a 4th object appeared. this object had identical characteristics to the other 3 objects. it took the same flight path as the other objects.  the first 3 objects appeared to slow down a little, possible hovering, as if waiting (in the western part of the horizon), and they were at a great height from this point relative to when i first saw the objects.  \r\n\r\nwithin 30 to 45 second intervals, objects continued to appear from the same initial viewing location following the identical flight path. at any given time, i could see 1 to 2 objects from a great distance in the western part of the horizon and a much closer, lower to the ground (relatively speaking) object traveling from the east and moving to the west. one after another, an object appeared. the last object was number 8.  the duration for all of this happening, until there was nothing to capture on my iphone 5, was approximately 9 minutes.\r\n\r\nall the objects became dots in the sky and disappeared from my view. i was generally more interested in the close objects and spent more time looking at the initially viewing point in the easter part of the sky and did't pay much attention to wester part of the sky where the object had become very difficult to see. \r\n\r\nunfortunately, the first 3 objects flew one after the other, was an amazing sight to see. \r\n(there is no way commercial aircraft would have flied so close to each other and taken the same flight path.) i thought i had recorded these first 3 objects on my iphone, but i guess i was kind of shocked and excited and didn't realize i was not recording. also still learning the new ios 7 video camera interface. also, in the videos, you will see me occasionally moving the camera to the western part of the sky, but do not see anything in the video. i could actually see the distant objects with my eye when the iphone could not, but it was very small.\r\n\r\nbecause these objects appeared to climb, move fast to the western horizon and appeared to slow down in the west part of the horizon, i do not think they were shooting stars. in the video, at one point i hear a commercial airplane, but i can tell that it's behind me and not coming from any of these 8 objects.\r\n\r\nwithin seconds of seeing the first object, it had seemed so unusual that i had to take my iphone 5 out of my pocket to record it. when i saw the 2nd and 3rd, objects, one after the other taking the same flight path, i was in complete shock. as i child i grew up near o'hare airport in chicago, seeing planes all the time and i can't imagine any circumstances where you would see 8 moving object one, after the other, so bright, so fast, then appearing to slow down and wait for the others. also, the iphone video does not do these objects justice. they were much brighter then what appears in the videos. also, i recently saw the 1st rocket launch at nasa's new east coast space port, and these objects were much brighter than that rocket. there was no sign of any rocket trail. \r\n\r\neverything i saw tells me these were not conventional aircraft. also, i wonder if i had looked up in the sky earlier a minute or 3 earlier, if i would have seen additional objects, as i had just came around a turn and might have missed other objects. \r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:09:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

outside at sunset to look.......There were two stationary very large lights in the sky, where the evening star shows up...But later. there were jets also....Because their contrails were orange in the setting sun. one of the lights just straight up disappeared while i was looking at them. so, i went to get some binoculars...And what i saw is hard to describe. it looked at first like an a-frame shaped craft....Looked like it was likely mettalic since that's what color it looked like. then, as i was watching it...It looked like a plane...Jet maybe, not sure, with contrails coming down from the wings giving it that a shape........But......If they were contrails....How come they were not lit up orange like the jets flying across the sky? and it did not move at all...Stayed in the same place for about 15 or 20 minutes. then, the \"contrail\" things disappeared...And a few seconds later, so did the craft.\r\nwe were standing on my front porch in ranchos de taos, nm at the time these were observed.  the lights were so large and stationary, it was hard to miss them.  my son and i both instantly felt these were ufos.  \r\nthe object that i observed through the binoculars was really different.  i could draw a sketch if you would like. please feel free to contact me if you wish.\r\nthanks!\r\nheidi carr","distance":"Over One

white and green lights. i knew it wasn't a helicopter because the lights weren't in the same pattern and weren't blinking. we then lost sight of it. once we left the mall at 7:05 we saw it again flying east at a slow speed. at the same time a helicopter was flying in its direction. the object came to a complete stop and as th helicopter got closer the object flew the other direction then shot down at an angle at high speed and seemed to hover over some houses. my fianc��� said she saw the object go back up but i had lost sight of it due to the trees.
