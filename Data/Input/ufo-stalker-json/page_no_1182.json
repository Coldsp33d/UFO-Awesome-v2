loaded into my computer. my significant other took the movies on a tripod we have ready to go, and a general electric camera with 14.1 megapixels. 001, is 1 second long, 002 is 5 seconds long, 006, is 26 seconds long, and 007 is one minute and 54 seconds long. all videos are the same object.\r\n\r\nthe fifth video clip uploaded titled satellite 003.Mov, is 2 minutes and 26 seconds long, and we don't know if this is a satellite or ufo.\r\n\r\non the 15th of december, we let our dogs out to go to the bathroom before bed. we wanted to see the object we photographed three days prior, which is titled satellite 003.Mov. we named it that because we didn't know if the object that had suddenly showed up in our backyard sky for the last three weeks was a ufo or a satellite. this took place on the 12th of december. the date and time was not set. i posted this on facebook to see what my friends thought. ufo or satellite. it was posted on facebook on december 14, 2013. \r\n\r\nwe looked up at the first object we were checking on, and there were eighteen or more ufo's dancing around the first object we took a movie of three days earlier. we ran in the house to get the tripod and camera, and my other half was trying to film them all, and couldn't because the weather was so cold that the camera wouldn't take pictures. we went into the house, and my other half warmed up the camera, i turned on the computer, so we could download the movies and/or photo's when we were done. \r\n\r\nwe went back outside, and there were still five objects circling the object. my other half found one object to focus on, as the others were too spread out to fit in the frame without panning, and most likely not get a good picture of anything. four out of seven clips turned out. we went into the house to see what we had. it was very cold to stay out there too long.\r\n\r\nmy computer screen was black, and my computer was suddenly off. i had it hooked up to the television set, and saw a screen that said my computer was unable to boot, and had to try to do a repair and restore., so i pushed the button that it said to from the tv screen, and it repaired it. we downloaded the video's. \r\n\r\nlater that morning we were going into town, and my other half's cell phone was in the same condition my computer was in. not working, and a blank screen. we took it to radio shack, and it was rebooted some how. \r\n\r\nfor the many ufo's to go forward, backward, up, down, and around as if dancing together we know what we saw, and filmed. someone asked me if it could have been from the comet that recently went by. that is impossible as fragments from asteroids, or comet fragments do not make intelligent dance moves across the sky. \r\n\r\ni smiled, and thought to myself wow!, post something on facebook like that, and suddenly we have lots of visitors. my other half feels wonderful about it, as he has had several intense up close sightings in the past, and now he has validation that those events happened. i also have validation. \r\n\r\nit's real!!!!!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

lights.  i observed it for 10-15 seconds before it accelerated instantaneously to an impossible speed and was gone from sight.  it took off so quickly that i was barely even able to tell that it had gone south or south-east, rather than just vanishing outright.  there was no sound, and as my computer was on as well as the phone, there were no interruptions on either.  \r\n\r\nmy first thought

december 2013 at 8 pm. i am a member of a club with a large swimming pool in mumbai and it is located right off the arabian sea. 3 of my friends and i decided to spend the evening there. we entered at around 7.55 pm and were walking towards the club house which is located right next to the ocean. i did not notice the moon and there was a large light illuminating the swimming pool. the night sky over the ocean was pitch dark and i could see the stars very clearly. i am a very eager star gazer and take every opportunity to look at the night sky and so that day was no different and i did just that. i moved away from that bright light that was illuminating the pool to get a better look at the sky and to my surprise noticed this star like object but with a very strange deep orange glow to it. i called out to my friends who had settled down to a table placed on the lawn in front of the club house. they came to where i was standing and we all saw this strange light. there was something different about it, it was too orange for a normal star. it was twinkling to a point of giving off a pulsating effect and had an extended glowing effect at the bottom. we all realised this was not an aircraft or a helicopter as it seemed too high for a helicopter and in any case the whole so called craft was glowing with no strobe lights at all. it was approximately 45 degrees above the horizon right over the dark arabian sea and there were no other identifiable aircraft in the vicinity. after hovering for about 5 minutes it suddenly started moving to the right very slowly and gave the effect of actually disintigrating rather than disappearing into the night sky. it was an absolutely cloudless night, so there was no chance of cloud interference. we were all left startled but thought rationally but could not come upto a conclusion of what we saw was anything terrestrial!","distance":"Over One

much but i didnt think he was crazy after he told me the stories about seeing far away things and strange lights in his room. i was still skeptical though...If i dont see it its not real. right? well, i guess the aliens agreed because after looking in the sky for about 3 minutes my friend shoots out of his seat and points up yelling look look!!! and above us is the most amazing thing ill ever see. this giant black silent triangle the size of a football field hovering on the treetops right above me and my friend. this happened 3 years ago in the pitch black so its hard to remember all the details, especially in that intense moment, or about three or four minutes.When i first adjusted my eyes a couple 5 times i asked my friend if it was a prank or a joke, when obviously it wasnt,but i still asked.I told myself when i was looking at it i would never belive myself so i just said to myself as clearly as i could.\" alex this is real this is unbeliveable though\". and i look back and try to convince myself it was just my eyes playing tricks but i know this thing was something else. i kind of think i saw engravings in this giant ship mabey like a picture or something writing or something for space aerodynamics i dont really know it looked like i saw some engravings in this dark black ship. the sides of the ship looked like it was multiple stories tall with an awning and deck kinda thing like the ones in star wars lol. i kinda think i remember faint lights at the corners but idk it was weird probably got abducted ahaha.... but ya not kidding.. after hovering above us for a few minutes it just went back the direction it came about 300 yards silently and straight then just zoomed off. my friend said that was the closest and craziest one hes ever seen too. never seen one sence then, and its 2013 about 3 or 4 years ago this was. sorry idk the date but it was 2009-2011 and it was cold out\r\n","distance":"101-500

fernando area after leaving a friends house in tujunga ca. as my son and i were driving home, he said to me as he pointed to the sky \"is that a planet or something like that, what is that?\" he is 18 years old and is a typical teenager that never has said much about ufo's or anything related to the subject. i then  looked at what he was looking at. i was driving so i could not take a long look at it, but did look several times as my son also pointed out that it wasn't moving. i thought it was an airplane because this is near the flight path to burbank airport, but sure enough the two lights we were watching hadn't moved. the two orange lights were very close together as if they overlapped like a tangent geometry. another thing i noted at the time which also raised my curiosity was the fact that there were no visible running lights on this object. i was still thinking this was probably an airplane just really far away and that could explain the color of the lights and their lack of separation and it was also night with nothing to gage distance to the object with. after observing the object for a few minutes, both my son and i were convinced that it was not moving. we finally passed by a big rig that blocked our view of the object and when we were able to see the sky the object was in again, it had vanished. gone, just like it was never there. that's my story and i'm sticking to it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":52859,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.3129579,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12202013-0003","longitude":-118.4544974,"occurred":1386921600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,
