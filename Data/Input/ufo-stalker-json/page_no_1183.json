(i see military jets taking off a mile from the airport and these lights were travelling at perhaps a slower speed, and perhaps just a bit lesser altitude gain.)  i took a couple of still pictures (17:54:47 & 17:55:01) and then a video at 17:54:48.  one of the still shots shows a light, and the video shows the 4 lights (triangle and trailing light).\r\n\r\ncould not make out any object, only could see the lights.\r\n\r\ni then witnessed light after light come off the horizon from the north and travel the same pattern, the same speed, probably about 12 more lights total.  some came off the horizon at a constant rate, i would guess they were about 30 seconds apart from each other and seemed to be equidistant from each other coming one-by-one. others came out perhaps at a 45 or 60 second interval.  all lights traveled at a constant speed, at the same speed as the other lights, and all traveled on the same linear path and seemed to eventually disappear.  i would estimate it took about 75 to 90 seconds from the time it came from the horizon until it fully disappeared.  another employee was walking to his car and i engaged him pointing out the lights.  he stated that he did not see the triangle formation, but saw about 6 of the lights and noted it was odd there was no noise.   i tracked one light as far as i could and it just got smaller and smaller, further away, then went out of sight like you would track a helium balloon.  at several points i observed what appeared to be a normal jet passenger plane, flashing light, much higher in the sky, and i could hear the jet eventually.  then there were no more lights travelling across the sky and i left the area.\r\n\r\nthe lights were odd compared to aircraft that i am aware of as they were constantly on, and flickered just a bit but did not blink.  the lights were the same intensity from the time they came out of the horizon thru the time they went past and outwards, and gradually weakened in size and intensity as they went out of view.  i thought this odd as the lights seemed to be multidirectional, not like a car/plan that you see the light as it comes towards you but perhaps a different light as you see the tail end of it. \r\n\r\nnote - have worked at this location for over 10 years and have not noticed any similar activity or similar flight path.

i was traveling about 25 mph as there are a lot of deer out and i had hit and killed one the year before. it frightened me a little as i didn't want to be abducted, and my first and only thought was that this was definitely an extra-terrestrial ufo. as i approached my driveway it veered suddenly to the right (southeast), and the trees blocked me from seeing it any further so i thought it had flown off completely. i went into the house where my husband and daughter were sleeping and fixed a sandwich (with my work schedule this was my supper), got ready for bed and slept.  a while later i woke up, but nothing specific had wakened me, except that i noticed there was total silence outside. usually some of the farm animals made noises through the night, or dogs would bark, but this didn't feel like a normal silence. i was uneasy. i got up and looked out the window. there was only a slight breeze, but it was a little cool outside. my husband was in a deep sleep and i didn't wake him. i checked on my daughter whose room was across the hall from ours, and she too was sleeping. i went down the hall to the kitchen and didn't turn the light on as the moonlight shining in was very bright and i could see clearly. we had glass french doors leading to the back deck and two large windows in the kitchen, so i could see very clearly. i got a drink of water and was standing in front of the sink looking out the window and could see the horses in the paddock behind our house and counted them to be sure they were all there and hadn't gotten in the neighbors pasture with his cows. a movent caught my eye to the right, where i had hung out my grandmothers quilt to freshen it, and standing next to the quilt, with its shoulder pushing a bulge in it, was something i can only describe as a grey alien. it/he was approx. 3 1/2 feet tall. wearing no clothes, it looked toward the barn and then the horses, then looked directly at me. i remember setting my glass down and staring at it for a few seconds, and i thought (my only experience with e.T.S being from the movie or reading  stories of abductions here and there - and not believing them either), look at the clock to see if any time passes can't be accounted for. the clock said 3:07. i turned back and thought, well i'm not going outside with it there, so maybe i'll try talking to it in my head. i said \"hello, my name is %%^&, and if you can hear me or understand what i'm saying, could you please raise your right hand. it blinked and raised its right hand, bent at the elbot, up to its shoulder, palm out. i don't remember how many fingers it had, but as he put his hand back to his side i noticed how long his arms and fingers were, much longer than ours. his head was larger, not in proportion to his body, and i thought how tiny his neck was to hold up such a big head. his shoulders were thin and his chest not well developed with muscle. he had no nipples that i can remember. his hips were very slender, and his legs as thin as his arms, and his feet seemed to me to be big for his leg size. he had a silvery pale bluish cast to his skin, but the mook could easily have washed or shaded any color, so i can't say for sure what his coloring was. his eyes were slanted at an upward angle and weren't exactly almond but more so than round. pure black, but i got no sense of evil or threat or fear by his being there. no hair covered him anywhere, and it/he had no genitalia that i could see, and was def. not female looking anywhere either. somehow i just sensed it was ok with me thinking of it as a \"he\", as if it made no difference one way or another to him. i next thought to him, i don't know why you are here, but i am sad to tell you can't let you in, i have to protect my family, especially my little girl, and that means if you try to come in or take me or them or do anything like that, you may be able to do it but i'll fight you and either i or you will get hurt. i wish i could come out and talk to you (and i was a little afraid, but i can't take that chance with my family. (i never thought it odd that he never actually talked back to me with words, it was more communication with emotion from him.) maybe you could come back in the future and we can talk, but not now. he looked down for a second, and his little mouth moved a tiny bit, and i got the feeling he was sad too, and sad that he probably wouldn't be back (that this was my one and only opportunity), and he took a step back and was hidden from me by the quilt. i stepped out onto the deck to see if he was still there, then tried to see over the quilt, and couldn't see anything. i went back into the house, and thought this is so strange, no one is going to believe me. i looked at the clock and the time showed 3:25. our entire mental conversation had taken what seemed to be about three minutes or less. i couldn't decide if i was wrong and it had taken longer than i thought, or if there was \"missing\" time. but i was quite relaxed and went back to bed, and fell into a nice deep sleep. the next morning i remember first thing thinking i need to get some paper and write everything down, but needed to get my daughter up and ready for school. her dad had already gone in to work. i remember thinking as i drove her in to school to be sure to remember to write it all down. then after i got home from dropping her off it was no longer in my head that it had happened at all. just a year ago something jogged my memory and it all came back as sharply as if it had happened the night before, and i haven't forgotten any of it. then i started searching online for ufo info, and after everything i've been researching, i decided to tell someone. i told my brother and he didn't say anything except \"ok\". (how strange). then i found the mufon site and decided to report it. i have had some other strange experiences as well throughout my life, but have no clue what it all means, or who to contact to sort it all out, and this at least i can make a little sense of, so decided it was time to report it. anyway, thats what happened, and it still amazes and puzzles me. what did he want, and after reading other encounters, if there was no abduction, why was he there? i never got any feeling of danger or threat from him, and to this day am sad i wasn't able to go outside and try to learn more about him. he has never come back, but if he did, now i'd go outside and try to talk to and learn about him.

1,500 to 1,000 feet up and about 2,000 feet away. it was approaching the highway and coming toward us, crossing our vision.\r\n   something about this made it look strange, and out of the ordinary,

gnoss field but not this far out or from this direction and contrary to the landing pattern. \r\n   it was off to the center right of the windshield, and lit a red orange. my first impression was that it looked like a landing light, but it was red-orange instead of a brilliant white. my next thought was possibly a helicopter. we could see it clearly. at first it looked like a solid light. after a short time, i began to see that it seemed to glow brighter and then fade. eventually it began pulsing. i started counting the pulses, and found they were about 1 second intervals. a strobe flashes at this rate, but it flashed, bright and on an off, on and off. this was a distinct pulsing glow and it would sometimes get mush brighter and sometimes it went dimmer, but did not go out - bright, dim, bright, dim. \r\n\r\n   it looked immediately strange, it moved from the right slowly to the left in a way only a helicopter might but as it crossed our vision, still no strobes. it crossed the windshield and over the highway, loosing altitude, to go over the petaluma wetlands. - \r\n\r\n\r\n738-1604 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12/9/13,  about 6:42pm, and dark out. clear sky, stars visible, highway traffic was light.    we had just left petaluma and were away from the towns lights. we were 3 people, monday, dec 9th, in a honda odesy driving south on hwy 101 at night, about 6:42pm. - for the first sighting: i was in the seat behind the driver, who was my mother. all 3 of us saw this, but i had the longest viewing.\r\n\r\n****\r\n    a second sighting: (involving 2 flying objects or lights) i will report this in a separate report, as mufon has no way to report multiple sightings together - a few days later we saw 2, low flying, nearly identical lights, right over the city of petaluma. it started when we first observed the light as we said good bye to some friends, after leaving a cafe. they saw it too, but were just getting in their car to leave. we stayed and watched until we decided to get in my car and give chase. this time, i was the driver. we also got out and observed the lights. one flew towards us and then away over a hill. we attempted to follow and lost it behind the hill, only to have one passenger see it reappear right in mid air, or another just like it. it emerged again, close to where we had originally seen it. this time it followed a similar pattern and disappeared again behind the hill in the same direction, but a little farther north in location.\r\n****\r\n    first dec 9th sighting continued:\r\n    we had just left petaluma and were away from the towns lights. the light was first observed by the person in the passenger's seat who pointed it out to us. distance was hard to judge in the dark, but it over the hill and coming toward the highway, maybe about 1,500 to 1,000 feet up and about 2,000 feet away. it was approaching the highway and getting slightly closer.\r\n   something about this made it look out of the ordinary, including its movement, but nothing glaring about it said it could not be a plane at first, except there were no strobes and i assessed it was not bright enough for a landing light. planes come in to land at gnoss field but this was outside the landing pattern and coming from the  wrong direction. \r\n   it was off to the center right of the windshield, clearly red orange. we could see it clearly. at first it looked like a solid light. after a short time, i began to see that it seemed to glow brighter and then fade. it began pulsing. i began counting the pulses, and found they were about 1 second intervals, but a strobe flashes at this rate, not pulses. this would not go out and it got bright, then dim, bright, then dim. \r\n    i assessed to see if it might be a helicopter. it loved from the right slowly to the left in a way only a helicopter might, but the movement was strange. \r\n    it crossed our vision of the windshield to the right over the marsh. finally, i was looking out the side window to see it. i rolled down the window and braved the frigid air to have an even clearer, cleaner look at it. looked like the red lights on top of the antennae by the gnoss field municipal airport, but those are 4 antennae together, with multiple lights and only about 200 feet tall. gnoss was about 2 miles south.    the 4 antennae are together, with multiple lights all the way up them and only about 200 feet tall and this hovered at about 1,500 - 2,000 feet up.  \r\n\r\nthe light hovered over the marsh but was not still. it was moving but hard to tell how much due to the movement of our car down the highway. as we traveled on the highway, i was able to determine that it was not going anywhere, but rather maintaining itself over an area \r\n      confirm that it was not going anywhere, but rather maintaining itself over an area.\r\nfinally, it started moving south along side us, slowly at first, paralleling the highway and eventually began overtaking our car.\r\nit headed out away from us. other planes were now visible in the distance and crossing at higher altitudes. it headed out over the bay, still at a low altitude. i followd it as long as i could. i lost it occasionally behind a hill behind a the hills to our right, but would regain it unlit i lost sight of it in novato.\r\n\r\n738-1604 ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

appeared to be ascending, individually, and in small groups/clusters, float together to a certain point, and then maintained a straight path, and then one by one disappeared, until only one was visible. we lost sight at that point, due to tree cover. there was no wind that evening, it was clear in the area we were observing, but there seemed to be some storm clouds to the northeast...We did see flashes of 'odd' lightning, as well. the orbs seemed to be traveling rather fast. they did not seem to be just floating on air currents. i attempted to take a photo, with my cellphone camera, but was unable to do so. as far as feelings/reactions...I suppose wonderment would cover it...We've been seeing a lot of odd things over the past couple of months...An earlier orb siting in november, a

in the sky for a star or planet, that was around 9:30 pm. i watched it for a few moments and saw that it had shifted positions from where i first marked it, i then got out my binoculars and went into the back yard for a better look, sadly, they are only 10x25 and did not offer as grand a view as i would of liked. i brought it to the attention of my girlfriend and after her assessment she took out her camera, which did not offer much better resolution, and after only a few attempts at  photographing it, she gave up. through the binoculars and the bedroom window i continued to watch the lights change colors and shape. there were green and white lights at what would be the north end of it, two green side by side with the white one on top, while the middle stobe'd red, yellow, pink, blue and white. as it floated across the sky ever so slowly, the lights at the north end changed positions and began to glow bright white at the south end without the green ones, while the lights in the middle seamed to change from a concave shape on the bottom, to seemingly encompassing it around unseen edges. the lights contained within the middle of the of the object of my fascination changed many more times. in the beginning they were round and only outlined the bottom, then encompassed it wholly, in nearly a perfect circle, flashing a multitude of varying colors, leaving a dark, or, black stripe down its center, (north to south.) at last glance there were no lights at the north end and it seamed to have a \"c\" look to it as if it were heading south with the bright white light heading it up. as this is still happening at this moment and i have taken yet another look, the bright white lite is now on the north end, while the surrounding lights have changed from nearly horizontal, to nearly vertical. it is now 10:30 pm and the lights are still moving in a south westwardly manor at about the same pace as the other stars, which are not, flickering multi colored lights. if this is a planet who's light is flickering in the clear and cool night sky because of the atmosphere, then i have to say, i cant wait till tomorrow to see it again!
