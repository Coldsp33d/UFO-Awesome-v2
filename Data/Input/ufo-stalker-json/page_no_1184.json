the exact description as seen it would be it has radiated in a golden pulsating matter yet it looked as if it was a giant star . it wasn't a saturn since it was way to the e & at high altitude , checked the sky as i've went out to take a photo's . actually i've also made a video of it (1 min 6 sec duration). i call this sighting a uap & not a ufo 'cause i'm not sure if it's some black project newest contraption or if it is actually an extraterrestial spaceship . reason for it being i did not feel any usual humming & pressure behind the ears . i simply was interested in it as it looked very pretty , like a large golden oval object that radiated rays , at least that's how i've seen it . however , on the photos it looked different , on each one & on the video too yet it looked very much different . on photos & video ot had all kinds of shapes & the colors had variations but always most prominent was the golden & white with some greeish to pink hue .\r\nhave nit seen it disappear as i was by then indoors reviewing my camera & after checking up on the object by the video afterwards it was just gone . \r\nit's not the only time since then that it just pops into the sky nearly in exact position & always to the seeing eye looks same yet on photos that is a different & amazing difference . so to summerize the dates that so far it showed up is : nov 19 th , dec 11th , dec 12 th & today dec 16th 2013 & durations of viewing the object varies as well . each time i just didn't want to blink ;p so i would not loose sight of this huge object & to tell the truth it felt the longer i'd look it seemed to be spinning , this confirmed via the photos !\r\nso far i've analyzed all the photos & took screenshots of my video too which almost each segment was also analyzed & i must admit a lot of it leaves one mouth gaping in awe , whatever this thing is :)\r\nbtw , attached is the video plus 2 other photos from sighting on the 11th & 12th of dec.\r\n\r\ni would like to forward most

about 30-40 feet above the houses) for 10 seconds then either turn around or go backwards for another 10 seconds. we saw this happen over and over again 22 times before we kept walking. we sat on a bench and lined up the light with a few trees and noticed that it only flew at the same altitude and when it hit one spot, it changed color (red to green) and when backwards, then when it hit a point it turned back to the other color and went forwards. flashing green in one direction and red in the other direction.\r\nwe saw some lights that would start as a small yellowish glow. the glowing ball would get bigger and bigger until it would shoot off into the distance. sometimes it would change into the white/green and red blinking lights and go away. sometime the glow was bigger than the street

next night, july 19 i went for another walk. i was getting excited and hoping now that i could see something again. i told my friends about it and they insisted i take a camera but i thought if they knew i had a camera, maybe they wouldn���t show up. and who would i show the picture to anyways? and it would just look like a light in a sea of black and wouldn���t prove anything. i wanted to see them more than i wanted a picture. it wasn���t worth it to me. \r\nthis time i was an hour later than the nights previous, at about 1:30 am. at the corner of the field where the pond is. i rounded the corner and i saw this huge round orb with rings around it. it looked like saturn. it was hovering about 50-100 feet over the pond. it was about 4 feet across. it was red and white lights but they were flashing smaller lights and much more quickly, like twinkling. it was like an orb and the lights were pulsing and shimmering, hard to explain. i was so excited! i ran to get closer, but it was so strange, every step i ran to see it, it seemed to keep moving back from me at the exact same distance as i was trying to get close to it. like it didn���t want me to get closer. so as i kept moving toward it, it kept moving away from me. i ran to see it and it went behind a tree. i kept running around the pond to see where it was going and just slowly rose up to about 150 feet and went slowly over the tops of the houses and out of my vision.\r\ni continued on my walk. in another field, behind the trees came this one that had 1 stick and beside it was another stick but a bit smaller than the other one. they were tied together by a line. it was just about 1-2 feet big. then around the whole things was a saturn ring that was pulsing red these ones didn���t hover. they went straight north and didn���t stop or waver or anything. just went straight, sailing, with no noise, right over my head. it was so weird because i saw the whole shape, there was no one in it, i couldn't understand how it could be a kid with some toy because it came from behind me and went so far in the distance till it was out of sight. it was 2 a.M. and there was no one around. i didn't know what i thought it was. i saw 3 different ones come over those trees and just head north. towards where these fireballs were over the houses. i followed them. all week there had been these ���fireballs��� over the houses across the field. they were really bright. but they���d either be there or always go off in the sky at a 45 degree angle up and disappear. they didn���t seem to be anything but lights so i never thought of going to investigate.\r\n\r\ni saw these ���fireballs��� (yellow-orange glowing stick-like things with the saturn rings around them). it was hovering over the houses across the field. bobbing up and down like it was in the water on a wave. there was a time when there were 4 of these things over the houses across the field from me. i started to go into the neighborhood and look for them. i would see one of them and run through someone���s yard and try to get closer to the object but they were only about 20 feet above the ground so the houses would obscure them. they were about the size of a beach ball, maybe 2 feet across of pure light. i���d try to run around the block and see them again. i would see one bobbing down in between 2 other houses and run for it. but by the time i always got to where it was, it was on the next street. they would go as high as just above the houses and then down in a yard then back up again. there were about 4 of these fireballs bobbing around for at least 3 hours. it seemed like they were looking for something or surveying the streets. they went from one street to the next. i hadn���t been in that neighborhood before so i didn���t know how to get around quickly and i was so tired running around the streets it was hard to keep up. the houses were too tall and the trees were blocking too much of the sky. i could see the ships sometimes in between the houses, but they would be moving and by the time i ran to the end of the street, i couldn���t see them anymore. then i would again but just couldn���t get to where they were at. i followed them for 3.5 hours this night. i could never get closer than 100 feet to them (1 house yard away). i was so curious but it wasn't a craft, they were just lights so i knew no one was in them so i wasn't afraid.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with

straight down. it was blinking/shimmering and it stopped in 1 area of the sky, and then vanished. a minute later another object came out of the sky in the exact same place, turned at the same place, stopped at the same place and then vanished. for the next 45 minutes i watched different lights zig zag all over the sky, all with the same kind of glittery lights of green and white.\r\nthey were so far away, that it was hard to tell really what they were. i wasnt afraid as they were so far, i couldnt tell if it was as far as a plane, or as far as space. they were just lights that were brighter than the stars, but i couldnt ever see a body of the object.\r\nthen i walked a few blocks and i saw 4 bright yellow-orange objects over the houses across the field. i watched them for about 30 min. let's call them ���fireballs���. they hover over the houses and don���t seem to move much. they bob over and around the tops of those houses in that one area. the lights are so bright. some of them get brighter and brighter and then just disappear. some of them move like they���re floating but they always go off in the same direction and disappear at the same-ish spot in the sky. i see a few of them coming from the east to where they rest over the houses, but many of them just appear. i was watching 2 of them over the houses and then a third one just came and then a 4th one. they���re so bright you cant tell if they are super far away or really just over the houses. but they are at the roof levels. they are here every night so far. different numbers of them. i left because it was getting late but they were still there. i didnt feel anything about them because they were just strange lights.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

helicopter looking for the other 2 ship-things i just saw, but it had absolutely no sound. a beam shining straight down as if it were searching for something. as it moved passed me, about 100 feet

the highway. it was about 4 times the size of the smaller 2 (70-80 feet). i think maybe that the crafts can stick together and then break apart so this could have been a collection of 4 crafts maybe?

could no longer see it.  i called my friend back and told him what i did and he could now see the object flying near his home.  his home has at least ten times less outdoor noise than mine and he  could not hear anything or see any flashing airplane lights  .  he also said that it fluttered up and down a bit while we were talking.  then it went out of his sight as well.  i have seen a low

watched it and saw that it wasn���t a plane. there were 2 flashing white lights on top. at an angle down from the white lights were green flashing lights. i realized the thing was only about 100 feet above ground. it was coming right towards me. i was standing there trying to figure out what it could be. it was totally silent. when i finally thought ���omg, this thing must be a ufo!��� it instantly turned towards me and started descending to me. i noticed that the thing that i thought was 1 ���ship��� changed and it was actually 2 flying side by side the whole time. so they broke apart and manoeuvred around so that they were coming right for me. the flashing lights changed to just be a shining light and the green lights stopped. when it got about 50 feet from me i was panicking. it stopped and just hovered. i was so scared of what might happen, i thought to myself, run! and the instant i thought that, they moved back to the exact position they were in and just slowly returned to moving south. i watched it go over the trees and saw that the lights at the back were slowly flashing red. i walked away and wanted to follow it and see what it did over the field a few blocks away. when i got there the 2 ships were again flying side by side over the highway, with red lights slowly flashing. it was about 100 feet over the ground. i watched them move until out of my sight, about 5 minutes. i never saw the actual shape of the craft. the lights were bright, but maybe because the sky was so black i couldn���t see it? i don���t know, but i couldn���t see any shape at all. from the lights i estimated it was about 15-20 feet long when they both were together, and half of that i suppose was the distance of 1 of them.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

perfect night to see a ufo. i thought that it would be cool to see one of those orange orbs that other people see. i am always looking at the sky as i have seen many interesting things, which i have reperted here.  i looked back to the spot that i thought would be the best place to see one- and- seriously - there it was- a glowing orange orb just hovering there, not quite directly above me, but moving towards my location. my heart was racing, and i was feeling vulnerable in that i seemed to have ask for this visit, but was not liking that it seemed to come towards me. i jumped out of the tub  and put a towel on, then decided to go for my camera. i got back and it was still there and i got a great shot of it, before it faded away. i thought at first that it was rising up through clouds, but there were no clouds. wow- i feel exhuberant and shakey and so much adrenaline running through me. this isnt the first time i've felt like there was some level of communication between myself and other strange observations in the sky.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then
