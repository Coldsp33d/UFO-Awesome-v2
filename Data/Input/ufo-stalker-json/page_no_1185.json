States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"The incident took place in early august of 2008 in southern california; in a section of the city of whittier called \"up-town\".\r\ni was at my girlfriends apartment located on the 2nd floor, on the north side of greenleaf ave., adjacent to a hill and hiking trail. it was a little after 12:30am, my girlfriend and i had an argument, then i went to lay down in her bedroom, while she remained in the living room on the couch with our cat.\r\ni remember laying down on her bed and closing my eyes; i had a strange dream about being locked in a submarine trapped in ice when i heard the door open.\r\ni immediately jumped out of bed, and all the hair on my neck stood up as i watched.\r\nthen i heard and felt a humming noise, that was so low and deep that it made me a bit nauseated. \r\nmy heart stared racing as the door continued to open, and then, standing there in the hall was a small figure around 4ft tall that was dressed in what seemed like a black cloak. in shock, i tried to scream out and grab something from the nightstand next to me to try and defend my self in some way, but i went mute, and felt like i was paralyzed. it raised its hand and was holding something in it.\r\ni fell and crippled down to the bed not being able to move, 2-3 more of the small figures cloaked in black entered the room, in a sort of ,hurried waddle, and surrounded me.\r\ni couldnt move, and all i could do was stare at the first small humanoid figure that was pointing something at me. it had hands, or what looked like hands. the skin color was dark, a brownish green; then the last thing i saw was its face as it stepped closer towards me. its eyes where big and yellowish with slits like a cat or reptile. its skin on its face was a bit lighter color then its hands, it had no hair, i didnt really see a nose, just slits where the nostrils should be, and its teeth where jagged and pointy in a small child like mouth. it said something in a low gutteral voice that i couldnt understand, it sounded like someone talking underwater, then i looked back at the clock, it said 1:30 am, then it all went black. the next thing i know im laying in bed staring at the ceiling. i go to sit up and i have a sharp pain in my left lower back, i turn to look at the clock and it said 4:30 am, then the humming noise came back and a bright light perred in from the 2nd floor window, i opened the blinds to look out and i saw a teardropped shaped craft with a dome hovering in mid air about 10 ft from the window. it was about 20ft long. it had lights of red, orange, blue and mainly white on the sides and underneath i saw what looked like landing equipment. it hovered there for about 3-5 seconds, then the humming noise dissappered,and it became silent as it floated slowly up past the trees and vanished out of my sight. i was confussed more then terrified and felt dizzy and disorented. i walked out of the room and saw my girlfrined laying on the couch, asleep, with the cat hidding curled up in a ball, with all of its hair standing up hissing in the direction of the front door.\r\ni tried to wake my girlfriend as i ran past to the door, but she was in a dead sleep. excitied still, i ran out of the door and down the stairs to the street below our window where i saw the craft drift away to see if i could see where it went in the sky. but it was gone. i went back into the house when my girlfreind started to wake up and the cat was now calm and walking around the kitchen. i told her what happened and about everything i felt and saw. she did'nt remember seeing anything, just seeing the clock on the cable tv box say 1am, and then she told me she got really tired out of no where and it all went black. i asked her to check my lower left back for any marks, when she did she found a small red spot that was slightly hot and a little swollen .I never saw anything like that again, but i still have nightmares sometimes about it, and i still have a small scar.\r\ni don't know how else to explain what happened to me.\r\nthis is just what i remember.","distance":"20 Feet or

having dinner with my parents at their house and wanted to get back quickly so i could get online to talk to my girlfriend. i always walk the same route when going from my parents to home as it cuts across a lot of the town and makes for a quick walk home. it's also quite high up and there are clear areas along the route where you can see out across the town, the harbor and even the whole bay itself.\r\non this night it was a lovely crystal clear sky. in some places along my route there is very little lighting and in some cases no street lights at all leaving the road in complete darkness, allowing one a completely clear view of the sky and all the stars, something that is rarely achievable in the town with all the bright light.\r\nbeing a bit of an amateur astronomer since i was a kid i welcomed any chance i could get to see a brilliant clear sky with little light around and so took what chances i had to gaze up as i walked.\r\ni reached another dark stretch of road and had a clear view to the south west across the whole bay, i stopped a moment to pull out my phone to select some music on the music player as i had been listening to some on my way back as was my usual routine. i noted the time was 2230 and had been walking about 10-15 minutes and put the phone away. it was at that moment that i looked up at the clear sky again in a southern direction and noticed a single bright star. even now i don't know why i looked up then or what made me notice it, but i did. i stared at it a moment and suddenly realized it was moving at a slow pace in a north west direction.\r\ni immediately identified it wasn't an airplane and thought that maybe is was a satellite. amazingly as this came to mind the object suddenly increased in brightness almost like it flared up with a white light, and just as quickly faded into nothing all while moving still.\r\ni was astounded at first and thought that maybe it wasn't a satellite but maybe a meteor or slow moving shooting star and it had burned up, despite it's white light.\r\na few moments of looking on it reappeared a small distance away from where it had vanished, only it was back to it's original form and now moving up higher across the night sky and towards me, heading north east. it then got even more bizarre!\r\nas i continued to watch it travel in a straight line, waiting to see if it would vanish again, it suddenly performed a strange a seemingly random, yet also impossible, maneuver in various directions before finishing at the exact point it had started the maneuver and continued along it's north eastern direction once more. the maneuver only took a split second and when it happened the light left a quickly dissipating trail behind it, like someone holding a single light in front of you in a blacked out room and moving about quickly in your eyesight, the path burned temporarily in your eyes. i could see still see the bizarre moment in my own eyes for a few seconds after.\r\nas it continued heading north east it eventually came right overhead, suddenly brightened again, and faded into nothing. it was gone for a little while longer this time and thought it was gone for good.\r\nit eventually reappeared a short distance away from where it vanished, but was no longer traveling in a straight line but in more of a curved path that gradually turned toward the north.\r\ni pulled out my phone, turned off the music player as quick as i could and started the camera function. i tried a few times to snap some pictures and even started recording, desperately hoping i would catch something i could show to someone. as i would find out though the lack of light was no good for the camera phone and it captured nothing but black, and no enhancing on computer would fix that.\r\nas it followed this path it brightened and faded two more times, the final time though it faded much more slowly as it began to vanish over the horizon.\r\nas soon as it was over i checked my phone and noted it had been only five minutes. a sudden feeling of uneasiness and urgency came over me, i suddenly felt very uncomfortable and nervous and immediately made tracks straight back home as fast as i could. as much as i had been in awe and intrigued in what i had been watching i now just had the urgent feeling to get inside, i didn't like being outside no more and contently found myself looking at the sky like i was checking to see if it had come back or if anything else was up there.\r\ni quickly brushed it out of my mind the next day, but when ever i think about it i just get this odd feeling i can't explain that chills me. i guess i would like to get to the bottom of it and see if there is an explanation for it or not.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

night.\r\na quick recap: last night i saw a bright light shoot across colorado springs from east to west. when it got to the west side of the springs, it split into five individual lights and hovered there. it's altitude was lower than pikes peak (i could see the mountain range silhouette behind the light). i ran inside to get a camera, and when i came back out, there was a single light hovering over the mountain range to the south of pikes peak. last night in the dark, i thought it was over cheyenne mountain (which houses the norad facility), but as it turns out, it was hovering over a peak somewhere between pikes peak and cheyenne mountain (i don't know the names of the peaks).\r\ni shot a series of photos on tripod, overexposed, so that i could see the mountain range. i was able to overlay six photos with the peak lined up, to show the object was not stationary (like a bright star would be).\r\nto the naked eye, and in those six photos, the object appeared as a very bright light. \r\ni then took several photos at a much faster shutter speed to get a proper exposure on the object. for these photos (still on tripod) i used the mirror lock up function and the self-timer to insure there was no camera shake. the details in the round disk object are the real details, not an anomaly caused by camera movement...\r\nthere are details, but surprisingly, it doesn't look like

observed a distant light,bright undefined shape or size in sky at aprox 45 degrees to the east sky 2-3 miles out as it appeared from edge of building i was parked by, at first glance thought distant plane or chopper. as continued to watch it moving cross sky the object was coming in low, fast and moving in straight path towards the nwest best guess 1000-1500 ft. above ground over the middle of my city. as it approuched a closer path cross my field of vision i then saw a trailing unknown red blinking object in the same flight path that appeared to be trailing or chasing the first object,the 2nd light at that point appeared to be a air craft of some kind? at this moment maby a minute into wathcing what was happening in the sky i was still in truck,as was bout 17 for temp outside. this is the moment when i realized i was not seeing what my mind first tells you is normal,so i then got out of truck to see and then actually hear the roar of a jet type engine in the sky in direction of the objects still in the flight path of now almost above my area i was parked.The first object was brighter and more vivid,shapeless,but its light was coming from all around it,no edges? but still in same position and distance to ground and height of angle with the second red single blinking object still chasing but not gaining on it, this is when i could tell that it was a blacked out helicopter,no other lights that could be seen in or around what im sure was a blackhawk or other kind of  helicopter. the roar of the engine sounded to be at max thrust, i at this point in watching got that eerie feeling i was encountering a ufo being chased by a manmade craft trying to be stealthy in pursuit,this about 3-4 min into this sighting the 2 objects continuied off nwest of the city passing over the downtown area and into the night horizon 3-4 miles out of my sight in the direction of the army national guard about 10 miles that direction. i am very puzzled of the entire event and can't stop

side of the road in woolston to get a clearer look but the object seemed to be using the trees to limit our observations. this object could move like nothing i've ever seen before in my life. it was very controlled in all its movements no matter in which direction it wanted to go. it appeared to have the ability to perform a sidewards change of direction without pause from the forward direction

i first thought it was perhaps fireworks, airplane, or a flare off in the distance.  i quickly realized it was none of those.\r\n4) balls of light, from my perspective, about the size of a large star or planet, in the night sky appearing at one second intervals at equal distance every time.  the lights lasted half a second.  it was on one trajectory at first from se to nw and they progressed with sequential flashes 10 or 12 times across the sky.  it then stopped (disappeared) for a few seconds, and then reappeared headed at about an 85 degree angle ne but still in the sw sky.  6 or 8 more lights appeared and then stopped almost directly above me. it was clear with a bright moon and i could see no stars though i was in a village with some surface lighting. that drew my attention as well as i am a star gazer and know the effects of ambient, surface light pollution.  once it was gone, i listened for aircraft noise, as the military practices frequently in this area, and there was none.\r\n5) i felt i had seen a ufo, for sure, for the first time in my life.\r\n6) it just quit after the second shorter pass.\r\nnote: i thought about going into the shop and bringing out others to witness this but i was so taken that i did not.  i may be the only witness to this event.  i was sober and am a responsible person well respected internationally in my profession which is music performance and education.  i'm making this report because of the credibility of mufon and your sincere desire to get to the truth about ufo's. i've seen other weird lights in the sky earlier in my life but this was the most dramatic, and strange (compared to what i normally see in the sky). that i have ever witnessed.  for whatever this is worth, i hope that it helps you.  i would like to be kept informed if you figure this out. \r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\na. kendall

seen a day or two before, but that was about 730pm.  tried to look for it as i left for work but unable to see it again.  if i may, i would like to describe all 3 that i saw in this 3-4 day period.  first time day or 2 before at about 730 pm as i went to store.  noticed a bright light to s-se about 45 degrees, it came down slowly, and at same time two projections came out, one to the right and one to the bottom as you look at it.  came down at about a 45 angle from right to left, hovered for a few secons, then rose up again at 60-70 degree angle from right to left and disapeared in about 10-15 seconds.  next morning or day after is when i caught the video.  on the morning of 26th, came out  looking and as i scanned sky, about 10 degrees to the right, in orion, therer were 2 or 3 quick flashes of light, a pause and then a couple of more, but other than the flashes, nothing seen or heard.  worked at airports and around aircraft for 15+ years, and know what a strobe and anticollision

kswo. i was in a cessna 150 at approximately 3,000ft msl hdg 270t. approximate local time was 2000 at the start of the sighting. visibility was significantly greater than 10 statute miles. temperature was approximately 85f and wind was around 3kts\r\n\r\non my return leg back to kswo from ktul at approximately 2000, i was following highway 51 about 20nm to the east of kswo when i noticed a very bright light brg045. approximate location of my aircraft at time of sighting was n36 06.78 w096 44.52. approximate location of object at time of sighting was n36 24.66 w096 58.62. \r\n\r\ni initially noticed the object during my routine scan outside the aircraft for aircraft operating in the local area. kswo was my home airport, and is also the location of a university flight school. \r\n\r\nthe light's appearance was a brilliant white, like a large aircraft's landing light. my initial reaction was that it must be either a planet, or more likely a large aircraft in the pattern at kswo. as the sighting progressed, i began to dismiss the previous objects as it was too far below the horizon to be an astronomical object, and lacked recognition lighting that is common to all general aviation and commercial aircraft.  \r\n\r\nduring the initial part of the sighting, the object exhibited cbdr or constant bearing, decreasing range; it was heading towards my aircraft. this lasted for 15 minutes. estimated airspeed of the object at this point estimated to be less than 50kts. \r\n\r\nas i begin to descend into kswo at 2015, i started talking with another pilot in the vicinity of the airfield operating a powered parachute. at this point my attention went from the unidentified light, to descent and pre-landing checklists and i lost sight of the object. upon landing at the airfield at 2025, i notified the operator of the powered parachute that i would be interested in coming to look at his aircraft after i had secured mine for the evening. he accepted my offer, and i parked my aircraft and secured it for the evening.\r\n\r\nat 2115 i drove to a nearby hanger on field at kswo to meet the operator of the powered parachute. when i arrived, he along with a friend and his son were on site. they were looking at an object through a pair of binoculars that was now directly south of our position. the 3 individuals explained that they had witnessed the object transit from above ponca city, ok....Pass stillwater, ok (kswo)....And was not observing the object (along with myself) in the vicinity of oklahoma city, ok. witnesses described the object as i had in my description earlier, and that it produced no audible noise. \r\n\r\nat 2120, i obtained the binoculars and looked at and re-acquired what i assess was the same object that i had sighted earlier.  approximate location of the object was now n35 40.08 w097 21.96 which was directly south and slightly west of my position which was still kswo. while looking through the binoculars i could determine the object was spherical in nature and estimated its size to be about 30ft in diameter. with the naked eye from my viewing location, it appeared to be about half the size of an aspirin held at arm's length. through the binoculars i could clearly see the object \"morph\" through a color pattern. this patter was similar to the lighting that you can commonly find in limousines and other entertainment events. i would describe it as \"party lighting\". the sphere emitted an aura of light in a cyclical manner that was predominantly red/orange and green/blue. i observed the object in this location for approximately 20 minutes until approximately 2140. during this period of observation, the object remained stationary. at approximately 2140, the object slowly \"winked out\" and became invisible to the naked eye as well as through binoculars. \r\n\r\ni feel that i was very calm and objective through the entire encounter. \r\n\r\ni am an expert in identifying aircraft of all types under all conditions. i was and still am unable to identify the craft/object that i witnessed. although i feel that this aircraft could be attributed to a terrestrial craft/event, i feel that this is unlikely after my observations.\r\n\r\ni am attaching a powerpoint/pdf document illustrating my encounter. additionally, i am attaching a photo i found on the internet which most closely depicts the object that i observed.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"01:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line
