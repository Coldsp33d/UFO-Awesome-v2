downtown los angeles. it was around 6:30 pm, i looked out my window to the west, and noticed a fairly bright light, that was still in the sky. i often see helicopters in the sky at night here, always, in fact, but this light was not a helicopter. there was no blinking light on it whatsoever, and i watched it for a solid hour. i at first thought it was a hovering helicopter, but the length of time it was there, soundless proved that it was not,\r\n\r\ni have a very low quality \"mustek\" sd video camera, and shot about 15-20 minutes of horrible, low quality video, with sound, several shots of 1 to 4-5 minutes each, over the hour.\r\n\r\nsignificantly, i saw the light at about the same time, on the next evening, last night 12/12/13. i shot another couple minutes of video, but did not follow the light, i got distracted and did not check on it.\r\n\r\nat any rate, after watching the light for about fifteen minutes, it began to move farther west and south. i do not know if there were any winds aloft, but it moved about 20 miles over an hour, fairly fast, and i lost it on the horizon somewhere over i would say near venice.\r\n\r\nit was hovering lower than the flight of the police helicopters flying by, they all looked to be higher than this disembodied light. i have binoculars, and no matter how carefully i focused upon it, never saw any shape around the light, but the light itself was seemingly oval shaped, it had the appearance of an electric light, it twinkled on the crappy video, but it did not waver in person. in the course of the cuts in the video, it got progressively farther away and smaller.\r\n\r\nmy reporting this incident is actually an inquiry about any further sightings, to co-relate what i saw. the pathway of this light was by my estimation, from the time i observed it from the mid-wilshire neighborhood, and south and west of there to the beach, a very densely populated area. i saw it again last night, still in about the exact same spot as the night before.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

home in suburban franklin ma area - about 25 miles or so southwest of boston.  he brought my attention to it.  it was after sunset and quite dark, maybe around 6:00 pm or so.  he was getting ready to go somewhere and said there was a strange object in the sky with blinking lights going over the house.  he told me to go to the back door and see it (as it should have  been over the house by then).  i think that would make the direction it was flying approximately southeast to northwest (i'm terrible with directions though).  it was flying fairly low, at about commercial aircraft altitude (low enough to eventually pass out of sight behind the trees).\r\n \r\nit was moving slowly, it looked like it was moving much slower than a regular plane, and it made no noise.   i didn't see any other planes in the sky right at that point.  it had 3 white lights (presumably on the backside that we were looking at as it flew away from us), in a straight horizontal line, and they were flashing on and off in a regular interval of every few seconds until the object itself disappeared from view. there were no other lights, like the red and green lights on a regular plane.  i took a video of it on my crappy cell phone, but it was at quite a distance from us by that point and all you see is the row of white lights blinking in the distance, so i don't know if it's useful.  the whole thing lasted less than 10 minutes from the time he sighted it.\r\n \r\nnow it might just be a regular plane or some other known aircraft, but i haven't seen something like that before and neither has my boyfriend, and it just seemed odd. that's the only emotion either of us had, was that it seemed odd, with the flashing white lights. i'm wondering if you know that it's a regular aircraft of some type, or if not, you've seen other reports like this.  i've seen planes with the blinking red lights, of course, but not with 3 white lights in a straight line, and i'm wondering what kind of plane or aircraft would have that physical configuration?  so i'm not assuming it's some weird, unknown thing, just unknown to us.  maybe someone has some familiarity with this?  we've never seen that before and we look at the skies out here quite a bit (we have a pretty clear view of much of the sky when the weather cooperates).","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

portland, maine.  i was driving in a northerly direction, about 20 mph, and saw lights moving in a southerly direction.  they were so distinct that i quickly stopped to observe them.  \r\n\r\nso i'm looking to my left (west) and i see these strange lights moving pretty fast, not supersonic but i'm guessing about 720 mph.  (see below.)\r\n\r\nthey were 6 of them, in a formation that changed as they moved.  it initially looked like two in the lead, side by side, two following in a straight line between the two leading, and two more in the rear that were side by side.  the formation appeared to change as they moved along.  they appeared to come closer to the earth, then moved up in height and veered toward the west, disappearing into the night sky.  this whole thing took place in a period of maybe 2 minutes or less. \r\n\r\ni was cursing myself for not having my camera, which i almost always have, but then thought i might as well do what i can with the iphone.  \r\n\r\nthey had a strange light that looked like an umbrella, actually more like an inverted u,  and they glowed with a bit of orangeness.  there was no flickering.  and they looked nothing like an airplane.  i wondered if they could be helicopters and cranked down my window and there was no noise, from anything, even on the ground.  there was no traffic and it's a quiet area of portland.  besides, i've seen many helicopters at night over the years and these were much higher (i'd guess maybe 1-2 thousand feet) and were moving in a way that was unfamiliar to me.\r\n\r\ni am including the pictures i took with my iphone4s, with explanatory notes.  i have not edited these pictures at all.\r\n\r\nthis first shot was taken at 8:35:27.  i don't know the source of the light pollution on the right of the picture.  the objects were heading southwesterly and beginning to ascend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis second shot was taken at 8:35:32.  an expert on speed/distance might be able to calculate the speed of the objects by comparing the movement with the times shot.  i'm guessing at distances but looking at the map, am estimating they would have traveled from an area around windham, me, to somewhere around waterboro, me.  in the approximate 2 minutes i watched them.  this would put their speed at 720 miles per hour if i'm right.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe third shot was taken at 8:35:50.  note the comparative distance traveled in 18 seconds.  speed?  see above. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis last shot was taken at 8:36:41.  this was 51 seconds later and the first two of the lights had ascended, moving towards the southwest, and disappeared in the night sky.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinally, the time from the first shot to the last shot was 1 minute, 14 seconds.  if they were traveling 720 miles per hour, this would mean they covered about 35 miles while i watched, including about 45 seconds before i started taking the pictures.  this seems approximately right.

was directly behind me. i started viewing venus when it was at the south-eastern sky and continued to view it till it got to the northeast sky. at that time, around 8:50 or 9:15 i got tired of looking at venus and turned around, 180 degrees, and pointed my telescope to jupiter when i noticed the orb. it was impossible for me not to notice it once i had turned around because it was hovering about 2 yards from my rooftop and about 5 yards from me physically. at first i thought it was a paper ballon or some sort of paper that caught on fire and the wind had lifted it up off the ground but after further inspection it looked like a stationary flame and i was immediately blown. i wanted to yell for my dad to come take a look but i knew it was a once in a life time situation so i pulled out my iphone trying as best to resist the urge of excited. in fact i was so shocked that i thought i was taking video but realized it was only on the camera so i snapped a picture and switched to video. right after i snapped the picture the stationary flame turned into a perfect sphere and began moving towards the north. it moved slowly, as it moved towards the north it elevated to the tree-top hight and continued it's path towards the north. meanwhile my dogs were going haywire-barking from the bottoms of their lungs. as i tried running to the top of my door steps i lost sight of the orb over the rest of the trees. i ran inside and began yelling excitingly, showing my family the picture and video, until there was an eerie atmosphere in the kitchen. no one believed me so i just put it off and ha dinner with my family. \r\ntwo weeks later, today (12-12-13), my neighbor snapped a photograph of a similar colored orb moving across his farm.  i decided to post these photos online and a flood of people around my town began confessing to seeing a same color orb...Each sighting occurred on a thursday and all sighting in rural areas.","distance":"20 Feet or

above my location i got one picture off and it just disappeared after that. istill have negative, i've been watching all these ufo shows and thought i could finally show it to someone who would believe me, in the late 90s i brought the pic to school to show everyone and everyone was amazed by the picture. the top part of the object is blue and some of the bottom is red and the front is what i could only describe as a beatle beak. feel free to contact me i'd love to have someone look at the negative i do have a pic on the same negative where i took a pic of the moon 3 times in one pic but

jasper, ga on a very heavily traveled roadway with many other vehicles present at 5:44pm eastern standard time. i turned northbound from majors road in the cumming\\milton, ga area on to post road. while turning northbound, i happened to notice a pulsating light that appeared to be either a star or a light on top of a radio or cellular tower. i studied it for a moment because i was able to immediately rule out a star when the light began to flash \"on and off.\" i then ruled out a light from a cell tower or radio tower because the light wasn't pulsating or flashing in a manner consistent with the flashing of a warning light. it was random and captured my attention that i then began to split between driving, talking on my cell phone, and observing this object. i tracked the object intermittently out of the passenger side of my truck for apx. one minute, at which time i looked away to the road ahead, viewed back to the right, and the object was gone. i assumed that i had \"passed\" the object and that it was now in my blind-spot behind me and wasn't going to think about it further. then, about 4 seconds later, i turned a small corner with a group of trees and, as the trees cleared from the view of my windshield, i noticed an object that was apx. the size of a ping-pong ball held out in front of me at arm's length directly in front of me. the height of the object immediately ruled out a plane and the object was emitting red, blue, and white flashing lights that didn't blink in any specific sequence. it was immediately clear that the object was not something that i had seen before. i exclaimed to the person on the phone that i was talking to that i was witnessing a u.F.O. she, of course, laughed at the notion, however, i asserted that it was not a joke. she told me to pull over and take a picture. i told her that i would call her back and i hung up the phone so i could get a picture. i pulled into a neighborhood and kept the object in my sites the entire time until i had to jump out of the vehicle. when i put the vehicle in park, and opened the door to jump out, the object disappeared. it didn't \"speed away\" or accelerate at a high speed,,, it just disappeared as if it just instantly \"cloaked\" itself by turning off it's lights. i stood for a few more moments scanning the twilight sky to see if the object would re-appear but it didn't. i was completely astounded by the whole event because i couldn't believe that i had seen such an event and i also couldn't believe that the many other vehicles on the road appeared to not see the event at all. it was a very confusing and surreal thing.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

were on a slant to the horizon and holding steady. i could not make out any other physical shape. the object remained motionless throughout the entire observation. we did notice small objects ejected from the craft in the form of red lights. they went to earth but we did not see them land as they were behind some trees ... perhaps a mile away(to the east). we did not observe them heading back to the object in the sky. there was a small plane in the area heading to the southwest,but it soon passed and was observed no more. when we first observed the object the sky was perfectly clear. light cloud cover did obscure the object on occasion as we continued to observe, but it kept reappearing as the cloud cover diminished. it was in the same place as before. we observed for about 1.5 hours and then the object was fully obscured by cloud cover. i want to note that before focusing on the object, i trained my telescope on jupiter and clearly observed the planet and 4 of its moons.  the planet was glowing (like our moon) and definitely not a bright white light. i then swung the telescope over the object and began my observation. it was no star.

hovering about 20 feet above an electrical pole, directly across the street from the hughes missile systems group buildings in canoga park, california.  \r\n \r\ntwo cars ahead of me were pulling over to the curb and a couple of cars behind me did the same.  we all got out of our cars and were looking at the object.  i asked if anyone knew what it was, but no one answered.  there was no fear, just incredulity.  \r\n\r\nafter about one minute it took off at an incredible rate of speed to the southeast.  it was not possible to determine a shape; just lights in a circular pattern.  it was almost as if it were transparent.   it took only seconds to disappear.\r\n\r\nwhen i got home i told my husband, an engineer employed by lockheed, what i had seen.  he said it was probably a c5a going in to burbank airport.  i asked if a c5a could hover.  he said no.  i said it wasn't a plane.  i do remember a general feeling of calm when i knew i should be agitated and that calmness persists to this day.\r\n\r\ni've never really shared this experience with  many others.  not that i didn't think they would believe me, buy because i had a general feeling that i shouldn't.","distance":"21-100
