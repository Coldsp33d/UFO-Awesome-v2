weather was pretty clear and comfortable that night. probably between 60 to 75 degrees fahrenheit. i left the gas station and around 1 1/2 miles later i was at a series of sharp curves just prior to entering a wooded area on my road. as i came around the bend i saw the triangular craft with solid orange orbs at the points and a blinking light in the middle hovering around 50 to 75 ft. over the tops of the trees. i guess the object was around 100 to 200 ft. long and half as wide. the appearance of it made me first freeze then my mind began to race. i stopped my car as soon as possible and was able to prevent myself from being located directly below the object. looking up at the underneath of it i was a little afraid and definetly in shock. what was to happen next as it quickly became clear to me that the technology my eyes were looking at was without a doubt capable of being fatal too me or anything around it. i also had a slight feeling of lost time. i was probably sitting in my car with it parked in the middle of the road staring at this craft for about 8 mins., desperately trying to wrap my mind around the dark colored objects underneath on the bottom of it along with the brightness of the orange orbs. i tried but couldnt recognize any of the ships parts from other mechanical objects i recognize which just continued to startle but later amaze me. at about the four mins. remaining mark i realized it hovered there and id heard entirely no sounds from the ship. the object was so clearly differently composed from anything i had ever seen before i continued to realize. it wasnt making any noticeable sounds but how? it should have been impossible for that to be true due to the size of the craft and how close i was located to it i shouldve heard it. i then once again tried to recognize any of the objects on the outside underneath of the craft to help me understand how this object could float there so idly and seemingly effortlessly. at this point i guess i had been looking at the craft in fear and amazement for about 12 mins. it then moved away and out of my eye sight maneuvering in a \"z\" like pattern incredibly fast and was gone without a trace. i assume it had to be faster than the speed of light.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

year was 1984-5. present at the time, other than myself, was my wife, and daughter. i noticed 3 bright spots in the distance 1-5 miles distant to the north. they could have been stars low on the horizon accept they were slowly moving together west then back to the east as well as north and south. i and my family were just off hwy 2 about 10 miles east of wolf point mt. they, the lights, seemed to be, for lack of better explanation, looking for something. i say this because i cant imagine what else they would have been up to. i will describe further.\r\nthe lights would hover in place, perhaps 1-3 hundred ft. above the ground arraigned inline from east to west, for some minutes equidistant from one another. then one on one of the ends would \"shoot\" away. if it were the one on the east end of the trio, it would go east then immediately the one on the west end would go west the one in the center remained. then within minutes they would suddenly with great speed, reappear back in their original positions. they moved forward toward the south then back toward the north always inline and equidistant. the lights always did the same thing shooting away then coming back together, the center one always remaining. they did this for many hours as we watched. the routine of these lights did not alter from the above, until it did. it was approximately some where between 2 and 3 am when the routine of these lights changed. we had watched for hours and were getting tired and bored with what was going on when one of the lights, the center one, came forward toward us. i kept thinking it would never get close enough for us to see it clearly. i kept think it would certainly stop, but it didnt. it slowly approached us to within 50ft. it hovered 20 to 30ft above the ground. it was very bright yellow orange color, perhaps 30ft in diameter. it hovered for maybe 10 minutes. it seemed to be watching us as we had watched them. then it went back to the north with the other two ufos perhaps 1 mile away and they simply and suddenly went away from view. i say that because they just vanished. they didnt speed away. they just disappeared.\r\ni dont know how many attention seekers you get telling theyre stories or how many false stories you get from people. while in the annuals of ufo lore this incident may not be notable. it is however absolutely truthful! one tends not to believe ufo stories until one encounters something he cant explain. at no time did i or my family feel threatened. we were to the contrary amazed! thank you \r\n","distance":"21-100

floor so a good view). my brother went to the outdoor balcony, he then yelled at me \"bro there's ufos in the sky!\" i ran to the window by the balcony and saw in a distance 5 balls of light that seemed to be in a 'v' formation. they seemed to be hovering above the ocean. there was what seemed to be a loud aircraft sound in the vicinity when i stepped out into the balcony to get a clearer view, although i was not sure whether this was coming from the commercial airliner that was flying in the air at the same time, although the sound seemed a bit louder and slightly different from the usual commercial airliners that fly past and almost nothing like a helicopter, as well as the fact that the sound came earlier than the airliner seen (i live next to logan airport so seeing planes / helicopters is an every day occurrence although within my 4 years of living here - im a student from the uk) i have never seen a formation like that from my apartment nor have i seen aircraft behave in that way nor have i seen 5 hovering together at the same time. when i first noticed it i noticed it just looked odd, but i thought it could be helicopters from the way the lights of these objects were flickering although there was absolutely no sound present similar to a helicopter that would suggest that. \r\n\r\nwhen i first saw them they appeared to be in an organized formation but as they moved it was not so organized. at first i was very surprised when i saw the objects, not panicked or frightened just very intrigued. i was going through the things in my mind of what it could be, the most reasonable being helicopters, although i have never seen that before. as my brother was taking photos of them on my phone and some video, they began moving off to the left slowly, one faster than the others. the object furthest to the left disappeared behind the view of a building while the others very slowly followed although i did not see them actually go behind any buildings, they were still in the same sort of spot. since they broke their organized formation and traveled off to the side in what i assume is the direction of the airport i assumed they must have been aircraft that belong to logan airport or something, so after about 5-10 minutes of watching them i went back inside having lost a bit of interest and faith that they were from outter space.\r\n\r\nthis morning i woke up and decided to watch space shuttle videos on youtube as i am interested in space. i came across some ufo videos which then reminded me of the incident i witnessed in the sky about 3 days ago. this caused me to search \"lights in the sky over boston\" videos on youtube. i came across a video titled \"ufo lights over abington, ma usa heading to boston\" depicting balls of flickering light in the sky being filmed by a passenger in a car. although the video was uploaded october 17 2012 i was shocked because the objects in the video had a very similar resemblance to the objects i saw. i have attached photos and video.\r\n\r\ni understand mufon must get thousands of ufo witness accounts but if you end up viewing this and think it is credible as being a legitimate unidentified flying object please dont hesitate to contact me as i would be happy to know too. (the video i attached had to be cut slightly shorter than its original length in order to have it sent to my email so it could be saved on my laptop and uploaded here - i have the full video on my iphone but the software on iphone requires me to cut the video short in order to be able to send it over email) - all video / photos were taken on iphone - i have more photos if you like.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\nsam.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":52723,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.3600708,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12122013-0003","longitude":-71.0552732,"occurred":1386734400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1386874942000,"summary":"5 flickering balls of light hovering in the sky over the ocean, then appear to move very slowly in a line.","tags":["light","hovering"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/52723_submitter_file1__IMG2826.MOV","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/52723_submitter_file2__photo1.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/52723_submitter_file3__photo2.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/52723_submitter_file4__photo3.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/52723_submitter_file5__photo5.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Boston, Massachusetts","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:217949"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Vancouver","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was taking my 15 minute break at work when i noticed this object. for the last few months i've seen this same star like object from my homr witch is just 5 minutes from where i work. for some odd reason i decided to take a picture of it, zoom in and thought u guys could tell me what this is. it comed around almost daily, same time just before sunset.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":52722,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.6417081,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12122013-0002","longitude":-122.6591461,"occurred":1386814080000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1386848778000,"summary":"Sphere like with v-shape lights","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/52722_submitter_file1__20131211170806.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/52722_submitter_file2__20131211170855.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/52722_submitter_file3__20131211194503.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/52722_submitter_file4__20131211194558.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Vancouver, Washington","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:217950"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Delhi Charter Township","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"While driving home i saw a bright green light (like a starburst) soared over the treeline of our neighborhood moving horizontally sw around 6pm.  my wife was traveling in her car three miles ne behind my location and saw the same thing plus another green light that seemed to be falling at an angle towards the ground in the distance.\r\n\r\nat first i thought it was a fireworks rocket, but i noticed it was travelling horizontally across the sky.  it was pretty large for fireworks and it was very bright. it did not leave a trail, there was no sound, and it did not explode.  it soared over the three line where i lost sight of it.\r\n\r\nlater, i mentioned my sighting to my wife and she said she saw the same thing i saw as she was driving on the highway about three mile behind me.  she said she saw an additional light that seemed to be falling to the ground at an angle.  she paid more attention to this light because she was wondering it was a plane or something about to crash into the ground.  however she didn't see any impact after losing sight of it.

chitchatting about life. after a few minutes we were looking at the sky commenting on how blue/clear it was when we saw what appeared at first to be a skywriter. i didn't think too much of it  but a couple of moments later took a second glance at it noted something that looked very peculiar. there was a long vapor trail but the weird thing was the vapor trail started what appeared to be a few hundred yards in front of the first craft. there were three crafts the first and third seem to be very similar if not identical the third was very easy to see was trailing the first two they were all on the line. the first craft was cigar shaped but mostly shrouded by the vapor trail that was making in front of the craft. the middle craft (if it was a craft) appeared to us is just a small star or real bright light we were never able to make out any craft shape. but all three maintained the same distance pretty much from one another flying in a straight line through the entire flightpath that we witnessed over a period of probably 3 or 4 min. when we first noticed it they were descending towards my house from the north west. they took a bend over us probably 1000 yards or a couple of miles infront and over us. and then ascended in the northwest. my daughter and i stood in total amazement watching it disappear into the skies. when i say it, they were definitely three different objects. with regard to the objects the first and third were definitely crafts which made absolutely no noise they left and incandescent vapor trail. the thing that caught my eye at first was that the vapor trail look unlike any skywriter i've ever seen. with a skywriter the vapor trail is tight like a ballpoint pen immediately behind the craft. then it looks more like a paint brush stroke as you get thousands of yards away from the craft. this was totally different. the width of the vapor trail in front of the first vehicle was the same with as the entire trail. when i started looking closer it was obvious that this wasn't the skywriter. the first craft i made out was the one shrouded in the beginning of the vapor trail. then i quickly noticed another cigar shaped craft what appeared to be several thousand yards in trail. it was either lit up with lights or had a highly reflective metal exterior. it was too far away to make out any more detail than that. they were not any conventional type of aircraft which we see plenty of in the same area. there were no navigational lights or wings and the weird thing was the middle craft must've been either very very small where was the craft of all. but it did maintain the same distance throughout the entire flightpath even acid vent in front of our house and back up to its ascent and emitted a starlike glow the entire time.","distance":"501

the top 10,800 ft. el. we planned the trip around the full moon because of our all night hike. at 3:10 am my friend and i were at about 6000  ft of elevation. due to our position on the east side of the mountain, the moon had already set. it was pitch dark where we were besides our flash lights. we couldnt even see the lights from palm springs because we were seperated by a mountain. suddenly while looking south east towards the santa rosa mountains we spotted two objects. i noticed the objects because they were brightly colored and in a location where there are no houses, roads, cars, trails or anything for that matter. when i first noticed the lights i thought they were either a night hiker, a car or a house.\r\n\r\nthere were two crafts, positioned about 3/4 mi. apart, hovering around 750 ft. the objects both had bright flashing lights. the craft that had 3 lights was south east of my location. the lights all had separate colors but they blended together so their true color was indistinguishable. perhaps red yellow and blue. the other object which was south of my position had one main light and another light that periodically illuminated. the main light seemed like a bright white light. both crafts hovered in exact synchronization despite their distance  between each other. they seemed to be moving up and down and side to side. the object with 3 lights seemed to be the dominate craft because it was in more of an open area and when it would move, the other craft mocked its positioning while it was deeper in the indian canyons. it appeared as if tbey were looking for something.\r\n\r\nmy friend and i, of course being skeptics, questioned every bit of rational to explain this situation. we watched them for about a half an hour. by the time we decided to continue with our hike, we were affirmative to the fact we had witnessed two ufos. despite our visual sightings, both of us had seperately felt that they could feel us watching them. during our sighting we felt that the lights sensed our presence. after the sighting we disclosed in confidence in each other that we had sensed strange sensations which internally translated to the feeling of them being aware of us. after 30 minutes 3:10 -340 am of our sighting we continued on our hike. by 4:00 am the lights were gone.","distance":"Over One

and rides the ese bus because she has special needs. her school does not start till 9:45 am. i tied the dog to the porch rail and heard an airplane so i looked up. the planes come pretty low here since we are between the airport and the navy base. the plane was headed like it just took off from the airport. it was obvious it was a passenger plane. like i said they fly close here. it was headed south. i kept looking at the sky. i always do, because i believe and i want to see and meet anyone or anything new. i looked northwest and saw something white. it was so far away i thought it was a star. but i thought the sun was too bright to see a star that well. i noticed it was moving. i opened the door and told my daughter to come out. i pointed it out to her. she said it was just a star or a satellite. i said stars and satellites can't be seen in this sun lite and it's moving too fast. there was no sound at all since the plane had gotten out of earshot. it stopped and i ran in and got the binoculars. when i came back there was a red object coming from the east. the white object stopped and the red one went west in front of the white one. holding finger distance between them it was like 6 inches if you spread the thumb and index finger to measure. the red one passed the white one in front of it. the white one started going again towards the southeast. i looked through the binoculars and the white one had a solid greenish-yellow light covering the entire bottom surface with a small silver outer rim. the light was steady and continuous. the red object stopped and turned like a v shaped turn not a wide curve like a plane would have to do. it went southeast after the white object, as if chasing it. i looked through the binoculars, it too was star like, and it was just like the other one only it had a pale reddish light with a silver like outer rim. i could not really gage a shape. they were so far away they were like stars. but stars don't stop and change directions and follow other objects. i wouldn't think a satellite would either. my daughter kept saying it was stars or satellites because she was not going to admit what she saw and have people call her coo-coo at school. she said she could not deny some of the things she had seen before though. she told me not to show her anything like that again. i'm like, \"but i want them to come say hello to me!\" we couldn't get the camera in time. oh yeah! they both disappeared at the same time by shooting straight up. just \"poof\" gone with the red on following the white one!!! my daughter was like, \"where did they go?\" i said, \"straight up!\" kept looking, but they were gone. my daughter is a high functioning autistic. she is in main stream classes and hangs with the regular kids. she is very

sometimes just hovering on the same spot. the weird thing was that when hovering, the lights in the middle moved to the left and to the right and while doing this the whole triangle rotated. than it stoped and moved and than again and again. i observed it approximately for an hour and a half until the clouds came and i lost the view. i wasn���t able to do any footage because on my camera those

sky. it flew past my line of sight from east to west. at first i thought it was a helicopter flying low and fast, so i thought nothing of it. i was approximately a block away from my house when i noticed that the light changed direction and there where multiple blue and red lights, with one dim white light in the middle of it. i made a left towards my court and i noticed the \"lights\" got brighter. now the \"lights\" were heading north west. mesmerized, i observed it weaving and zigzagging north west. i parked, got out of my car, and i immediately called my wife. i called her for 2 reasons, 1) i needed a witness and 2) make her believer. i know for a fact that if i told her i saw another ufo, she would tell me that i'm crazy. as i got her on the phone to come out, the object was flying everywhere, stopped on a dime, hovered up, dropped rapidly, floated down, and the lights dimmed. i heard my wife coming out and the object was still there. she noticed what i noticed. i also saw the object(s) doing barrel rolls and loopty-loops. my wife's 1st impression was, \"that's a remote controlled helicopter...\" the lights were right in front of her and she was still in disbelief. we noticed the lights go behind our neighbors house and then reappeared. it didn't technically go behind our neighbors house, but from our point of view...It seemed like it went behind our neighbors house. it was too cold for her to be outside because she was wearing her pj's so she went back inside. i was standing in the middle of my driveway still observing it. i couldn't tell how far or close it was because i just had my eyes checked by the optometrist. they dilated my eyes yesterday, (monday, dec. 9th, 2013), so my eyes were adjusting. (i have 20/20 vision by the way). as i was observing the lights/object(s), i really didn't feel anything besides excitement. i thought to myself that i've been seeing these \"objects/lights\" quite frequently since i moved to livermore back in 2007. i felt that it got colder and my skin felt like it was tingly. tingly as in pins and needles. i noticed the object hovered up and slowly headed towards the clouds, but before it hit the clouds the lights just turned off. ive been walking in front of my house to see anything, but saw nothing. i went to my backyard and didn't notice anything. i feel like i may see more lights and or objects sometime in the near future.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

looked out the window. i noticed a persistent vapor trail materializing across the cloudless sky, basically east to west, passing just south of my house. i couldn't see a plane! a long white trail of white material was forming across the sky, as if being emitted by a plane!! i ran and grabbed my camera and got several shots of the phenomenon, the included image the first taken. the sky was slightly hazy, but cloudless. the vapor trail persisted much longer than other planes, all visible (and recorded) passing by which dissipated about 30 lengths behind such planes. this east to west vapor trail persisted hundreds of plane lengths, although, again, no plane nor craft could visually nor photographically be detected.\r\n\r\ni recorded this same phenomenon on november 27th, 2010, 4:28 pm, and reported it to mufon - it can be found with a search. in comparison you would note that the vapor trail appears to be at the same height and traveling in the same direction as this event. now as then, i report this phenomenon in the strict sense of reporting an unidentified flying object. i also report this as circumstantial evidence that an \"invisible\" craft is ejecting material into the air over st. louis on some soft of regular basis. each time i happened to witness and record these events by chance, where, statistically, this event must be happening in a much shorter periodic time period than every 3 years, as if one time wouldn't be enough to be disconcerting
