oval passed from above the car out to the horizon (it never went over the horizon, but appeared to keep going into space) in about 2 seconds. i say oval, but i could tell it was actually the shape of a frisbee, but from my angle, it appeared to be an oval. we were about a half an hour north of o'hare airport, but it was moving way to fast to be a plane. and it was too big and had a solid white light that didn't blink or flare or leave a trail, so it couldn't have been a comet. it seemed to be about airplane height, i want to say 20,000 feet. but by the time it reached the horizon, it could have been anything higher than that. if a plane travels 500-600 mph, i would say it was 4 to 6 times faster then that. the best way to describe it was if i were laying on my back and a professional whipped a frisbee over my head. only difference is the object was clearly glowing and was very high in the air and huge. it was about the size of a skittle, maybe a little bigger from my perspective. as i wrote, it happened very fast, but as soon as it happened, my passenger and i looked at each other and at the same time said, \"did you just see that?\".  i consider myself a fairly intelligent

by car with my mother from manteca,ca to ripon,ca.It was about 9pm pst and my mom noticed lights hovering above a almond orchard about 1 1/2 miles from us. it was a dark no moon night and the lights really stood out as odd. the lights were hovering and moving slowly back and forth over a particular section of the orchard. my mother said we should go find it and see what is going on. she said she thought it was a helicopter looking for something.\r\nwe drove following the lights until we got about 1/4th miles from them. at this point, it changed direction and started to move straight south. my mother drove very fast and we got ahead of the lights and she pulled over on the side of another almond orchard. it was so dark out there in that part of the rural manteca area.\r\ni got out of the pickup on the side right in the orchard of trees. i was standing by my seat in the corner of the door car part. my mother would not get out and kept asking me to get back inside. i asked her if she could see it coming. there was no sound at all, nothing. no wind that night not one leaf rustling just dead quiet. she yelled that it was coming and i looked up towards the north to the back of the pickup and it was there. now we saw the shape of it. it was a massive black triangle with lights on the corners that were very bight illuminating white. the object did not make any sound at all of any kind. if you were not looking at it , you would not know it was right there over your head. when it passed over us, i was amazed at how low it was, right on the trees. i think it was about 30ft above my head as it passed over. i could not see the lights as it passed me because it was too big. it blocked out the sky, i remember seeing a dark black so black it was blacker than the surrounding sky. the black was unbelievably black. i would say it was at least the size of three houses. incredibly huge. it was quite thick as well. it did not bend up on top in a curve, completely flat all over on top. it was about 30ft. thick all over. it was moving so slow it seemed at times to not be moving at all. but it was moving. it went over us, and straight along that first 20 rows of trees to the south. my mother at this point was freaking out and we starting driving to the south to follow, then my mom suddenly stopped the truck in the middle of the road and said she was afraid, we should not follow. she made a u turn and we went another way home, still rural but far from that thing. i watched the lights keep moving south until i just could not see it anymore. my mother died in 2004. she told me not to talk about it in our little town of ripon,ca where everyone knows everyone. so i did not. i don't think it was discussed much between me and my mother until my first son was about 14 years old, then she told him about it. back in 1977, there just was not a black triangle awareness and me and my mom did not know what to think it was. now that more and more people are speaking of it and there own sightings, i feel a little better about the whole thing. i know they exist because i saw one long long ago in that field that summer night. i could of thrown a stick and hit it. i know it was there, just don not know what it was.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

both very similar, and spotted both moving the same path from north to south.\r\n\r\n1. at home outside.\r\n2. looked up at sky, no cloud cover with all three, and first was almost directly

it was moving faster than a jet would travel, which i thought was strange. the second time it was brighter, moving the same rate of speed in the same direction, and then just disappeared. there was no

first i thought it could be a bird. i kept watching as it slowly cam closer. it was soon apparent that it wasn't a bird so i stepped outside the front of my house and watch it approach. as it cam closer, i called my neighbor over to show her. we both watched for about 3 minutes as 6 objects floated by, slightly to the west of us. there were 4 elongated oil barrel shaped objects and 2 round object that were either much father away, or just much smaller. all 6 objects stayed in formation the entire time as they ever so slowly floated by, never wobbeling of changing position. as they floated by, they seemed to be gaining altitude and accended higher and higher until they dissapead behing the clouds. this took place during the day at about 1pm. they were about a mile high in the sky and as they passed they seemed to get higher and higher. this happed on 12/7/13. as the first elongated oil barrel looking object went by, it looked like some kind of vortex was surrounding it, however that could have been a trick of the eye, i don't know. each elongated oil barrler objet looked as though they were at least a mile or more apart from each other, one behind the next. in between 1st and 2nd as well as the 3rd and 4th were 2 tiny round dark objects alsom traveling the same slow speed and also staying equidistant from one an other. the oil barrels ufos were on their side with their sides (or what would be their top and bottem if they were actual oil barrels) pointing east and west while they were floating south.Judging from the size, i would say each oil barrel objet was about the size of a football field. there was no noise, and no lights. i didn't want to move because i was hopping to see them excelerate or do something unusual, so i didn't get my camara. the entire thing lasted about 3 minutes.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

movements and the change of colors. i called my husband and we could not believe this was happening to us.  it sure was something that we had not seen before. it kept moving for about a minute. the object was moving too fast and irregularly to be an airplane or a helicopter, and also the color pattern was not something we had ever seen. my husband went inside to grab his camera, and as he was coming out, it moved quickly, flashed, then disappeared. after 2 seconds, there was a loud thunder-like noise, yet there was no rain or thunder before of after this happened. no good pictures were able to be taken, just one cellphone picture, which just looks like a small bright dot in the dark. i'll still attach the picture anyways. there were no visible stars on this night. this was really

vision. after an initial 15 minutes of scanning i picked up on prominent objects in the foreground that were not there earlier (sky was increasingly clouding over in advance of an ice storm). as minutes went by they became unmistakably apparent. after careful tracking i realized they were in motion and spent a total of 45 minutes tracking their movement from a glide path left-right to stationary rest, to movement of orbs within their groups which are evidenced in the video. there is a rod flyby in the video at the end. side note: i also caught a cloaked object (very large) moving through the sky at a much higher altitude...The night vision picked up its magnetic impulses disturbing the atmosphere and it moved se to nw. interestingly enough, there was absolutely no plane or helicopter activity in the sky the whole time the orbs were in view, which is extremely unusual in the richmond area.","distance":"Over One
