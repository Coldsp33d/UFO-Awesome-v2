like and then a terrible sound of them being attacked and torchered so loudly that it sounded like a baby with a blood curdling scream over and over. this went on for about five minutes.\r\ni was just thinking to myself im glad its not me or my cat, i felt terrible about it because there was nothing i could do about it and i was not going to trample into the woods and jungle across the street to find out. there are a lot of wild animals out here so you see a lot of them and hear them to.\r\nat first i noticed that this basketball object lifted out of the woods silently, i thought is was a kids remote control device, but then i realized quickly that it was not and it made no sound, so i was mesmerized and just watched it come closer to the road. i was trying to figure out what it was and kept stepping out till i tripped of the front step. i looked up and it started crossing the road and lifted up to the power lines and just hovered there for a few minutes, my power lines are very low so this was close.\r\nthen it was crossing over the power lines and coming down towards the north end of the house, at this point i said out load, o my this is not of this world, it heard me and started coming towards me. i panicked and ran into the house and locked the door and ran for the phone, i called three people to tell them to come to my house that i was scared and i wanted to leave and not be there by my self. i even called roger sugden whom everyone knows and had him and his wife on my phone for over a hour trying to calm me down. needless to say i did not go to sleep that night. the next day i told my son about it. he went over to the neighbors and they said they had been out side earlier and seen it too, they were walking a friend out to there vehicle. so i went over and asked her what she seen, she described the same thing and was a little freaked out by the whole thing too.

the sounds that i would hear airplanes in new york city make, but it had more of a \"wave\" to it, for lack of a better word. the object reappeared across the sky (to my right) and it was moving very

i can tell you that the plane was not in one of them. he was also flying rather low, 400 to 500 feet, if that. my attention was then briefly distracted to a point right above my window, where the second helicopter entered my field of view as it flew towards the other chopper. as i followed the new helicopter progress, i noticed it aiming for -and focusing its searchlight on- a flaming object, or rather, a cone/teardrop shaped object hovering horizontally [the tip was facing forward] right below and in front of the first helicopter. the ufo looked like a floating fireball, and on close inspection, i noticed it was covered in numerous short flames that seemed to come out of small nozzles distributed all along its surface. you could tell it wasn't a regular aircraft, the contrast with the lights, patterns, and manner of flight of the two helicopter was just striking. i first assumed it was a chinese lantern that had caught fire, or maybe a remote-controlled ufo toy, but it's size was rather big [helicopter size, at least] and its flight slow and on a level, in what felt like a controlled hover. i could follow the sounds and interferences of the two helicopters as they moved around, and not once i heard any sound other than those of the choppers. only then i recalled the numerous fireball reports that are everywhere these days, and thought '...So this must be what they call fireballs...' once i realized this, i hesitated a few seconds between staying glued to the window, waking up my wife for a second witness, or running for the video camera. i ran for the camera as the object was slowly coming my way [slowly heading north] it took me about 10 seconds to get back, and leaning on the glass, i zoomed all the way in [10x] and started taping the ufo. i could see the ufo had turned west by now, and the orange-yellow flames were now bright orange, still crawling to a slow pace [5 mph]. then in a few seconds, it seemed to pickup some speed and went totally red, then dark red. what happened next is hard to describe - it either turned off its fiery nozzles immediately [hard to do as it should still show some glow from heated elements] or flew away from me so fast it gave the impression of turning itself off. i looked for it straining my eyes to see if i could detect a shape in the dark, but nothing. right before this you could 'feel' the ufo, you knew something was there. but then it was gone, off, zipped, and you could feel the void. right after this vanishing act, the second helicopter left, while the first chopper remained in the area for another 20 minutes. \r\n\r\ni checked the short video, but for some reason the focus went crazy, possibly due to the low light conditions. that said, you can still see the ufo shrinking in size to a dot, pretty weird. i will try to upload it soon. also, i would love to get in touch with the couple that saw this vary same ufo in the area, it would be great to try to triangulate its position from out viewing points. although everything they reported matches to the dot with what i saw, i realized the dates and hours are different, so maybe there's a recurrent phenomenon here, maybe even a hi-tech prankster at work.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":52634,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.0567075,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12062013-0011","longitude":-118.3836653,"occurred":1386055680000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cone,   Fireball,   Teardrop,   Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1386378375000,"summary":"Flaming ufo chased by helicopters above pico-robertson area in los angeles - same ufo from case 52627!","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"90035","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":3,"locationName":"Los Angeles, California","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:218725"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Los Angeles","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Traveling north bound on the 101 freeway i noticed a red fireball with a tail and aura around it at my 2 o'clock. i brought it to the attention of my passenger as the object moved horizontally across the sky to our 11 o'clock, it appeared to slow down and hovered in place for about 45 sec. in that 45 sec the object lost its tail and seemed to diminish a bit resembling a red star.   the object then changed direction going out towards the atmosphere and gaining a tailing again as if picking up speed turned a bright red and disappeared.

first time a friend of mine saw it and said that it was just like a disc with some red-blue lights flashing or turning below...\r\n\r\n10 days ago me and my girlfriend were sitting and enjoy the night,and we saw a very bright white light just standing in the sky around a hill and that was fine...I thought it was some radio transmitter or something like that on the hill...But after 2-3 minutes the light started to move and we were watching,it just blink one time and then it just disappear...Not moving faster or something...But just disappear at front of our eyes...But at that time we didn't have anything to magnify...So i took my binoculars in my car in case to appear sometime again...In the mean time i bought a funny telescope for 30 euros to watch the moon and stuff so the telescope also was in my car...And tonight just tonight after exactly 10 days at the same time and the same place the same light appeared again...So my girlfriend took the binoculars and i went to the telescope even for 30 euros i assemble it in 15 seconds :) she was watching the light with the binoculars and i laid down on the ground wi! th the scope and i was searching for the light...The light again was just standing still at the sky...So while i was looking for it in the sky the light started slowly to go up in the sky...And i found it on the scope...When i set the scope magnification i was stunned....I saw a disc shape ufo...The ufo was moving little bit faster and faster...But tonight it doesn't disappear...Tonight was coming toward us..Actually above us...On height like a chopper fly...There was no sound at all !!!When it was flying above us i took the binoculars and saw it below the ufo...Now i was very very sure that it was disc shape with some red and blue and white lights just like my friend described 1 month ago...And believe me it was a sight to remember...This was my second time in my life to see it so close above me...The first time was in 1995 when there was an earthquake in this town...And back then it was pyramid shape...With very bright white lights below...From all ufo pictures around the! internet i haven't found pyramid shape ufo....Imagine a real ! pyramid- --just a little smaller,flying.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then

seconds later i saw a beam that was flashing (almost like lightning but straight up and down) and it would flash in the same spot every 30 or so seconds. it flashed for a few minutes and then it stopped.  i was a little creeped out so i called my family out side. when they came out i got out of my car and then realized that these beams were all around the neighborhood.   they saw the lights and we didnt know what to really think of them.  i left my moms to start driving home, a little up the street i had to turn left , once i turned left there were more beams everywhere, there were three really bright ones right in front of me, i stopped my car and tried to get my phone out of my pocket as fast as i could but when i looked up the three beams in the road were gone. ii was sad i couldnt get a picture of them but kept on driving.... i made a right and once i did there were probably fifty beams in an open field from the sky to the ground.... once i passed the field the beams of lights were gone.... i posted a status on my facebook and one of my friends saw the same lights in the same area of town.
