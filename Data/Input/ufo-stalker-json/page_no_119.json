she described were not like what i saw.I was not afraid when i saw the ufo today.I felt a calm resignation almost like i was supposed to see it.I only wished that i had seen what my mom and dad saw so

then went rapidly back to the original site of hovering. \r\nthis object appeared to be very far away but it was clearly not a celestial body. we remained on her deck viewing the lights for about 15 more minutes and then i left to return to my home in calais. when home, i told my father about the event and we both went outside to see if it was still visible. it was. i took still and digital video images. when i then viewed the stills on the computer, a chevron-shaped object, with lights on its' \"wings\" was clearly shown. i took multiple photos. what is interesting is that in images that showed the object, no stars were visible surrounding it. however, when i took photos in other parts of the sky, the stars were clearly visible in the photo images. nothing showed up in with the digital video function however.\r\ni would like to note that my father is a retired engineer, mit alumnus, very scientific, practical, and skeptical. he agrees we were viewing a ufo, something he has

described as a \"d with a triangle\" (but from his sketches has a similar shape to a stealth fighter, with no lights and no reflective surfaces.)  it made no sound and woke no one as it proceeded to the west and disappeared into the heavy cloud cover.  the entire incident took only thirty seconds or so, and did not give him time to get anyone else.  it terrified him and made him wonder if it was an ill omen.  i suspect fairchild airforce base might have run some kind of stealth drill over the town at night to see how quiet their new jet is or something, but the witness insists it did not look

that quick it was gone. we both saw it starting and ending at the same time. my husband states he saw it as i did and from the beginning until the end of the sighting. what we saw appeared to be metallic in color and was moving at a fast rate of speed. it appeared in the best way i can describe to have been traveling faster and only slowed down for seconds allowing us to see it momentarily before taking back off again. it had the appearance of a trail of itself as i would describe as if you were filming something like a car and it leaves an imprint of itself behind in a fuzzy image. when it took off it did so fast that it just appeared to have went behind an invisible wall. a few moments after that a black helicopter flew in the same general direction. we pulled over immediately when were able too just to gather our thoughts about what just happened and both of us felt an uneasy feeling as if we weren't supposed to see that. i have seen meteorites come in to the atmosphere
