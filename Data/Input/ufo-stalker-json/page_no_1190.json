it was a satellite but i have never seen a satellite that close before. the object appeared to be hovering i stopped my car and got out and took some pictures and a short video. i took pictures on my phone some with the zoom and some without as well i took a couple pictures with the flash some without, but i am not sure which are which. when taking the pictures the object was bopping around in and out of the frame, i thought it might be me but then i steadied my arm on my car and the same thing was happening. then my cell phone died, so i left and the object was still there, i returned to the same spot about an hour and a half later and it was gone. when i got home i plugged in my cell phone and it was showing

of mitchell, sd.  the sky was clear and the moon almost full.  about a mile ahead off to the right, i spotted 3 radio towers and began scrutinizing them waiting for the flashing red light required to alert small aircraft of their presence.  after a few seconds (5 or less) i noticed a sudden bright yellowish light strobe on and off quickly (1/10 of a second duration or less; probably hundredths of a second).  i quickly realized that it was not directly on top of the towers, but closer to me than were the towers.\r\n\r\ni wondered why i didn't see a red pulsating light, but rather this strobing topaz light.  about 3 seconds after the first \"flash\", it strobed again but was much closer, moving almost exactly opposite the direction i was travelling, but slightly angled towards the highway.  \r\n\r\nabout 3 seconds later, it flashed again.  i very briefly looked at the highway to ensure i was pointed well in my lane then looked directly to my right through the passenger window of the full-size pick-up truck i was driving hoping that i would see it one more time before i passed it.  \r\n\r\nit flashed one more time with a light of incredibly intensity with \"crystals\" of brilliant light that was gem-like; like topaz in color and luminosity on the bottom.  the light on the top was also of a crystalline structure and brilliance, but was pure white.  the white light was only the upper portion of the object and the \"crystals\" were shorter than the topaz ones that constituted most of the light phenomenon.  \r\n\r\nthe structure was only observed as an emanation of light.  it was not symmetric vertically, but appeared to have most of its mass on the bottom or larger half in a vertical sense.  the upper part that was white did not extend to the front or back of the largest horizontal dimension; the direction of travel.  it was only this last (4th) flash where it appeared closest to me that i could see that there were two different colors of light.  there was no sound then or a sound wake that followed.  based on the distance travelled in the space of time required, it must have been travelling at least 150-300 mph if not a little more.\r\n\r\nit wasn't until after the last flash that i did the \"math\" in my head and realized that a small plane would have displayed a red light at the tip of the port wing and a green at the tip of the opposite/starboard wing.  i lived less than a mile from a major airport for several years and observed many small aircraft and helicopters approach and depart at a close distance.  \r\n\r\nthe phenomenon being reported here was unlike anything i've ever seen, heard described, or have seen in pictures, videos, or depicted in drawings.  in just these immediate few seconds that followed the last flash, i realized that this was not something i know to be man-made; hence this report.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

about 75 degrees, at about 7:30 pm). we were on vacation from the 19th until the 27th of october (2013). i believe my estimation of the date of the photo is very close. my girlfriend's mom has a pretty nice backyard, and there is a gorgeous giant cactus just over her brick wall. the moon was out--and just about (if not completely) full. it was just a very nice scene and i have a 'photographer's eye' so i decided to snap a shot with our fuji 12.2 megapixel digital camera. i did not notice the object in the upper right hand of the frame until the next day. i initially believed it was just dust on the view screen, and tried wiping it off. it did not wipe off. i then utilized the 'zoom' feature on the camera and enlarged the spot on the frame where the object was. i became disturbed because it was not an airplane-it is obviously 'disc shaped', and looks as large or larger than a jet plane. no wings, or fuselage, or lights are visible at all. i actually took a photo of a jet plane the next night under very similar conditions and the difference is obvious. when i got back to jersey, i enlarged the shot as much as i could on my pc. i searched on the web for someone to send this picture to so it could be studied or verified. i found you guys and remembered hearing about mufon on a television show once. i hope this helps or interests you.

o'clock that was keeping pace with my piper at about 50 yards away. i veered slightly to the right to avoid any contact, but in a matter of moments the object closed the distance and was within 20

at the front of the closest store to mt. hermon road looking west towards highway 9 with the bonnydoon mountain behind. i saw what possibly appeared to be a plane slowly moving north a little bit above bonnydoon mountain from my angle. object was about 3/4-1.5 miles away aprox. what caught my eye is when it stopped for a few second then moved south then to the north a few times as it descended slightly sometimes hovering for a few seconds in between. at one point when it stopped the blue aura went away and then returned, it seemed to be a perfectly round sphere type object. after the object went north to south it stopped for another few seconds and then dropped strait down to the ground out of sight into the tree's. it appeared to have landed on the far side of highway 9 maybe about where the end of cooper street ends or at-least somewhere in that general area. there seemed to be a helicopter to the north of where this strange object went down and the helicopter was no more then 500ft above ground, it could have been a small plane as well, did not have a lot of time to look at it because it went out of sight and i heard no noise from either of the objects. there is a possibility that it could have been a rc helicopter with a weird light attached to it, but it sure did not seem like one. was definitely not a plane, real helicopter or anything i am used to seeing and it did seem to be intelligently controlled. if anyone else saw this or knows what this was please post what you know or saw, i would like to know what this was. one other wierd thing is that i seemed to forget about this event until later the same night when something that reminded me about it triggered the memory, could have just been me forgetting about it i dunno.

away, flying low and going out of site because it was flying below the tree line from my perspective.  i could see the back of it. it was traveling away from me, north, northeast.  it had a red light/glow in the center on the tail which seemed to be the propulsion.  it seemed to flicker. i called a friend that lived in the direction it was flying to tell him to look outside for it and then another smaller triangle came across the river so i hung up and i recorded it on my phone.  it was traveling west to east. this one was smaller but looked the same.  both had the red glow on the back.  the smaller one looked kinda like a stealth bomber flying really slow.  it flew faster than the first triangle. you can see the red glow on the back and you see it flicker out near the end of the video.  my feelings were of excitement but then later frustration because i didn't get the bigger triangle on video.  i wish i would have put my hazard lights on and just stopped on the bridge to

was out in my backyard off and on for most of the night of august 31st and well into the morning of september 1st. it was early morning september 1st of this year 2013 that i became a ufo believer. i say a ufo believer but i want to make it clear that i did not see an alien creature or little green men but that i did see a ufo up close and it was not from this world. that i do know at 54 years old and a star gazer my whole life like most other people that dream about what may be up there among the stars. i told my wife and all of my many friends about my ufo encounter for a couple of weeks or more until i decided to shut up. i was very disappointed that none of my friends or relatives or even my wife seemed to believe me. but really how could they believe me. they all thought that i had lost it. but my wife and all my friends know i do not shoot bull and i can not lie just like pinnoccio and they all know and respect that. it made everything a little frustrating for me. i have a small video that i managed to get while running down my street with my camera above my head trying to find the object in my screen. it was 3 o'clock in the morning and i was still quite shocked at what i had just witnessed prior to my bad idea of getting the camera. there are some cool pictures of the video frames blown up and the picture are a little frightening. when the ufo came straight at me from the north sky it looked like an orange circle or orange light bulb. i thought it may be some kind of science project from macmaster university or something like that or maybe some kind of hoax. it was certainly odd because at the time i noticed it, there was nothing but clouds in the sky and no stars to be seen. i continued to glare at this bright orange light that was getting larger and larger and seemed to be dropping from the sky as well as moving toward me very quickly. it maintained its large orange circle appearance until it stopped above the house across the street from me. at that point i could not see anything (including my house that i was standing right beside) but purple plasma that was firing out rapidly from the complete surface of the outer rim of the large orange circular glow that looked like the moon in front of me. it was breath-taking and i knew at that moment that i was actually seeing a ufo and not a hoax. there were many recent siting that i located on google after my sighting and i read many reports but i never read of anyone talking about the purple plasma and i believe it never got close enough to the other ufo sighters to see the plasma. i also believe the plasma is what disrupts any signal it may give off to detect its presence in the sky. the plasma was electric and moving frantically. it may have been scanning me or something like that as it sat above the house across the street for more than a few seconds. i wasn't sure what to do at that moment. when i finally moved my feet to run and get my camera in the house, the ufo seemed to rotate or shift and then began to move straight west. i ran as fast as i could in through the back door and out the front door with my camera in my hand. i was running down the street and looking down at the camera to make sure i had it set to video because it was too far for a picture or flash shot. i am a camera picture taking fanatic and my camera is usually at my side or always close. what a mistake that was getting the camera. i should have run out to the front of my house and forget about the camera to continue watching because i missed a few seconds that i could have viewed and because the footage is much like other footage i had viewed on google. the video footage shows the orange glow moving away from me higher up and a lot farther away. there is a small sparkle that appears very close to it at all times. i have what may be a picture of the sparkle up close. the sparkle object reflects different colored lights much like the flashing lights on the bottom of an airplane. it also seemed to me that the sparkle may be the large orange ufo's guidence system ... gps. i researched as much as i could the next day and many days after for any other sightings at the same time as the siting i had seen. when i came out the front door that night to see where it was located in the sky, and where to point my camera, i could almost see a structure behind the circular orange glow as it traveled away from me and was getting smaller in size. it almost looked like a robot type shape behind the big orange glow as i believe i was viewing the backside of the object. the visual overpowering front side may be a smokescreen or cammileon of some sort, hiding the structure that is behind the orange circular glow. with the endless shooting purple plasma surrounding the orange circular face when it was right in front of me, makes me believe it knew i was there. i am a weather guy of sorts and watch the weather channel often as it relates to the clouds and sky activity. i say that because i am located in a unique area of our city for sky activity. i am located at the foot of a small mountain behind me and a valley beside me. i am located right beside hydro wires and towers as well as an airport up on the hill behind me and straight above me are at least 3 major wind roadways that are always there and that produce some of the most beautiful sunset skies and cloud formations on the planet when the 3 winds meet in the sky. when i researched for other ufo sighting, i discovered that the main criteria for many sightings are airports and hydro towers and lines. i have looked up in the sky repeatedly every night since and i am starring up more than ever. my fear now is that i will see it again and that may be it for me. i have some questions of my own regarding the whole experience. i wonder if it is possible that i may have received some radiation from the closeness of the craft and perhaps it is detectable on my body or in my blood. i know that i was a little tired for a while there with no real explanation. for those who have had a close experience there is the question of will it come back and take me. are there more and what are they doing. is there an eminent attack from another race being planned. why can't people get better proof of these objects or aliens. i have wanted to write down my sighting for a long time now and i am glad that it is done. i know it must be frustrating for other fellow ufo sighters to get anyone to believe you and i hope my experience helps to ease the frustration a little. i believe you. i really do. i have added the short video that i was able to capture and some of the frames of the video blown up. i believe now that there must be plenty of evidence out there of ufo activities but the government does not know how to explain it all to us the people. keep watching the skies and take care.

military and a bit of an aviation enthusiast so am quite familiar with most of the aircraft in our skies. \r\non sunday evening my girlfriend and i were travelling home from my sisters in stirling, along the m9 southbound en route to glasgow. at the same time my girlfriend and i became aware of a large gold light above the gargunnock hills. living under the flight path to glasgow airport i am familiar with aircraft landing lights and am fairly positve they are seldom gold and don't remain in the same location. or shine with the intensity these light were shining with. we watched these lights for 30 seconds, then from left to right, anti clock wise they blinked out. one after an other. we could see the silhouette of the hills below so can be sure they weren't from the ground. whilst illuminated the lights were in an almost disc configuration although quite flat at the bottom and were angled up, at what appeared to be almost 45 degrees to the ground. the gold light seemed to twinkle, as if there was more than one and they were shinning in succession before blinking out over a 5 second period. very strange. \r\nanyway, felt compelled to report it as i have never seen anything like it. i spend a lot of time looking at the planets both through a telescope and without, it was way too early for venus. the sighting occured around 19.30pm.","distance":"Over One

intersections.  but at this time, it was late on a sunday evening.  my husband was following directly behind me in his car.  there were few cars on the street along with us at this time.  this short stretch of neighborhood area has few street lights.  an object caught my eye on the right side of the street.  at first, i thought it was a street light.  then i noticed that it was a bright/glowing red orange object that was gliding at tree level.  it crossed our path.  i got to witness it up close as it crossed right in front of me.  the only way i can describe it, is that looking out my windshield from inside, it was about the size of a large car.  the object was glowing red from within and had a bright colorful haze around it.  it seemed to be in the shape of a tear drop sphere but it was so bright.  i would've gotten a good recording if i had had my phone out.  i slowed down and rolled my window down so that i could point out the object to my husband. it made no sound as it glided straight across.  i pulled over to the first parking lot i found and i was able to watch it until it disappeared.  this definitely is a populated area that i witnessed it in.  it was coming from an area that is somewhat isolated (south) but going towards the highly populated area (north).  it was not a fireball with a tail and it was not falling from the sky.  it was gliding across the sky at a low level and moderate speed.  i only saw one object but i kept looking around to see if i could see anything else.  when i got home, my husband confirmed that he too had seen the object.  i believe people when they say they witnessed things but i never thought i would see one on my own.
