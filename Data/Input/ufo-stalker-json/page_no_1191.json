blvd, and east cherry street. central islip, ny, 11722.\r\n\r\nwhilst returning to my home in long island, ny. from work in queens ny, i was one block away from my house, while on nichols blvd and east cherry street, i was observing the moon in its quarter period at 03.13am on the morning of may 4, 2013, looking towards the eastern sky while driving south, a bright light like a star caught my eyes on the left of the moon at about 40 degrees apart, \r\n \r\nthe light began glowing and twinkling and appeared to be shifting about, as it form bigger than the point of light as it first appeared, it look like it was heading towards my direction to the west and began to get bigger and changing colors, it first looked white and then start changing into an orange, redish, greenish and black color and radiating, it appeared to be the size of my fist outstretched and it then explode into a bigger fireball which began to travel along the ecliptic plane in a southernly direction in many pieces of fireballs,\r\n\r\nfrom that point of viewing while pulling of to the side of the road the object appeared to be breaking up with glowing debris separating from the main object, at that point i then  remembered to use my phone camera to get a picture, but i then realized that it was charging, by the time i unplug and turn on the phone thinking it was in the video camera mode. i turned the camera towards the objects dis-interagrated into points of light going south. \r\n i was a very disappointed after realizing that the camers was in the still shot mode and i did not get a clear picture to show to my family and friends as proof of my sighting, the one picture i took i then sent, 2 text messages out, one to my friend and co-worker allan asencio and my wife judy phillip.\r\n\r\nthe following days i began to look at the various news channel and you tube, and nasa, for any reports of this fireball, and nothing was found to be related, what i saw is unique to me, but no proof of the sighting make the reporting obsolete.\r\n\r\ni am compelled from within myself to post this observation at this later date of the sighting, from may 3rd 2013 to today, dec 3rd 2013, what i saw is awesome to me, and i hope that some one, somewhere did observe this event, and with the expertise and access to investigate by mufon from nasa / esa, maybe some light can be shed on this subject,i stand by my obervations, maybe a super nova that occured millions of years ago, now being visible, i would like to know,

we noticed something shiny in the sky above us (a bit north) so we used the camera to focus on it and take a photo. checked the camera to see if we got a photo and then went to take another photo but the object was gone. we were seeing planes in the sky the entire time we were there and they all were very clearly leaving vapour trails. this object was not. additionally, it was stationary while we saw it. it was there for one minute and gone the next. husband's report on the photo:\r\n\r\n\"basically, this is the canon raw file loaded into photoshop for pre-processing (contrast tweaked a bit so it's easier seen). the top image is the entire photograph, the focus point is centered directly on the \"object\". taken right at sunset, so the sun was reflecting off this object. jets in the atmosphere were producing contrails this evening, there is no associated contrail with the \"object\", and it was also extremely \"high up\", which leads me to believe it was outside of our atmosphere. however, it's too big to be a satellite and iss' orbit didn't take the station overhead of us this evening, so it's not iss. the second image is the photographed zoomed into 100%, centered on the object, and the third image is zoomed into 400% (as far as it'll go). showing a \"boomerang\" shape. so... we have a boomerang shaped object reflecting sunlight and outside of the atmosphere... and it was a fast shutter, 1/400th, and taken at 400mm. interesting to note, that spacex did launch a falcon 9 rocket from florida this evening however it's definitely not the falcon 9 rocket, or the ses-8 payload that was launched this evening. my camera thinks it's currently 8:26am, and the actual time is 7:26p. the raw file is timestamped at 6:11am, which means it was taken at 5:11pm. the

25, 2013. my husband called me to come outside to the back yard. every day and into the night he has an hourly smoke on the back porch, so he is very familiar with the skies and flight paths ect. anyway, he pointed out a stationary ufo which had blue and white or very light yellow flashing lights around the perimeter. it was about 8 to 10 miles away in the south and 400 feet above us. it was hovering above a forested hill and was there for at least two minutes.\r\nwithin 4 seconds it was over us. there was a very bright white light underneath and you could barely see the blues on the edges anymore due to its location to us. however the smaller lights around the large white one almost seemed recessed as it flew above us. the back lights were more distinct in their outline. my husband believed it to be triangular in shape. he had been outside in the dark longer so his eyes were able to see edges better than mine.\r\nit was difficult to determine size due to the fact that we could not see the elevation. however, given the following perhaps you could make a calculation of how high it was: our property is 150 feet long, so looking up from underneath the ufo, it was covering at least 75 feet of the property and the probably 35 feet of the 45 foot width of the property. it seemed to come directly from the mountain south of us which is a good 400 feet or more above us and 10 miles away from us. it moved south to north and its acceleration was not uniform as it was stationary over the mountain and then was upon us in 4 seconds (so 10 miles in 4 seconds), it slowed when directly over us, it didn���t hover but it slowed enough for us to get a good look and be able to agree on a uniform description. it accelerated again, however it was slower than a jet but much faster than a small plane or copter. \r\ni cannot emphasis enough how large the center light was in proportion to the vehicle and how white and brilliant the light was, it was amazing. if we had stared at the light itself for any time we would have been blinded by it.\r\nat 6:35pm my husband witnessed another similar object move to the northwest and he only saw it's edges which were also rimmed with lights. this moved so fast that he could not yell for me to come and see it.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1

base in indiana. we decided to work things out so i started spending time with her at her house. the time these events occurred happened during a weekend but i can't recall the exact date but it was sometime in september 2013. we were inside the house watching tv and we heard what sounded like thunder so i went outside to check out what i thought was a thunderstorm. i could see what seemed to be a large thunderstorm heading straight towards us, our prevailing wind at that time of year comes from the southwest so i'm going to say that it was coming from the southwest heading northeast. but without actually being there with a compass in my hand i cannot verify for sure that was the correct direction. it seemed like a very intense storm to me so i decided to watch it as it came in as i am infatuated with watching storms. as i watched the wind picked up and i would say that it was blowing a steady 20mph and gusting to 30mph. after watching the storm for about 30 minutes i noticed that it was still hovering in the exact same place, directly over crane naval base. i then started to pay closer attention to the lightning, it was rhythmically pulsing a flash about every 10 seconds. it would do this for a couple minutes and then it would just randomly start to flash. i never seen any actual bolts of lightning just the light inside the clouds which at some points looked to be very low to the ground. the thunder was very loud and deep, rolling out a very long time and every now and then it would give off a sudden very loud bang of thunder. the atmosphere and the air felt electrified and just very thick and heavy. it was seemingly difficult to breathe at times and i felt somewhat dizzy at times while watching this. i watched this for probably 3 hours steady, until midnight or a little after when my wife made me come to bed. i was woke up several times throughout the night by the thunder and each time i got up and went outside and it was exactly the same as when i first started watching it at around 9 pm. i woke up about an hour before dawn and watched it until daylight and it was like you flipped a switch at daylight the whole thing stopped and the sky cleared up. the next night the exact same thing happened only my wife joined me in watching this time. as this was happening we decided to check the local radar and although there was what seemed to be a severe thunderstorm happening the news showed clear sky's. i attempted to video this on my phone and my camera malfunctioned and would not work, my wife's camera was also malfunctioning on her phone so we were unable to record this at all. i was able to take one photo at the very beginning of the edge of this storm right at dusk. we were unable to use our cameras after this photo was taken. i feel personally as if the government was conducting some kind of weather modification experiment as this happened 2 nights in a row and the storm just hovered over the naval base and started at dark and abruptly ended at daylight.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

sold our house and were getting ready to move so our bed was just a mattress on the floor. i like to fall asleep listening to something in my headphones, so i was lying in bed trying to fall asleep listening to coast to coast am. i have trouble sleeping ever since coming back from iraq. i know i had been lying there for at least an hour because of how far along in the show it was. i wasn't even sleepy yet so i was just listening intently to the show with my eyes closed when the audio started going in and out. it was then that the feeling that i wasn't alone came over me. i was lying on my ride side with my wife to my back, i opened my eyes and the room was lit in a pale orangish glow. i rolled over towards my wife and that was when i saw 3 typical grey aliens standing in my master bathroom about 5 feet from my wife's side of the bed. i couldn't make out their faces. but i knew what they were from their big heads and how thin they were. i could see their outlines perfectly because of the orange glow that was emanating from the bathroom window that they were standing in front of. i could tell they were wearing some kind of tight fitting suit that was a darker color than their grey skin. i immediately started screaming, \"what the f%$#, what the f%$#!\" as i grabbed my wife in fear. she woke up and started screaming and then broke into prayer in here first language, romanian. the 3 entities de-materialized into 3 orange glowing balls and floated through the walls of the bathroom. my wife was screaming,\" what's going on.\" the orange glow faded quickly as soon as the last orb passed through the wall. about 3 seconds later there were 3 quick bright flashes of white light that came through all 4 of the windows in the bedroom and it was over. we had a room mate that shared a wall with our bedroom that never even woke up and i was screaming like i was in the middle of a firefight. my wife and i got up and looked out of the windows immediately but saw nothing. needless to say i didn't sleep the rest of the night.
