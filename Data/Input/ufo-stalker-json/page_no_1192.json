she go's crazy trying to get our son away from the house! the jet appeared to us at that time to really be crash landing on us and our house? at first the jet was high and looked like a normal plane in trouble? when we first spotted the jet it was maybe 500 ft. off the ground? the strange thing was it seemed to come down fast then we looked up again and it appeared to just come to a dead stop in air? the other most crazy and amazing thing was we heard nothing no sound at all coming from the engines?  now because of the strange no sounds? we froze and just watched this huge floating military cargo jet airplane with huge jet engines and wings just floating right for us. the jet got very very close then banked right and floated right passed us with still no sound coming from nothing? the jet was so silent you could hear the wind passing over her wings. at this time the jet was 50 ft. from the ground? and the distance from us to the jet \"line of sight\" was maybe 100 yards or closer? the jet moved passed us very slow and very close. guessing the speed was 5 mph. still watching the jet but now from the tail end and we noticed the thing had to climb to get over the 100 acres of woods and trees just 700 yards behind our house. folks let me say again this huge flying military looking cargo jet was below tree top level and floating over our house in the middle of the country with no people no building no nothing just me and my wife and son? \"and no sounds\"  \"please tell me how can a military c-17 cargo jet float in air?\"  \"also let me say we thought it was over? we thought at first this thing was crashing on us and our lives was over including my sons life? we were very very scared!\" we did noticed the jet had no identifying numbers of any kind? i only seen a white star on the tail fin. the windows and cabin area was all blacked out. the body of the jet including the wings and engines and all the other parts was all dull black. i cannot be 100% for sure but the closest we can get is a boeing c-17 cargo jet airplane. it was like watching a floating city come over your house in daylight with no sound?

4 minutes when it disappeared and reappeared to the right of where i had originally saw it. it the made a 90 degree turn and flew in almost a zig zag pattern and then disappeared kind of like a shooting star. while all this was happening, the other object remained stationary for about 4-5 minutes longer. it continued to pulse during this time but at one point it disappeared for about 10-15 seconds and then reappeared in the same spot for about another minute and then disappeared for good.\r\ni'd like to add that i'm an amateur astronomer/star gazer and have never seen anything like this. ever. i'd also like to add that it was very very cloudy tonight and there were no aircraft in the sky at this time. it was very quiet and these objects made no noise whatsoever.\r\ni'm a 30 year

i was suppose to file a report with after witnessing a ufo and it led me here.. that was the first thing that came to mind. i immediately tried to write a report with my phone but it wouldn't work

up into the night's sky i thought to myself, \"i cannot believe in all my years i have never seen a ufo\" when on que i saw a bright, well-lit object emanating three distinct lights from the front of it; red, green and white, blinking in a pulsating pattern from its right to left, flying in from the tree line, towards my direction.  this object was flying very slowly and rather closely to the ground, and appeared to be slightly descending.  i followed it to my front yard where i observed the object already sitting stationary above my neighbor's house across the street.  the object was not literally above my neighbor's house, but its placement from where i stood appeared to be above my neighbor's house.  in reality, it was most likely towards or in the defiance area if not further, as opposed to in st charles.  \r\nwhile watching this object, i happened to notice a second lighted object, similar to the first, also sitting stationary in the air to its left.  i do not know from where it came or for how long it had been there before noticing it, but soon after i watched it fly back toward the tree line, from where i saw the first object fly in from.  again it flew low enough, even lower in fact, that i was able to see it was black, had v shaped louvers, had four lights; two sets of lights each; one in front, one in back; one row red and other white.  when i turned around to see what the first object was doing however, i saw that an identical object had already replaced the very object i just watched fly away!  this happened maybe four to six more times before the initial craft i first saw left and for the night.   the first crafts was the last to leave.\r\ni also saw a third light in the sky during the times these other lights and crafts were hovering.  this one though, was just a red light, going back and forth from the center object to the side objects.  to me, it looked like acting as if a watch dog.\r\n\r\nafter all the excitement was gone from the front yard, i went to the back door downstairs to see if i could view anything left in the sky from behind the house.  i opened the door and heard something that startled me, so i instantly closed the door and ran upstairs.  suddenly then the air became so electrically charged that it was almost suffocating for me.  i kept waving my arms in the air as if to push something off my back, because it literally felt like something attached itself to me.  sounds crazy i know, but no more crazier than what i had just witnessed.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe very next night the lighted object was seen virtually in the same place.  it has been seen two nights more, equaling four nights altogether.  its placement is virtually in the same area, give or take several miles.  it appears to come anywhere around 5:30,

and a half, slowly descending towards the north, disappearing at about 30 degrees above the horizon. it looks like it rotates around with a flashing red light on the top, and when it rotates, there is like a black line down the middle, like it separates in half - almost like what an amoeba or a cell looks like when it divides, but then it seems to merge together again.  \r\n\r\nseveral days into

small children) i got out my phone and decided to tape a little.  i said, \"okay, if we're communicating, then move.\"  it disappeared immediately.  i was nonplussed and moved my camera around looking and suddenly realized the light had jumped about 25 degrees to the right.  i laughed because it seemed like a game to me.\r\n\r\ni have this on tape, but i'm sort of nervous about posting it.  the night after it happened i came home and there were two military helicopters circling our neighborhood for about two hours.  i've lived in this area for a long time and i'm used to military air craft but i had never seen anything like that before.  it rattled me, because i think they were looking for something and i think it had to do with the sightings.\r\n\r\nseveral nights after my post i was watching the \"star\" and, because we are near to ft. bragg, i was looking around to see if there was any other activity in the air.  i was sitting on a swing set in my backyard and staring straight up when it seemed like the stars were wobbling.  as i watched, i compared the position of the stars to the trees that were stable and noticed that it seemed as if the stars were \"off.\"  looking in this area made my eyes ache as if i were looking at a bright light but it was dark so it seemed weird that my eyes were hurting.  as i watched to figure out what was going on, the edges of something huge and black were barely noticeable but the backdrop of stars would suddenly look normal as if something camouflaged had moved past them so i was seeing the real thing.  then i noticed that the \"stars\" were moving in concert with one another and then i thought that it might be some huge cloaked object with lights made to look like the stars -- maybe stealth technology?  but there was absolutely no noise and it was bigger than anything in the sky i've ever seen.  i don't know how close it was because there was really no reference point.  if it were as high as a regular airplane flies, it is gigantic.\r\n\r\nthen a few nights ago i went to robeson county for thanksgiving, not really thinking about my friend or anything but when i stepped outside there it was.  i was delighted because i feel excited every time i see any of them.  the sky is much clearer out there in the country and i noticed there were a lot more of those \"stars\" but they seemed smaller or further away.  they were moving around.  there were also several of the lights that moved together, making it look like there were a lot of those large dark ships in the sky.  some of the lights were directly above us and when we would say hi they would sparkle on and off.  i finally broke down and got some binoculars from walmart to try to see what the friend looked like.  it is like a roundish cell of dancing light divided down the middle, but you can't always see the black line because it rotates.  finally i said, \"i'd like to see what you are because i can't tell.\" then it turned and looked like a ring of prism fire.  the best way to describe it is it looked like an eclipse looks like when a planet blocks out the sun, like a black hole in a strange fire.  then it rotated again and looked like the glob of light again.\r\n\r\njust now (nov. 30th at about 10 p. m.) i went outside to see if any of them are out.  the one i usually see is not visible, but there is one in the eastern sky.  it is very bright but smaller than the one i usually see.  it also is bright white with a red light.  \r\n\r\ni have no idea what any of this means.  i want to let everyone know this stuff is real, take it from the former ultimate skeptic.  i'm still trying to explain it but the more i see the harder i get.  i wish others in this area would start watching and try to help me understand what in the world it all is.  however, i have to say i have felt weirded out but ultimately i feel very friendly with them, as if they are pen pals that i finally am getting the chance to meet in real life.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":52529,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.7837883,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11302013-0018","longitude":-79.2983104,"occurred":1385625600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North

not move at all.  it hovered completely motionless even when the car passed under it.  this happened around 4:40 p.M. and as soon as i got home i reported it to fox 11 news as well as some other

was a perfect circle of blackness with a slight glow around the edges. after a while (about 30-45 minutes) this object simply disappeared. shortly after we were called back to baracks. eventhough i never seen any landing or flight of this object - it probably scared our military high command quite a lot. enough to call out all the battalions in the area to high alert.\r\ni realize that this
