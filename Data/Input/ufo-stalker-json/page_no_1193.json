exceptionally strange, but i did see a lot of small bright orbs zipping and whizzing around. at first i thought it to be a meteor shower. they seemed to be appearing and then disappearing as if to go in and out of phase. was this a type of cloak? i went back inside to get my my wife and a pair of binoculars around 5:00 pm. after returning to my front porch there was a very bright star like object in the southern sky. nothing had been there before i went inside. it seemed that it just appeared out of nowhere. i viewed the object through the binoculars and it looked like those smaller objects had attached themselves into a cluster on the outside of this larger object.  i think the larger object was in stealth mode or possibly out of phase until it suddenly appeared. the large object was shining bright and slowly rotating. it looked to be sending a white beam of light out to the sides and also down to the ground. the large object was definitely a huge triangle, it looked to be jet black with hundreds of what appeared to be orbs attached around the edges. they almost looked like windows. weird stuff for sure. the small orbs would detach , zip around, and then reattach to the main ship. after i went inside both my wife and i felt real light-headed and nausea stricken. my wife even threw up. strange indeed. i am going to have to get mufon up here to record this while i can

when i went out to the front driveway. i saw my neighbor jack, a very old african american man, standing a few feet into the street between both our houses. jack's house was adjacent to my mom and dads house. anyway, i walked out to see what he was doing. i always visited with jack because he had this insect collection in a fish aquarium in his garage and i always found it interesting to look at them.  jack always hung out in his garage. he would sit on a folding beach chair and just smoke or listen to his radio i guess. anyhow, this time i saw jack doing something a little different. he was just standing in the street gazing up at the sky. i walked over and asked him what he was doing. he said to take a look up or maybe he motioned with his hand and pointed. that part i don't remember, but the part i do remember is when i looked up at the sky and immediately saw two silvery discs visible between some white clouds. they were completely still,motionless. jack must have seen them originally from his garage and probably saw them there for some time but i only saw them for a few seconds. they looked slightly smaller than the size of a dime actually, each of them. \r\nit was mesmerizing to see them. for the few seconds i saw them, they surely burned themselves into my memory forever. especially when they rotated at about a 40 to 45 degree angle and shot up between the clouds at an unbelievable speed. they blurred or flashed out of view up through the clouds and it was all over as fast as it started for me. i was so excited to have seen such a thing that i ran into the house and excitedly told my mom and dad that i just saw two discs in the sky and i told them what they did and that jack saw them too, but they really didn't care or believe me i think. i'm now 45 years old and i can still see those discs up there clear as a bell. silver, no detail, no apparent engines, no noise, no surface detail visible whatsoever. they were simply and purely two silvery discs that demonstrated amazing gravity defying and speed capability and it was impressive as hell. i will never say it's technology from some place other than earth,i can't possibly know that. thinking about it today, i feel it's very possible that some group here on earth figured out how to do this and so that's where i stand. i know flying discs are real, they do exist because i saw them with my own eyes and so did someone else standing right next to me. those were machines constructed by someone out there.

brightness white light that was pulsating. when the white light was 'turned off' it was a small bluish light, pale blue, then, the light would ' grow' into a brighter larger white light, then the white light would shrink back to the small bluish white light and grow again to bright white light... i noticed it to the east and it was moving southeast to northeast. at first, i thought is was a plane or helicopter. something was different about it, so it caught my attention and i kept looking at it. i also followed it. at this point, i no longer thought it was a plane or helicopter but a ufo. so, instead of going home, i followed it for a few minutes until i couldn't follow it anymore. i went to school road park and it flew over the trees and i lost it. i decided to go back home, so i kept driving straight on school road park to turn onto orville road and head back home. to my amazement, there was the object again, now visible over a clearing... however, it was not going in that direction before i lost it. it would have had to have 'jumped' to get to that new position in the sky from where i last saw it to be where i saw it now. weird. anyhow, it flew over route 309 and i couldn't follow it any longer. i wanted to get it on video with my phone, but as i was fumbling with my phone, i didn't want to take my eyes off of the object, i didn't want to miss anything. it happened rather quickly and i didn't have chance to catch it on video with my phone. for now on, i will have my phone ready for these things.

he could and i asked him to get the binoculars out of the rv. \r\nwe could see it but i saw two flashing items. but we could see it and it was no plane. i went to the house to get our nephew. he came

take and yes it is jerky it show the object changing colors fast. i did try to contact the local news by sending an email, but nothing. i was hoping to have some one else see it. we did think it might be a plane until one flew right towards it and then headed northeast. not a blimp. it was clearly round and was not connected to anything. it was bright and there was no shadows. the object its self had a haze about it. i was able to focus on a pattern and watch things follow a path.\r\nafter an hour we went inside and after anther hour it was still there. it had just moved towards the southwest.

to finish changing my tire, when i noticed an oval shaped object inside a fog like cloud. i joked to myself that it was a ufo over downtown knoxville, and thought wouldn't that be something? i pulled out my cell phone and took a picture, then zoomed in and took a second picture. sorry no landmarks at bottom, my finger covered part of the lens. there were two planes moving around the object one turning above the object, i could see a flash of his wings as he turned, the second was flying next to the object, leaving a trail behind it.I could not i'd the planes, too small, but concidering it was flying at a 45 degree angle, over a city, i assume it was a military plane. note, there were storms in the background, and there was supposed to be a full moon, but i did not see it. i thought maybe it was a reflection of the moon, but it was just before sunup,still twilight outside. and the object changed from oval to round as it turned downward inside the cloud. there is a dark area at the top right of the circle which looked almost like a w, without the middle section of the letter. it also had some white lines which to me looks like the cloud is rolling upon the downward edge of the craft. i estimate that the jets moved from 10,000 feet to about 25,000 feet within 2 minutes time. and if that is correct, it would make the object between 2 and 3 miles wide. it appeared disc shaped with the top side almost glowing white, and the outer ring black, with a curved edge. i took the two photos, and the repairman yelled at me, and i went and took a few pics of my damaged tire, and went back to look at the object in the cloud again, and it seemed to have disappeared , but the cloud still gloed a little, as if the object was flat, but i could no longer see it. my question is ..Why would 2 planes be around it if there wasn't anything there? also, i watched the weather that evening which had a radar from morristown, tennessee, and thought i saw a blip on the radar during the time lapse radar report. i would like to get a copy of that report. it was there about 2 minutes, then was gone. i have two photos.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

there are also several small rural airports for single engine planes and helicopters in the area, along with air traffic from philadelphia, trenton-mercer, atlantic city, north jersey & new york area airports.  after the time change in early november, the large number of air traffic in the sky has caught my attention on my ride home, but this encounter was different from what i'm used to seeing.\r\n\r\nconditions: night/dark, clear skies (if there were clouds they were not noticeable or did not play a part in what i saw because i don't remember them and there were lots of stars).\r\n\r\nmy encounter:  driving home from work on november 20, 2013 at approx 18:15 hrs, i was headed south on route 206 in southampton, nj (usa) approaching the area of main street/retreat rd intersection, when i noticed an object flying about the same speed as a small single engine aircraft off to about my 1 o'clock view (south/southwest part of sky).  there are several small rural airports for small size aircraft in the vicinity so i initially thought i was seeing a small single engine airplane lining up for landing at one of them.  \r\n\r\nthe object was flying (sort of) toward me, headed north/northeast.  the object almost reached main street and made a quick 180 degree turn flying back toward red lion rd, headed south/southwest again.  as i passed main street, trees along route 206 started occasionally blocking my view, but in between breaks in the trees i was able to see it make two more quick turns flying in a criss-cross pattern over the wooded and farm areas in the vicinity of red lion & hilliards bridge rds before disappearing from my view again.  i initially assumed it was a plane positioning itself to land at the red lion airport, but the sudden quick turns i witnessed from the craft and the triangle light pattern on the underside of the craft left me puzzled.  \r\n\r\nas i continued travelling down route 206, each time there was a clearing/opening in the trees i would see the aircraft.  i kept watching toward the airport to see if i could catch it landing when the trees opened up again.  as i approached the area of ridge rd i realized the craft was now headed in a path that would cross over route 206, from approx west/southwest toward east/northeast.  it had also slowed down quite a bit and, as i got closer, i realized it was going to cross over the highway right over top of me.  at this point i also realized the craft was much larger than a small single engine plane.  because we are in close proximity to the military base and this is the exact location where i've encountered military aircraft positioning themselves for landing i now assumed it was military aircraft.  i opened my sun/moon roof and cracked my windows so i could hear the 'plane' as it went over me.  \r\n\r\nas we intersected each other the craft seemed a little slower and lower than what i am used to seeing on this flight path.  it had an engine noise, but was much quieter and had less of a rumble than the usual large military aircraft i've had fly over me before.  i could see a small portion of the underside of the aircraft between the three bright white lights and it appeared to be same color and/or pattern (maybe panels?) i would expect to see on the underside of a large airplane.  the silhouette against the night sky also appeared that the object itself was triangle in shape with one solid white light at each corner, explaining the triange light pattern.  after the object flew over me it took about 15 seconds (give or take a couple seconds) to reach the red lion circle where the sky is much more open.  as i went around the circle and looked back to where i would expect the object to be flying i could not locate this aircraft again.  \r\n\r\ni consider myself to be a skeptical person, but i am opened to the possibility of unexplained experiences.  after thinking about it, several things did not make sense to me.  1) the initial flight pattern i witnessed seemed too quick and sudden for this large of an aircraft.  2) i wondered the possibility i had seen two different aircraft, but i really do not think so.  the light pattern is what caught my attention.  the three solid, bright, white lights in a triangle pattern with no other lights.  all aircraft i remember seeing usually have at least one or more blinking lights somewhere on the plane, sometimes in a different color.  this did not.  3) the craft was also flying much lower and slower than usual, since it was still several miles (maybe even 10 or more miles) to the runway at jbmdl.  4) where did it go when i looked back for it about 15 seconds after it flew over me?  4) i also thought about the possibility it was a drone since there is a lot of talk about drones these days.  it seemed a little larger than i would expect of a drone, but i don't know a lot about them.  it did have an engine sound, although quieter and less of a rumble than i would normally expect from aircraft of that size.  technology is ever changing, so who knows.  \r\n\r\nat this point i have not been able to put a name to what i saw, so it is (to me) a ufo.  would love to know if there is a valid explanation or if anyone else saw what i saw that night.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

waved goodbye and turned to walk to the car.  overhead there was a commercial aircraft in final approach to the nearby nashville airport, probably just under 1000 feet.  as we were hearing the sound of their jets, we both looked up and saw what looked like a southwest airlines plane.  as our angle of vision fell to about 45 to 35 degrees from the zenith angle above us, my girlfriend and i both saw the glow of 3 orange/red lights in a triangular formation.  at first it looked like 3 lights on the tips of what would have been a tremendous singular entity, but after 2 or 3 seconds, i decided that they were 3 separate entities flying in a formation.  as they moved from the northwest to the northeast across the sky with moderate speed, a 4th, 5th and 6th light appeared to come into view from the same northwestern position, following the path and at the same speed, except that the 4th, 5th and 6th lights were in a row with considerable distance between them, like periods of ellipses with a lot of space between them.  the lights themselves were a constant brightness the entire time they were visible, with a large steady broadcast rather than a pulse, blink, fireball, afterburner or alternating frequency.  my first thought was that it was the astra tr-3b at a very low altitude, but then my second thought was that it was a military helicopter formation.  upon further thought though, at that distance we should have heard some sort of noise had they been helicopters.  as it moved towards the east, it passed behind some tall trees and the triangle was gone.  behind it trailed the 3 lights in a linear row, 1 of which at some point in view turned its light off and thus disappeared without seeming to change direction or leave its flight pattern.  we all watched as the last of the lights faded behind the trees.  i would not have filed this report except that my girlfriend googled something about lights in the sky in nashville, and someone else had filed what sounds like this same set of circumstances but from much further east, in hendersonville nc.

period.\r\n\r\npart 1.)\r\n 1977, dark, very clear, quiet, spring evening. suburbia, 45 minutes north-west of manhattan, ny, usa. i was age 18, sober, waiting outside for my friend's mom to pick me up for a weekend trip. \r\ntopography: standing on the east-side of the bottom of a valley running straight north-south where a commuter train and nearby highway run parallel; creating a clear view looking south-west. \r\n i observed in the sky, at a distance of approximately less than 1/4 mile, a steady flashing red light moving either straight down or directly toward me. i assumed it was a helicopter but heard no noise. i did however, very clearly hear intermittent vehicular traffic which was coming from a farther distance within the valley. the flashing red lights moved downward, slow, straight, and steady until reaching an altitude of approximately 100-200 feet. then the object stopped and hovered motionless at which time the red light changed to blue and stopped flashing. after several minutes i ran inside the house to tell my parents who were watching tv; they were asleep so i didn't wake them. less than 10 minutes later the blue light began flashing and moved due south away from me at a slow steady rate, then out of site.\r\n\r\npart 2.) \r\n i started scanning the sky for more activity but the only objects observed were at a very high altitude. there were 3 white lights, which i thought were jet-liners flying in completely  different sections of the sky.  i continued walking around the front yard trying to scan as much of the sky as possible, from different angles. over the course of several minutes the only thing moving in the sky were those same three jet-liners which now appeared to be moving toward each other; but at that great distance i had no perspective as to their relative distance or altitude from one another. those 3 lights kept moving on a course, and at the same steady rate, toward the same part of the sky. i held my gaze on their potential collision course. i was astonished at how extremely close they were converging. just prior to crossing paths, all 3 lights stopped dead. they formed an equilateral triangle and did not move. they now appeared to look like any other star in the sky almost directly above me. i did not look away until my ride finally arrived several minutes later. \r\n\r\nnow i know that apparently stationary stars may very well be ufo's hovering in our atmosphere.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

preceding events, but i remember standing alone with my head down. i remember hearing a humming noise. i did not immediately look up, but listened for a few seconds. when i looked up, i saw a craft that i can best describe as looking like an airplane with no wings or tail. there were what appeared to be observation windows located along the side of the craft. there were occupants in the craft looking directly at me. the object was hovering between my house and our neighbor's house to the south, approximately tree top height (trees nearby were mature walnut). i stood and looked up at the craft and occupants for several seconds. the occupants were humanoid. i do not recall any unusual features except that they had what i would describe as a serious or intent look. there was no real expression on their faces. i can't say exactly how many occupants there were, but it was more than 3. initially i did not feel frightened, but after several seconds i remember feeling an intense fear come over me. i screamed and ran into my house. i actually blocked this memory for about 12 or 13 years until i saw a depiction of a similar craft in a book on ufos i picked up in my high school library. the memory came rushing back and rather frightened me. i came home and asked my mother if there was any unusual incident she could remember regarding me and a frightening experience i might have had when i was 4 or 5. she recalled that about that time i had run screaming into the house repeating over and over that \"the airplane was going to get me\". she said after that it was weeks before i would go outside. she said i was apparently terrified about something. the one thing that troubles me is that the event occurred in broad daylight and in a tract neighborhood (westmont, located in pomona, ca. i don't know how a craft like that could have been hovering relatively low to the ground and no one else saw it. that i just cannot explain. i will say that while this was the only time i can say i viewed a craft, there have been other unsettling experiences over the next 30 years or so after my initial recollection of this event. my first husband coincidentally reported an incident that occurred when he was about the same age i was when i had my sighting only his was an actual encounter with beings that involved missing time and amnesia of the event by other family members who were present. i don't want to go into details of this or my own later experiences unless this organization feels it is worth exploring. this memory in particular has haunted me for a long time. it would be nice to know if there is a simple explanation or if this really could have been an alien encounter. i don't talk about this much because frankly i don't want to be thought of as a kook.","distance":"20 Feet or
