 i climb down out of tree w my climber stand and noticed behind me in the sky a big bright light. at first it appeared to have a shape but then it just looked like a big round light. at first i thought star but i've never seen a star that big and that bright. it looked to be about half the size of the moon and it was a full moon that night. in the video i show both for comparison. then i thought well maybe it was a plane reflecting light but knew full well i was trying to explain away what i was seeing. it was huge and far away. it was slowly moving across the sky i mean slowly. this is when i started recording it w my i phone 5 cause i knew i was watching a ufo and i was gonna get the definitive video. i watched it for about 20 min while a was walking out of the corn field i was hunting in. it started to move away from me then would come back. it kept on getting real big then shrinking down. like watching a basketball shrink to pea size. dim then bright but there wasn't any clouds. the feeling i got was man are they coming for me and because of tv shows started looking for things like beams to bigfoot that's how serious it was. about 35 min into watching the object it came close enough to actually see 3 rings which made up the object , all rotating. one inside of the next. the reason i didn't stay and watch more is because i was already late to get where i needed to be and i had already recorded it for over 35 min and it pitch black.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

2013. family members were asleep upstairs. i felt a strange feeling of unease and nervousness for no reason. i was sitting near sliding glass doors with the curtain closed. for some reason, i stood up and wanted to look outside. \r\n\r\nas i peeked through the curtains,i looked across a 3 acre meadow toward the distant tree line. directly over one of the large distant trees was a bright, white, translucent, teardrop shaped, glowing object. it was the size of two full moons.It seemed to be illuminating a large area around it-brighter on the right than the left.I looked at the cable box clock and it was 11:11 on the dot. \r\n\r\nas i continued to look at the object,it blinked and lit up a fairly large area. it made the area near it light up as in a thunderstorm. it was hard to tell how far away it was. it could have been 1000 feet or a mile or more. it was hard to say. \r\n\r\nas i studied it closer,i saw four or five brighter white spots on it facing toward me. i wondered if they were beams. there were no lights or beams shining down on the meadow which remained dark.There were broken clouds that night.\r\n\r\ni wondered where the beams could be pointing. i looked up to the clouds directly over the house and saw that the outer edges facing the object were outlined in white light like a beam of light was being projected on them from the object. it was stationary over the tree line for at least 5 minutes. at this point, i was absolutely terrified. \r\n\r\ni let the curtain close. i was too petrified to ask my family to come and see it and i also was trying to protect them from potential harm. the object stayed there for at least 5 minutes in place. i looked again after that and it was totally gone and the sky was once again pitch black.\r\n\r\nwhen it was gone i was very, very shaken up. i could not sleep all night. i called my friend in weymouth massachusetts to talk and she told me people in nearby quincy were demanding answers from their local government about sightings there within the few days prior. i am still traumatized and apprehensive about the event.

(as far as i know the phenomenon was still occurring at this point.) first off concluded that i am not crazy and not seeing things. i had a few great reference points because of the way i was laying in bed, so it wasn't my eyes playing tricks on me. secondly i made my report and after doing so had some closure, so was able to finally go to bed. i lost sight of the objects by shutting my curtains, leaving my bedroom door open and demanding a night light from my mother.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":52440,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.14393352700786,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11262013-0011","longitude":-73.55101264315911,"occurred":1385452800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New York","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1385490502000,"summary":"Star like objects zipping accross the sky ","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"12516","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Copake, New York","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:222955"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Downey","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was standing outside our garage with my father in law when i saw a red/orange light emerging in the air from the south above the building complex in front of us.  i really didn't pay to much attention because this is l.A.  and it could have been anything, but after a minute or two i notice it was just floating above us at a south easterly location high above the sky.  that is when my father in law and i joked it was a ufo.  we actually  thought it could have been a sky lantern because of the color of the object, the height and distance, and the light was pulsating.  we had a conversation of what it could be when it started to float slowly to the east, then back to the west, then going south.  my father in law then began to record the object (which he did for over 5 minutes), as it slowly moved west it stopped and floated stationary before slowly floating to the south and then moving east where the light just disappeared.

it but when the object moved in a curved path, passing over houses at the end of the street,i realized that it was a ufo as there was no sound. there were no strobe lights and the glow appeared to flicker slightly. as the object flew away in a curved path, its light dimmed and before getting obscured again by houses, it had dimmed completely.\r\nthe moment i saw the object, i knew it was not an aircraft because there was no sound and secondly, the light was a glow without there being a beam effect. the ufo was at a pretty low altitude of about 300ft and it moved without wavering in path. i could have mistaken it for an aircraft had the glow been of the color of landing lights. i watched the object fully aware that it was most probably a ufo and as the light dimmed, i was even more convinced of the craft being under intelligent control. the light of the ufo dimmed before it disappeared behind houses dimmed to a small point of light. \r\nit seems that the craft was accelerating throughout the curved path.\r\ni watched the scene calmly and at no time did i take my eyes off the object. it will be apt to say here that i was standing outside and gazing at the skies to see if
