at sky, and without talking with each other we watched this white light come out of now where in the sky, faster than anything i have ever seen, it swooped in a straight line out of darkness and stopped, almost if it was looking at us. i remember distantly looking at my watch right before @ 2:05 am and once we observed the ufo leave orbit. it was 4:30am and my friends mother open the window to the house to yell at us for being so pound. so it from the fastest thing i have ever seen, to a dead stop, then lost over 2 hours, and accelerated as fast as it stopped and left. we both looked at each other after his mother yelled at us through the window, looking at each other and talking over what we had just seen, and questioning the fact of the lost time. while we are now both believers we rarely tell people about what we saw because, we already learned that the story doesn't earn any credit, and we get shunned for believing. but we also dont speak much about it becuase we dont know what happened. why did we loose time, as far as we know we were silent the entire time before his mother opened her bedroom window to yell at us. since that day, i have been unable to think the same way, do the same things, an my previous medical problems seemed to worsen. \r\n\r\ni have seen very similar sightings more and more and choose to kepp quiet, as to not be outcasted but as crazy as it

high in the sky. what initially caught my \r\nattention was the fact that there seemed to be a large number of stars \r\nwithin a very small area and had never seen a cluster of stars like \r\nthat. after approximately 5 to 10 seconds of staring at the stars i \r\nnoticed they started becoming more clear and defined in what was already\r\n a very clear starry night. at first the stars seemed to move together \r\nvery slowly. my first thought was i was seen an illusion from \r\ntemperature changes in the night air or some other explainable cause. \r\nwithin a second or two the cluster either became brighter and larger or \r\ncloser as it was hard to tell in the dark sky and began to accelerate in\r\n a north by northeast direction. the entire time the stars maintained an\r\n exact position with relation to each other and moved as if they were part of the same solid object. within 20 seconds the cluster had moved completely out of sight. i stood there trying to understand how stars could have appeared to move that way and continued scanning the sky to find some rational explanation. just then i looked up and over the roof on the apartment building next to mine and i noticed a small translucent circle or sphere moving at a speed slightly faster than walking coming from a southwest direction just above the tree line and heading straight for the other apartment building. as it approached the roof it had to increase its \r\naltitude by a few feet so as not to hit the roof. once it was above the \r\nroof it changed to a straight north direction and continued on directly \r\nabove my head, then seemed to drop by a foot or two.  when it was within a few feet of the apartment building next door it became close enough to illuminate the side.  it rose a few feet, cleared the building, and slowly accelerated away in a northerly direction.  the entire time i was looking for wings on the object like a bird or bat or some other explanation that could cause something like that to appear.\r\n\r\nit wasn't until an hour or two later when it really hit me.  my wife noticed something was not right with me.  i began to have a wave of what felt like extreme sadness, anger, and loss of control that left me wishing the entire incident never happened.\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 501 Feet - 1 Mile,

dog on the highline canal trail behind the building. we proceeded west, it was cold and overcast with those sorts of clouds that appear misty that come in winter, very grey and heavy looking. we were about 10 minutes in the walk, actively looking for strange lights, etc. as 4 nights previously i had seen another orange orb to the south of the trail in the boundaries of a golfcourse. my girlfriend spotted an owl in the trees which i then photographed. we proceeded west again down the trail when i looked up and spotted a shooting star, and got a bit excited as things seemed to be getting interesting. not 5 minutes later to the south we beheld another orange orb, very distinctly yellow orange about 50 feet above what i believe would be the lakes surface within the golfcourse, it was very bright, brighter than the moon (not larger)and very intense. we watched it intently to be sure it was not anything we could discern. it rose about 50 feet in this time and then vanished, seeming to implode.\r\nwe proceeded southward again toward fairmount cemetery, being just south of it, or behind the the cemetery on the highline canal trail, looking even more curiously around  in anticipation of something... when we spotted a little white light south- westerly about 70 degrees from horizon and about 1500 feet right at cloud level set between two very grey and heavy clouds. we watched it, quickly dismissing it as a probable airplane, when it then just disappeared, it did not move forward into clouds, it appeared, and disappeared. we were now freaking out, not uncontrollably but rather in a happy excited way. \r\nwe stayed in that spot, looking all over for anything when about 10 miles northeast seeming to be out by dia we spotted another orange orb, one could tell this one was quite large due to the distance, and its size. if not for its bright orange color we would not have watched it as intently, it moved from left to right, then stopped and stayed in place, again vanishing in an implosion looking manner. i was trying to photograph them, but was having camera difficulties.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

traveled closely together. i thought the color was strange, and noticed they weren't blinking like planes. also, this is a regular flight path to newburgh airport, but those planes are always

thought \"if i tell him this , and he doesn't see it, he's going to say 'oh it was venus'.\" so, i made sure he saw it and even he said it was highly unusual. then we saw the third one appear from the

bird-size shapes but all i could find of interest were clouds. i noticed a particularly strangely complicated cloud and thought i will have to have a closer look at those pictures on the computer. the cloud may have been moving slowly cloud-like or it may have been hovering for some reason i didn't think much more about documenting size, distance, with my outstretched fist but guess it would have been about basket ball size at arm outstretched. i have a feeling there were many more of these shapes traveling under that grey ceiling cloud. i get the feeling there is more to come, i should be

(same as a computer makes when it is running). it was strange how a big shining sphere had a small red sphere orbiting around it.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":52391,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.1552388,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11232013-0010","longitude":-76.1470778,"occurred":1385269200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1385267756000,"summary":"Big sphere with small sphere orbiting around the big sphere. shined very brightly.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Shickshinny, Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:224323"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop, 500 Feet or Less","city":"Commercial Township","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was 13 years old and with several cousins and friends. we were playing hide and seek at my aunt dot`s house just down the street from where i lived. we had been playing from the time it got dark outside. so i`m guessing about the time it happened but maybe between 8pm and 9pm. it could have been later but we were always in the house by 10pm. anyhow i decided to hide in a field that was grown up with weeds, that was right behind my aunts house. i walked into the field maybe 30 to 50 feet and laid down in the soft weeds on my back so no one could see me. i could hear the other kids talking but not very good. as i lay there i noticed a object way off in the distance. it was very small. if i had held out my hand to measure it, it would have been about the size of my pinky nail. as i watching it suddenly came to stop directly over me in a split second. it moved so quick that i did`t see it actually move from where it was to where it stopped. i laid there looking at it and remember like it just happened today. i did`t feel afraid at all but just felt mesmerized by what it was doing. i know it was only about 300ft above me because it was so easy to see. it was round looking at it from the bottom but i know it was saucer shaped from what i saw when it left but i`ll get to that in a moment.It did not make any sound at all. it was mostly metllic in color and had several lights that were in rings \" one inside the other\" there were 5 rings and each ring had maybe 20 to 30 lightshapes in it that were changing color, size and shape as they moved around the ring. the lightshapes within each ring was moving in a different direction than the other rings.Each lightshape was not a clear square or triangle or oval or other shape. each lightshape was dark in color and did not light up the ground where i was. i remember thinking it was beautiful. it only stayed there like that for around 30 to 45 seconds or perhaps a minute. then suddenly as it came, it left. i remember it leaving just a short blurr of itself going in the direction it came from but could not see it disappear into the distance. within the blurr i saw a side view of a saucer shape. the blurr it left was about 100 to 300ft long.I ask the other kids if they saw it but no one did. i could not believe they did`t see it. if one of them did then they never admitted it. this was my first sighting of three in my life. i have been telling others about it my whole life. my next 2 sightings there were witnesses but that`s another memory.
