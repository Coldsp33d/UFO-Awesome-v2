and then move up or down and then fly across the sky.There are more then one, in photos i have taken there are up to 10 or more.In the photos they sometimes look like orbs connected together. i also took a video, in the video it was  circle shaped and looked like it was spinning. it changed from yellow, to blue, to red,to green and orange and stayed in the same spot. we both have seen lights in the woods not far from our house. we walked to the woods where we saw the lights and took photos which had several orbs in them.The photos showed a very bright blue orb, a green orb and a pale white one. i have seen bright orange and yellow type orbs in the woods from photos i took on my deck during the day. we have several photos of the ufo's and orbs.\r\nthis has been going on since we first noticed it after the meteor. it is confusing to me because in my photos the ufo's have different shapes it seems each time we take a photo. i know it is not an airplane or anything like that because we have seen several at a time and a bunch in the photo's . we have seen one large white light which looks like a satellite but there were several of smaller ufo's flying around the large white light.I know it has kind of upset my life because i keep checking the woods and sky taking picture to try and find some sort of understanding or answer for whats going on .I'm only going to send two

that kept us looking in that direction. after about 7 minutes, the large orange star began to move, toward us, but remaining overhead, and as it traveled the light went from a single orange light to looking almost identical to a plane's lights, and transitioning between the light pattern, the now 3 lights seemed to spin in a circle, in what my husband describes as \"some one trying to get the lights right\". this light comes and goes, for example...We bought a telescope in an attempt to get a better look, at 6pm, i tell my husband we have to eat before we can go out, and it was still in the sky at that time, by 7 pm, it was gone, other stars were still out, but this brightest light had gone. almost as if it knew we were preparing ourselves for a look. i also noticed a few nights ago

not notice any flashing lights on the object.  the object appeared as a glowing white light with what appeared to be some sort of structure below the glowing white light.  i was only paying attention to the object at the various red lights as i was driving.  at the light at w 11th and oak patch i saw a flashing light as part of the  glowing object, so i thought it must be a airplane.  as driving down road glanced at glowing object and noticed the flashing light was falling away from larger glowing object.  i almost crashed my vehicle.  i paid attention to the road, pulled into the gas station at the fred meyers at 11th and seneca.  i had fuel put in my vehicle, and as i was having the fuel put in my vehicle, i continued to observe the light in the sky.  while watching the object at the gas station i did not observe any change in the light.  it was about 30 degrees from the horizon while i was watching from the gas station.  i drove home from the gas station.  i kept track of the object as i drove home.  it was dark out now and i could start to see stars in the sky now.  i pulled in my driveway, went in my house, got my dslr camera put on my 70-300 lens with a 1.5 multiplyer.  i took one frame of the light from my yard at this point the light was a on the horizon as there is a hill to the south of my house.  as i was setting up the camera on the tripod a helicopter went by to the

washington state.  between the ages of 7-9 i was staying with my uncle, his wife and my two  cousins.  for some evening entertainment my uncle decided to bring out his 8mm home movie projector.  during a brief moment in the film my uncle pointed out something my father had filmed in the sky while making chicken deliveries to rural locations in idaho (not sure that part is relevant).  i must stop for a moment here and point out that i have spoken to my father in great detail about this event.  however, if needed i can make arrangements so a mufon investigator can speak to my father or my uncle.  my father first spotted the object to his right from inside the cab.  the object got his attention enough to make him stop the truck immediately and start filming.  the camera my father had with him belonged to my uncle.  my uncle had loaned it to him, so i guess my dad got lucky. it's important to note that this is not the best footage of all time.  however, i will tell you what i have seen on film.  first though i must state my reason for coming to mufon.  i am here to respectfully request help in this matter.  also, i am humbly seeking resources to discover or at least try and understand what this object might have been.  i seek no fame, money and i do not want a bunch of attention from all of this.  however, this footage has never been seen by the general public and has remained within our family for over forty years.  i have tried to forward the footage and work with some other folk's but have found the act of pulling teeth to be more fun.  okay, so enough of that.  the film is about :06 long.  after speaking with my father and seeing the film this is what i know.  the object was heading north.  it was white and cigar shaped and appeared to be tumbling end over end in a slow manner (like a big stick being thrown for a dog).  the odd thing is the object stays or appears to stay on a straight trajectory.  the object maintained it's course just above some dry, grassy rolling hills.  there is farm equipment and a structure in the film that may help in determining it's distance and size.  when my uncle had the film converted from 8mm to dvd he was able to create four different presentations with some very limited photo software. the first is of the original footage.  the second is a still shot but a little more close up.  the third and fourth presentations are slide shows.  it's important to note: if you watch closely and click the slide show's at a consistent speed you should be able to see the object tumbling end over end.  for the record my uncle still has the original 8mm film.  i will try and attach all four presentations below.  if i am not successful, please, get in contact with me so i can e-mail them too you directly.  i apologize for this statement's length.  the biggest reason i am pursuing this is because seeing that object at a young age left an impression on me my entire life.  i never forgot what i saw that night we all gathered to watch home movies.  finally, a few years back i decided to ask my uncle about the film.  prior to this we had never spoken about it since i saw the footage as a kid.  he was happy and shocked that i remembered the footage.  in short, here i am now, over thirty years later, trying to seek help in identifying the object.  on a final note i must state that this footage is old, limited and really needs attention from modern technology.  surely stuff i don't have.  i will say this, the more you study it the more you see.  i have promised myself to keep an open mind.  i have no ego, but all i ask is a good, honest effort be placed into this opportunity.  enjoy and thank you in advance for any help you can lend in an attempt to solve this matter.   c. jerald,

aires in the area of los polvorines. i believe there is some argentine military aircraft facilities in the area.  i am writing now because in telling the story to my teenage daughter i felt so disturbed that i never shared it and that somehow my memory of it was erased for a time.\r\n\r\nmy husband and i had walked to dinner two blocks away.  the area was quiet and dark, families in their homes, little or no movement in the street.  after dinner, walking back home, we crossed the two blocks and nearing our tree-lined street, suddenly saw a large disc-shaped object with lights that lit up and turned off, going around its circular edge in a flow pattern.  it reminded me of the spaceship from lost in space.  it was absolutely silent and i remember standing there as the giant disc silently slipped above us across the sky without any seeming hurry or speed and disappeared beyond the trees in the direction from which we had come.  \r\n\r\nwhile i think this is amazing, i am writing this because what i find most disturbing is that i went home that night.  my husband and i did not talk about it at all.  i did not call anyone.  i simply went on with life as if it had never happened and i don't know what triggered the memory or exactly how long later it occured, but only later did i remember everything.  my husband says he remembers seeing something but can't say what it was, or if it was anything unusual.  \r\n\r\nnow, i must share that my uncle robert bletchman was very involved in mufon, and my parents in apro in arizona.  i know loads about ufos and that the best thing is not to have too much to do with them!  i also know how to describe sightings and know how important having seen this would have been to my parents and to my uncle, who was alive and well at the time.  if under any normal circumstance this were to happen to me, the first thing i would do is run, not walk, home and call both parties!  i would tell them all about it.  i would tell others.  yet, i walked calmly home with my husband and went to bed.  and forgot about it.  its absurd.  absolutely and totally absurd.  its not me, or how i would have acted.  yet i did.  and that is what still bothers me today.  i just looked up the idea of memory loss and saw others had experienced the same problem, so i thought i ought to finally, fifteen years later, report mine.  once i remembered it, i recalled and still recall it as if it was yesterday.\r\n\r\ni hope, although its late, this helps somehow.","distance":"101-500

nap around 10:30pm.  i realized i hadn't eaten any dinner yet so i jumped into my car to go get something to eat and warmed it up a little. we recently have below freezing temperatures here. their is also no cloud cover at all tonight. the moon and stars are very bright tonight. while i was pulling out of my driveway, which faces east and looks out over the snohomish valley i saw what literally looked like fire in the sky. it was about the size of a quarter from my view and i could tell it was moving slowly. it wasn't an airplane or helicopter. they sometimes fly hot air balloons out over the valley but not in freezing temperatures and at this time of night. it looked like flames in the sky, this is actually the second time i have witnessed this. the first time was a couple of months ago and although i thought it was weird then, i tried to just tell myself it wasnt anything and ignored it back then. i drove maybe a mile down my road trying to keep my eyes on it through the trees and tree line. eventually the trees were too thick and i lost view of the flying firey object. once i got to a clearing where i could see back out into the valley i didn't see the first fiery looking object anymore but an object that looked like a big star stationary in the sky. it was flashing several different colors. red, blue, orange, white, like a strobe light. at this point i noticed two airplanes. one flying towards the object and one flying over the object. i also used google sky maps to verify it was not a star or planet. which it was not. their is definitely something weird flying around our night time skies. it's also strange that earlier today a meteor or some type of burning object fell from the skies in oregon i believe. it was on the news. this object i saw tonight looked similar to those photos of the \"meteor\" or whatever they are claiming it might have been but it didn't fall to earth, it was floating / flying.","distance":"Over One

kept flashing in the same place (unmoving) so i stopped to get a better look & could barely make out a shiny object that was just sitting there flashing very brightly. \r\n i got excited & hurried the last block home to get my old camcorder out before it left.\r\n i got the camera & hurried out but it wasn't in sight anywhere so i zoomed out & scanned the area for about 20 minutes to no avail.\r\n i went back in but kept looking out every few minutes & finally about 20 to 30 minutes later, there it was exactly where it had been.\r\n i started filming,  zooming in & out to give an idea of how far away the thing was. i was very excited & cursed alot not realizing i was doing so till i watched the video. embarrassing! \r\n anyway,  it was there for 30 seconds or so & suddenly it wasn't.  in the video it looks like it shot off to the east but it could have been me moving the camcorder while trying to steady it. it's hard to hold it still while zoomed out over 200x.\r\n the object was a large cylindrical shaped thing that seemed to have vertical lines & a raised area on top. it reflected light like a mirror but seemed to change color. could be caused by the distance & low budget camcorder. a jvc minidv 400x digital zoom about 10 yr. old.\r\n i downloaded it into my dvd recorder hard drive & burned it onto a few dvds. it wont play back on the camcorder nor does it record anymore. i still have the original on the minidv cassette though.  its the sharpest image. the dvds are okay but need someone with a computer to clean it up some.\r\n i started to make this report eariler but was afraid of ridicule.  now that i have two more sightings recently i feel better about it. i also have them on video on my galaxy s2 here. one cloaks right above me but its only there for 3 seconds. you'll get it also. it's on youtube on channel paladone101. \"accidental ufo\" is the title.\r\n let me know where to go now fellows. mail you the disc or what? it a lot better than this one here.\r\n i'll send reports on the other videos i sent over the next couple days, okay?\r\n        later.","distance":"Over One

as i began to walk down the step of the porch as this object was pretty close now, flying really low, and i have a large pecan tree in my yard and it was a bit higher than the top of that tree, and i'm not sure how much higher, but it seemed too low for a plane, even for a small plane that has been flying for this amount of distance. he finally said \"yes, i can hear it now\" and then this object is flying overhead, not slow and not fast, just sort of gliding along its path - and i look up and there is this red square, an outline of a square anyways in red light - my first thought was that it looked like an escape hatch or emergency exit type of thing. i looked straight up at this thing and it was shaped like a triangle, but not a pointy long angle triangle - but a blunt, rounded, and stubby triangle. i watched it until it disappeared over the top of my house. i told my husband \" i think i just saw a ufo\" he sort of giggled, and i said \"no, i'm serious\", and then told him that the thing had no wings like a plane should have and the hum was not the sound of a propeller or even like a helicopter , it was a low... but audible hum that my husband could hear on the other end of the phone. i did walk around the side of my house to see if i could get a view of the object from the rear, but i could only hear the hum for a moment or so longer and no longer saw the lights - then it was gone.
