that was supposed to happen those few nights. we were parked facing directly east, sitting on the east side of the lot. there were no lights/objects obstructing my view at any time. we had noticed the sky was full of planes, and when we bothered to count the blinking lights, it was something like 20-30 flashing lights visible to us in east sky. after about 5 minutes in the lot, my female friend pointed out an orange-ish light to the north-east in the field beside the building. aprox 200 yds away. it was hovering directly off the ground below some power lines, beside a sub-station. after hovering for about 30 seconds, it began moving sw towards the menards building. it slowly rose above the building, and stopped moving, a few feet above the top of the building, no more than 75 yards away from my vehicle.\r\n\r\n me and my friends were in awe, and the next thing we knew, the objects glow grew in intensity at least tenfold, resembling the sun for roughly 5 seconds, before slowly dimming back to its original amber glow. the object sat there for 3-4 more minutes, and the amber glow spontaneously went out, and the object instantly began rising, moving towards us and up. the glow went away and was replaced by what could best be described as lights that mimic those of a traditional aircraft. 2 blinking lights on the edges of its silhouette (which i could never properly make out even when it flew over) the object flew directly over my sunroof (which i had open) aprox 75-100 yards above my vehicle. i'd say it was round if anything. the only thing that distinguished it from a plane in this form was a bottom central red light, that appeared to sparkle or pulse. this event has changed my life and the lives of my friends. more encounters have happened since, but this was the

very intense white lights in the rear (engines?) and a very intense red strobe in the center on the bottom. it also had 3 very running lights. one in each corner. the surface appeared jet black like the stealth bomber. there was no noise at all. it was slowly rotating and appeared to flip on its nose and stand nose down. it emitted a bright white strobe that pulsated outward from the bottom. i noticed 2-3 other smaller bright objects at a lower altitude that appeared to be circling the main object. also i observed at least two conventional aircraft fly over the object at a higher elevation. they appeared to be cargo planes or very large private planes. i could not make out any features on the smaller bright white object, but they never  left the main object, they just circled it. i watched this go on from about 5:50 pm cst to 7:00pm cst and noticed that the main bright object was slowly descending in what appeared to be an arc-like flight path. it was moving slowly from 30 degrees azimuth to the due s (heading of 180 degrees on a compass) to  treetop level in the sw (about a 220 degree compass heading)\r\nas it was descending it would dim and brighten, then the lights appeared to go out one by one until finally it disappeared from view. the smaller objects stayed with the main triangle until it went out. i don't know if it landed or not. i might add that fort leonard wood army base is in the general direction the object was last observed and it has an airfield.","distance":"Over One

work fifteen minutes west of the city of kingston ont, the area i work is a low populated sparse buildings and mostly wooded area...While heading home from work approximately 18:20, ten minutes from the west end of the city traveling due east i saw a very, very, very bright area on the ground. there was significant bright white glow towards, around in all directions and into the sky. it surprised me with the amount of light that was emitted from this area, which was approximately one km (3000 ft) north of the highway i was on, beyond a partially cleared field but just into the woods beyond. i slowed and was taken aback, even shocked, by the brightness. i saw no detail other than the significant amount of light, as whatever was making the glow was hidden in the trees (although light did emit from between the trees as i slowly traveled by. i have traveled this road for years, know the area reasonably well, but never seen anything like that along this stretch of country road. i came home ready to share my strange story when my girlfriend was excited to tell me that while leaving work at 17:25 (approx 55 minutes earlier than my sighting) she had seen something really weird... she left her work (inside the city of kingston west end) and as she traveled west towards our home (along princess st- at gardiners rd) she witnessed a large, glowing object. she described it as being like a vertical pole, or rocket shape, glowing red as if on fire. the object was hovering a few hundred feet above the ground and slowly moving west, and as she continue to observe the object, it slowly rose in a directly up direction until it went out of her sight. upon reaching home she could make it out at a higher altitude heading west and up like a rocket, as she described it. the object was large. she was excited to tell me her story, but then was surprised when i then told her of my drive home. neither of us have ever seen anything of this nature before, and it was very strange that on the same date, same time of day (later and dark) we both 45 minutes apart from opposite ends then see something neither of us can explain. we do live a few km from the city airport, a smaller local airstrip with limited number of flights, but having grown up on a military base i know what we witnessed was not any standard aircraft of any known type. im a skeptic of ufos in general, until now

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"When i was going from the upstairs of my home to downstairs, i happened to glance out of the front door window and noticed two very bright objects that appeared to move by the window quickly. i walked outside to get a better look thinking that they were possibly helicopters, or just something interesting to look at with my binoculars or telescope. however when i stood still outside i noticed the two objects appeared to not be moving, so i thought maybe they were just bright stars and i had observed some kind of optical illusion while moving by the window. however, before going back inside i noticed that the two objects started to slowly move again, very slowly up and to the right exactly in unison. at this time i noticed that one object was predominantly white with blue, red and greenish lightly pulsating all at the same time, while the other was mostly gold and copper flickering, with sometimes a yellow tinge. at certain times it appeared there was a very faint third object off the left of the bright white/blue object but i could not get a good enough look as it was too dim and close to the light pollution and tree line. i instantly got excited and ran inside to the house, grabbed my canon powershot elph 510hs and quickly set it to night shot. there was also no sound of any kind; it's very quiet in my area and i can hear helicopters or jets from a great distance away before you can even see them, which made the experience very intriguing. it was very difficult to get the camera onto the objects as they kept moving and there is no optical viewfinder on the camera, only the small digital screen. i then proceeded to take 3 separate videos, one with night shot mode, one with night scene mode and the final with long shutter (night) setting. i rested the camera on the side of the house to try to stabilize it as best as i could, but the objects were moving quite a lot and it was difficult to capture. feeling that i took as much clear video as i possibly could (about 10 minutes worth), i decided to get my telescope out just to absolutely make sure it's not some strange helicopters i'm witnessing. i was luckily able to get the telescope zoomed in perfectly on the white/blue object and it was clearly a bright white sphere with pulsating colors and it appeared to actually jump from part of the lens to the other. while trying to get the telescope on a good angle, a group of 2-3 helicopters flew overhead in the direction of the object and about 5 minutes after that 2 jets flew in the same direction, both with 2 visible exhausts close together; which reminded me of the rear of an f-15 or similar fighter jet. i tried to get my camera back out to record it but by the time the camera was ready they were behind the trees and you could only hear the engines. hanscom air force base is only about 15-20 miles from where i live and i know they have fighter aircraft, although i am unsure what their current status is as of 2010. however, i do know they are still an active military base. i went back inside to get my father who also saw exactly what i was seeing. i then went to get my brother, but when i came back outside, all of the objects were gone. upon reviewing the videos i took, there was one clip that seemed to show what i was seeing the best (long shutter mode), and it actually quite clearly shows the white/blue and gold/copper object instantly jump slightly to the right, in exact unison. and it is not my poor camera management as when this happened i had the camera resting against the side of the house and when i move the camera about later in the video you can see the colors streaking from the long shutter exposure time. on the other video it shows the objects moving to the left, stopping and moving to the right, and at the end of the clip you can actually hear the jets approaching. i have seen many strange objects like this in my area over the past 2 years but this is the first time i have somewhat good quality footage of the event.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

with me has been telling me he has been seeing a ufo like object. i dismissed it as a star, but it has been dissapearing in between his smoke breaks he takes outside. so. went outside t see it, and it was in the western part of the sky, under the clouds, just sitting there. we waited and it just disappeared after about 30 mins. could not believe it. planes do not hover and stars do not dissapear. it was about 4 times the size of a star and very bright white. just round. hovered perfectly. we saw planes after that in the opposite direction after it was gone and it was definitely not a plane!  we will keep our eyes open cause it has been coming back!
