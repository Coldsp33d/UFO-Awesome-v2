(the results were of poor quality and inconclusive.)\r\n    as we watched, the objects were completely silent. they hovered in (what appeared from our viewing angle to be) a square, oriented almost due-north/south and due east/west, for approximately an additional 30 seconds. then the southeastern-most light slowly departed toward the southeast, apparently in a gradual ascent, until it finally disappeared into the bottom of the cloud cover. the clouds were highly unlikely to have been lower than 800 ft. above the river (1400 ft above sea level), or higher than 3000 ft. above the river (3600 ft above sea level.) (determined by known local elevations.) \r\n    as the one light ascended to the southeast, the northeastern-most light slowly moved toward the south and then a bit west, leaving the remaining 3 lights in an inverted \"check-mark\" formation.\r\n    after attempting to record the phenomena for approximately 2 minutes, realizing that the results were going to be poor, i decided to try and take still photos instead. during the roughly 15 to 20 seconds that i was looking away from the lights at my phone to re-set it from video to still mode, the objects disappeared. they had appeared to be rising, though barely perceptibly, when i looked away. the lights were in our constant view for over 5 minutes in total.\r\n    i believe the low-level clouds were descending as fog (a common occurrence locally) and the lights disappeared into them. however, as bright as they had been, it would have been normal to expect a slight glow for at least a few moments as the lights would have been enveloped by the cloud, but there was no glow. \r\n    we live in a regular flight path of the rescue helicopter from chattanooga's large regional trauma center. we are very aware of the sound of a helicopter, even from a distance of one to two miles. these objects produced no sound, whereas 4 helicopters would have been obvious. moreover, there was no rotor-reflection glow, and it is highly unlikely that 4 helicopters could have hovered in such relatively close proximity to each other.\r\n    i looked for other reports of the incident but found none. due to a hectic schedule, i failed to report the event in a timely manner. recalling it today--10 days after-- i decided to record the incident while the facts are still fresh in my mind.\r\n

treetops to the sw of my house. i observed this object move up, down, and sideways several times. it would get really dim then brighten, and repeat the process over and over. it appeared to be hovering or moving in a circle. i noticed a couple of bright flashes coming from this object, the another smaller bright light appeared to the left of it. it did not stay lit, it just flashed and went out. after this happened the larger object descended to treetop level. it again brightened and dimmed several times. it finally went completely out. at almost the same instant the object went out an airplane light started blinking and was heading in the direction of the larger object. this airplane apparently had its lights off until this object went out. the general direction of this object was in the direction of fort leonard wood army base so it could have been a military exercise. i will also mention this activity has been going on since october in my area.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

up in the sky across the road which is east of the driveway. i saw an orange glowing light through the trees across the street. it seemed to be moving slowly, but i realized that when planes are coming towards you they seem to move slow. there was no sound like a plane or jet engine would make. i got into my car and turned on the radio on low and smoked my cigarette. when i got out of the car, i looked up in the sky to see if the light was still where i had seen it. it wasn't there, so i looked farther to the north, which is when i saw that the one light i had seen in the beginning had turned into 3 orange yellow lights. they were in an inverted v formation with the middle light a little behind the two side lights. again they were not blinking and they made no noise. they were well above the tree line but not as far up as some of the usual blinking lights that i see from the planes around here. truthfully, i thought it must be some kind of new aircraft that i am not aware of. i have never seen a plane with steady orange lights before. and it made no sound whatsoever. so thinking it was just some kind of new aircraft, i went back into the house. later, when the man i live with came home from a meeting, i asked him what kind of plane has those kind of lights and no sound. he brought up boomerang shaped ufo's. so i googled it on yahoo and some rense site mentioned an increase in sightings of ufo's with orange lights. so i decided to contact you. i really don't know what it was. there is a small airport in a nearby town, so we have all kinds of small planes and jets in the skies at night. i am kind of excited that it could be an alien craft! i have wanted to see a ufo as an adult, since i had seen 3 ufos in broad daylight and close when i was about 8 or 9 years old. by the way, it was dark tonite when i saw the object with a full moon to the east. it was not moving erratically or suddenly; just a slow easy path!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

290 west. as i was returning to my vehicle, i happened to look up at the night sky. this was the first night in several nights where it was a clear night sky. \r\n\r\ni looked back toward 290 west (in a southern direction) and began looking at the stars and various aircraft (mostly small private planes) flying in the area. i'm saying they were small private planes due to the other lights that i could see, such as the green and red blinking lights that accompany the white light. the characteristics of these lights were similar to those of other planes, i have observed in the area. \r\n\r\ni then observed a single bright white light almost directly overhead. i did not see any other lights attached to the this object such as the green and or red blinking lights one would except to see so that someone could make the assumption that what one was looking at was nothing more that an aircraft. \r\n\r\ni observed that this bright white object was moving south. from my vantage point the direction the object would have taken would be somewhere between kerrville and san antonio. i observed the this bright white object was not descending (falling to the ground) but was traveling at an unknown altitude toward the south. the speed of the object was constant but not fast.\r\n\r\ni then observed a smaller aircraft off in the distance to the southwest. i could see the faint white light and the accompanying red and green blinking lights on this aircraft. i observed that this plane was flying from west to east. i observed that this plane appeared to be much further off in the distance and close to the horizon. \r\n\r\ni then looked back up and found the bright white object still overhead and continuing its southern flight. since i had now observed a plane much further off in the distance with a faint white light and red and green blinking lights, i was now beginning to wonder what this object was that i was observing.\r\n\r\ni then retrieved my binoculars (10 x 50 fixed) from my vehicle. i located the bright white object through my binoculars and focused. i could not make out any detail of the object but i could also still not see any other lights, red, green, blue, nothing no other lights were accompanying this object.\r\n\r\ni also noted that the speed of this object was increasing. before when i first observed the object there was no noticeable increase in speed and my head was only moving slightly but now i noticed that as i was observing this object through my binoculars my head was moving faster as i followed this object. i was even able to see this object pass in front of stars at a fast clip as it continued its southern flight path.\r\n\r\njust out of curiosity i lowered my binoculars in an attempt to locate the aircraft i had seen earlier flying from west to east to see how close these two objects were in relation to one another. to my surprise i was able to easily locate the plane still on course from west to east but i could no longer see the bright white object. \r\n\r\ni searched the night sky for a few more minutes and never located this object again. as bright as this object was i should have been able to easily locate it again with my naked eye as i done in the first place. i know that this object was not a satellite nor was it any type of conventional aircraft that i have seen to date.\r\n\r\nthe total time i

look up at the sky.Because.Earlier in the evening a was looking at the full moon. then i saw what looked like a round ball of fire.Traveling from the southeast as if it were coming from the ocean.I live just outside the city limits , so there is not much lighting. when i first saw it i could not explain  what it was. i started calling my friend to come outside to see it.At this time, the object got so close but we could still not see any  shape or form,only a bright burning orange light.Then it just cut from its west movement to a northern path where it accelerated and it just vanished. then we looked over where this thing came from and there was a second ball of fire coming from the same direction as the first.We took out our cellphones.And they both were completely turn of ,and we just could not get them to turn on, to record anything. it to took the same fly path as the first one.But this one i could see what looked like just tips on its side they were silver metallic in color. i have never seen anything like this before. we were in shock because we could not explain what we saw.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the sky. at first it looked like a quasar but then i noticed it was moving across the mountain tops in a slow deliberate line. there was no sound as it moved but it moved so slow that it could not be an aircraft such as a plane or helicopter. the light from the object changed color from red to orange to yellow in quick succession. i watched as the object disappeared behind the mountains but noticed that the light from it gave off a bright aura that never changed its brightness. as it slowly came back from behind the mountains it continued on its slow deliberate path until it went behind a larger group of mountains and i could not see it again. i honestly have never seen anything that bright or slow moving in the sky. it was a moonless night and the skies were clear. i am a former soldier who's mos dealt directly with aircraft identification so i know the difference between small prop planes, jets and helicopters. i do not know if there were any local radar tracks that could confirm what i saw.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
