39000 ft up. pilot told me those clouds in the photos below us in the plane are about 6-10 thousand high up\r\nlooks like giant antenna or smoke stacks. something large enough to be making the clouds look like a wake from a boat is going through them. \r\nso here's what's weird, tallest man made structure is 2400 ft tall and is in dubai. \r\noil plat forms are only 200-240 ft above sea level. \r\nthat's how i noticed it. saw the wake in the clouds\r\nthese are live photo's. you can play them and see that they weren't moving. \r\nflying over gulf heading towards ft lauderdale \r\nnear louisiana \r\ni thought maybe oil platform. \r\nbut. nothing is that tall in the gulf\r\nagain these things could be over 6-10,000 ft tall if the originate on the surface. \r\nif you go on google earth to look at this area, it's all grainy and they only have it clear close to land. \r\nwhatever it is is extremely tall and not just skinny. but massive enough to make large wakes in the cloud patterns\r\nand it's like two large structures with several of the towers on them. \r\ni could see oil platforms further on in my trip and they were tiny in comparison. so i'm ruling that explanation out. \r\n\r\nand this is over the gulf. unless there is some high mountain where they put stacks or antennas over 6/10 thousand ft tall to get them that high, i have no clue\r\nno clue how accurate this is with the geo location in photo app, but here is the google satellite image shows nothing but dark blue in the area of the photos. again the map is only clear close to land\r\nyou can see how they feather the image with photoshop so that everything beyond this line is not a clear image.

this started it was about 2 am and i was in bed, i couldn't sleep because it was very hot and we didn't have air conditioning in that house. the window was open and the sounds of crickets and traffic drifted in from the street below, i was reading on my tablet when suddenly everything went quiet. i was suddenly nervous, crickets only got quiet when something disturbed them. i listened for a moment trying to hear of someone was in the yard, i could hear a faint hum. i was confused, i'd never heard a hum like that, it was soft, low, and even, like a machine. \r\n\r\nthinking it was an airplane or something i looked out the window at the sky, notocing there were two especially bright, and orange stars. i looked for a little while, but the noise never changed and no planes appeared. then the light on the left moved, i was a little scared and annoyed. i thought that maybe they were drones, as i watched more i realized the movement was all wrong for a drone. they were too smooth and steady, and the turns too exact. i was beginning to panic, i had no clue what they were. then the left one shot off to the left and disappeared, i crept past the sleeping dog and my sleeping sister to look out the window. the light never winked or wavered like a star, i suddenly felt like i was being watched and i scrambled back to my bed this was probably around 2:10.\r\n\r\nmy scrambling should have woken the dog up at least, she's jumpy like that. but both of them stayed soundly asleep, and i was really scared. the light got bigger and the odd hum louder as i watched, my heart was pounding and i was shaking. then an odd calm settled over me, i knew in my core that the light would never ever hurt me. it got a little bigger, i'm pretty sure it was coming closer because the hum was louder. i watched the light with a feeling of calm and joy, and i know i was watched in return. i felt dreamy and safe, and something that wasn't me, but was kind. after what felt like a minute or two the light shrank and the hum softened. i watched as the light followed the same path the other had and moved beyond my sight. \r\n\r\ni felt lonely afterward, and a little sad. like when a good friend leaves after a long visit. when i looked at the clock again about 30 minutes had passed, rather than the 1 or 2 i had thought. despite only getting 4 hours of sleep i woke up the next morning feeling refreshed, and content.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On friday march 16, 2018 i was walking my dog along the greenbelt on the northern side of veterans memorial park in cedar park, texas. the loop around the park is about 1 1/3 miles total. an aviation buff and lifelong sky watcher, i noticed a white/silver metallic sphere moving at a high rate of speed tracking roughly south to north at an estimated 10-15,000 above ground level. there was no exhaust or visible means of propulsion in a standard sense. while holding my dog’s leash i grabbed my mobile phone out of my pocket to attempt to record some video before the sphere would be lost in my line of sight over the tree line. the video is terrible since i was juggling the dog leash and fighting with the sun glare on my phone. there are only a few frames of the object. i have seen the same type of sphere moving at a fast speed a few years before, ironically, while walking my dog at the park. it is only because of the following activities that i was prompted to get this event documented.\r\n\r\nafter losing sight of the object i continued around the trail wondering whether what i witnessed was advanced human technology or something otherworldly. minutes later at approximately 12:07 while walking southbound on the western side of the greenbelt, i heard a low hum and looked left and up. at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet i saw what i’m convinced was an air force c-17 globemaster, a huge four engine cargo jet. in nearly four years of living in central texas, i’ve never seen one before. it was tracking the same south to north direction of the flying metallic sphere, but approximately two miles east. i could only wonder if the c-17 was tracking the sphere, or it had released the sphere itself in some military test, or if seeing the two in the space of 7 minutes was coincidental.\r\n\r\ntwo days later, on sunday march 18, 2018, i was, again, walking my dog around the park. while walking northbound on the east side of the park i began to hear a low rumble and recognized the sound of military helicopters. only occasionally do you see any military choppers over cedar park, even given that the us army base fort hood is only 45 air miles away north northeast. i stopped and looked around for the choppers. this was 11:22 a.M. central. what i believe were two apache attack choppers were about one-half mile south from location and traveling west at approximately 3,000 feet above ground level. they were flying close together with the lead chopper staggered to the left of the other. what happened next made my jaw dropped the lead chopper abruptly jerked the chopper right (north) over roughly the same track the metallic sphere had been flying two days earlier. the lead chopper’s move must have come to a surprise to the back chopper, because there was nearly a mid-air collision. the two choppers continued that course until i lost sight of them because of the tree line. just as i was getting to my car to load my dog and head home, i heard another low hum at 11:32 a.M. flying the same course west as the other two choppers was a lone apache. and it made the same move (but smoother) of heading north along the track of the other choppers and the metallic sphere two days earlier.\r\n\r\ni have no idea as to what these events mean. i can only chalk them up to high strangeness at this time.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

husband and i (along with a few friends) sat on our back deck to await the long-anticipated event.  we were fortunate enough to live on the exact centerline of “totality.” i had prepared a chart which showed the planets and stars that would become visible in different areas of the sky and suggested that everyone briefly turn their gaze to observe them.  but i also encouraged everyone to primarily focus on the sun as i knew the 2 minute-34 second window of opportunity would pass very quickly.  \r\nthe time approached, and i announced when the special eclipse glasses could be removed.  during totality, we were all mesmerized; suddenly taken by the absence of sound, we noted that birds could not be seen nor heard, and even insects had gone eerily quiet while basking in the mid-day  darkness.  an unexpected but very welcome stream of coolness seemed to spill over us on what was an ideally clear and otherwise hot summer afternoon.  \r\nin the final seconds of darkness, my husband asked why i had not taken a photo with my cell phone.  frankly, it had not occurred to me.  knowing there were only seconds to spare, i grabbed my cell phone and took a picture of the brilliant eclipsed sun.  however, i knew that a cell phone photo could not capture the spectacular and rare occurrence we were graced with witnessing that day.   \r\nseveral weeks later, i thought about the picture i had taken on that special afternoon.  i checked my cell phone and zoomed in on the sun.  as i remembered it from that day, the moon had overtaken the sun and had become engulfed with an angelic-like flowing translucence; but the photo could not compare with the memory of the actual event.  before closing the picture, i glanced above and below to see if any of the visible planets or stars could be seen.  much to my surprise, i found an object of enormous size (in my zoomed-in frame) in the 6:00 position below the sun.  it was clearly not one of the visible planets or stars (based on location).  and since it had been so quiet that day, i knew it could not have been an airplane.  \r\nbefore that moment, i had been a sceptic.  but coincidentally (if there are coincidences), around the same period of time, i watched a new netflix release: unacknowledged.  my skepticism turned to avid curiosity.  and since that day, i have been doing my research. i believe that what appeared on my photo during the great american solar eclipse might be evidence of something else: one of ours or one of theirs.  i would be most interested in your opinion.  thank you.\r\nattachment:
