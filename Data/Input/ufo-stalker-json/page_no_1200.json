walking the cat behind our apartment complex which runs north and south.  my attention was drawn to a bright orange light moving behind the trees.   for an instant, i thought it was a bolide, but then discarded that idea because it was moving so slowly and left no trail.   it was about 500 feet above the ground, and the sky was hazy with a visibility of maybe 5 miles.  the hazy full moon was visible but stars were not.   there is a small airport a mile to the south, so i thought the light might be coming from a small aircraft moving at 100 mph, but there was no noise.   it took about 15 seconds for the light to go from being due west of me to disappearing behind the trees to the north.\r\n\ti then saw a second light, the same color, brightness, altitude, speed, and track.   i walked back to my apartment, and a third light appeared, following the first two.   i then saw a commercial jet aircraft flying west from the austin-bergstrom airport 15 miles to the northeast.   its sound was following behind it by 4 seconds, so it was 4000 feet away.  my lights were much closer, still completely silent.   i tried to take a cellphone video of the 3rd light but it didn't register.   i got my wife out to look as the fourth light went by.   it did not register on the cell phone either but she verified my sighting.\r\n\tthe lights were the color of the sodium-vapor street light across the street.  they presented as a sphere about 1/20th the size of the full moon's disk.  their illumination was uniform from center to edge.  there seemed to be no obstruction such as a landing light lamp holder which would change the shape or intensity of the light as the viewing angle changed.   there was an almost imperceptable pulsing of the light; maybe 1% of the total brightness, at about 1 second intervals, but it was not a separate light such as a xenon-discharge marker.   i could see the individual lights on the commercial jet, in focus thru the haze, but these orange lights were not coming from a point source.   they looked like an out-of-focus source, something like looking at venus thru a telescope that is not in focus, but one or two magnitudes brighter than venus.\r\n\tobserver:   chris franks    hobbies include astronomy and identifying lights in the sky.   this is my first failure-to-identify in 80 years.   worked as an electrical engineer for the aircraft radio division of cessna aircraft, then 41-1/2 years as an engineer for hewlett packard.   worked with charles adams, who analyzed the \"crystal skull\" artifact and debunked its supposed extra-terrestial origin.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

walk.  i was 30 ft. in front of my house when i heard a continuous grrrrrrrrr click grrrrrrrrrrr click hnnnnnnn(like the high compression whine when a helicopter lands).  it sounded as though the object was sitting out back. i moved 8-10ft closer to the east side of the house to see what it was but could not find any light.  i know there was an object there but i could not see it.  my yellow lab led me towards it with his nose straight in the air. instead of confronting the object behind my house i called the dog and went in and told my wife.  she was concerned because i was standing there ghost white. i explained that there is something in the backyard that sounds like a continuous grrrrrrrrr click grrrrrrrrrrr click hnnnnnnn(like the high compression whine when a helicopter lands) and maybe it was some kind of jet propulsion engine or electromagnetic object.  she asked if i wanted to go check it and i said, no.  it was not bothering me and i was not going to bother it. just as she began telling me i am crazy, she flicked the light on in the kitchen(the east side of the house) and we heard a dense clang sound like brass symbols crashing but without the reverberating gong. her eyes widened in disbelief and the light above her head on the ceiling surged power and emitted explosive light 2 feet in every direction nearly consuming the hair on her head. it seemed as though the object was on the southeast side of the house and it ejected or ascended as if it was spooked by the kitchen light coming on. i suspect we were being spied on or analyzed. we went to bed that night somewhat disturbed from the incident. the next morning i was up early to travel. it rained the next day or two and when i got back on thurs., november 7th i searched for any trace of an object. i found a span of burn marks spanning 8-10 feet wide. \r\n    in conclusion, i would like to make one other note. last year around this time (right before the snow came) i had an odd dream

so i keep my eyes fixated on the sky daily. this day in particular, i was leaving my house on the way to school. i park my car facing west, so as soon as i got in it, i immediately noticed the object in the sky. i also saw four of what appeared to be military jets flying in its vicinity. the object was so far away i didn't even bother trying to take a picture as the focus on my phone wouldn't pick up an image, and i was in total shock and awe at the moment. the object was red at first, then the red light faded to reveal a white, cigar shaped craft, hovering in the sky. it was completely still. then it started to glow white, like an aura, then went back red, then white again. the next thing sealed the deal for me about it being an ufo. it emitted two huge balls of light from it's belly. not detached, but emitting them from the hull. they were extremely bright, like what you would expect from a space shuttle taking off, but completely white. then it started to turn in place, as if it was observing the planes flying around it. then it turned red and flew off in one direction and came back to approximately the same place. the only way i knew it flew away is the fact that it got smaller. i was trying to track it while i was driving and every time i saw it, it was in a different position in the sky, same altitude, just different place. i also noticed more planes in the sky while i was driving and counted 7 total. i eventually lost the craft because i had to travel in the opposite direction towards the school, but the planes and helicopters in the sky continued throughout the three and a half hours of school and on my way home. i kept the event to myself during class but i told my girlfriend as soon as i got home. in hind-sight, i wish i would've taken a picture. if anybody else saw the object and reported it to you guys, please e-mail me so i know i wasn't the only one to see it.","distance":"Over One

at it the wind was breezy/gusty. i was having a smoke and looking at my next door neighbor's roof when my eye caught movement just to the left of where i was looking. i looked directly at the object and it was coming from the west towards the east between our houses and traveled at a slow walking speed. the height above ground was less than 30' and i was standing on my deck which is 3-4' above ground. the object traveled from west to east and then gently turned (about a 20' radius)north until i was no longer able to see it. it was simply too difficult to follow because it blended so well. during the time i observed this object, it made no sound and did not change elevation and its slow speed was constant. i had a perfect view of this thing for about 20 seconds under ideal viewing conditions.\r\n from the time i first noticed the object, i can only describe it as a perfectly round distortion, about 10-12\" in diameter that was traveling very slowly. the tree branches and other items behind the object did not match up perfectly while looking through the object. i studied it intently trying to understand what exactly i was looking at. one of my first thoughts was \"this thing doesn't want to be seen\". it was very difficult to follow the object even while it was traveling at such a slow speed of probably about 4' per second. just after the object passed me, i noticed that the object then began to \"flutter\" faint white flashes inside the object that were retained inside the ball like object. the fluttering was not uniform as in the whole object did not pulse or glow. the fluttering looked like a large almost transparent butterfly with faint white wing edges that had too much material that flowed and was flapping very fast inside the ball. \r\nmy background is in mechanical engineering and i have never seen anything that has perplexed or shook me more than seeing this object.
