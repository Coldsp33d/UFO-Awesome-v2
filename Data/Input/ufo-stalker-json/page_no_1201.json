caÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩada flintridge area heading east on the 210 when suddenly i saw bright blue-white orb dart straight down across my vision in the near distance, about less than a mile from me on the opposite side of the freeway. it was perfectly round and did not blink or flash. it had a very pretty icy bright blue color. it was quick but graceful, flew effortlessly and was almost instantaneously gone from sight. like 1 or 1.5 seconds. i was sitting in the passenger seat coming back from a late meeting with clay's mom and i exclaimed, \"whoa! what was that?!\" because the object was so not a plane flying! it did not have a tail like a comet, nor did it fall and burn up like a falling star does. it freaking zipped across the sky! it was like the size of a nickel if you held one up at arms length... smaller than the moon, but bigger than a star. my boss was driving and she was afraid i saw something on the freeway so she looked to the road and did not see it in the sky. i said to her, ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩthat was weird... that thing was not like a plane or a falling star\" but then we kept talking and i was still thinking of it all the way home. \r\n\r\nhereÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩs where things get interesting... i get home, walk in my front door, and my husband jumps up from his computer all excited and says, \"babe, i just saw a ufo!\" and i say, \"i just saw it too!\" and my husband asked, \"what color was it?\" and i said \"blue\" and then clay proceeded to explain exactly to a tee what i had just seen; only he saw it about 15-20 minutes later than i did in upland, ca. this is my second ufo sighting in my lifetime! (my first is a much longer story from when i was a little girl in ulupalakua, maui) ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

wv. after passing the flat top underpass headed southbound on i-77 i decided to take pictures of the mountains with the fog settled into them. you can see for probably 60 miles the elevation is a lot higher than the surrounding areas. i snapped a few shots down the mountain at which on point the suns bright rays nearly blinded me (so i believe). as i approach the bottom of the dip i thought i seen something with my peripheral vision down behind the trees but thought nothing of it till i got home. on that evening i was uploading pictures from my phone onto my pc. first i noticed the ball of light in the last pictures and the bright light i thought was the sun. checked a couple pictures before and noticed an object fly east(right to left in the picture) and drop from the clouds behind the mountains. in the later pictures there is a light so bright you can hardly make out anything in the picture. then there is a ball of light heading left to right (then flying south/southeast). had some kind of red something coming off the sides which i don't know if it was caused by the bright flash of light onto the lens of the camera on the phone. the object continued to move in the same direction and drop behind the trees seen in the last picture. that is when i seen something out of the corner of my eye. i never seen this thing the whole time i was driving and was amazed when i went through my pictures. my truck window was down so i know it was not a reflection. the first (black) object in pictures i believe to be the same object seen in the last pictures. i believe the suns light was reflecting off of it making it appear as if it were glowing. i know for a fact it was not a plane or helicopter from experience working at atlanta national airways (ga), dulles airport(md), and oceana naval base (va).","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

it was full daylight so it was not a star or planet. it moved from the moon to the left and then stopped. then it started moving down and then stopped. it appeared to come from the moon or from in front of the moon. this is when i ran inside to grab my video camera. by the time i ran back outside, the orb had moved diagonally to the left and down away from the moon in the \"7 o'clock\" position. this is when i hit record and captured it for 2 minutes and 10 seconds before it just vanished into thin air. \r\ni used my sony hxr-nx30u video camera. \r\nyou can clearly see the orb in my attached video. i did not edit the video in any way. it's just raw footage. please enhance the video by 300% or zooming in to see the orb. \r\ni was the person in the video filming, and i was asking if my grandfather saw it but he said something about his eyes so he didn't see it until i showed him the video.\r\nmy camera was set to 1920 x 1080 60p.\r\nlook at the 15-16 second mark as it moves rapidly.\r\nthen again look at the 21 second mark, the object begins to clearly move from a stationary position. definitely watch the orb between seconds 15-16 and 21-23, it moves position rapidly then stops again.\r\ndefinitely not of this world. please share.\r\n-thanks\r\n-jeremy

house. my family was moving from ca to de in about a week so it was the last time we would be able to have a nice walk in the santa anna winds. the wind was blowing 25-30 mph, we loved walking in high winds it felt great. we walked about a mile or so and was in the middle of some good conversation when i saw a very bright red star about 80 degrees up in front of us. we kept walking not really thinking much of it, a few minutes later i looked up again and it was getting bigger. i said something to my friend about it and we both kept an eye on it while walking. at this point we both had our attention on the very large red star that was moving and quickly decreasing altitude. we watched the ufo drop down to about 300-400 ft off the ground and about 1/4 mile away. it was hovering over a box canyon we rode our motorcycles in frequently, we called it the ladera jumps because we would ride up the sides and fly over the top of the canyon walls.\r\nit was dark out about 8:30 or 9:00 in the evening and we had not spotted anybody on this freeway but us. normally we had to hide from the security patrol when ever we walked on this stretch of road. of course when we would have loved to see their truck come along this night, no truck. well we watched it slowly move from one end to the other end of the box canyon and then we were shocked to see it come over the freeway that we were on and drop down to 200-300 ft off the road. our nerves started to get the best of us when it started to come our way. it hovered with no noise at all while the wind was so strong we had to lean into it to stay on our feet. when it got almost directly above our heads we freaked out and ran the other direction. we were on a overpass at the time so we ran to the corner where it was only about a 10ft drop off the ground and jumped. as soon as our feet hit the ground we ran under the overpass and stayed there for a bit, i kept peeking out to see if it was still above us. i can not tell how long we stayed under the overpass both of us were shook up. when we got enough nerve to come out it was gone or so we thought. \r\nwe climbed back up on to the road and started looking all over the place trying to spot  it. about 1/2 mile away was a sheep herd that was brought in to keep the wild wheat down during fire season. we spotted the ufo it had gone over a small hill over the sheep and now it was slowly increasing altitude like it was in slow motion. when it was 200-300 ft high it slowly tilted on an angle until we could see through the dome on top of the ufo. inside in red light we could see the outline of 2 or 3 humanoid shapes. it increased altitude to 500-600 ft and took off so fast it was gone in seconds. the ufo was the  typical disc shape but on the bottom like a ring around the outside it had lights about 3-4ft wide that would change different colors, all the colors of the rainbow,it was like a wave flowing around the base.\r\n\r\nmy wife and family have been the only people i have ever told about my experience. sept 1970 thousand oaks ca changed my life for ever,its finally off my chest and it does feel good.
