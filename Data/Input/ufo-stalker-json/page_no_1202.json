saturday, november 9, 2013.  she went out on her second floor balcony to have a smoke and in a matter of seconds she called me how to ask me what type of light that was in the sky.  the light was very and i do mean very bright and at about 40 degrees in the sky (at 220 degrees sw from our location) visible over some trees and another apartment building.  at first i thought that it looked just like the bright white light that is on the front of large passenger planes. the biggest problems with that explanation is that it would have had to be within a mile of our location and flying lower that 750 (approx) feet in order to be that size and bright.  the thing was it didn't appear to be moving, there was no sound and it was not accompanied by the flashing red light that is always on the underside of all large aircraft.  together we watched the light for about 10 minutes and finally noticed that it was now lower in the sky (about 30 degrees). this change was so slow that if we hadn't compared it to the trees and the other buildings, we would have never noticed that it had moved at all.  i tried my best to come up with an explanation as to what this might could be but nothing seemed to fit.  i thought that maybe it was a large plane that was flying directly away from us and that's why it didn't move from side to side, but the size never really changed abd i just how slow could it go in order to appear to not be moving at all.  it was way to bright to be a star or planet.  i thought about a radio or cell tower, but the light did eventually go lower and eventually disappear.  the i remembered about the goce satelite that was suppose to be falling back to earth in a couple of days, but everything that i read said that the satelite always had a tail and would blink, this light had or did neither.  i also thought about the iss, but upon looking it up on the nasa website, it was traversing the sky in the wrong direction. it lasted or was visible for about 40 minutes. i'm not saying what it was for i have no idea. if anyone has the answer i be very thankful for any legitimate

the bedroom was located in the basement, having big windows facing the yard. i opened my eyes amd saw a bright greenish light, maybe a beam, enlightening the yard. the light was brighter than the usual spot located in the yard and it had a different light color (the actual halogen spot is not green). somehow it didn't seem to bother me and i felt to be at odds with myself whether i should get up and have a look out off the window or to get out off the house. in someway i also felt like i wasn't really able to move amd i closed my eyes again. after about 1 minute i got scared to death when the light disappeared but a noise i've never heard before come from over the house. it was a growling,  roaring and rumbling noise that went through my bones and went from a deep sound to a higher and higher sound as the thing liftet off. i still wasn't able to move and shocked deeply. after some 10 minutes later i heard the same noise again. this time it sounded like it was a couple of streets away. the same roaring with the same lift off sound. after that weekend, i told a colleague about it and he told me that he read something in a forum from a guy who wrote that he had seen something glowing and hovering over the village where i was that night, but i couldn't and can't find his entry. if anybody could tell me what it was that i saw and heared, if anybody could approve this happening it would really ease my life as i've been dealing with this for 7 years now.","distance":"21-100

pulsating, circular light coming over the tree line. i watched closely since it was so bright and there was no flashing as an airplane would do as we view aircraft regularly living where we do. as i told her to turn around and look, several other (approx. 3-4) objects started coming into view over the tree line that looked exactly the same. they were getting closer and you could see even more coming over the tree line. we went out front to see them as they flew overhead and there were neighbors out witnessing the same thing. as they flew overhead, there was zero sound emitted from any of them, and as they got directly over us, they seemed to just disappear. in total, there was probably 15-20 objects, all witnessed by several neighbors. we got some video from an iphone which is not very good quality, but very interesting. the objects flew in a straight path, but changed positions abruptly, in almost a very wide triangular formation. the first and the last object that came over was much brighter than the others in between. we live fairly close (approx 25 miles) to a major airport and a military base and observe a lot of aircraft from both, but these were something we've never seen before.

is that?!\" after looking at it a few seconds, and continued to verbally express my incomprehension of what this object was.  i pointed it out to my girlfriend but she could not locate it in the sky.  \r\n\r\nthe closest aerial vehicle that i know in comparison to what i saw would be the northrop b2 bomber, which are stationed in central missouri, and i have seen them in flight before.  however, given the actual size of a b2 vs the relative size of the object i saw, the engine noise would have been extreme.  also the object i saw did not have an apparent engine section extension added to the \"boomerang\" body shape, like the b2 has.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":52151,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.9711529,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11102013-0005","longitude":-91.8288034,"occurred":1384069200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1384099248000,"summary":"Large dark boomerang object flying parallel to highway k in o'fallon mo","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"63368","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Missouri","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:226655"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82751,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1202}
