had come back to my friends aunts house in pataskala for dinner. while i was waiting for dinner i was laying in a hammock looking up at the sky for airplanes (her house is under a flight line airplanes use as an approach to land). as i was looking up i saw a very small white object, appearing to be a circular or sphere shape, moving very quickly. this caught my attention because the planes that fly over her house are usually high up because they are on a flight path already, or low and slow with their landing gear out. i saw it and immediately knew it wasn't an airplane, the shape not right, it was too small, and it was traveling too high up and too fast with no jet contrail. almost as soon as i saw it, it made an abrupt upward directional change to the right (towards me). it was probably a 20 degree change from the direction it was originally traveling. a few of my friends were nearby and i yelled t the to come over. i tried pointing it out to them, but they didn't see it. they came right as it was getting to the tree line of the forest in her back yard. it was so small and going so fast that even i momentarily lost it when i looked away to tell them to come look at it. the only reason i saw it was because i was looking closely at the sky for planes. i know what planes look like, i've attended airshows since a very young age and my dad works in the aviation field, so i've been around planes all my life. i can assure you that it was not an airplane that i know of. there was no sound, it was too maneuverable, and going too fast. afterwards i felt very frustrated/defeated because none of my friends believed me because they didn't see it and i know that i saw something out of the ordinary. i was also very curious about it afterwards. i came to the conclusion that it was either a drone, or something our government has that we don't yet know about. either way it was an unidentified flying object and i wanted to report it. i've seen a ufo once before and i know it's a real phenomenon. i hope this will help people see that they are out there, even though it was a short and uneventful

garage, went inside an immediately let the dog out in the backyard.  this was at about 925p.  i saw to the north of me a large number of glowing orange balls in the sky with random spacing.  they were moving in a way that looked like ascending as the came slowly towards my neighborhood.  i made the dog go back inside and stood there watching for a couple of minutes wondering what they were and then remembered my cell phone was in my pocket. the lights were not there less than 2 minutes before when i pulled into my driveway.  \r\n\r\ni took several pictures of the lights and a couple of short videos as they moved across the sky.  there was the initial random grouping 6-7 lights, then a second random grouping of about another 6-7 of them and a few minutes later several more in doubles and triples and a few single lights.  they seemed to float across the sky.  there was some individual movement within the groupings but they all followed the north to southeast path across the sky. there was no noise.  i didn't see or hear any other aircraft, helicopters or anything else in the sky during the entire 10 minute event. \r\n\r\n my first thought was that they were flares, but they did not drop towards the earth at all but continued on in what i believe was a fairly high altitude.  occasionally it looked like one of the lights would sort of accelerate or move away from another light.  this again was quite random. some of the lights appeared to blink out and then come back on. some blinked out completely some stayed steadily glowing for the entire 10 minutes. the orange balls glowed but did not seem to cast any light around themselves.  i thought i occasionally saw an additional tiny red light inside the orange balls blink, but they were at a distance and i'm not sure of that.\r\n\r\nin my cell phone pictures the lights appear white but they were glowing orange.  the only photo that captures the right color was one where i tried to zoom in, but with a cell phone camera it is all fuzzy and didn't do me any good except it shows the right color.\r\n\r\nthey disappeared after they had passed towards the southeast.  i think they just all went out unless my neighbors house blocked me from seeing them if they had come down further out of the air.\r\n\r\ni went inside and tried to decide who to call to see what they were.  i decided on the abc 15 news desk.  i spoke to a woman and asked if she had heard of any strange lights over mesa.  she hadn't and didn't know if there was some kind of military exercise over the area either.  i watched the news to see if anything else came out but i haven't heard anything at all. called the news again on november 9th to see if anyone else had reported these.  nothing. these were so bright and so numerous that i can't believe i am the only one who saw these.  there is probably a reasonable explanation, but it seemed very strange to me.  i was not afraid during the event because i judged them to be pretty high in the sky.  afterwards my feelings are just a nagging curiosity to know what i saw and why nobody else seems to have seen or reported this.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

a flock of gulls in the distance.  they were flying from the nw to the se.  upon watching them closely, i could see they were definitely not birds, though there was a \"flutter\" effect, like the tail of a kite trailing a string of aluminum foil squares attached end to end by their corners (with a small space between them - not corner to corner.)  i said to my wife, \"that's weird, what is that?\" and ran outside.  definitely not birds!\r\n\r\ni put my hands up to my eyes like binoculars to block out surrounding light.  (it was cloudy, though the sun had recently come out in the southwest and was shining under the clouds quite clear and brightly.)  i had never seen anything like what appeared to be very shiny, reflective objects \"fluttering\" and undulating like a wave slightly up and down.  that's what gave the whole siting the feeling of something perhaps like disposable aluminum pie tins on a string fluttering and spinning about.\r\n\r\ni watched it for a while as it flew in the direction of ithaca/danby.  as it flew, behind it, yet it must have been under the clouds, i could see what looked like a star.  but, no star would have been visible in this rather intense (horizontal) daylight.  the \"star\" did not reflect light, but was giving off its own light.  it remained stationary (ne from my location) as the \"two strings of square/diamond-shaped pie tins\" passed in front of it.  the speed of the strings was constant (though way too fast for a flock of birds)and may have been similar to a typical plane you would see any day. my mind wanted to interpret the whole thing as a sky-banner, but there was no plane pulling it.\r\n\r\nwhen the double-stringed, sparkly object had gone too far for me to see, i ran in the house and called my son (who lives outside of ithaca - sw)and told to go out and try to locate them.  he went out, but didn't see anything.  perhaps he was looking in the wrong direction.  or, perhaps they were not at an angle where the horizontal sun would have been reflecting light in his direction.\r\n\r\nthe double-string shape made it look like a group of reflective objects that were curiously organized.  there seemed to be a connective feature mid-way along each string that tied them together.  after the unidentified flying stringy-thingy disappeared in the distance, so did the \"star-like\" object that was seen beyond it.\r\n\r\ni've never seen anything like it, nor heard of anything with this description.  it was not chevron-shaped, because it did not come to a point at one end.  it was two parallel strings of reflective objects with an apparent connection between them in the middle.  i sure wish i had had a real pair of binoculars with me!","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

i were standing in our driveway talking to our neighbor.  the wind picked up causing me to look directly overhead.  there were two cloud fronts moving toward each other from different directions.  one cloud bank was lower than the other and moved rapidly towards the south, while the other cloud bank moved from the south towards the north.\r\n\r\nas i watched the two cloud banks head towards each other, i spotted a bright shiney object directly overhead.  at first i thought the object was a mylar ballon.  it appeared as a constant bright metallic refection in the sun. i kept watching the object waiting for it to move around in the high winds. it was then i noticed that only the cloud banks were moving and the object appeared to be stationary.  i remember thinking, \" how could a mylar balloon stay put like that with the high winds ? \"\r\n\r\ni pointed the ojbect out to my wife and neighbor.  although my wife couldn't see it, my neighbor immediatly spotted the ojbect. a bunch of clouds from the south bound cloud bank began to cover the object.  i figured once the clouds moved on, the ojbect would be gone.  about four minutes after the clouds moved in, there was a hole in the cloud bank.  i looked up and the shiney object was in the exact same place it was before.  the object looked to be approximately 2-3 thousand feet in altitude. i know this because jetliners from minneapolis internation airport where holding an outbound flight pattern, which was directly over my house.  the object appeared to be about two to three hundred feet above outbound air traffic that day.\r\n\r\nmy next thought was that it might be a bright star.  however, the sun was out and it was a bright fall afternoon. looking around, i could see no other star like ojbects in the sky. next i remembered that there was supposed to be an asteroid passing close to the earth that same day.  the cloud bank recovered the object, so i went inside.  once in my house, i got on the internet to do some research on the asteroid.  as it turns out, the asteroid in question was only visible with a telescope.\r\n\r\napproximately an hour later i went back outside to look at the object.  there was a clearing in the cloud formation, so i looked up in the exact same spot the object had been.  it was gone... \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Me, my wife, and 2 yr old son were leavin my aunts house in the southern area of hope mills, nc. my wife (driving) first noticed 1 bigger orangish light hovering at least 300 ft or more above ground level, which looked fairly large and was kind of dull in color, i first thought of a meteor because of color and size, then i noticed it was not moving. that's when the object seemed to either multiply or deploy a smaller brighter orb as the big light simotaniously disappeared from my sight. as the the orb started to move and descend alone i noticed an orange trail very similar to a meteors fire tail, almost identical, but was moving or falling to slow to be one. then as it was falling (in a path similar to a leaf or side to side pattern) we both watched a second orb literally appear out of nowhere, stunned at this point we were both in awe at the orbs movement and color/fire trail of these orbs when the third one popped up a few seconds after the second we were shocked and i was honestley a little scared and worried as these 3 objects gradually descended to the tree line one by one in different  patterns, i turned my phones camera on by this time just to notice that the camera really didnt help, we could see the 3 orbs moving and falling behind the tree line on the video but it doesn't show the brightness or orange/fire like trail behind them as they fall behind the tree line. we drove the the area for a while, not seeing anything except the smaller plane circling a large area around us. after the 30 minute ride home, that same plane with the same lights was still in the same airspace a mile or so up, a lot higher than then the 100-150 feet it was flying when it flew right in front of us as the orbs were falling. i still can't explain what we saw tonight, but i just hope someone else saw what we did. that was actually our second time seeing orange orbs together, we saw 30+ large orange orbs hovering very low directly over a neighborhood in raeford, nc in 2005, as we passed the lights we lost sight behind trees, made 2 u-turns to drive by again but were not there the second time, about 3 minutes later. twice me and my wife have saw orange orbs and cannot explain any of it.","distance":"Over One

usually skywatch with night vision devices anywhere from 1 to 4 hours an evening. this week in question was very quite, no moving targets until early in the morning approx 254 am i noticed a moving object what seemed to be a large satellite in night vision. i scan the skies up and down north to south and east to west when i sighted this object, its my typical grid search., it was moving very slow from about 60-70 degrees above the horizon ne, it would stop and hover for a moment and continue. i then noticed this object was \"wobbling\" and closer inspection was actually spinning. i looked with naked eye and noticed it looked like a star and i then grabbed my binoculars after about 3-4 mins into the observation and noticed is was white and quite bright but fuzzy, colour almost very light blue. what startled me it had a hole in the  middle, did not seem to be a tower or bubble, just a hole. i followed it for about 15 mins, video edited to about 6 mins on attached video.It circled the ne sky about 2 times and on the second turn it took a direct path ne or more easterly direction and speed increased. i lost view of it over other downtown buildings. i have noticed similar wobbling craft in the past, this seems very similar to another capture i have on my collection of videos. i tried to get feedback from a lot of people to no avail so figure its time to send to mufon. i have captured many odd objects and ufos downtown vancouver and i see a major trend and most objects are head in one specific area of the lower mainland. i have a background in astronomy as a hobby and own telescopes, 2 night vision monoculars and binoculars and i have never seen an object like this in my life except for the other sightings earlier in the year. please let me know what i am filming.!! or if anyone else has seen something similar!! thank you so much! it seems to be a classic disk shape ufo, so i am quite excited! attached video is edited for time and digitally zoomed in to see the craft clearer, the original but edited for time is here.
