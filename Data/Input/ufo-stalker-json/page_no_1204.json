do you feel that? right there! right there!\" the people would look at me for a second, then just continue with what they were doing. they would look up in the direction i was pointing, but only for a second before returning to their routines. not a single person became even the least bit curious enough to ask me what they were supposed to be seeing! they weren't seeing it! they must have thought i was nuts! after staring into it for about 5 minutes, being exponentially filled with the love as each second ticked by, i thought that this is what 'heaven' must feel like! i thought wow, i never noticed the sun like that before! and completely mesmerized, i started the cab, turned left onto university avenue, and started a slow crawl from st. paul all the way into minneapolis, in a trance-like love-daze, winding my way through minneapolis until i got to lake calhoun, where i parked looking out at the water and feeling the \"heaven\" still inside me. i had lost all interest in picking up any more fares! i stayed there by the lake for at least two hours, probably much longer, and then the feelings of love started to subside within me. as the love retreated, i started to feel very sad that it was leaving and that try as i might, i could not make it stay! in hindsight, it was like people who have had near death experiences describe when say that they were filled with love when they 'entered the light', but then when they were made to return to earth, the love left them and they could not keep hold of it and that made them feel very sad... heartbroken! that's how i felt as the love was subsiding in me! i became very angry with myself for leaving the 'sun' back at rice and university, thinking \"you dummy! why did you leave?!\" i started driving back to st. paul when two things occurred to me. first, i was able to stare right into that \"sun\" for the entire 5 minutes without any damage to my eyes! and second, the cab stand at rice and university was located on rice street, at the southeast corner of the intersection, facing directly north. now i'm no astronomer, but i would bet you dollars to doughnuts that the sun has never appeared 30 degrees above the horizon in the northern sky in the entire history of this planet! so what did i see? well, i've had many years to think about it, and believe me, i think about it nearly every day, wishing that i could get that feeling of heavenly love back! nobody else could feel what i was feeling, even as i was trying my best to point it out to them. this leads me to believe that whatever it was, it was meant for only me. why? beats me. i haven't a clue! what was it? well, it was in the air, and although it was stationary and not flying and looked exactly like the sun, it was in the northern sky and so definitely unidentifiable (not the sun). i have to conclude it was a ufo. what was the feeling of love it poured into me? i think it was possibly an experiment, perhaps to see how i would react. i hope whatever they/it learned from my reaction does not lead to the development of something sinister to be used against us in the future, but what a perfect weapon when you think about it... make everybody on earth feel how i was feeling when filled with their 'love', then invade. who would want to shoot back? so i'm a bit torn by the experience. on the one hand, i wish i could feel like that forever. on the other hand, i'm a bit angry that someone or something would mess with me like that. at least it wasn't your basic run of the mill alien abduction with the all too common accompanying orifice probes, so that's a big plus in my book!!! believe me? disbelieve me? i don't care. it was what it was. i haven't experienced anything like that since... kind of wish i could though! i wonder if anyone else has been subjected to such an event?

any object they were mounted to just the lights. they were moving south west about 20 mile an hour and as they got about a half mile from us they would dim and dissappear. i tried to do all the math

getting brighter and brighter. the more i looked the brighter it got but it was not getting brighter it was getting closer, before i realized it was within arms reach and i felt like i couldn't turn away no matter how hard i tried. it was scanning through my eyes with some sort of laser it was like it was reading all my memories like files in a computer. literally 1000s of images from a baby till the present flowing and i could see the images as it was scanning and i know they were from my mind because well i remembered so many of them. i remember feeling like it was searching for something

(from the next room) leaving me alone in the kitchen. i immediately turn back  to look at the object and as i did, the object started to glow brighter and more intense this occurred for 6 to ten seconds then as if reacting to the fact that they had been spotted an immense beam of light shot out bursting through the kitchen window hitting me in the chest violently pinning and paralyzing me against the wall, sucking all of the air out my body. i could not breath. at this point i am in a state of shock. the kitchen at that time got so bright that i could not see anything but light all of a sudden i feel some thing spinning violently in my stomach all of this occurring at once. this affect lasted for fifteen to twenty seconds. the light, like a vacuum gets sucked out of the kitchen everything comes back to view the spinning motion in my stomach stops as well and i am released from the wall collapsing to my knees crying uncontrollably. not wanting my girlfriend to see me like that i crawled on my knees slowly exiting her apartment trying to get next door to my friends apartment i knocked on his door he opens the door to see his friend on the ground crying uncontrollably i crawl into his apartment and cry \"sobbing\" after five to seven minutes past i start to regain my composure again, and he is begging me to tell him what just happen. i guess  the residual affect of what just happened wouldn't allow me to speak about it without crying and that night i would cry on and off for two hours. after regaining myself i cautiously walk back to my girlfriends apartment and asked her, did she or her soon notice anything funny in the kitchen? she responded no. i asked her son why didn't you bring your mother back to the kitchen to show her the object? his response was that she wasn't interested.Thats when i broke down and asked didn't you guys see a bright light they said no. so after all that i just described my question is there anyone that has had this type of experience.\r\ni used to think that i was a tough guy standing 6'3 200 pounds living in a tough city but after that situation i found out that i am not as tough as i thought i was. willing to listen from anyone willing to help. thanks","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":52086,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.7174828,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11072013-0012","longitude":-74.0042231,"occurred":1026358200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New York","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Egg,   Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1383867570000,"summary":" a ufo in ny attached me>","tags":["hovering"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":4137,"locationName":"New York, New York","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:227429"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Malgrat de mar","country":"Spain","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"6 objetos luminosos , claramente ovnis muy luinosos volando en  direcciones imposibles para un avion , en vertical , horizontal, etc..Con rastro luminoso","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":52085,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.6455042,"location":null,"logNumber":"ES-11072013-0011","longitude":2.7438793,"occurred":1383877080000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Catalonia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1383855560000,"summary":"6 objetos llameantes en varia direcciones","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid","timeZoneName":"Europe/Madrid","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Malgrat de mar, Catalonia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:227430"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Sunny Isles Beach","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At about 7:40am on oct 28 2013 a comercial jet did a nose dive then 2 fighter jets coming from the south fired a missel or rocket that chased after a white ball like thing that went into a cloud came out at a 45 degree angle and effertlsly excellerated out of the reach of the missel it wasnt like on tv it just went faster the the missel streight up the missle tryed to turn but couldnt and i lost track of where it went 15","distance":"501 Feet -
