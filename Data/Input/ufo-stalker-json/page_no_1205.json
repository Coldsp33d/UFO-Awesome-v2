the clear night and a sky with no regular aircraft in site. i was looking due west approximately what i thought was about 9 or 10 0'clock. and i saw what i thought at first was a reflection of one of those spotlights that are used at special events or airports. then it moved closer and i could see a series of lights with equal amounts of separation. it had a slight bend in the formation, and it didn't move sqaurley from the apex of the curve, it moved at an angle.With all the lights following in line with the lead light.If i had to put a size on what the mass would be i would say it could have been a mile or two wide. though i couldn't see mass just a row of lights i felt it was one solid object.It moved from the northwest to the southeast. i felt in awe and completely convinced that it was a full blown ufo as i have spent a lot of time looking up at the night sky and i have definitely never seen anything that was as fantastic a site as this thing was. this isn't the first ufo i have seen so i didn't get overly exited but it was thrilling. i watched it go out of site moving to the

description is in romanian language because is easier for me to describe with details and without any error. please find someone to translate propely this text. faceam, impreuna cu cumnatul meu, poze lunii pline cand vazand in directia opusa muntii fagaras usor luminati de lumina lunii ce se ridica, am incercat sa fac o poza nocturna de pe trepied cu expunere mai lunga catre munti. am tras cam 3 cadre in care, in timpul expunerilor, discutam cu cumnatul meu care, cu un aparat mai putin performant, se straduia sa surprinda luna satisfacator. dupa fiecare cadru luat muntilor am verificat ceea ce am obtinut iar la una dintre ele am remarcat o mica dara luminoasa pe care am considerat-o atunci ca fiind probabil vreo stea si considerand reflex poza probabil \"miscata\" din greseala am mai facut cel putin o poza in speranta de a prinde poze cat mai clare. tin minte ca discutam cu cumnatul meu despre faptul ca totusi ma mir ca am prins o lumina de stea pentru ca cu ochiul liber nu se vedeau stele deasupra muntilor insa nu am dat mai mult atentie chestiei. insa retin faptul ca lumina lunii (care se tot ridica de la orizont) crestea asa incat si stelele care se vedeau in mod curent deveneau destul de putin vizibile. la foarte scurta vreme am auzit un zgomot ca de avion apropiindu-se. fiindca se auzea destul de tare, fata de felul cum se aud cele care trec frecvent deasupra zonei unde locuiesc, am cautat din priviri in sus sa localizez sursa acelui sunet. atunci am remarcat faptul ca nu se vad luminile pe care in mod obisnuit le pot vedea la avioanele de linie care strabat, la altitudine mare, din diverse directii zona de domiciliu. avand aparatul pe trepied, l-a decuplat rapid si din mana am incercat sa prind cateva cadre cu acele lumini dar, pentru ca foloseam un obiectiv de zoom insa destul de nepotrivit pentru capturi ale unor obiecte insuficient luminate, am avut o oarecare intarziere a prinderii in cadru a acelor lumini. poza surprinsa mi-a ridicat mai multe intrebari intrucat apar lumini cu dare cauzate de miscarea naturala a mainii la zoom maxim dar si lumini si dare absolut deloc \"miscate\" in acelasi timp. iar luminile \"miscate\" par sa fie sub celelalte care sunt \"nemiscate\". pot afirma dupa sunet ca a fost cel putin un avion implicat in aceasta experienta insa dupa numarul luminilor albe precum si dupa taria si felul sunelelor auzite as inclina sa cred ca a fost vorba probabil de doua avioane. si nu cred ca erau de linie pentru ca pareau a fi mult mai jos decat cele care, cum spuneam, survoleaza frecvent zona de la mare inaltime in diversele lor rute. insa separat de acele sunete specifice de avion nu pot afirma clar daca se mai auzea inca altceva intrucat atentia mea era in acele secunde spre capturarea de imagini cat mai repede posibil pana sa de indeparteze. insa am retinut cert faptul ca am remarcat mai multe lumini decat in mod obisnuit si nu toate pulsand. cele rosii pareau si mai mari decat cele albe, nici nu pulsau si cand le-am vazut prima data pareau a fi a o scurta distanta de cele albe (aveau un mic avans fata de ele) cand am reusit sa prind in obiectiv luminile respective trecusera deja peste vertical locului unde eram eu asa incat le-am prins oarecumva putin din urma lor. cand am descarcat pozele pe calculator si le-am studiat am remarcat faptul ca si poza cu peisajul montan nu e una miscata si mai mult m-a mirat faptul ca, la o prelucrare simplista a pozei in sensul aplicarii unui surplus de luminozitate, se observa faptul ca norii slabi prezenti deasupra muntilor erau mai luminati in zona acelei dare de lumina. adica dara de lumina era pozitionata intre munti si norii destul de josi. si mai mult, nu putea fi o stea asa mare comparativ cu muntii si nici nu putea sa se deplaseze aparent asa mult in intervalul de timp in care am tras cadrul. mai multe despre experienta asta nu stiu ce sa va spun insa m-as bucura daca m-ati oferi o explicatie logica intrucat cei cu care m-am sfatuit nu au reusit sa explice poza in mod multumitor. pozele atasate sunt cele originale (cele mari) si cele mai mici sunt decupari din cele mari la care le-am aplicat strict un surplus de lumina (uniform in toata poza)pentru a vedea mai clar ce anume e acolo.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

with aliens.\r\n\r\ni had my nightlight on as i fell to sleep facing my open window.  at around 1:30 am i became aware of myself lightly dreaming seeing gray clouds.  i then opened my eyes and realized i could not move my toes or anything else, except for my eyes and head.  managing to rool over on my back i saw up against my closet an orange grey, and 3' from it an alien i later found out to be called, \"god mars\".  i kept staring at the orange grey in disbelief as how it could be orange noticing its eyes were a lighter shade orange.  when i first looked at \"god mars\" being all pure white with radiation moving on its body it projected a 6\" white aura onto my bedroom door for 3 seconds then the aura went back into him.  both entities were perfectly still, as they each had a round foot long 3/8ths of an inch white enamel stick in front of them.  neither one touched the sticks.  the sticks were upright on a foot wide wooden counter that stretched out in front of them.  the counter was waist high to the entities.  \"god mars\" had a small head with small round eyes, and huge rounded shoulders.\r\n\r\nwhen i looked away from the entities i became aware of one inch long lines hooked on to the backs of my head near my ears.  then i realized the lines being thinner than a hair was the source of why i could not move.  and then i realized the sides of my head feeling bloated.  then looking back at the entities i soon heard a loud motor sound coming from them, and towards my bed.  in panic i screamed as loud as i could three times.  when i screamed the third time, with my eyes closed, moving my head from side-to-side i noticed everything was gone when i opened my eyes.  at this time i was kicking my legs and moving my arms.  i went right to sleep.\r\n\r\n9 months later i found a website that mentioned orange grey.  otherwise i never heard of one, and years later i bought 2 dvds that show the entity i encountered called, \"god mars\".  it is engraged on a boulder in a foriegn country and said to have great knowledge.  i recognized the small head a huge rounded shoulders.\r\n\r\nattached are all my ufo sightings and alien abduction, encounter

began to question the source or object. 3 nov 2013, notice a bright light that stayed stationary for extended periods of time. i traveled to a higher elevation to find that with the visual horizon of the skyline, 8 additional lights were observed. each appeared to be less than a 1000 ft about ground level, in a radius perimeter expanding over the entire field of view of approximately 270 degrees. the lights would intensify becoming extremely bright for a short periods of time as the objects remained stationary. as the object dimmed, the lights were in a triangular shape vertically. a brief description would be if 3 incandescent light bulbs were stacked horizontally. driving towards the source, the lights would vanish. twice on the evening of 3 nov, once in the location of the object, the source of the illumination went off, revealing an aircraft. i exited my vehicle in an attempt to listen as it flew directly over head less the 500ft above ground level. the normal position markers and anti collision light were observed but the craft was practical silent. if not straining to hear the power source, if would have easily passed unnoticed. i can not express completely in detail the coloration changes of the lights from each of the craft observed. \r\n4 nov 2013, i spoke to friends within the aviation community, although none doubted what i described, none of us could come up with a logical explanation. on this same evening, 3 of us travelled to the high point field of few which i witnessed the activity the night before. by 6pm, the craft were back within the same areas. with the vehicle parked, and lights off , we just observed the activities. attempts were made to capture on video. once viewed, its just not enough detail. we all agree that whatever the source of the lights, it is high energy. no light beams, or spot lights, but more of a intense glow of variable colors. the most visible activity is between 5:30pm and 8:00pm. within the course of our observation, once again, a craft few directly over head, emitting practically zero sound. one personal belief is these may be drone aircraft. prior manufactured drone aircraft could not remain stationary due to being prop driven. now, drone aircraft do have the ability to remain stationary and are of a rotor wing design. the this being a plausible explanation as what the craft may be, the next question is why are they there and what are they doing ? we search the web for more answers a came upon this site. seeing the many have described similar sitings, we thought this is the place to post our story. we are going back to the same point tonight being 5 nov to watch what we consider the unknown. if anyone else witnesses this type of light, be sure to look for others. i was actually shocked to see how many were actually seen at one time. ten of us will be there tonight. i must say, the one of the observers that was along 4 nov, has stated she will not go back to watch due to fear of what was seen, and possibly being seen. more to come !","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path then

area with my 6 year-old daughter. i looked east and saw a bright reddish orange sphere object about 45 degrees above the horizon. i thought this was a very strange object because it just floated and did not move. it then moved very slowly in a south direction. it then turned and went slightly north and then went east picking up speed and then out of view blocked by rooftops. it didn't shoot away quickly it just seemed to accelerate smoothly but at a moderate pace. my daughter and i saw it for about one minute. i could tell it was very close and low by how fast it dropped over the horizon behind the rooftop. it was definitely not a plane and i thought maybe it was a floating chinese lantern because of the way it glowed and changed colors from red to orange and appeared to float but it did not move with the wind but changed directions. \r\n\r\nwe continued looking for several minutes and it suddenly appeared again near the original location. it seemed to just appear and it may have been a second orb because the first was pretty far away when i last saw it but i only saw one at a time. this time it was not as bright. i ran back to my house which was only a few doors away and got my video camera and told my 11 year-old what we saw. we went back and it was not there. we waited about five minutes and it appeared briefly for about one minute near the original location but the lights then went out or it left quickly. i believe it went east but i was looking through my video camera and lost sight of it. i got a brief video but it was not very good because my dog was pulling on me. we waited about five more minutes and did not see it again and went home. we were all quite excited as this is the first ufo we've have ever seen. i say that because this was unlike anything i've ever seen.\r\n\r\nwhen we arrived home, i went upstairs in our two-story home and opened the blinds and looked out a large east window for about ten minutes hoping to see it again but saw nothing and figured the event was over. i left for only about one minute and decided to check one last time and close the blinds and i was shocked to see it right in front of the house at about a 60 degree angle, much closer than the first two times. this time it was very bright because it was very close. i do not know how it got there that quick because i was only gone for a minute. my daughter was on the telephone telling her friend about it who lives a short distance away and told her we are seeing it again and to go outside.  i ran outside and began videoing it. my two daughters and wife came and they witnessed it. my daughter also took an image of it with her tablet. it remained still for about 20 seconds and then moved slowly in a southerly direction pulsating its colors with various shades of orange and red sort of like a fire. it was an orb shape but seemed to change shape slightly with the bright glow around it. it flickered a few times getting dim and then would get bright again. it continued moving in a southerly direction and got very dim either because it sped up going away from me or just shut off and then it was gone last seen going south. this viewing lasted about three minutes. i estimated it was about 500 to 1000 feet in altitude. i estimated the size to be about 10 to 20 feet in diameter. it was silent with no sounds or noise emitting from it.\r\n\r\ni googled \"red orb over discovery bay\" and found two reports this year, one with video and the video was exactly the same type of object we saw. other searches revealed reddish orange orbs to be a common ufo phenomena in recent years. can't say it was extraterrestrial but it appeared to be controlled based on its movement and was unlike anything i've ever seen. i called two sheriff's offices since i live near the border of two counties and they had not received any reports. i called two local papers and they had no reports. i'm sure others must have seen this since it was so bright and unusual and this is a populated residential area. i will post the video on youtube and here which is okay quality but i used too much telephoto but you can clearly see it.

no sound.  i got a call at 11:18 pm saying come see this.  from my driveway through the trees the lights were 2-2.5\" apart when i held my hand up in front of me.  only reference i could think of.  3 minutes later it was close to treetops on the horizon and i measured 1/2 to 1 inch on my finger.  when i saw the lights i only ever saw flashing or strobing.  wife and mom in law saw solid light and flashing/strobing lights.  i heard no sound while outside watching this.  they saw more than i did and said they heard nothing the entire time.  if looking at a map of hayesville  imagine the lights coming down hwy 69 near the state line then moving east towards the clay county rec park.  it seemed slow moving while i watched.  we do have aircraft fly overhead here normally.  but this was different.  i will keep my eyes peeled tomorrow and will have camera ready.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

tonight between 8:30 pm and 10:30 pm my dog would sit and whine and look skyward whether indoors or outside. its a cloudy night so we could not see what was going on up in the sky southwest of us a little ways but there was a red glow to the clouds in one spot in the sky. a little after he quit whining we took him for his nightly walk the red glow was gone from the clouds. we have had some troubles with strange ufo's in the area one was destroyed about month ago with the local ufo and two friends he called in when he couldn't get the other strange one to back off, the three of them combined their weapons and destroyed the stranger. i hope that was not being repeated tonight. since it was cloudy there is no telling what was going
