up then a forth orb that was by itself light up just as the 3 orbs began to 'fade' then disappear, the fourth orb then disappeared. it was a little further south than the cluster.  the total length of time they were visable was at a count of 2 at most.  it was when i saw the first three orbs that i called for my husband who was inside the barn tending to one of our horses, but by the time he made it outside, they were gone.  we waited approximately 3 - 5 minutes just to see if they came back which the 3 orb cluster did.  it was only visable for a count of 2 again but it was further north than were i had originally found them. trees blocked our view from where we were at that time so i don't know if they came back.  i checked in the front of our house but didn't see them again.  they were orange in color.  they gradually lit up reached what i thought to be the brightest then faded away.  this was for both sightings. there was no movement noticable while they were lit and the only 'movement' i can say i noticed is when the second set of 3 orbs appeared further north.\r\n\r\nmy first thought was flares but that would have left more of a noticable trail or noted movement.  there was none.  i knew it wasn't headlights as it was to far up in the sky for that. the sky was clear so there was no reflection on the clouds.  i don't know what it was and really don't have any sort of explanation other than they were orange orbs.\r\n\r\ni have never seen anything unusal that i couldn't explain as something 'normal' or ordinary. i am always on the look out for these events but this

on the north side of 500 south. it was 8:58pm, and i was walking with a friend, both of us witnessed the object.\r\n\r\ni first noticed the object as i am a natural sky watcher, i like to look up and see what stars, aircraft, clouds, etc. are in the sky at any given time. i noticed a bright point of very clearly orange light north west of our position. i pointed it out to my friend, as it was noticeably unusual from anything i normally see in the sky. the very bright orange light did not blink, and seemed to move relatively slow, and was completely silent.\r\n\r\ni didn't know what to think of the object at first since it was clearly not an airplane or helicopter, it was to bright and close to be a star or satellite, and it was a steady, constant light.\r\n\r\nthe light moved from north to south in what appeared to be a subtle arch from west to east and back west along it's path. as the object passed the leonardo in my sight line it began to grow in size. as it continued south it expanded to what i might guess to be the size of large car, but it was not possibly for me to tell it's actual size and distance. the intensity of the light diminished as the object expanded and continue it's smooth path/decent. i lost sight of it as it dipped below the roof line of the near by buildings on the south side of 500 south.\r\n\r\nthe expanded object looked like a blob of glowing orange around a dark or not visible interior, like a glowing viscous fluid over a glass bubble, though the object did not appear to be a perfect sphere. the uneven appearance of the glow around the object gave the impression the object had spin and a subtle wobble.\r\n\r\ni felt excited to see something so unusual, and i felt the object was beautiful and transfixing. i pulled out my phone and snapped a (unfortunately, slightly motion blurred) photo of the object in it's smallest, brightest form early on, then switched to video mode and attempted to record it on video too. i stopped recoding about 45 seconds in and moved closer to 200 east hoping to get less flare from the street light, then began recording again. the video is dark, and i'm not certain the entire event is visible since the object was less bright as it expanded.\r\n\r\nas the object neared the roof line of the buildings to the south my friend and i ran to 200 east hoping to regain a visual of the object, but i could not see it anymore. there were commercial airplanes, stars, streetlights, etc. all very clear, and non remotely like this object.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

been hearing for the last 3 weeks. the night was cold (57 degrees), clear skies with lots of stars, light wind, and i was sitting facing 255 degrees west. i had my cell phone, a digital camera, and a pair of binoculars. i used the cell phone compass to determine my direction and the voice memo application to record the conditions and my observations. there were many aircraft, jet and helicopter flying in the area, all with appropriate red or white strobe lights flashing.\r\n\r\nwhile scanning the skies periodically i noticed a grayish cylinder object float across the sky almost directly above me from a ne to sw direction.  the object was definitely not a flock of birds or floating debris as the shape never wavered or formed into any other shape. it remained a cigar shape. the object made no sound, had no lights, and had no contrail. it was definitely lighter in color than the night sky and i did not observe it passing in front of any stars. there were no aircraft in front or behind the object and i could not estimate it's altitude, but i would have to estimate it's speed in excess of 500 mph. albuquerque airport is about 15 miles to the sw of my location and is adjacent to kirtland afb. all aircraft traffic observed was either in a north to south direction at a lower altitude or east to west at a higher altitude used by commercial aircraft.\r\n\r\nbefore i could point my camera in the objects direction it passed outside of my eyesight or was made difficult to see due to the porch lights of the house across the street to the left and also from the porch lights

��� sunday 3:30 am to 5:30 am (ist 03:30 to ist 05:30).\r\n\r\nlocation reading taken from handheld gps: north 19 deg 01.147' & east 073 deg 17.087' ��� matheran, panorama point, maharashtra, india.\r\n\r\nwhat were we doing?: stargazing with telescopes (150 mm newtonian reflector on dobsonian with 25 mm & 10 mm eyepieces).\r\n\r\nwhat made us first notice the object?: a glow in the sky as big as the full moon and having a similar brightness of the moonlight around it. imagine the size of full moon and there is no moon in there!\r\n\r\nwhat did we think when the object was first noticed?: a nebula so prominent and how could we have missed it!\r\n\r\ndescription of object: the spaceship had 3 pinpoints of lights. like 3 fingers (index, middle & ring fingers) of our hand. unequal in height. here the spaceship had index finger light most bright and ahead than the other two. the other two pinpoint light sources were dim as compared to index finger���s pinpoint light source and were equal in brightness.\r\n\r\nactions & motions of the object: slaty grey colored waves like wifi signal symbol were emanating on the front & the back side of the spaceship. it moved slowly but definitely. we know artificial satellites like iss or hst move fast in an arc, having a visible pass of few minutes with naked eyes. this moved in a straight line and then made a turn to descend and then ascend. when it made the turn, the wifi signal symbol-like waves emanating from it, changed their pattern, to resemble a floral pattern, which is illustrated in the ufo pdf uploaded below. as it moved to one side, the waves emanated from its opposite side, appearing to propel it or leave from its exhaust. \r\n\r\nfirst seen near star canopus > took a turn near star alphard > last seen near star procyon.\r\n\r\nthe travel path was as long as the big dipper asterism in the sky!\r\n\r\nour feelings, reactions & actions during and after the sighting of the object: as soon as we saw it, through the telescope, binoculars and unaided  eyes, there were shouts of joy and ecstasy! ours was a mixed group of people of mature age and understanding. there were multiple questions as to what could it be. we tried contacting local astronomical societies, who all were sleeping then. we continued our observations non-stop, recording its movement against the background stars.\r\nwe didn't have a camera / d-slr to photograph or video-record this event. the mobile cameras could not record the faint light of this far away object.\r\n\r\nhow did we lose the sight of the object? we didn't. for almost 2 hours, we kept on seeing it. it did become faint as it went far away from us. but the most important thing was, it stayed there. it got lost in the haze of the rising sun as it dawned. the sky became too bright to observe any further.\r\n\r\nplease check the pdf file uploaded for diagrams & star charts.

to it and was rotaing and reflected the sun light every second or it was artificial produced like being shown to us. it hovered did not asssend or desend just hovered i was looking right at it for 10

light blue light appeared out of nowhere by a grouping of four stars in the shape of a diamond. when it appeared it was already in motion it made no noise at all but it traveled faster than the world

headed for it managed to travel what must have been at least 50 miles is about 0.5 seconds. it looked kind of like if you take all of the stars in the sky and put them next to each other like in an atom but you make it brighter than that and make it give off more light than that. when it got to the 3 star grouping it just disappeared, gone without a trace. right after it disappeared is when it hit me, i was thinking there was no possible way that was man made. then i wondered where was the satalite, the pastor that i was with had the star walk app open on his phone the object was not on there but the it said the satalite was right next to the grouping of four stars but it wasn't there i looked the next night but it still wasn't there and so i still don't know what it was. i still

honestly, and this might sound crazy..But i think they heard me yell and probably turned on some type of cloak. i only say that because where it hovered and stopped it turned black with the sky and all the bright colors just vanished. but i could still see a black outline of the rectangle, and in all the stars out in the sky i could see a patch of them missing gone right where the ship just vanished at. like the stars where hiding behind the cloaked craft. and i turned to my friends and they saw nothing. it all happened in about 10;15 seconds time. two of my friends were facing me and one was inside on his way outside, and they were shocked by my crying and me shaking they really thought i was joking at first, and i told em everything i saw and two didnt believe two of my best

driving on route 32 westbound through batavia then eastgate. i viewed a bright, stationary white light. no movement. no other stars or celestial shining lights viewed while driving. 31% cloud cover according to weather station online report. the light must have been at very high altitude because i traveled for about 6 miles due west and it stayed in the same exact position from my view through the driver's side window. i estimate it at about 60 degrees above the horizon. i thought it might be a geosynchronous satelite but i don't think i have ever seen one before so i would not know. the white light was at least as bright as the landing lights of a large plane were on while in flight. i do recall seeing the running lights of a plane, white with some red, somewhere in the vicinity of this light, though they did not seem to be close to each other. i am quite certain that i veiwed this same object one night at home a night last week. my house is only about 4 miles from the point where i first noticed this tonight. both times struck me as unusual because of the brightness of a totally stationary white light many times more luminous and considerably larger than that of a pinpoint starlight-like object i've ever seen in the night sky. while watching from my home's driveway there was no sound. that did not seem strange as the thing seemed to me to be very far away. tonight i tried without success to find information on the internet that could explain this. i could not find any data that might site an orbiting satilite as the possible origin and no ufo reports similar near my location. i lost sight of the light when i changed direction and entered hilly terrain. my sense is sort of like feeling suspicion, and wonder of what simple, ordinary explanation there probably is for this thing. and if there isn't one then seem to have a feeling of trepidation. \r\n\r\n  ","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

small but still bright white then it just disapeared.  i ask my husband the whole time \"what is that bright thing in the sky\".  at first he thought it was a star but when it disapeared he was as surprised and puzzled as i am.  there was an airplane flying from the north going south closer to us right before the orb disapeard and it was still flying after the orb disapeared.  id say the airplane was flying at 30 or 35 degrees above the treeline.  it is a clear night and we can see the stars.  no noise was heard.","distance":"Over One

craft was flying horizontally and fairly low in the sky, passing from right to left from the observers position. it was leaving a dense trail of thick smoke, vapor, or substance on its wake. this object was a real, structured, physical machine and may be seen from its reflection in the waters of the madre de dios river underneath it. the object was estimated to be over a hundred feet long.\r\n\r\na newspaper account read in part:\r\n\r\n\"the colour of the head or nucleus of this disc was an intense orange. the direction was south to north, was visible from 1 to 2 minutes, leaving

altitude i believe they were at they would have to be traveling i. excess of 3000 miles per hour. no sound whatsoever. i was amazed at the speed and coordination. they did not manuever or turn but they were so tight and quick i let out an \"holy sh*t\" again i have an extensive background in aviation and whatever these were they surely were not anything that i am aware of in existense in this

turned around and looked exactly where the craft was. i exclaimed to the three other people present look! and pointed. i couldn't say anything else to describe what i was seeing.The other three gathered beside me and behind me as i pointed at this craft. i remember lowering my arm,i cant say exactly how long we stood in that spot, then the craft rotated parallel to the ground and menuvered west ever so slowly to a small cloud. i looked at the one person to my left and asked \"are you ok\" she never responded to my question but stared at me as though she was in a daze. i turned and observed the other two robotically folding and raking the yard.About 10 to 15 seconds passed by and the three others who was present picked up pace and started chatting. not a single one of us said a word 0f what just happened.   the beauty of this craft.......,human words cannot due justice. i can say it was as highly polished pure silver. there was no windows or doors.It had a slight domed top and the bottem was slightly convexed. the strangest thing i noticed was it had no shadow. i like to say it was self luminous non-radiant. this event was mentioned in a statement to the government in 2001. since then my personal life has been completely turned up-side-down. a psychologist came to me and said  \"they are just trying to get you to hurt someone\"  .......Im scared but i fear nobody.

direction gewestweg to go hitch-hiking to sint-niklaas; halfway hoogkamerstraat i noticed something in the sky and showed my hubby, we kept on looking, it was so strange. a man across the street started watching too. no clue what it was, so kept on looking. it hovered incredibly slow, very high in the sky. never knew anything could go so slowly! but it moved. less then step-foot speed, much much less. it moved from left to right in one straight line. so slow. no sound, no extortions, no wings. it was a massive object. must have been huge, as it was so high up in the sky and yet the size of a ball. oval shaped. strange colour, like mother of pearl but without all the other colours. pure mother of pearl, but a bit different. never saw a similar colour in my life. no windows, no lights. there weren't any planes nor helicopters, nor balloons. the sun was high in the sky to the left. there were absolutely no clouds. the sky was bright blue. it was a lovely soon to be spring day which felt like spring already. with three people we kept on staring to the object. then all of a sudden it went up at such an amazing speed as if you have something on an elastic that was stretched and let loose. and it went out of sight within a second. we looked at the man across the street who was shaking his head in unbelief as well and walked on. kept looking up in the sky to see whether it would come back or see it somewhere else. never saw it again. later that week talked to friends about it who looked at us like we were idiots and laughed. never reported it. a couple of weeks later ufo sightings were all over the news. military involved and all. still didn't report it. got laughed at enough already. and the shape i witnessed was different than the shape witnessed in the ardens. 23 years later and i'm still trying to find out what i saw ...
