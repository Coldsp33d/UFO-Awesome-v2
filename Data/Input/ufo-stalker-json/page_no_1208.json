job and heading to a friends house when he felt a warmth in his head and a voice that told him to go to his parents home.  he arrived at his parents home around 3:30am. as he pulled up to the driveway he noticed that the driveway light had just turned off like someone had been there. the home is located on a wooded light with no neighbors nearby. as he got out of his car he heard a metalic sound like something hit a rock. in the home he heard the dogs barking frantically. he looked out a small, open window and saw two red orbs. each contained a small \"gray\" creature about 3 1/2 to 4 feet tall. as he watched he saw about 2 to 4 shadows between the orbs and his window. they seemed to be about 6 feet high. they were making bliping noise as if they were speaking to each other. he felt they were trying to get into the house through the opened window.  he grabbed a stoker rod from the fireplace and went outside to chase them away. he remembers turning the corner of the house and then \"waking\" with the stoker lying on the ground next to him. he said that he lost about 1 to 2 hours of his memory. his mind was all messed up like he had been on anesthesia. also his right foot which was broken some time before the incident was now healed but now his left leg hurt.  he also notice the his clothes were not on him right...Like they were remove and put back on wrong. he felt very disoriented and exhausted. he felt he could not make it back to the house so he sat in his car for a couple of hours until his mom came out to walk the dogs in the morning. he told her what had happened. the witness has dreams.  since he was around 18 everything has a 31 in it���all his passwords, etc.  this happened on his 31st birthday.  he always had dreams since he was 18 where it was things he never knew about like quantum physics, einstein���s theories, time and space were 3 dimensional, unified field theory.  he would wake up and write them down and then look them up and verified what he had dreamt. witness feels he has been observed for many years but only while at his parents home.  he found out later that his stepfather also had visits.","distance":"20 Feet or

daughter said \"dad mom just yelled for you to go outside.\" i thought that maybe there was something wrong with one of the dogs or an animal had gotten into the yard and the dogs were going after it. ran out and she told me to look up. i saw this object that looked like it was on fire almost. had 5 to 6 appendages protruding below it. i yelled to my daughter to get my phone so i could get a picture of it. she didn't here me so i went in to get my phone and told her what we were looking at and to come out. by the time i got back out the object was moving off to the east. i told my daughter to go get the video camera. she did, turned on the camera and got a little bit of footage. i only got one picture with my phone. the picture isn't great because by then it was to far away for a close shot. i told my daughter go get the car keys and we went to try and catch up to it. i chased it through three towns. never got another shot. when i got back i spoke to my wife about what had happened. she told me that when she looked up she saw the object hovering over or close to our house. when she yelled for me the object then began to move off. what is so weird is on 10/31/2013 i had been watching the planet/star or whatever it is in the sky. and had noticed that it had something orbiting around it. i had been observing it the object orbiting it. for hours it changed positions through the night. also had been trying to research if anyone else had noticed these events. next day i have a ufo over my house. to me that seemed a little weird. as amazed as i was by seeing this object it wasn't the first one i had seen. and certainly not the biggest. this one almost seemed like a probe in my opinion. it reminded my kind of the lunar lander because the appendages/legs below

1sr the object appeared much larger and was white with out the usual colorful lights. i picked up the binoculars expecting to see the colored lights with them, but this object was an elongated oval or cigar shape with white pulsating lights outlining it top and bottom.  what was very unusual is that what would be described as the oval body was more a silver white shade with at least 100 tiny sparkling lights. it almost looked elegant.  this was total opposite in appearance as to what we had been seeing in the same area, ne of us towards pittsburgh, pa. the third time i looked at it through the binoculars, it had morphed into an elongated boxy rectangle shape. there were other objects that looked like what we had seen in october in the sky also, and two took a flight path to the west.  they were much closer than a jet and had what would be described as a gliding motion ... they just glided across the night sky much lower, much larger, and quicker than a jet or helicopter. i told my husband you have to see this. he looked through the binoculars and immediately said go get the camera. he was a previous skeptic.  the repeated sightings in october have changed him into a possible believer, but this sighting tonight has finally converted him. he was very disappointed that i could not catch anything on film using two different digital cameras. i have no idea what type of camera would work. ... tonight's sighting is like nothing we have ever seen before or could have imagined.  the entire object looked almost transparent and glowed and sparkled white.  it is now 2100 11 pm est and i am going to go back out to see if it is still there.  it is cloudy and it disappears then reappears as if it might be going behind the clouds but not sure, it might be fading in

curly blonde hair. after this meditation i felt the need to take a picture of the sky. so i did and when i looked at the picture i saw the craft. it has 4 lights and 8 lights when zoomed in and is transparent with a dome shape it is either very large or close to me. i attached the original image, zoom in to see the additional 4 lights. the image is facing 215 degrees sw and my location was 48*

lights, no blinking around them and noticed they were not moving.. the airport in in opposite direction as well.  eventually around alexander exit i drove under the 2 lights hovering and could not see any shape of what they were from, kept on my journey.. when i got to cantrell rd in little rock i noticed when i looked back south i could still see the lights still hovering. i had traveled maybe 8-10 miles since i drove under them.  i pulled over took a video, as i pulled over i noticed 4 military helicopters flying in formation from maumelle/north little rock area flying towards the object in the south.  i then noticed lots of helicopters in the sky in all directions, i think i counted 8 of them, i have to watch the video to be sure cause i counted them out.  watching the object i noticed that now it had ejected 5 smaller lights to the right of the object about 1\" away from my vantage point.  these 5 lights made an l shape and blinked bright white light in sync and just hovered in place.  after 10 mins of observing i left the road and continued to drive.  \r\n\r\ni felt kind of comfortable and cool when i first drove under it and when i saw it again, but when i saw the military helicopters flying in formation towards it thats when i got a little scared.  \r\n\r\ni do not know what this object was, i do not claim that it was alien and i do not claim that it was military. for all i know it could have been either.  i just saw something odd, unidentified and of obvious interest to many many helicopters that normally would have no reason to be flying around

to call someone, so i contacted mufon and left a message. he was so frightened he asked me to call the air force, but i couldn���t find a phone number. i watched it and took video of it and so did he.  then he came home, and his boss called him on ranch 4 to go meet him. i answered the phone. i asked our boss to look outside to see the ufo, he said it looked like a planet or something he was not sure. i hung up the phone while my husband was going to going met him his boss. while my husband was gone i was outside looking up and the object moved from the driveway side to my front door side. i was getting very upset, because he was still at ranch 4 with his boss, so i called the fire department, but they said they did not see it. the fire department is far from us, so maybe they did not, but i think they were scared. \r\nwhat did you think the object was when you first noticed it? a ufo. \r\ndescribe the object and its actions and motions in detail. it kept moving from the side of the

clucking, and the lamb seemed dazed. \r\ndescribe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object. i have seen ufo���s a lot as i have previously reported off and on for the

west to see if the bright object had shown up yet. it showed up after sunset, but before twilight. around 7:30 pm. i have taken quite a few photos of it over the past months, and decided to take a few more. i set the camera (on a tripod) on the roof of my vehicle. i took eleven photos over a twenty minute period. the first photos showed the white object (orb) with a halo around it. the last photos showed a more distinct orb shaped object, with a purple center.\r\nit's as though the 'cloud' around the orb was a product of it's flight. after remaining stationary, the 'cloud' disappeared, showing more distict detail. in other words, i'm guessing the apparant ionization surrounding it was a product of its propulsion.\r\ni left the camera set up, and an hour later i went outside to see if the object had moved. i witnessed a jet coming from the direction of san antonio (coming from the southeast) headed straight for the object. i decided the pilot was a lot braver than i. the object increased in brightness as the jet drew closer. the 'halo' again appeared around the object, as though it had fired up its engine. i had the impression of a cat arching it's back and the fur standing out. i would guess the jet flew within two miles of the object. about four minutes later, another jet appeared, following the same path as the first. this time the object retreated around ten miles into the distance.\r\ni happened to check on the object about twenty minutes later and witnessed another jet approach the object from the north. this time the object disappeared into the distance.\r\nthe first photo shows the object after it first appeared, with the 'halo' surrounding it.\r\nthe second photo shows the object in more detail with a purple center.\r\nthe third photo

around the little lake in bell roth park at approximately 10:00 pm. when i got to the east side of the lake, i noticed three orange-ish lights in the distance to the west south west. i watched the three lights doing aerial maneuvers for a short time then they looked like they were coming in my general direction. i was curious but not afraid. they got to, possibly, a couple of miles from me and made a sharp turn to the north like they were following federal blvd. toward northglenn. i remember wondering if my mother, who lived up in that direction was up and watching the lights too.\r\n\r\nafter a few moments, they came toward me again and stopped directly above where i was standing at the top of the berm by the lake. i became mildly alarmed when they started coming and by the time they got to me, i was terrified and began looking for a place to hide. i ran toward the childrens playground at the base of the berm. a bright white light shone down, then blinked off and then the lights were gone. when i got back home, my husband asked me where i'd been and told me that he'd walked around the lake at least three times looking for me. i was confused and felt like i'd been drugged.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1
