i am convinced 100% it wasn't a normal craft. i won't mention one of my friends name as he works for an orginization i'd rather not say but i will say this. he's an aircraft mechanic and now an investigator of plane crashes. if anyone can officially rule out what we saw as an aircraft it would be him...A professional at hand. we went ther hoping to see something maybe just out of excitement but honestly didn't think we would. we got something waaay more than we bargained for and something we'll never forget. probably not the best idea but we're already talking about goin up again for the night in a few weeks.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:01:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":87379,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.754412200000004,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10162017-0026","longitude":-119.7641868,"occurred":1508009400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1508189649000,"summary":"While star gazing i noticed a light appear out of no where and watched it fly over us til it disappeared.

like days today. it was perfectly clear and you could see airplanes from hundreds of miles away. not a cloud in the sky. i took a stroll to the backyard to see what work needed to be done. i looked into the south skies. while doing so, i took notice to a bright metallic object in the southern skies.  it stood out becuase it far brighter and lacked the \"trail\" all the other planes were leaving in the sky. it didn't look like it was moving at all initially. shortly after, it sped up acsending and descending throughout it's flight path. over the course of about 7 seconds it moved all the way from the southern sky to a position between me and sun, where it seemed to disappear. i couldn't really see at this point due to the brightness of the sun, so i just started filming and covered my eyes with my other arm. i could faintly see it appear just above the horizon where it asends a short distance then descends below the horizon(right before i say \"ufo\" in the video). i kept the filming rolling another 10 seconds or so for the heck of it. after reviewing the footage a bright light was present (which was not there after revewing the footage, 20 or 30 secs went by). i assume this is an effect of filming the sun? in addition, the video has some objects flying by. not sure what to think of this either, it wasn't really windy at all? maybe a 3-4 mph wind speed?  i was hoping to have someone who knows a thing or two about video software to analyze it to get a better picture. hoping maybe someone else saw this or coulud derive an explanation from the video. please email me

in 2015 in harlow, uk. it was a clear night so i was looking at the stars a lot. as i changed direction my attention came to a different part of the sky where i noticed the object. it was a cigar shaped orange light that was stationary. the light had no blinking lights that aircraft would normally have, but was just a orange light with what appeared to be diagonal lines going through the light. it also appeared to be a dark shape around the light almost squarish. i thought the light was strange so sat and watched it for a few minutes to see if it was moving. it was not. i also noticed there was no noise coming from the object which was also strange as aircraft overhead normally make a noise. after it hadn’t changed direction or moved i decided to take a picture of the object. my first photo was faded as o had the flash on so i had time to change the camera settings which was all new to me and took about a minute to figure out and take another picture. this picture had clearly caught the object as well as some stars. i was then checking out the photo to make sure it was a good picture and just shortly after the object just disappeared. i physically saw this object with my own eyes for several minutes before capturing it on camera. i can’t explain what i saw that night it didn’t look like anything i have seen in the sky before or aircraft so to me it is a ufo. i would be keen to find out if anyone else has seen anything else like this or can explain it.\r\n\r\npeople have said its lens flare but that does not explain how or why i saw it with my own eyes. when you zoom in on the picture you can see a shape around the light it would be interesting to see if someone can make this object clearer.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

circles. a drone spins and this was not spinning. it cleared a short amount of space and vanished into the clouds. it could be easy to say that it was a product of johnson space center, i have no idea why it would be flying around up here. you could say it was a toy. i don't know if flying toys go that high and i didn't see anyone nearby with a remote control. all i can say a boy at the pool who is under age saw it too. i had him look with me as he was the only nearby with his grandmother. he had no idea either. i have never seen anything like it and i do not take drugs and of sound
