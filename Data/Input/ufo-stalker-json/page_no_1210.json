about 4 minutes from the time they saw the object and then took picture with i-phone camera. they started looking at it at 9:10 am.  i seemed to be about 4 miles off-shore. it was not a sea plane. the binoculars they used was 10 x 50mm strength. you could see it was something hover over the water once the got the binoculars. it then took off away from the witness toward the horizon. the total amount of time they saw the object was about 20 minutes. the picture was taken at 9:26 am.  not sure if the craft was sucking up water because it seem so strange. but that is what it looks like in the picture. i am attaching the screenshot of the picture but the witness will e-mail the original. dennis wears glasses but did not have them on him. when they used the binoculars they could tell it was definitely above water. at first they thought it may be a boat but not after they used the binoculars. \r\n\r\nabout 2:00 pm on the 800 block on the same street they saw 2 military green helicopters that were side by side. the were surprise that they hovered over the neighborhood. they were heading east. the saw them hover for about 30 seconds. stop and go movements over the neighborhood. they said they have see helicopters going down the beach but they have never seen them hovering over the houses. \r\n","distance":"Over One

couple of stars and usual activity of helicopters (path from morse/hamilton around new albany area they usually circle in day and evening.  generally 3-5 helicopters and some small planes most evenings. i noticed to the right side one helicopter was brighter like a star east of the rooftop of building behind me. it appeared to move behind the building sideways in straight line so i put on glasses and checked the time on my phone 1:47 am. this light was brighter and didn't have the red blinking light of other helicopters. although the light was facing me it moved slowly from east to se ( compass 129 degree se. it stopped over the rooftop(left side) , emitting light like a star. after a few minutes i decided to time it to see how long this helicopter stayed in place.\r\n\r\nat 2:02 am it still hadn't moved but i was aware bobbling and wobbling like a top (not a helicopter) & not like a star.  i was aware of bright light flashes coming from the top & as the light hit the clouds around it i noticed it was definitely round orb like, and although it was clear outside small clouds were around the parameter of it (a small space of no clouds around it, then small clouds around that space). it would emit a red or green light that wasn't evident until the light bounced off the cloud.\r\n\r\nat 3:07 am, a red thin flash like a lazer beam shot out of the bottom, but when it hit a cloud below it didn't go through the cloud it rippled across both sides of the cloud. that was interesting. this happened within seconds and only once.  i became aware of several very tiny stars i had not noticed next to it, but as i blinked were gone. \r\n\r\nat 3:10 am the object shot to left about 2 feet, then shot to right, then up and down and then stopped all within the area i was

33&#8728;22'59\"n, 112&#8728;10'30\"w. this morning while on the back porch facing due east at approximately 0806, i saw what appeared to be an object well above the flight pattern reflecting the morning sun on a heading just slightly south of due west. my home is in the primary flight path for sky harbor, so commercial aircraft are a frequent and constant sight. aircraft overflying phoenix at altitudes above 20,000 feet heading westward in the same approximate area as the ufo i saw are also a common, everyday occurrence. as an avid sky-watcher i keep binoculars close at hand (tasco 7x35), and the apparent lack of traditional aircraft features and contrails piqued my curiosity. on the horizon at first glimpse the object was reflecting the sun, appeared roughly the size of a baby aspirin, and was traveling at a rate consistent with high flying aircraft, but slower than satellite traffic. through the binoculars the object was approximately dime-sized, apparently metallic with a highly reflective surface, and clearly discernible as a perfect sphere. no visible wings, no contrails, no heat signature - just a highly polished, metallic sphere that i kept in the binoculars for roughly 3-5 seconds.  when the object was 15 degrees east of being directly overhead, i grabbed my iphone to capture an image, maintaining eye contact with the steadily moving object, then watched it vanish instantaneously. i had roughly 30 degrees of visibility before the object would've been blocked by my home, and quickly ran to the rear of my yard which affords a full view of the objects westward path. visibility was open with only the faintest hint of clouds, and the entire western horizon was devoid of any aircraft whatsoever.  i could still clearly identify commercial aircraft to the north and east in the pattern, but the object i'd been following simply disappeared.  i grew up around military aircraft, served in the marines and also in the air force as a c-130 loadmaster. i am very familiar with commercial and military aircraft, and have been trained as a professional observer. this object was highly visible, and did not appear to possess any characteristics of any aircraft i've ever seen before, nor did it resemble high-altitude weather balloons, which i've seen on numerous occasions. it was visible in one instance, then gone without a trace in the next.  truly remarkable sighting, and i hope i wasn't the only one in phoenix to catch a glimpse of it.

(lenght) or the size of 2 school buses.  it was approx 500 ft away from me and no more than 400 ft. in elevation. it made no sound (i turned off music in my car and opened window).  it was a dull gray or putty color, and had a slight curved bottom contour - i could not see the top of it bc of my close proximity to it, but i think it was slim sized.  i live about 8 miles from davis-monthan afb, so i

friend in albuquerque, nm (from thursday, 10/24 through 10/28/13).\r\n\r\nafter finishing dinner at the pf changs restaurant (at 4440 the 25th way ne, albuquerque, nm) on sunday, 10/27/13, my friend and i headed to the parking lot when my friend noticed a very bright light hovering in the sky over the general area above the roof of a hotel (i think a drury inn?) in the same parking lot. we stood for about a minute or two debating what we were looking at, since when focusing on two points on the hotel's roof the light wasn't moving. so we decided to get in the car and decided to head sw in the direction of the light outside the city limits where the light pollution was less. it was odd because it was hazy/some cloud cover in the night sky and the stars weren't many, and the ones that were visible in this parking lot weren't that bright. so this light dominated the sky even in a well-lit parking lot and was rather big and round in appearance. we noted the time on the car clock as 7:58 p.M. (mt) when we got into the car.\r\n\r\nwe headed up paseo del norte (road) heading west in my friend's car. as my friend was driving we noticed planes flying in the sky and they were distinctly smaller, had the typical red and blue blinking lights, and less bright than this light which appeared stationary and unwavering in the night sky.\r\n\r\nso, as my friend drove her car, i kept my eye on the light so as not to lose its orientation in the sky. the planes appeared to fly under or around the bright light, but it was the planes in the foreground and background that made it clear this wasn't an airplane. and as the planes moved, this light did not.\r\n\r\nwe stopped at a sharp curve in this road which is the perimeter to a local airfield (double eagle?). there are no streetlights at this point and this area is considered \"behind the volcanoes\" which, i guess, means something to you if you're from this area. (it's a dark area from which to view the albuquerque \"valley\" and see the entire city from a terrific perspective.)\r\n\r\nthe photos i took are not really very good. these were taken with a panasonic lumix f 2.8 25-600 mm camera, which i had on me in a backpack for my visit with my friend and her family, as well as to capture our day outings in and around the albuquerque area. the photos simply show a bright light. it's odd because there was no moon visible in the sky tonight and this object, to the naked eye changed colors to include flashes of bluish-green, red orange and yellow before descending below an apparent cloud cover, as the light lit up a layer of low clouds making the light a muted, warm orange, and making it apparent that this light was descending behind/below the cloud cover. finally, even the warm bright light wasn't visible as even a muted light in the sky and we drove to my friend's home in the albuquerque area.\r\n\r\nwe thought maybe a weather balloon? do they emit bright lights that appear constant? did anyone else see this tonight?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering

i went outside. i looked to the ne, and an unknown strange glowing object caught my eye. it wasn't acting like any normal firework, so i sprinted inside and grabbed my video camera. \r\n         when i came back outside and started recording, the light was slowly moving south from the north east, and was not making a sound unless it sounded like popping fireworks. i figured it to be moving maybe 2-5 mph tops. i was startled, and my heart was racing with questions. the more i watched this glowing pulsating red orange ball the more i began to realize it wasn't normal it wasn't a plane or helicopters. as i tried to follow the object with my camera, it was moving further away. then it just disappeared like a light switch.\r\n          i watched the skies for another minute or so, when like a light switch, it was back due east and twice is high as before. i begin filming a second time but it was just too far away to capture any good quality as you will see in the first video.\r\n          the object appeared to be 1/4 mile away and i could not determine size. from my vantage point it was the size of a tennis ball. when i first witness the object i knew it wasn't a firework because of its manorism, shape, and pulsating nature. it was mostly all red with a pulsating orange in the middle. seeing this object at first scared me but then i became 110% curious. i still would like to know what it was, as this incident remains in my daily thoughts. \r\n           the reason i am coming forward now is because i would like some answers, and if there is a 1% chance of this

i was on  my way home in the country. around 10 pm. it was about a half mile distant. i would estimate its size at 20 feet in diameter. it slowly passed from north to south and disappeared. my aunt who lives nearby said she also saw it. the next night i noticed bright lights in the sky. i used to enjoy stargazing so knew these weren't stars. the following nights sightings escalated. the bright white light in the west appeared, accompanied by two strobing white lights. there were also several strobing objects whose light changed red/green/blue. these were higher in the sky. i called my neighbor who met me at our property line. we watched the lights and figured they were really strange. the following night, he brought his wife along and we stood on the back of his truck and watched and counted many more objects scattered across the sky. we used binoculars. we counted 13 of the pulsing colored light objects. they seemed to be stationed about 15 miles apart. there were eight bright white lights in the sky, scattered apart. there were six strobing white lights across the sky. the next night i looked outside and saw the strobing colored light objects. they were across the sky and were stationary. i wasn't just scared, i was terrified. the next three nights i stayed in town. the bright white light to the west is still there, though not always in the same position. i don't go outside at night anymore, though i'll peek once in a while. sometimes i can spot one or more of the objects. there don't seem to be nearly as many as the time my neighbor and i watched. there has been unusual military aircraft activity which has not been seen in this area previously. there was an awacs plane with its fighter escort flying at a low altitude at twilight, a c-130 flying a curious pattern in daylight. there were three black/grey helicopters flying in formation from se/nw in the daytime. i finally screwed up the nerve to take pictures. i set the camera on a tripod with maximum zoom and set for night filming. i used the highest resolution. after converting the image to jpeg, i noticed the detail was about the same.\r\nthe photo of the rectangular shape with the strobe on the side was about 2 1/2 miles distant. i discovered the rectangular shape only after examining the photo. if i had to guess the height of the rectangle, i would say it would be close to 30

past 10 days. i have waited for news reports of a helicopter crash, however nothing in the last 3 days has been reported. so.... i cannot not report what i saw during the early morning hours of october 26, 2013. and, i cannot believe that i would be the only one to have seen this (late fri night, early sat hours).   at approx 1:20 a.M. saturday morning (oct 26), i was lying in bed. my bedroom faces nw; my view is that of the ocean + ucla campus + 405 frwy sepulveda pass area. i live in a highrise and my view is second-to-none of the skies in that direction. i constantly see planes and helicopters flying around all day and all night. i have become accustomed to seeing police helicopters speeding in one direction or another all over westwood.... there seems to always be 'something' going on (additionally, there are emergency medical flights that constantly land on the rooftop of ucla med center). this particular evening, while late i was still awake lying in bed..... and i suddenly noticed a red blinking light fly over my building towards westwood/ucla (the incoming projectory was above my sliding glass door towards the westwood area... a norm that is seen very often). however, this time.... the projectory of the 'helicopter' was *going down fast*. i expected it to slow it's angled direction and steady itself over 'the incident'. this did not occur.... causing me to sit up in bed and watch what i thought was to be a helicopter crash somewhere in the vicinity of the fraternity houses on the other side of ucla. i watched as it still angled downward, i watched... i watched... and then bam! it hit!!!   while waiting, and staring, and waiting, the explosion that i expected did not happen. i kept waiting... still nothing. i floundered about wondering if i should call 911... still no explosion, and most importantly no fire engine sirens (i hear those constantly and am located very near two local fire engine companies). i kept waiting for sirens, kept waiting for a delayed explosion, kept waiting, kept waiting, and kept waiting. absolutely nothing.  from first sighting to 'what i call should have impacted' took probably about 8-10 seconds. i know what i saw.... a fast-moving blinking red light (that of my norm police helicopter in the area) with a projectory from above my building going way too fast and too angled not to have crashed. i promise to all those reading this.... i saw something, and something that should have crashed. while i heard 'no crash' and 'no explosion', i know what i saw. i saw what i thought to be a helicopter crashing. there is absolutely no 'ifs, ands, or buts' about it. i figured that the morning news would surely explain it all. i wanted to call someone, but who? and, i did not want to sound like an idiot to anyone i could have called since 1) there was no explosion, and 2) no sirens immediately after the fact.   my concern, my wonderings, my thoughts flooded my mind for at least an hour after that. i had pulled out my binocs but saw nothing in that direction immediately after-the-fact. even come daylight, i still saw nothing in that direction with binoculars.  on an ending note, what i saw was not a meteorite (there was not that familiar streak in the sky associated with a meteorite)..... nope, this was a blinking red light (that which i associate with a police helicopter) that came angling down into the ucla area and suddenly disappeared at ground level. no other colored lights, no solid lights, no noise, no explosion.  if *anyone else* saw the same thing that night.... please please make a report here!   i saw something waaay back when in my late teens, and i will never forget what i saw then. then, 10 days ago i watched for over an hour and a half -- an object that never moved in the sky during daylight hours. and now, yet another 'something'.  it took 30+ years to see 'something' a second time, and only 10 days later to see 'something' a third time.... waay to uncanny. i'd swear with a polygraph as to what i saw.... and still, even to this day, not a single report of a helicopter crash to confirm it. ten days ago, i had a witness to what i saw.... however, sadly this time.... it was just me.... and i'd give anything to know that someone else saw what i saw. i just cannot be alone in what i saw.... i am in the ucla westwood area and it being a late fri night/early sat a.M. ---- well, there just had to be others who witnessed the same thing..... and as of today, sadly there just ain't a single other report listed here :(","distance":"501 Feet - 1

light in the sky, that was extremely low, too low for a plane. i pointed it out to my son. we then observed a second similar bight object move close to the first, both appeared to be hovering and within a few hundred feet of each other. than one moved away swiftly to the north/west, another object then joined. we observed up to 3 or 4 objects moving in sync, then broke away, one remained above the road and seemed to follow us as we headed west. all these object were bright, very bright, and seemed to have random blinking lights, ability to hover, and move away at fast speeds, sometimes turning abruptly. we stopped the car to try to take a photo on our camera, but were only able to capture a bright object. at that same time, we called my brother to tell him, and talked briefly with him before my phone cut out it's signal. this incident took place as we traveled home in my car, from monroe, ct, through easton ct, to redding ct, a trip of about 30 minutes and we observed the objects for about 10-15 minutes of the trip. this occurred mainly on rock house road, but the objects seemed to be in the western sky over easton or redding.\r\nwhen we first saw it, immediately it looked to bright for a star or plane and too low in the sky for a plane, and it's movements seemed too different than any plan could make. we did not hear any sound, even though we opened the window of the car. at the closest, the objects may have been 500 feet or more above the road. \r\nmy son and i were certainly amazed as we watched, and a little scared about it. eventually all the objects moved and we could not see them.
