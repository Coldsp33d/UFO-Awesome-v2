having a cigarette.  as i was standing there, a extremely bright beam of light appears on the one side of the peak of the neighbors roof.  it was so bright, it casted shadows from it.  the light then disappeared, and another beam of light comes down on the opposite side of the roof peak.  at first what came to my mind was, did my neighbor install security lights on his roof?  that made no sense, as he has had no reason or problems that would cause him to install this type of lights.  i then thought that maybe another neighbor had a flash light out and was shining it at his roof, but that made no sense either, because the neighbor would have  had to have been way up high with the light pointing down.  i looked up to see where this light was shining down from, and could only see up about as far as maybe 300 feet, but there was nothing up above from where the light could have came from.  there was no sound coming from above, like maybe a helicopter or airplane it could have come from.  and what else was so unusual about this, there were no sounds going on at all, it was dead quiet.  no car sounds, no birds singing, no crickets, no cicada sounds, nothing.  this situation lasted no more than a minute.  i became really scared, seeing this light coming from out of nowhere.  if you were to go into my neighbors yard, there would have been no obstruction from trees or power lines in the path of this bright beam of light coming down on the roof.  it just stopped, all of a sudden.  i stood there, trying to justify what i just saw, and could not come up with any viable reason as to how this could have happened.  i saw the neighbor at about 5:30 am, leaving for work, and i just asked him if anything strange had happened at his house recently, and he said no.  i did not want to ask him directly about the light beam, i thought he would think i was crazy.  he just moved into this house about 6 weeks before this happened.  now each time i am out side, i am always looking over to his house to see if this happens again.  this has really bothered me since it happened.  if anyone has heard of something like this happening around here, please contact me and talk to me about it, please??\r\n\r\nthank you,\r\n[name removed/cms/tg]","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

mono-scope and field-glasses. by far the most interesting event was possibly a rather large emp discharge seen only on camera. this discharge followed a couple of smaller ones. as a former senior aerospace research engineer and private pilot this intrigued me the most and something that i had never witnessed visually. each discharge radiates out in two invisiable-to-the-eye waves from the center.  \r\n\r\nit also appeared that the flight crew was having great difficulty attempting to regain control of the craft in light of a possible mechanical problem. the craft also appeared to lose altitude following each discharge but did appear to regain a little more control. after a period of time they soon dropped down behind a saddle in the mountain but it's glow was strong enough that it could still be seen for many miles.\r\n\r\nnote that this event took place near the area of bugarach mountain and rennes le chateau, both well known as possible energy centers.    \r\n\r\nalso note, that my son and i are still on vacation and staying with our friends chris and sue ingram in southern france and have not had a chance yet to down load the video from our camera to the computer, but will up load the video when we return in a couple of days. both chris and sue would be excellent to interview and are both english living in france. chris is a well know writer that can describe most everything to it's smallest detail.\r\n\r\none last observation is that one would think that the military, police and others would have taken action to investigate and/or recover this craft but none appears to have taken place. this craft appears to me to have made a possible hard, simi-controlled landing but did not explode and probably remained in tact.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

hadn't moved for at least five minutes.  i asked my son what he thought it may be to just joke about it being a ufo and he said i don't know probably a plane.  at that time i told him i don't know because it hasn't moved.  then it got brighter and started to fade to a small pin point and got bright again then to a small pin point then disappeared completely.  it was gone roughly 10 seconds and came back in the same spot and got bright then faded to a pin point then did that one more time and disappeared completely.  about 5 seconds later it reappeared quite a disance north of the spot it

there were any planets visible at that time and following up the next night to make sure it was not a planet or just a bright star, i saw the exqct same thing tonight saturday and it followed almost the exact same path as noted the night before. the plane threw me off and it only shows to make sure before submitting a report.\r\n\r\n99 out of 100 times there is always a logical answer to what i am seeing, i was seeing venus which in itself pretty cool but i should not have submitted a sighting until i checked out other answers first, which i always do.\r\n\r\ni apologize for mistakenly submitting my report, the plane really through me off, and was just a coincidence. \r\n\r\nas a side note saturday night i also saw an orange light that disappeared, this was only a chinese lantern, saw for app.30 - 45 seconds viewed through binoculars, you can normally see that the light will look like yellow and orange and you can see the candle flickering on top and the bottom look orange and when it burns out you can see the black structure of the lantern falling, its easy to think its a ufo,however i have also seen objects much larger that are similar in color but looking through binoculars looks like a ball of fire almost molten the only thing that to me looks like the lit end of a cigar if you blow on it, and it is flying. make sure to note if its windy or calm. \r\n\r\nits easy to mis identify objects, give your sighting time and most of the time you will be able to come up with a logical answer as to what you are seeing, but keep looking up and you may be able to see
