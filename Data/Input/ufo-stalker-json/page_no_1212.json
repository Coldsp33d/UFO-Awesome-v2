awhile.\r\nnoticed object as soon as i sat down inbetween a tree branch.\r\nat first i thought it was a passenger jet which stage and fly toward midway airport right past my house,sometimes i have counted as many as six at a time. but this one did not move at all it just hovered motionless and it was seemingly much brighter than jet lghts and much larger. there were i think five jets during the sighting that went past it, at that time i was thinking it was a planet as they had no reaction to it so i reasoned it must be much higher than it appeared, \r\n\r\nhowever after several minutes i noticed it was descending lower as i lost sight through the tree branch and i realized it was not a planet, i could not figure out why the planes were not reacting to it they were moving below it on their flight path and i wanted to see a higher flying one go over it as i probably saw over 20 aircraft at different heights but none went over it the whole time. after awhile i noticed it was descending lower and to the right.\r\n\r\nas i wrote it was extremely bright i keep binoculars with me and it was really bright looking through the binoculars. right toward the last maybe 10 minutes i got the verification i needed to see that it was something other than a plane. from the south i saw a little tiny light heading towards the object and eventhough things shake around in the binoculars i saw it move past it really close and i saw it move behind it and reappear, then i saw what i had never seen before this plane actually went around it and came past it again before moving off to the north, the plane looked tiny compared to the object.\r\n\r\nat this time it started to descend more rapidly but still slow and its color changed to orange and it appeared to almost be fading out but it descended out of sight but i could not tell.\r\n\r\nthere must have been other people on the ground who saw this besides me, it was cold out but still it reallly stuck out, all the lower altitude passenger jets absolutely had to see this as evidenced by the one that circled around it, there is the tell, another plane reacted to it.\r\n\r\ni watch for and have seen things in the sky which were much more crazy than this sigjting so i pretty much was just wanting to see if other planes reacted to it, that was a wow moment for me, or it moved off quickly, changed directions, went straight up or disappeared or amything else out of the ordinary.\r\n\r\ni told my wife after it happened as she just came back home, my daughter witnessed the object with me three different times during the sighting the last time she saw it i told her about the circling plane, i guess the cool part was it was over an hour in duration.\r\n\r\nanyway i do not know what it was so its unidentifed, i would really like to know if it showed up on radar and who was thempilot that circled it though. also i took a picture with a cheap disposable camera when i get the film developed if it shows up i will submit it but i hily doubt it will show anything.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with

trees across the street. at first i figured it was an airplane, but as it emerged i was shocked at how bright and close by it was. the object appeared as a very bright aura of green/blueish light. at first it moved slowly at a distance of around 300 yards away. it moved steadily past and at one point ascended 300 feet or so without slowing down or speeding up the whole time. i thought about running inside to grab my phone to record it, but at first i didn't want to miss it so i opted out. as it grew further in the distance after passing, i climbed atop my car for a better view thinking i wouldnt see it again. a slightly jet-like hum was heard coming from the craft, but other than that it was completely silent even when it was within 300 feet of me. after i saw it nearly a mile away i hopped down to continue smoking my cig and discussing it with my girlfriend who had saw the whole thing as well. not more than a minute later we see the object fly almost right above our heads across out street at a high rate of speed back in the direction we originally saw it come from. after quickly leaving our line of sight over the neighbors trees across the street, the object reemerged from some trees down the block flying in almost the same pattern it had originally, only this time faster. i saw it repeat this pattern once more before going back inside, but it is important to note that the light emitted from the object was brighter than any man made light seen. it would burn my vision a bit from looking at it. also to add to the credibility there were several man made aircraft in the sky at the time i could easily differentiate from. i did manage to get some video but the zoom on the phone camera was horrible and you cant see very much","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

was working in my garage when i heard a loud aircraft. this was louder than your typical plane. i opened the door and looked up immediately. right as i did i saw an orb fly directly over me at very fast speeds. right after that what appeared to be jets chasing it. as it flew right over my house, i kept watching them as they flew away over the tree line. they were going really fast. a typical plane takes about 3 minutes to pass by. these guys were going so fast that i only had what seemed like a few seconds to see them.\r\n\r\nthe orb was a white light that didn't appear to be blinking. the jets had your typical lights on them and they were blinking. their lights seemed awfully bright though, maybe it was because they were so low to the ground. \r\n\r\nas the orb and what i will say were jets were almost out of sight, the orb appeared to have an outline of a triangle but it almost appeared to be cloaked. \r\n\r\nif this was a triangle craft, it wouldn't be the first one i have ever seen, back in 2001 i saw another sighting of a very large triangle craft that was hovering over a river. that's why when i first saw the outline of the triangle i was thinking that my mind was just wanting to see a triangle craft again. after reading more reports online that saw similar last night, i think it could have been another one, only smaller than the last. \r\n\r\ni wish i could

almost pinpoint sized, but still quite bright.  these changes in shape were immediate.   while pinpoint sized it moved rapidly (flash like) through an opened slatted window that had a screen.  end of encounter\r\n\r\nthe window curtains were open, and it was still very dark out.   the entire encounter lasted about 30 seconds. what was so odd was the interior of the room did not get any brighter from this light source.  i remember immediately rationalizing the incident to myself, thinking it was some sort of reflection off the slatted window panels and went back to sleep, never getting up to check further.  the next few days i remember trying to find a source of light that could have made this happen, but no such lighting was ever found. \r\n\r\ni remember feeling bewildered but not afraid.  i don't know why i woke up at that particular moment in time, i didn't have to use the restroom and my normal wake up time was much later (about 6 am).  i was definitely not dreaming. weather that night was clear and about 55-65 degrees - typical summer weather for that time and place.\r\n\r\nthe single family residence is located on a cul-de-sac with the rear yard facing a golf course. the slatted window, where the object left the room, faces the rear yard/golf course.  if you are looking out this window from inside, no roads are within sight of the window.  there is a swimming pool in the rear yard that could have reflected light but i could never find a light source. i was at that residence for a few more weeks then moved out of the area.\r\n  \r\nnote: \r\n\r\ni know what reflective light on an interior wall looks like and how it moves when cars or light sources pass by, more 2 dimensional, but this was quite different, not against the interior wall, but between the wall and myself (3 dimensional).  i have never seen anything like that since.  a modern day laser scanner is the closest thing to what i saw that night.\r\nbut even that description is insufficient.\r\n\r\nthroughout my life i have told only a few close friends about what i observed.  the reason i decided to put this in writing is so that you (mufon) have a record. possibly others have had similar experiences to this and may feel some comfort knowing others have seen these sorts of orbs/lights before.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":51814,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.50649577000648,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10242013-0032","longitude":-117.32483606710858,"occurred":335183340000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Sphere,   Star-like,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1382677343000,"summary":"Summer 1980 -
