the street for trash pickup.\r\nwe were throwing broken crayons we found between the couch cushions at the house and hiding behind the couch when the porch light would turn on. (kids)\r\n\r\nanyway, i noticed what i thought was a plane in the sky that was very low, but i was not interested in it because i saw planes all the time in that area. what got my attention was that it was rotating very slowly back and forth. not rolling, like a plane but turning on an axis. the lights seemed to change the shape from triangle to kind of a strait line.\r\ni nudged my buddy and said \"look\" he looked for 2 seconds and said \"its just a plane\" and i said \"no look, its turning on its side\" so he finally looked and we both watched not understanding what it was. so we ran over to our bikes and tried to get closer. the object moved slowly away from us and if we stopped, it would stop. it was just above the treeline and then started to move upward, very slowly. we chased/followed the object all the way from block street, and merriman to the k-mart parking lot which was several blocks away. many people in the parking lot saw the object and the planes that where circling it. you could see the blinking lights of the planes around the object and here the sound of helicopters. this lasted around 15 mins and the object moved out of sight and the planes followed. the next night i waited in my living room, hoping to see the object again. around 8 or 9 pm,it appeared right above the trees from the night before. so i got on my bike and tried to get closer. again the object moved as i moved. i had to go to school the next day so i could not follow for too long. so the third night i waited again, and the object came back, my mother happened to wake up to use the bathroom, so i grabbed her by the arm and drug her out to the porch, and told her to look in the sky, she didn't see it at first so i pointed and she said \"that's a plane\" i told her \"no, look at it.. its turning upside down\" she watched and put her hand over her mouth, and said \"what is that?\" i said \"it comes out every night at this time over the trees, but i can never get close enough to see what it looks like\" she put her hand on my shoulder and said \"we should get inside\" \"why?\" i replied. she said \"because i don't feel safe out here\".\r\ni went to my room and hoped i would see it again, but unfortunately i did not. the event was in the detroit free-press, and the statement was something about an out of orbit satellite. i know for a fact that hundreds of people saw this object. it wasn't until years later i saw an old hbo documentary on ufo's that showed sightings where air-force planes where scrambled during the same period for 3 consecutive occasions in michigan around the same time that summer years earlier and i remembered what had happened. it has been on my mind ever since.\r\ni have tried to find information on this event with no luck. \r\nmaybe someone else has described the same thing around that time.\r\nthanks.","distance":"101-500

observed a football or egg shaped object streak across the sky  and out of sight in a matter of seconds. it was a vivid green and appeared to leave a trail behind, more a streak of light behind the object due to it's incredible speed. i abruptly stopped the car and asked my passengers what if they had seen the object. they were looking the opposite direction and had only a sense of a brief greenish light. i was shaken by what i had seen and the fact that they apparently hadn't seen the object (and quite possibly questioned my sanity) or didn't want to or weren't able to comprehend what they had seen. imagine looking out your driver window, seeing a glowing green football shape appear out of nowhere then streak across the sky and out of sight at an amazing speed. i have had other

may 15, 2013, just before 1:00 p.M.  it's beautiful there with gardens and lakes and the cemetery is heavily treed.  i chose for us to go there so i could take some portrait photographs of my husband with the gardens in the background. i know the date and time because of the \"stamp\" on the photographs i took of my husband just afterward.  \r\n\r\nwe were slowly driving down the main road through the cemetery and entered an area where the trees are sparse when i happened to look up.  for only a few seconds, i saw an object in the sky that appeared to be stationary, nearly directly above us and before i could react, we were back under the canopy of trees.  i yelled for my husband to stop the car but he was on his cell phone and took his time stopping.  i got out and walked back to the spot where i thought i'd seen the object but i never saw it again.\r\n\r\nthe object was very white, matte with no sheen at all, and was cylinder-shaped with a cone-like front or back end on it.  there were two dark \"lines\" encircling the main body that were either painted on or perhaps the object was comprised of three sections and i was seeing where the sections joined each other.  i heard no sound from it and there was no vapor trail or lights.\r\n\r\nthe sky was clear and very blue that spring day and the whiteness of the object really popped against the sky. i saw it vividly.  it appeared to actually be stationary.  i only saw it for a few seconds and though it seemed to not be moving, it may have been moving very slowly.\r\n\r\ni was very stunned when i saw it because it defied logic and made no sense to me.  it was like nothing i'd ever seen.  i was extremely frustrated with my husband because he seemed to have no reaction at all to what i had seen and what i was telling him.  in fact, he continued to talk on his cell phone while i was rushing up and down the roadway trying to find the object again.  although he believed me, he never had much of a reaction other than to tease me about it.  at the time it happened, i immediately got out a piece of paper and drew the object to show him and to keep for myself.  i thought about it a lot for several days or a week and the memory still comes back to me often.  i guess the mind keeps trying to make sense of mysteries like this because they are so extraordinary and unexplainable. by the way, i attach no significance to this siting being over a cemetery.  it just happened to be where i was when i spotted it.","distance":"101-500

usual) and starry.  you can see the light descending at an angle above the 5 street lights.  it vanishes to the right of those lights, then there's a bright flash, followed by 2 more flashes.\r\nthe

the sky at night sometimes because we've always been interested in the whole ufo thing. he saw it and said \"hey mom, look at that.\" i looked up and just assumed it was a passenger plane, even though the two nearest airports are quite a ways away from where we are, we just sort of brushed it off and went inside. even though i had never seen those many lights on an airplane before, we continued inside. it wasn't until sunday when i got onto facebook and saw the posting that i flashed back to what we saw. i then realized that what we saw had absolutely no sound. if my son hadn't have noticed it ( the lights were quite bright ) we never would have seen it. and i realized that it was flying awfully low to be that far away from the nearest airport. if i had to measure the distance from the ground where it was i guess i would say it was about 15 stories high. it had been raining a couple of days prior to that and it was really cloudy. we could see the formation of lights ( that flashed a bit, then stopped ) thru the clouds as it flew along at a moderate speed. we only watched it for about 20 or 30 seconds. it quietly flew/glided directly over my apt complex and i can't believe no one else saw it. there was no wind that night. and i'm in the north part of dallas and the pic was taken in oak cliff, which is in the south-ish. so it flew north to south. according to whomever posted the pic on facebook, it was taken a little before/after approximately 8pm. my son and i got out of our car around 8:10pm headed inside, so i'm guessing it was the same object. since the clouds were blocking our complete view of it we never saw the actual structured craft. only lights in a circular pattern.","distance":"Over One

nights in a row���\r\n\r\ni have seen this almost exact scene 9 evenings over the last two years. three of these sightings were the last three nights in a row. i���m pretty certain i will see it again tomorrow. i have managed to already show three other people, much to their surprise and to my sanity. everyone is completely stunned when it actually happens as i say it will. \r\n\r\nhere is the way it seems to go:\r\n\r\njust after sunset, and before moon rise (it happens to be a waning full moon the last 3 nights) i can look north ��� northwest and 7 to 10 burning orange fireball like lights will appear in the sky as if turning on and reaching maximum brightness. tonight i noticed it seemed to start with one ball that, very rapidly, split into the whole group. from there it seems to change a bit from encounter to encounter. \r\n\r\nsome of the objects will remain completely horizontally stationary and usually begin a sequential pattern of blinking once or twice, from left to right. some of the other objects might line up exactly vertical and also fade in and out sequentially. it���s not really a blink, but more like they start to ���slip,��� as they pulse. while this is happening, the stragglers seem to move around more randomly and either fade out alone or merge together before fading out. this whole first ���act��� may last 10 ��� 15 seconds and then vanish.\r\n\r\nafter 20 seconds to a few minutes, they reappear almost due north and seem to repeat the first act again. i���m guessing there is roughly 10-20 miles in between locations, but i can���t get a good fix on distance and size of the objects. \r\n\r\nfrom there, it becomes more random with the dance, but always switching between the two spots. i haven���t been able to determine a pattern, if any, yet.  it seems to happen 3-4 more times in each location as the large group of separate fireballs.\r\n\r\nafter that, the numbers seem to diminish and the time between appearances grows longer until just one ���ball��� appears every 10 min or so with a very short duration of just a second or so.\r\n\r\nthe show seems to end with a crescendo of just one fireball burning very, very brightly for one second and then the event seems to end as quietly as it all started; just as the moon begins to rise over the hill behind me about 45 minutes from the start. \r\n\r\ni have been able to watch this show for the last 3 nights with such regularity, that i have risked looking totally nuts and invited friends to come witness this strangeness. so far they have not let me down. everyone who has seen this is stunned and cannot believe what they are seeing with their own eyes. it defies any explanation so far. everyone leaves stating, ���wow, people will think i���m nuts if i try to explain this!��� luckily, i am 3 for 3 in the ���not nuts,��� department with those i have dragged out to witness this. i will continue to invite others nightly, until it ceases to happen. i figure that the more people i can show this too, the faster we can come up with a rational explanation of whatever this is. \r\n\r\nyes, i have tried to take pictures, as have my friends, but for the last few nights we all just have our phones and they just don���t do it justice. plus it all is so exciting that as we fumble to his the record button and get it into view, you really don���t want to take your own eyes off of the scene as you struggle to make sense of it all. its quite spectacular and, unfortunately, it all happens pretty rapidly. \r\n\r\ntomorrow morning i am headed to phoenix to buy 2 good quality video cameras and tripods with the hope that i will get at least one more good night of this amazing show to record in a couple different ways.  i���m hoping that night vision might reveal some shape other than just orange orbs / ���fireballs.���\r\n\r\ni live in a very rural area, but i am 60 miles from luke air force base. my sensible head says that this must be some sort of secretive military project being tested in a rather remote location.  that said, it is still directly overhead, and quite blatant to those looking up in a rather populated area. if this testing were shifted 3 miles to the west, it would all happen in a desolate 60 square mile area, separated by mountains and populated with maybe 100 inhabitants.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

victorville on the backside of hwy 18 at about 4:30 in the afternoon, my wife was trying to take pictures of the sun breaking over the ridge with her cell phone and her phone was dying, she had no charger with her so i started to use my phone for her. we got to a point on hwy 18 where the sun was almost just right so we decided to pull over in a turn out to take some pictures. i rolled down my window and started taking photos with my samsung galaxy note 2, at first my phone was zoomed all the way out to really get a close shot of the sun coming over the hill, to be honest it didn't seem to look good on the screen, not the picture, so i backed the zoom all the way out and started taking photos from there. i took enough pictures and we figured we would be ok and that the ones i took would work. we decided to roll up the windows and take off to head home. a foot note, the road was dead, there was no traffic that came by when we were shooting the photos, as i said my window was down, i was not shooting with a flash that i can remember, and even if i was using the flash the pictures i got were moving all over the hillside and down and forward towards us, so a flash explains nothing. i am a skeptic, but seeing is believing. i do believe that there are things out there that we cannot explain and this is going to be one that is on that list. my wife and i had absolutely no idea that these photos were captured when we were there, or believe me i would've stayed and shot video and taken more pictures, you can count on that, we discovered the photos that night laying in bed looking at them, our life is busy, by the time we got home it was dinner time so i we got home and just started taking care of that stuff and then just finished off the night with watching some tv, like i said, we discovered the pictures laying in bed that night before we went to sleep. anyway, i am looking for answers and would like to be referred to someone that can analyze these photos. there are actually 2 of these \"things\", in the first couple of semi blurred photos there are actually a few things going on other than just two dots, there are halos forming above one of them and there are also grey matter that forms in front of these things as well. i am hoping that you can help me or refer me to someone who can. i am going to go back out there in a week when i have some time off of work and take some more photos and hopefully get some more pictures. any help or explanation you can give me would be great. by the way, i have more pictures however your webpage only lets me load up so many. i have more available upon request.\r\n\r\nthank you,\r\n[name removed/cms/tg]","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,
