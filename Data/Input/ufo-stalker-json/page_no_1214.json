10/11/13, and ending 10/12/13 i observed this \"blinking\" light that had multiple colors viewed by me with my naked eye and through binoculars.\r\n\r\non the second night, the light was still there, at the same time - 730pm, so i decided this time to film it on my kodak easyshare m580 digital camera.  i set it up on a tripod, and pointed it in the direction of the light, and then recorded the following 11 minutes of this light.\r\n\r\none thing i find surprising and amazing, is it is the same set-up of lights that i had photographed and sent to you in a previous report (case #51739 - two photos attached - original pic with circled \"triangle\" and magnified pic of circled area), except those were captured seven days earlier (10-05-13) and during the day, and in a different place in the sky.\r\n\r\nthe most amazing portion of these footage is at the very beginning.  it looks as though after the three main triangle lights are visible, on the left-side of the screen, you will see another white light that suddenly appears and then begins to zip and move at a very high speed across the screen.  what it looks like to me. is that at times, it passes over the top of the \"mother ship\" (not visible for a second) and then reappears on the other side of the \"triangle\" - all within a brief second.\r\n\r\nit is quite amazing.\r\n\r\nimo - there is something happening over albuquerque, which seems to be happening right now, has been happening for the past 30 days (it seems) and it is something not of the ordinary.    \r\n\r\nis this tr3b?  i doubt it.  it seems to be something else.\r\n\r\nwhat is your take on it.\r\n\r\nplease remember.....This my material,so please consider it copyrighted and protected, but you are free to analyze and converse with me on it.  i am at your disposal.\r\n\r\nthanks!","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

miles. i go in and tell my girlfriend that, \"it's back!\". she comes running out and watches the stunt show for a while the runs back in for a camera. while she's inside this ship make a direct beeline for me from the west la area and stops almost directly over my head at roughly 70 degrees off the horizon. i estimate that its direct distance (vertically and horizontally) from me was 1/2 mile or less. so close that i was waiving my arms and yelling at it like an idiot. i saw no structure, as the light was just too bright and unwavering. it sat over my head then retreated in the exact

since there was a storm coming and there were nice looking shape and color combinations. the clouds were moving quickly so i decided to take a few pictures out the window while i was driving. i took several pictures since i was hoping to get at least one good cloud shot in the series.\r\ni took the photos at 4:21pm and didn't look at them until about 10pm, at that time i saved the ones that weren't blurry or tilted and zoomed in on the clouds and farm house, when i did this i noticed an odd shape in several photos.\r\nthe object is cylinder shaped and appears to be made of \"c\" shaped sections stacked together. there is clearly a vapor trail below it coming from the top of one of the clouds. the image quality is good and you can zoom in to see the details and some odd surface features.\r\ni took a total of 3 photos in 11 seconds, 2 show the object and vapor trail, the third shows the same plus a very bright white spot directly below shaped and sized like the object above, there are vapor trails above and below this bright white light patch.\r\ni did not notice the object at the time since i was watching the road and was aiming at a big target (the clouds) and not a focal point. i noticed them 6 hours later when i checked the pictures so the movement or appearance are unknown to me.\r\nthis is my second report in 2 months under similar circumstances, both involved unusual storm clouds and both involved cylinder shaped objects.\r\nmy only feelings are curiosity and confusion since i don't know what it is and would like to find out. i do find it unusual

doors two very large, dark blimp like objects side by side.  they were facing nose down like torpedos.I could not not help but notice them, they were totally \"in your face.\" i could only think they were ufos. i called to my roommate to come see and she witnessed it too. we stood on the deck and watched. they were side by side, huge, dark, dull black, no windows or light or emissions, no sound whatsoever. i asked her to get her iphone to take pictures and she ran upstairs to get it.  i saw the craft on the left start to slowly and gracefully move under the other one and start to move north.  i yelled, \"hurry, hurry! they are going to align vertically now!\" i don't know why i knew this, perhaps because i took it as such a display, i did not feel threatened and neither did she. she came downstairs with her iphone but couldn't get the craft against the sunset sky. by now the moving craft is ascending upwards on the south side of the stationary one. she went to get her ipad to try to take a picture again, but it didn't work either, just too dark, sky getting darker now and the first bright star appeared. now they are aligned vertically one on top of the other.  there they stayed for a few minutes, and then the craft on top slowly  left heading southwest.  it went up very high into the dark sky.  the other one stayed a few minutes longer and then it too left following the same path as the other one. all this while the objects remained torpedo like.  in other words they were blimp shaped, but they were vertically positioned.  the objects did not make any right angles or abrupt movements, it was very graceful. i was thrilled and baffled to witness this display.

and did not approach as many of the other aircraft does, because we are directly below the flight path for ottawa international airport, meaning we see many aircraft come and go all the time. once it got dark we can see lots of aircraft (all well below this shape) pass right by it, to no alarm. this intrigued us no end, because how could they not see this item and not report it. so we are

observation balloon for the airport. however, it is now october 23 2013 and we can attest that we have seen this item in the sky (weather permitting) every single night since we moved in and right
