while, i could see 3 white lights with an orange/red light in the center. the orange/red was sort of flame looking, sort of like a rocket look but also like a beam and there was no sound. i ran inside to get my camera and telephone to call others to see if they saw it. by the time i came outside again, it looked like it was up high over harrisburg city, pa. at least, five other people were called and went outside their homes from various areas and saw the object. the object slowly descended into the south west horizon at which time i lost sight of it. we do live near an army reserve base, indiantown gap and i believe it came from that direction. i think i saw planes around it and just heard a jet go over right now at 8:10 p.M. which is odd because they never fly this late. very glad others saw it also, otherwise i would second guess myself.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

thought it might be a plane, but it wasn't shaped right. it was a faint disc, light orange in color. much smaller than the moon, but much bigger than a star or a planet. didn't move much, but after a few minutes, it drifted south, then southwest, and finally went out of sight on the horizon due west of me. i could only see it for four or five minutes. my guess is it was a balloon due to the drifting nature of its movements. and it's probably a low altitude object but gave off no motor sounds. it could have been emitting a faint light or more likely reflecting some other light source. however, it glowed, glimmered, shimmered, and appeared to smolder. it could also have been a searchlight, but i did not see the shaft of light usually visible leading from ground up to the disc of light characteristic of a searchlight. and the disc had that smoldering quality. i came to notice this because i had been outside a few minutes earlier and saw the bright lights of an apparent big jet plane far away on the horizon. so when i stepped out later a glanced up quickly to see if the plane was passing nearby. there was no plane, but i did see the strange disc of light at the zenith. my first impression was that a plane was on fire, but quickly realized it was not a plane and there was no fire, just that glimmering, smoldering look. after possibly vacillating a little directly overhead, the disk moved south fairly rapidly then circled around to the west and went out of sight over the horizon due west of me. the light was coming through some thin clouds when i first saw it, but retained its general appearance when it moved whether above clouds or in clear sky.

since a young age. i know most aircraft as seen from a distance day or night. two of us were sitting in the back yard facing n. towards toronto int. airport. i stood up to stretch and notices a bright yellow light high and to my left which at first i thought was an engine fire on a jet at about 15,000 ft. it was descending towards us and as it got lower it seemed ball like and the yellow flickered to orange. the solid orange colour then flickered deep red and then solid red. it then turned left about 30 degrees and levelled off at about 3000 ft. passing in front of us left to right. as it passed to our right it turned left again 30 degrees and started to climb faster. as it rose in the sky the red flickered to orange, then solid orange which flickered to the original yellow colour. as it gained speed it turned to white like the look of jupiter and then clearly sped off at a speed which i could not even believe. this first orb took about 1 min. when it left the two of us started to talk in somewhat a shocked fashion.\r\n     10 sec. after this sighting in came the second one fallowing the exact same path with one change. the last turn before climbing out was about 2 miles sooner than the first. this one turning to climb somewhat in line with the airport.\r\n     the third orb started 10 sec. after the second, followed the exact same sequence of the first 2 and again the final turn to climb was 2 miles before the second orb.\r\n     all of the craft made no noise, descended, made 2 turns and climbed in the same manner. they were identical in their colour appearance changing from yellow to orange to red, flew level and reversed colour change as they climbed. the size was of a golf ball at arms length. the flight path was intelligent, highly accurate, and repeated 3 times. i had a clear sense that there was a craft and it was shrouded by this vapour which was a reaction to our atmosphere thus the colour change as it moved through the thicker or thinner air. \r\n     the odd part about this time was as i stood up at the beginning of this event i was about to say i had not seen or heard a departing jet for 10 min. that is unusual for the area we can see is the normal departure end of the active runway at a very busy airport with 2 min. spacing for departures.","distance":"Over One

nevada foothills near a small lake and below my home less than a mile away is the spillway and the river that flows away from my location at left angle to the south. i have been observing strange lights here for yrs. ever since my parents moved us in 1967 from the bay area. my parents have passed away, being their only child i inherited and live here alone. drove home from visiting a friend around 9:00 pm last night who lives about 30 mi away towards sacramento area. i parked in my driveway and was getting some things from my car when a flash of light caught my attention. i looked around and saw many moving lights. i took my purse n belongings in the house grabbed my binoculars and went out my front door. as little as five yrs ago i would only observe occassional lights coming and going almost always east to west, seldom west to east. appearing to be traveling to where the lake/river\r\n join. when the moon is waxing or waning the stars are so bright and plentiful that it's much harder to see the \"lights\" usually they are higher up and seem to try to blend in with the stars. on several occasions though one would move across the sky very dimly lit then suddenly  get brighter and larger and shoot off very fast  disappearing from sight. in the past saw orbs low over the trees that changed colors, gold to red to violet etc. not flashing but morphing colors , perfectly spherical only about 50 ft over my  head just above the trees that surround my home. last night however there seemed to be more and varied types of \"lights\" and dark gray orbs not projecting their own light, but reflecting the moonlight. very low above my head. i was frightened by the number of them and (for the first time) i sensed that they were unconcerned that they could be easily observed. the worst part is that for the first time, because they were moving so slow n low that i felt some were stopping over me and were aware of me. standing in the dark shivering with binocs around my neck (binoculars that are not night vision) and unfortunately i don't have a digital camera except for my droid's. it doesn't have zoom so it wouldn't pick up anything but the moon. i wasn't about to use light to attract undue attention  to myself. using the binocs though i could see the dark orbs over my head just above the trees right in front of me. then looking to my right (east) three lights stacked vertically were moving towards me. they appeared to be separate by their movement and not joined as in three lights on one \"craft\". weird they were like in formation three vertically instead of horizontally.  flying up from behind a tree was what appeared to be almost like ascouting light that rapidly changed colors and direction preceeding the three stacked lights more of the zippy  multi colored lights started to appear from various directions. i got the feeling they were with the three stacked lights, these things were going to pass right over my head. i was standing on my front porch facing the small county rd that runs just feet in front of my house. i went inside and saw that i'd been observing all this for about an hour and a half. the last thing i'll add is that i'm in the flight path of an airforce base that ia quite a few miles from my house. the jets pass over more at night than daytime. however last night in the time that i was outside observing all these things above me, the number of jets flying seemed to increase.So wish i had a video camera last night. i'm gonna buy one now.","distance":"21-100

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was standing on the deck at my parents house, around 8:15 oct, 22, 2013, and noticed this strange light flying through the sky.  it was rather large for a plane light, made no sound, and was not blinking, nor were there any other blinking lights around it, trying to in my mind, make out to be an aircraft of some sorts, but this was a solid light, unlike regular plane lights.  \r\n\r\ni was looking north, literally at a view of mt. saint helens, and it lasted for only a few seconds.  it flew by slowly, then expecting it to simply go behind the tree line, instead, it dimmed and almost seemed to change direction, size, and shape at the same time, direction along the same path, but smaller, was an abrupt angle i felt directly away from me.  it went smaller rather abruptly, and instead of a symmetrical getting smaller, it just disappeared, like it just jumped to severely high velocity.\r\n\r\nthe object was a brilliant white light, when it dimmed, it seemed to be red or green, i'm partially color blind, but clearly it was a color, and it went to almost a disc type of shape, happened too quickly to make out the shape exactly in it's dimmed state.\r\n\r\nwhen it disappeared, immediately first thought came to mind, \"interesting\", then a feeling of uneasiness, and even anger later that night, could not get much sleep and part of it is this alien thing that just decided it's going to fly into the area with impunity.  i so wish we had something that could just snatch these things out of the sky, or at the very least, they would find a way to put people at ease, regardless of their origin, to identify themselves so it doesn't feel like this outsider/stranger is just going to drop in and to nowhere unaccounted.\r\n\r\ni continued to scan the sky for about 15-20 minutes, and within 15, a strange helicopter/jet thing flew overhead, it was night so couldn't make out what it was in full, by i could hear prop and jet noise coming from it, but it had this dampening type of thing going on, which reduced the sound significantly, and made it sound just odd.  i could tell the latter, this thing was man made, the former, that glowing thing, not of this earth.  i continued to scan and about 5 minutes later, a jet flew overhead, different trajectory, was run of the mill, but i needed to make sure my eyes were not playing tricks on me, and i needed that immediate visual of normal plane lights compared to this thing.\r\n\r\ni have a background in aerodynamics, i know a plane when i see one, and i know if something is even strange like that heli, being man made and all sorts of exotic designs have been prevy to, no aircraft of any kind can move like that thing, and all require safety lights, the lack of those safety lights was what caught my attention and had my study it in the sky.\r\n\r\ni did post the sighting to facebook, right afterwards, while it was fresh in my mind, and it was awkward to do, something that is not supposed to be there, plays tricks on ones mind, and to share it, i can see why people are reluctant to do so, there is a whole dynamic going on and why people keep these to themselves.\r\n\r\nthere have been rumor's along black heli's in the area, and even specific mountains that have plenty of activity towards that aspect, visit yacolt wa., some time ufo people, you may spot something yourself, this area is known for being a hot spot in that regards.\r\n","distance":"101-500

21, 2013.  at 7pm i carried some boxes out to the truck where my husband was loading them in the back.  when i walked up he said a ufo had been hovering over the mountain for about 20 minutes and although it hadn���t changed position he said the size was changing and sometimes it changed color from white to orange.  we only lived 3 miles from the mountain and had a clear view so i looked over to our east and there was a bright light over the mountain.  since it was still light out there were no stars or planets showing so this bright light was the only thing in the sky and it was just hovering there.  it was round and larger than any star or planet if they had been visible at that time.  so we stood there watching it for about ten minutes and then it started to get bigger until it was twice as big as when i first saw it. the color also changed from bright white to orange and back to bright white again.  then it started to get smaller and within a minute or so just disappeared.  my husband said he felt like it was watching him but i think anyone would have felt that way because it looked like a big eye in the sky.  there were no spotlights, planes, helicopters, balloons, sounds or clouds at the time so it was definitely a ufo. i have seen other ufo's in the area in the two years i lived there so i wasn't alarmed by it, just excited.  unfortunately, it didn't occur to me to get the camera and take a picture of it.

subtle sound outside. at first i thought it was a train, but then i realized that a train would not be here at 1:30 in the morning. it was a very powerful, rumbling, low, deep tone that i heard. i became interested and wanted to check outside to see what was really making the noise. the area is very foggy with low cloud cover, and has been like this for a few days. i instantly noticed the ufo over the water, right above titlow park. it was about level with the horizon, maybe 100-300ft above the ground. i was very amazed to see it because the three lights in the shape of a triangle were very bright. they were white lights, and i was surprised that they were so easily visible. \r\n\r\ni stared out my window, shocked and excited and scared. this ufo moved from left to right very slowly over a period of ten minutes. from west to north west overall. at first it moved some, then paused for a minute, then it continued it's path. at certain times it would fade into the background because of the fog, but i could still see it, and wanted to see it for as long as it was visible. the triangle shape was not flat, but rather perpendicular to the ground, so that i could see all three lights clearly in a perfect triangle shape. this scared me because it made it seem as if the ufo was watching me during its whole flight path. there were no planes, helicopters or anything nearby. it was very early in the morning after all. \r\n\r\nthe ufo eventually moved toward north west and reached a certain point where i could no longer see it from my window, so i let the whole thing go and no longer pursued it. i could still faintly hear the humming, pulsating noise even after it was out of my view. since i was somewhat close to it, i'm sure other people could hear the noise even better if they were a few hundred feet closer. the ufo really wasn't that far away from me. \r\n\r\ni feel so surprised and scared to see this ufo, for i have heard the sound that it makes many times before. i use to think that it was just a train going by, since the train tracks are about one mile from where i am. it scares me to know that it was something much more than a train, and that it was really a ufo making these noises. there was a time, about a week ago when i woke up around 3am and heard those same noises, but much louder as if they were right outside my window.  the sound from the ufo is really one-of-a-kind and i have not heard anything else quiet like it.

parked. i drank my coffee and listened to the radio while he took a nap in the back seat for a hour. after 20 minutes i was looking towards the scenic overlook into the night lights of boston about four miles away. between boston and i was the town of milton and quincy below the overlook. i noticed in the area that was defined by trees on each side 200 feet apart a strange shape which seemed see through with blinking colors coming from the right side a cone shaped object appearing at 300 to 500 feet off the ground which put it straight in from to my eyes 300 feet away. the edge of the object had a sharp edge line between the sky and what appeared to be an containing within it entire surface was as if you were looking through water with thousands of small various color twinkling lights. it had the effect of blending it in with the background of the city and house lights as well as the stars in the sky. the only reason i noticed it at first and as it went by was the sharp difference between the objects surface and the actual background. it continued westward at a rate of 5 mph. i tried my speed gun on it but got no responce. it was approx. 500 feet long or more with a height of 100 feet or more at its widest point. it resembled a blimp without the engine or control tower. it contiued past me in about four to five minutes and out of sight westward. i sat there and was stunned. about five minutes later it came from the left side (west to east) at the same hight and speed. i woke up my partner this time and he refused to admit he was seeing it then became angry about now saying he sees it but don't tell anyone about it. i tried then to bounce my spot light off it with no responce back from it or any reflection or illuminating any area. then tried my blue and red lights on and off to see if it would react but nothing. it continued out over quincy and out to sea. i called logan airport boston after a chuckle they said they had noting on radar. my partner transfered out of this district to the other side 30 miles away the next day and would never ever speak of the incident again.
