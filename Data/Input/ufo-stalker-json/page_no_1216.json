to prescott az to meet some kids at 8:00 am 10.19.13.  we got off from i- 40 and went south on hwy 89.  halfway to prescott in some hilly area and covered with small trees.  i had noticed a white disc object on the n. side of granite mt in the distance.  it looked like some smoke  that was coming out of the mountain. granite mt still looked the same with rocks, it was light tan.  i also noticed that there was some flat areas in the valley, but to me it could have been gray smoke. i kept staring at the haze and mts in the distance as we went around turns and up and down hills.  i then remembered that there are no mesa tops in prescott and told terrie to look at what i am seeing.  she confirmed that they are flat mesa's with protruding tops.  we saw two big ones and one small one very clear and square in the distance.  it also looked like some pointed poles below the tops, which were very pointed at each end.  they were all one med gray color and very large. there was no shadows or land layers to see. as we drive about 67 mph, we see the left side of the middle mesa start to distort and change. the white disc is now vanished some how and the left areas are distorting and some things can be seen moving.  we lost view from trees and rock hill.  when we came out, we saw granite mt some other hills and mts in the valley.  they had different shades of color and looked normal in the distance. they looked much smaller now with depth.  there is no white disc, no mesa's and no pointed poles any where to be seen.","distance":"Over One

was descending from the gonzales pass along us 60, which overlooks the eastern portion of the phoenix-metro area when i saw what appeared to be a cluster of christmas lights moving in the sky approximately over the superstition mountains.  it was a very clear night and the moon is a few days past full.  the sky was bright yet this object clearly stood out about 30-35 degrees above the horizon.  i was driving roughly west into the phoenix area and the object was approximately 30 degrees to the right of the highway.  the cluster would surge upward in an arching path and blink in various colors.  at times the lights on the top and bottom of the object changed from a roughly spherical outline to two straight lines while the lights on the sides and the rest of the surface were distributed roughly spherically, yet in a random pattern.  the lights 'twinkled' and while i could not see a clear shape, the object did not appear to be completely solid.  i pulled to the side of the highway and observed the object move from west to east in the northern sky, taking a zig-zag and ascending/descending path.  at a couple of points, the object would stop.  the object also interacted with smaller lights on 4 or 5 separate occasions by emitting what looked like a line of white light connecting to the smaller objects.  these smaller objects appeared single points of white light.  \r\napproximately 2 or 3 years ago i witnessed my first ufo approximately 70 miles east of this location while driving to the same town i was returning from during this current sighting.  i was very excited to witness a second event and was surprised at how radically different this object appeared to be in form, behavior and density.  i was frustrated that i did not have a camera available yet completely excited about seeing what i was seeing.\r\n\r\ni am familiar with the various aircraft in the area and live near sky harbor airport so i see air traffic each and every night in the area.

shaped objects of different size and mass in the night sky. many evenings, i use dr. greer's meditation techniques to signal the various craft flying by or hovering. i also have cultivated more equipment with better optical capabilities. i haven't been able to buy a n.V. monucular to record any or all events. but i'm working on it.\r\n i was present at the 1st conference in joshua tree, california this august.\r\nif you recall ; it was aptly named \" contact in the desert \". so, that put a kink in my ability to buy more equipment. as to record events & experiences.\r\n this entire weekend all sorts of craft have been in the sky ! of all shapes & sizes. i've been signaling one specific shape & its been acknowledging my presence by flashing a white beam back at me, from the darkest part of the night sky. one (1) flash is for yes & two (2) flash for \" do you understand me \" ! usually my contact is a large cigar shaped craft with a conning tower fore or aft of the craft. a conning tower that one would see on a us \" aircraft carrier \", these etv's are usually unloading many smaller sphere's; that then fly off into different directions.\r\n this evening, i walked out on the porch to have a smoke. immediately , around 15 miles northeast, at a 90 degree angle from where i happened to be standing: i saw a pulsating light. the light, with my naked eye was giving off a translucent green, menthol-spearmint hue; with a white and red pulsating light in between. i went to my car & got my gear. this craft was closer then normal. they usually keep they're distance. i assume because of all the airplane traffic.  i guess, where i live is a regular flight-path for both civilian and military aircraft. in the early evening. from 9:00pm to 4:00am , maybe one plane fly's by each hour. since last october, the amout of etv's seen by me has gone from a few hundred to thousands on any given evening ; when the sky is clear or just after a rain storm. something is going on. i can feel it. i think our precious earth is headed for a catastrophe of biblical proportions.\r\n getting back to the sighting. tonight, is the 1st time i witness an ebe  in my presence, if only briefly. because the creature ran in front of me, and disappeared into the bushes 25 ft in front and exiting to the right onto someone els's property & vanished. all i heard was the ruffling through the fallen leaves & branches. this all took place as i was peering through my night vision goggles ; night optic's generation 3 ; auto gated. i was also utilizing a n.O.'s ir-k2 infared pointer to draw r\r\nthe craft's attention. then mark it with my green 850nm laser.  i also had an ultraviolet flashlight propped up , so its beam went into the nights sky. the other 100 & counting extraterrestrial vehicles started to congregate near the uv beam, in the night sky. so me juggling the equipment and viewing the vehicle that was signaling me. this tiny whiteish to opaque being ran by me in a flash.

fireball.  no strobe.  stationary.  the light it emitted had to have been several hundred yards across.  i tracked it hovering for about 15 seconds while driving, had time to pull over, check it out for a little...Then turn the car off...Look some more...Get out of the car and then think about getting the iphone for a video.  i scrambled in the car for the phone.  it got much smaller in size and then began to move northeast.  i've been searching the skys for decades and reading about pilot, astronaut and civilian sightings for just as long, so i was not surprised when i saw this huge \"exhaust\" like burst or orange..But i was amazed.  it was friggin huge and not moving for way longer than any firework.  had no strobe, and ended up moving forward/north and obtaining high altitude before flicking out.  this was the real deal.  i hope someone else saw it..It was early on a saturday night.\r\n","distance":"Over One

imediately i asked them to look up. this boomerang shaped ufo, appeared to be translucent, with sort of a white aura around it and few lights under it. one of the present was a microsoft flight
