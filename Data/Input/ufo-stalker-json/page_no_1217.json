father n law i want to try and video tape it. i went in the house got my video camera i then tried to find a video tape i could use. all that took about 4 to 5 minutes i came back outside and began to record. i first noticed the object moving slowly south west of me then it would come back north west it did that for about 10 minutes. some times it would stop in one spot. as you hear me say in the video it was fading in and out i thought it was going behind clouds but it was a clear afternoon the object was fading in and out and tilting side to side. there were several trees on both side of where i was recording so im sure they can be used as some type of reference. not until i viewed the tape later did i notice there was a second object it was silver and gave off a bright reflection but the sun was setting behind it the sliver object was at 1oclock of the object i was recording.  i lost sight as my video camera didn't have a very good zoom on it. i really didn't have any feelings i just wondered what i was seeing. i was there with my mother n law and my father n law he is a minister. i have had this for many years i have only shown it to 3 or 4 people but i have many questions and i am reaching out to you  hoping with the technology you have you can maybe give me insight to what i was recording that day.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

like it was moving in a northerly direction.  as traffic started moving, i tried to keep watch.  the lights stayed for a few moments and then disappeared.  as i continued up the hill on 67n, i saw one of the lights had come back.  i then traveled too far to see anymore.  when i arrived at work in poway, i kept watch from a second story window, but the sun had risen and it was too bright.  i didn't

two red lights and slowed down and drove through the neighborhood keeping an eye on them. i'd never seen lights in that portion of the sky and was a bit surprised and even lowered my window to take a better look and paused the car then continued to my house hoping for a better view. i thought they were unusually bright, even brighter than stars and for a moment i thought someone had put up a tower during the day while i was up at work. i thought it was super strange but as i drove through the neighborhood i noticed they were changing positions. when i got home which was less than a block i got out of my car and looked up and noticed they no longer were one above the other. they now were completely parallel to each other and were barely moving. there was no sound but they were still super bright and really big. there was no flickering and changing of colors which is what i've seen in airplanes and helicopters and no noise. this was a strong stationary red color that moved slowly and barely noticeably. after watching for between a minute to a minute and a half i noticed they were suddenly fading out like a flashlight with batteries dying and then they were gone. i felt as if they'd gone away from me. within a minute i noticed a jet crossing the sky at a really high altitude with blinking lights. we have the sarasota airport locally so it probably was a passenger jet. ironically, this helped me figure out the size as being probably two to three times bigger because the lights from the jet were tiny in comparison and blinking and much closer. the lights seemed to be right over the area that would be myakka park. i don't know what it was that i saw but i know this is nothing normal. i've lived here for at least 10 years and this was nothing like anything i've seen and i've seen all types of helicopters and planes cross over us.

scanned around.  bright lights immediately caught my eye.  two very bright lights in line with each other, with just a little space between them.  they were somewhat low in the sky & close to the mountain ridge, about the height of an airplane flying quite low but moving very fast.  i would say the lights were bigger than an airplane's would be & there weren't any accompanying red or green lights visible.  i did not see any outline of the object itself, but feel as though the lights may've been more rectangular in shape rather than as star's appearance & my guess of the craft's shape would have to be saucer or disk-like. there was no sound as a helicopter or airplane would have, and it darted over the mountain southward very fast. i felt startled, excited, and a little silly.  also wondered if others had seen it.
