the tree line and see it was a helicopter with a searchlight but maybe 5 seconds after losing sight of the object i came out of the tree line to find the object had vanished.  i don't believe it could have just flown out of view or into clouds at normal speed because it was so bright i was initially seeing it through dark rain clouds.  i'm still not sure what it was, if my mind was playing tricks

1/4 of a mile away at the post office in fort ogden florida. before we went over there we saw a number of large white orbs flying from cloud to cloud, it was a full moon so they were easy to see at around 8pm. so i told my wife to go grab the camera and see if she could get any of them on film. while at the post office getting ready to get in our srx we everything lit up brighter then the moon light and we looked over and this craft was not 500 yards from us, not far above the tree tops moving very slow, it was bigger then a 747 easily and we heard no sound, it moved along a southern path across 17 highway right in front of us. then it turned like it steered like a car and went parallel to the highway and started to turn back  like it was going to head back over the highway then just vanished, not sure if it accelerated so fast we couldn't see it or literally vanished. we heard no sound from it and we headed home hoping that my wife was videoing and saw the craft. when we got home she was outside and said you won't believe what flew over the house and i said we were right next to it and tell me you got it on video and she said yes so here it is. she said she heard sound from it like a electrical whirl or buzzing sound but very low decibels. my daughter and i heard nothing . the video is unedited and uncut. my daughter and i both agreed that it was triangle shaped with some things  like arms coming off of it. when we saw it it had a ton of solid lit lights and some flashing strobes on the sides and some kind of spinning thing on it. we are sure there will be alot of reports because there was definitely more witnesses then just us 3. government secret craft or something else? you decide or if you know tell us because we are baffled by it.\r\n\r\nextra note my wife heard a sound but she may have heard our aerators in the pond which makes a humming sound, it came right next to my daughter and i at the post office and it made no sound at all. we have lots of

extraordinary!\r\n\r\nit was just after 8pm and i was headed to york, pa on my motorcycle to surprise a old friend, in from california. it was pretty cloudy and i was taking a chance riding because odds were, it'd rain before i could get home. in any event, as soon as i pulled out of my driveway (just north of gettysburg), i saw it.\r\n\r\nor, i should say - them! \r\n\r\nthere were three very bright lights in the shape of a long, acute triangle - low in the sky, directly off to my right (after i turned left, onto the road). they were impossible to miss they were so bright! there wasn't another light in the sky and it looked as though they were moving! \r\n\r\ni kept glancing at them as i rode along and it was quite obvious they were individual lights, not part of some larger object or craft. it wasn't until i reached the 4-way intersection about 3/10's mile from my home, though, that i could tell they were indeed moving. they were headed almost due south, very slowly - maybe as slow as 5 or 10mph - with the light farthest from the two closer to each-other, in the lead; like a giant arrowhead moving across the sky! \r\n\r\ni was looking at them from the side, facing east, as they neared the roadway. i turned right at the intersection, heading right toward them and it wasn't long until i was nearly below them. \r\n\r\ni let off the throttle and was moving pretty slowly myself (maybe 15 mph,), listening as best i could over the rumble of my harley's exhaust. earlier this year, i'd seen other, similar lights, but none traveling in \"formation\". they were always solo and of pretty short duration. i was definitely excited and a bit nervous, but not afraid. i was not nearly this close for the other sightings and really wanted to see as much as possible; not knowing what would happen - but eager to find out! i called upon my infantry training to calm myself and take in as much detail as i could. like the others i've seen, these too had an orangish, amber-like hue, but these were closer and very bright; seeming almost to sparkle. it was much as though i was looking at them through running water, or something. they kind of rippled, i guess you could say. the had a slow pulsating effect as well which was steady and consistent - all three pulsing in unison, about every second or so. it was obvious at so close a distance, but i hadn't noticed it when i saw them from afar. i can't say they really \"glowed\", but it was very humid and they were very, very bright, so there was sort of a halo around them (for lack of a better word).\r\n\r\ni was getting close but not yet underneath them when they seemed to slow. then, without warning, the first one \"shrunk\" and took off - straight up and through the low-hanging clouds - followed by the second one, immediately thereafter. i'd lost the first one as soon as it hit the clouds, but i could see the second one continue up, high into the atmosphere through a hole in the clouds, accelerating and growing dimmer and dimmer as it went. i was finally directly under where the first one had been when the third one too became only a small, dim light as well. i assume it shot up through the clouds too, but at that point i had to really pay attention to my riding because i'd already been looking up for far too long and was afraid i'd run off the road!\r\n\r\ni should add that when they began their vertical assent, they didn't exactly \"shoot\" up. they just \"went\" straight up - not all that fast (at first). they did enter the clouds pretty quickly, though, so they must've already been a few hundred feet in altitude. if i had to guess, i'd say they were around 300-500 feet high, or so, and (at their \"largest\") i'd guess they were about six to ten feet in diameter, perhaps. when they \"became small\", they were maybe the size of a basketball. i admit that i'm really only guessing, though. i have no idea what the cloud level was - but, they were very low and dark - with small, open patches through which i could see the darkening sky above. as i said, it appeared the second one continued to accelerate, after it cleared the thick clouds and flew high into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nnow, i didn't know what to think about all this, of course. i was hardly expecting to see something so dramatic (just leaving mu house!) and i was debating whether i should turn around and zoom back to my house to tell my wife (and hide?), or, if i should continue on my way. i decided to keep going until i reached a little gas-station/diner by rt 15 (hunterstown exit) where i pulled over to call my wife. i no sooner pulled in and turned to face home when another light appeared - or, more accurately, it was there when i turned around and looked. anyway, i kept watching it as i fumbled with my gloves, goggles and leather \"snoopy cap\" and, finally, managed to get my phone out from under my leather riding jacket. \r\n\r\nthe light was moving south, just as the others had and i'd only just gotten my wife on the phone when it suddenly disappeared.\r\n\r\ni was about 4 miles from where i'd seen the other lights, so i can't say what it actually did. it was simply too far to tell for sure - but, like the others, it was too bright to miss and it too was the only light of any kind in the sky. i was trying to bring my wife up to speed - lamenting that she'd missed such an amazing sighting - when another light suddenly appeared! it came out of nowhere - exactly where i'd first seen the one a moment before and almost certainly where i'd seen the others - and, it was also heading due south.\r\n\r\ni was encouraging my wife to throw on some clothes (she was in bed!) and get out to see this one, at least, when it too disappeared - at the same spot the last one had!\r\n\r\ni was already running pretty late, so i asked my wife to stay out for awhile and see if she spotted anything else, but i had to get on my way. we don't know if any more appeared as she went up/out for only a few minutes before heading back inside. it was getting a little chilly and she's deathly afraid of the dark (and absolutely hates being out at night w/o me there - even with our large dogs!). i wish she had stayed out for awhile, but she didn't. i did what i could; constantly scanning the skies on my way to york, but saw nothing else.\r\n\r\ni'd like to add that i've seen more unexplainable lights and objects in the sky in these past six months than in my entire life put together - and i'm an outdoors kinda' guy and have always enjoyed looking at the night sky! this sighting was the most amazing i can remember, by far! i don't know what (if anything) all this recent activity means, but i'm going to be out there looking, every chance i get! you can count on it!\r\n\r\ngoodness knows, it sure beats watching the news!  :-(\r\n\r\n*i'm including two pictures i made which are pretty accurate representations of the three lights i saw. i did them in photoshop, using landscapes and storm-clouds i snagged online (or, created myself) and assembled them into composite-illustrations - adding the ufos/lights as best as i could. they are not pictures of the location(s) where i saw the lights. i was just too lazy to go out and snap pictures. i'd have still needed to insert the skies and all anyway, so i didn't bother. the size of the lights (as they appear) is very close to accurate, however, and the pics look pretty close to the actual area where this occurred. the lights were definitely big, but i did have a hard time with the brightness and color (i'm read-green color deficient) and how do you make something in a picture bright and pulsating? still, the pics are pretty close to what i saw and should give the viewer a good idea of what they actually looked like. \r\n\r\nthank you. \r\n\r\n**oh! i did get caught in a torrential downpour on my way home and arrived soaked to the bone and frozen! it was worth it, though! i had a great time!

short distance to relive myself, will standing facing the west i saw a large brilliant light , standing there in the buff trying to put a shape to this object or running lights i was unable to do ether. above me i could see a airliner in flight with strobes and hazard lights. i was comparing the two , one i new the other i did not. quite , slow , with a brilliant white light that came from every where, i was unable to give any structure just that the light was a sphere. a few days later i awoke felling good but a little tired from the before daylight hitting the trails till way after dark, my routine was to brush my teeth wash my face , arms in general a wash cloth bath.Wile washing my face i had very large deep red welt or bit mark on my left temple about the size of a quarter or slightly bigger. there was no pain no eratation if i had not seen it i would not have known about it. the men i hunted with said nothing about it and nether did i. this was to happen again in the next few years will hunting in the same area. for some reason i came to fear this object, just out side of camp is a small ridge, i became afraid of what was on the other side, i did not like the back side. the thing or what ever it was on my temple would have a large snow white scab that took from 4 to 5 weeks to disappear , i never picked at it or dug at it i left it alone. i have seen this light

and i was used to seeing them and hearing them. this was so fast faster than anything i had seen in person or in the news reels at the movies.It appeared in my right line of sight,and flew perpendicularly straight above the earth it dissapeared to my left. it is the singular clearest memory of my childhood. i went right away to tell my mom, i might as well have told her i saw santa flying by. but two days later, she told me she had heard on the radio that a day meteor had been seen in several states that day. i thought she was lying to me, because i knew what meteors looked like, and that was not what i had seen.So many people laughed at me, that i stopped talking about it and never talked about it after that. the craft looked solid and reflective, it appeared to have sparkler like sparks falling out of the rear. i have allways known it was a ufo even though that title was not coined untill much later. soon the phrase, \"flying saucer\", hit our vocabulary, i thought i had been wrong, because what i had seen had not been that shape, years later, i saw some film that showed a saucer like ship, then the saucer turned so that only the side of it was turned to the camera, and behold, there was my cigar shape! from the day i saw it, there has been a solid assurance in my inner psychy, almost creepy, that \"we are here, and we are staying\". i have finally written it down, here for you, i feel relieved and vindicated as though a heavy weight has been lifted from my being. this is all true. sincerly linda langdon schulz born april

witnessed this event unfold.Me and my son were parked in the kentucky fried chicken parking lot when suddenly my son calls out for my attention to look towards walmart.Three very bright white lights came up from the heavily wooded area behind walmart.This three lights were pulsating as they moved towards us and moving in a zig-zagging motion.This lights went over our van and when it got over highway 27 going across to cagans crossing they stopped and hovered for a second then they went backwards hovered for a second (in a blink of an eye this lights did this),then they moved forward and kept moving towards cagans crossing.Me and my son fallowed this lights and saw as they were in motion the three lights turned into one big very bright white light in the shape of a sphere.We couldn't tell if there were any occupants or the color of the object or even the shape since this lights were blinding it like camouflaged the object.We assumed the object was in the shape of a sphere judging by the shape of this lights.Me and son fallowed the now one big light to the cagans crossing lake were it stopped.Once it stopped the light hovered over the lake about the tree top height near the fountain and then descended very slowly lower to mid three height.This light hovered about 10-15 minutes and disappeared.There was never any sound coming from this objects even after it turned into one big light and there were no other lights on it that would tell if it was a plane of any kind or a helicopter.The big bright white light in a sphere shape located on the left of the picture as you would observe is the object and the yellowish orange light sitting lower on the right side of the picture is the lake's fountain.I want to also add that this is not the only time we have witnessed strange lights or objects in this area.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

dog that hangs out in the neighborhood screeching and running down the street . i went to the kitchen window to see what the problem was and as i looked out the window i noticed what at first i thought was a bright star in the sky to the south east but as i stood looking at it i realized that not only was it too bright to be a star but there was at least 5 lights across that were moving . at first the lights seemed to be flashing but then they were moving across the object .Then it  looked as though the lights would separate and then go back together  i watched it for several minutes to make sure of what i was seeing . i was excited about seeing the lights but also a little fearful .I called my daughter who lives around the corner from me and told her what i was looking at and we decided to meet at the corner so that she could see it too and make sure i wasn't looking at just bright stars. as i walked out my door and out into the street i realized that there was another one to the west of the first one and as i walked to the corner i saw another one they were not close together but i am not sure how far apart they were . when my daughter met me she verified that what i was seeing was not stars . she brought her camera and tried to get pictures and video but her camera didn't have a very far range zoom . i don't have a video camera any longer since i loaned it to someone about 4 years ago and have not seen it since . don't ever loan a video camera to someone who you cannot trust cause you never know when you may need it . we stood for about 30 minutes watching the ufos and the first one seemed to be getting closer as we watched it . the third one was slowly moving back and the second one to the west looked as though it was moving closer as well . when we saw them getting closer we decided it was time to go inside and we went home in a hurry. the ufos were moving really slowly as though they were looking for something or watching something . that's just our observation .When i came back into the house i went to look out the window to see where they were and the first one was directly overhead and i could not see the other ones . after a few minutes the first one slowly moved on till i could no longer see it . this is not the first sighting that i have had nor the second . a couple of years ago as my mother and i were returning home we saw a cloud , the only cloud in the sky and it was shaped like a saucer . it was sitting directly over a small pasture . then some time after that i'm not sure how long but we saw it again , the cloud shaped like a saucer . it was strange the way it was shaped both times and both times it was the only cloud in the sky but it wasn't that high up in the sky . i know what my daughter and i saw this morning are ufos there were no planes or helicopters in the sky and i have never seen an airplane or helicopter just sit in one place for very long .Also i have never felt fear at seeing airplanes or helicopters .","distance":"Over One

(not sure never seen airplanes blink like this) \r\naround 8:15 an hour later the star-like went from above the treeline appearing steady, then moved below the treeline down to the right. by 815ish the star was completely gone and too far below the treeline to observe it any longer. \r\n8:20 my feet are getting a bit cold and im ready to come in. i close my eyes and start to say thank you, thank you if you showed yourself to me again... then as i opened my eyes i yelled \r\n\"tyrone!! look at this! they are here again! omg thank you thank you!!\"\r\nthis giant orb was so brilliant. it was as if someone was shining a beautiful light in our direction saying \"hello i am here\" we both felt so wonderful and watched in awe as this object pulsated, did not move. this beautiful object was right above our neighbors chimney. it stayed still for a good minute. as i told my husband this is what i've seen before but in the past it was only for 30 sec or less and just totally evaporated or dimmed out. however tonight it just incandescently glowed and was brighter than any other star in the night sky. much brighter than venus! \r\nthen the object moved up! ascended in elevation than dimmed but then just appeared like a bright object. the white/yellow light was now still and the object moved course horizontally heading southwest. \r\ni followed them around a house and noticed this object was now blinking. no sound! and then appeared another one! stationary. no sound this second light source object started to ascend and take off in a southwest trajectory. what is weird as when they are still and very close to us there is no sound and no blinking lights. \r\ni feel so blessed to have seen this tonight. they are there. i really believe if you give out your energy/beacon they will respond. \r\n\r\nmy husband is still sitting here flabbergasted.. xd\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet -
