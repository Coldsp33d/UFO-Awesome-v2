when it was still dark as night.  as i came into the sidewalk at my subdivision a white light that looked like a star just appeared out of nothing high above in the southwestern sky to my 11 o'clock.  it was extremely too high to be a commercial airplane and it was definitely not a helicopter.  this drew my attention immediately to keep my eyes on it as best i could.  the star like object went from white to an all solid turquoise and continued a straight flight path traveling west in a very brief hyper speed then slowed down to a normal speed until it faded away in the distance. i am not aware of any u.S.Fighter jets that uses a turquoise color, i also did not make out any wings nor any lights at the end of wings. i heard no noise and did not see the colored light object blink as a normal craft's would. i stood there in complete shock the entire time, i immediately knew i was looking at something very, very different.  so different that this is my first time feeling the need to report this to someone other then law enforcement.  it was as if a star decided to come alive and start flying, that is exactly what it looked like.  but this star went from white initially to the color i described.  i did not make out a solid structure around the light.  it was simply a flying spec of light. i've been around long enough to know what a plane, jet and helicopter looks like.  i do not want any \"15 minutes of fame\" or whatever, i just want to do my part as a concerned citizen to tell my sighting.  i am far from a ufo buff.

street. the night is quiet.\r\nas i was doing my business i happen to look up. maybe it got a tad bit brighter, maybe i just flat noticed something above me, i don't know why. directly above me is a ship hull, complete with the hull plating and seam-work. the lights from the street were reflecting off the surface and was the only reason i saw it. it was not extra reflective by nature and in fact was a drab dull metal color (i am red-green color-blind). it appeared to be just 20 or 50 above the roof of the house i lived in, which had a steep roof that made it approximately equivalent to a two story place. i could be off by up to a couple dozen feet. its surface reminded me of any number of navy ships hulls.\r\n\r\nto this day i do not know why i did not call out to my friends, not 20 feet away from me in the house and asleep, right then and there. i just took a step or two out into my yard and stared up at this huge ship flying over head. something so amazing that it has to be shared and i just watch it fly away.\r\n\r\nit made absolutely no sound, not a single light of its own was showing moving slowly to the north. it grows in width as it goes overhead and when the what i assume was the back end came into view i knew it was triangular shaped and where the lights of the street no longer reflected was the blackness of its hull as it blocked out starlight for a while.\r\n\r\nit just kept going north. no other change in direction, action, or mode.\r\n\r\ni told my friends and wife at the time. never heard mention of it or any rumors of something weird. as far as i know, i am the only person that saw it. i could have called them out there and i didn't. i never could explain to myself why i did not chase after it in the car, wake my friends, run down the street after it to see where it went, anything.\r\n\r\nothers are seeing something that sounds like mine in texas now, so i thought i would put in what i knew.","distance":"101-500

the bright orange lights it  was  at about 6:50  pm looking west above pinal mountains .  no clouds, moon was up. three large round bright orange lights in a horizontal line flashed on for about 2 seconds then fizzled out. then 2 orange lights flashed on then off, then one light on then off. they were above the horizon about 45degrees moving together (like on the side of a blimp) slowly from left to right (south to north) also saw jets flying north and south around the lights.  thought the lights came from the jets, but they were so much bigger than the white flashing lights from the jets so i thought it was a ufo!  my niece came out and we walked to the circle k on highway 60 and 7th street.  on the way back at 7:25 we saw and heard jets flying around.  looking west again saw the three bright orange lights appear then dissappear, then two then one. my niece only saw the last light. we both saw four jets in the shape of a square flew north made 180 degree turn together then east overhead,  then turned north and back past me to the west.  saw 4 to 6 jets circling the area for about 20 minutes.  we got home, went inside and told my husband.   felt curious and a little scared.  he came outside and we watched the jets making huge circles around globe. i got my phone to make  a video.  walked out into the middle of the street looking south east at about 7:50  i saw them again, same sequence but this time they seemed closer.  the orange lights went out like fireworks fizzling out. this time they were moving together slowly from right to left (south to north)  i strained to see if there was anything there after the lights were gone, saw only small white lights from jets.  it happened too fast to get a video.  my husband walked out and saw the last light (just one orange ball light up and disappear).  we stood outside for about 15 minutes and saw jets flying back and forth (north and south, then overhead to the west then back to the east.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This is an incident i witnessed as a 6 year old boy. we lived at [address removed/cms/tg]. grand island, ne. the neighborhood was fairly new at the time and compared to today, was on the fringes of several farms and quasi-rural. the northern major road running east/west was capitol ave. and one block south was state st. young kids in the neighborhood attended west lawn elementary (not the new one, but rather the old one at state st. & broadwell).\r\n \r\nthis is the view looking to the north on [street name removed/cms/tg] which was right in front of our house. there were not many trees back then as the neighborhood was very new. there were even fewer houses. most of the houses feature here on the right were not built until 1965/1966. so the view northward was very open and clear all the way up to capitol.\r\non saturday, august 8th, 1964 a lot of the neighborhood kids and i were out playing in the street. it was typical stuff; riding bikes, playing army, simply running all over the place. a lot of parents were out working on their yards, washing their cars, etc. just a typical hot and very humid day in central nebraska.  an object drifted over the sky, transiting nw to se on its flight path. it got everyone���s attention pretty quick. it was huge. far bigger than a modern airship or similar type of craft. it was slightly overcast that day, but you could see it clearly. it was black, shaped like an oval cylinder. it had a red line going around the middle of it that was lit up and appeared almost electrical in nature. i remember smelling ozone. like you do when you short a wire out or with lightning. at the bottom and slightly to the side was some type of opening or even possibly a light source that was intense blue-white. it was not a bean or anything, at least it did not appear that way. it makes me think it was an opening as it appeared and then disappeared a couple of times. i do not recall anything coming out of it. but there was a strange sound, almost like ringing in your ears ��� but it was a really high frequency. it didn���t hurt or anything, but it was there.\r\n\r\npeople were talking about it and my dad (who cannot remember it happening) said it was probably some kind of usaf aircraft. one of the neighbors, my friend [name removed/cms/tg]��� grandfather thought it was probably something the russians had cooked up to scare people with. the odd thing in this was the longer it hovered there, the more quiet everyone got and soon stopped talking altogether. they just stared at it. even my friend \"d\" and another friend, a girl named \"p\" stopped talking and just stared at it. no one spoke, no one moved. i think at some point that the same happened to me.\r\n\r\ni have no recollection of time between the incident and sunday dinner, which was the next day. i do not know what happened in that time period, as the next day we were getting in my dad���s valiant and heading over to my grandmother���s house on [street name removed/cms/tg].\r\n \r\nthis is approximately what the object looked like. i am guessing here, but i believe it may have been as large as a ��� mile in length. it was simply massive.\r\n\r\nmost of the kids there that day are haunted by this incident. they know it happened, but none of the adults remember anything at all. it is like their memories were erased. this has haunted me for 50 years. i remember it as clear as daylight.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

\"it would be a good night to see a ufo\" it was so clear. next and within about 30 seconds my wife noticed a orange light traveling toward us coming from the ne. i had not shared my earlier thought with her yet. we both stood up and i almost immediately started to use my video phone. the object glowed an orange color with light traces of red inside it. it traveled at a steady speed and appeared never to change direction or altitude. \r\n\r\nmy first thoughts was a ufo or if not what is it? my wife says her first thought was a meteor or shooting star, now she is unsure and talks about it less than i do. she is not as open to sharing our story until i start to tell someone. it was no big deal to her.\r\n\r\nmy odd thoughts on the whole experience is that i had just thought about seeing a ufo and during the experience i thought of jellyfish. i think the jellyfish thought came because the objects illumination was iridescent similar to the videos i have seen of jellyfish, not a light that looked like it was from a normal light source. the color spectrum of the light was different somehow?\r\n\r\ni also was amazed that i didn't want to stay up all night and stare at the night sky searching for more objects. i was tired and all but it was weird it didn't fire me up and have me laying flat on my back on a blanket or looking straight up into the vast unknown. i do remember thinking it may be a thousand years before another object passes over our yard. i stayed up about an hour then calmly went inside and went to sleep. \r\n\r\np.S. look for the red object (it was orange to us at the time) the large white object is the moon.\r\ni am not a video expert, this is obvious after you watch it. the video is pretty low quality and shaky but it is all i had on short notice. i hope someone with video experience can somehow salvage something useful from it. please let me know if the video is determined to be an identified object or not?\r\ni used profanity in the video
