States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We have a houseboat on lake camanche and live in the area as well. we decided to take family out on the houseboat during memorial weekend for 3 days and 2 nights. we took the houseboat thru the narrows and parked it in china gulch cove on our first day out. we remained anchored at this location for the duration of our 3 day camping trip. this is a remote area of the lake with no camping or housing nearby. there were a number of boats we saw at the beginning of our trip in and around the cove we were in, but by our 2nd day (monday), they had all left the area. we were the only ones left out there by monday evening. we went to bed at a decent hour that night and i slept on the top deck bunkroom with my oldest son. all the slider windows were open to let the breeze through. i woke up having to use the restroom sometime during the night, not knowing what time it was. i noticed all the stars were out with no clouds in the sky and no glow from the sunrise yet. after using the restroom, i climbed back in bed and while laying there, i was looking out the open window near my head at the stars. after only a minute or so, i noticed a light coming from far off in the east with a path right in our direction. i assumed it was a jet coming over the sierra's heading toward the valley with it's yellowish light on the front. over the course of another minute or two as it approached, i realized it was also descending rather rapidly as well. and it wasn't as far off as i initially thought. the night was so still and quiet, i could hear tree frogs croaking and fish eating bugs off the topwater. because of this, i was waiting to hear some type of engine noise from this object approaching. there was no noise at all. by this point, i've gotten up onto my knees and had my face pressed to the window screen trying to hear anything from this object that has now reached the cove we were anchored in. it finally stops at the opposite side of the cove from our position in the houseboat. i'd estimate the distance across the water at about 300 yards. the object is right in line with the treetops behind it that are on the hillside (maybe 100 feet off the water). i also notice the light is reflecting off the water from the object. it's a solid yellowish color and bright, but easy to look at with your eyes even though it's dark outside. no blinking lights. i'd estimate the size to be equivalent to a large passenger car or suv, but round. it stopped and remained at this position and motionless for about a minute as i'm trying to make sense of it. then, it begins moving abruptly in all directions. sometimes it would move in a surging motion to the left maybe 100 feet, then fall downward 20 feet, then bounce back up very fast. at that point, i got nervous and stumbled downstairs looking thru the windows to not lose sight of it. i had no plan of what to do as i fumbled around in the dark, but in the process, i woke up my father-in-law from his bunk and told him to come outside with me to see this thing. in the process, i find my phone on the kitchen counter and see that its 4:12 a.M. we step out to the back deck of the boat and i notice it's just hovering perfectly still again. as i'm telling him what i had just witnessed, my mother-in-law wakes up and joins us on the deck. as i'm almost done telling them both what i had seen the object do, it begins bouncing around again. i can best describe the movements as if you were to throw a rubber bouncy ball on gravel. it would bounce all over the place and be very unpredictable. then it would return to a hovering position and always stay in the same vicinity. a few times it would go from a perfectly still hover to almost a shiver movement, where it would appear to be vibrating from side to side. after several minutes it returned to hovering when we noticed it began to turn on or \"grow\" a red light off the side of it. the light was a brilliant red color, but it wasn't like a red light. it resembled something like if a bright red beach ball was slowly inflated and illuminated. the edges of this red ball were perfectly crisp, not like looking at a typical red light in the darkness. then within 30 seconds or so, the red light evenly shrank down and was not visible anymore. the object hovered and bounced in front of us, and in the same specific area for quite some time (maybe 35 plus minutes.) i took pictures and video with my phone, but the footage doesn't do it justice. the pics/video makes it look so much further away and everything appears pitch black, whereas in person, we could see the hillside behind the object and the tree top silhouettes. by this time, the glow from the sun is becoming visible and it's around 5:00 a.M. i begin to notice that the object is ever so slowly ascending in a south-easterly direction as time passes. it is not visibly bouncing or shivering anymore, but is ascending so slowly, that you can only realize it by where it was positioned 5-10 minutes prior. it continued to ascend over the course of 30-40 minutes until it looked just like one of the last stars in the sky as the sun crested from the east. it was around 5:50 a.M. when the object finally became too difficult to see as it ascended so high in the sky with the sun beginning to rise.

i thought it was an airplane on fire. no sound was coming from the object so i knew it wasn't an airplane. it was flying low enough that i should have heard something. i watched it slowly cross the sky in front of me. i followed it in my yard until the trees blocked it from view. thinking it was over, i turned to the street where several cars and trucks had stopped to watch it as well. that's when i noticed the 2nd one. same as the first, it traveled in almost the exact path. then a 3rd one appeared. this one was much closer to the 2nd one. cars and trucks were still pulling over to watch, with horns honking. i watched the 2nd and 3rd one until they disappeared behind the tree line, still with my mouth open. after the \"show\" i put the trash in the can and headed inside, the cars and trucks continued on their way to wherever. i rushed inside to put a post on facebook asking if anyone else saw what i did. i called my brother and his wife to tell them about my experience and they told me to contact you here.\r\nwhat i saw exactly was just a bright ball (3) going across the sky. no color or shape could be seen other than i could tell there were appendages on the sides. it

was strolling in lisbon by the river tejo, next to the padrao dos descobrimentos monument when i noticed a strange cluster of lights on the sky moving at very high altitude. it was clearly visible as it was a dark night already with no light pollution on the river or left river bank where i was standing. the phenomena reminded me the pattern of a cloud of chaff or the light reflections on waves at the sea, except the ones on the sky moved steadily and seemed to glow and flicker, were very high above the few clouds (so much so i could not see the countours) and were following a straight flight pattern, from south to north at surely high speed -since the moment i saw them above the right river bank until they vanished from view on the city hills on the left bank around 15 mn passed, on a path that would have made it overfly the lisbon airport.\r\n\r\nand yet another strange fact; i am an aviation enthusiast and this summer as portugal and lisbon have become a much sought after tourist hotspot, i have been tracking for the past 2 months the arrivals of scores of planes, which land in large numbers from a sw flight path coming from the right (south) river bank of the tejo river, a bit off the bridge, every 5 mn or so.\r\nafter the dissapearing of the strange lights from my visual standingpoint, i was much further intrigued by the fact that dozens of outgoing flights were now departing from lisbon airport not on the very common south-north runway axis  but rather taking the usual inbound flight path, i.E., precisely on the opposite direction of the strange lights as if for some reason they were avoiding a possible crossing of their path. i am also a frequent flyer to man destinations all over the world and never have any of my flights took off across the city skyline, having inclusively to then make steep turns to go to their destinations as i observed yesterday.\r\n\r\nps: i took one photo with my iphone se and a short video, where it seems there is a central cluster with small independent \"orbs\" next to it. also, apparently and as far as i can tell, dozens of bystanders, mostly tourists were baffled as i and taking pictures and videos with their smartphones, and furthermore i checked with portuguese ufo associations and this exact sightings have been multiplying this year alone mostly in lisbon area but also in algarve (southern tip of the country).","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

planes taking off.  planes usually don't take off during the day here and it was 1pm.  i noticed what i thought was a drone hovering over the trees at the house next door.  i said to my two friends hey there is a drone.  it hovered over the trees and i said again, do you see it? just then my friend on the right of me stood up and said where? i said right there, over the trees.  i too stood up and followed him outside.  as i did this, the drone shot straight up and was gone by the time i got outside-about 10 steps.  i realized the drone wasn't flying like a turtle, with four legs under it, it was like a turtle walking upright, like a cross, as it hovered.  maybe drones do this now, i'm not sure, but it disappeared in a second-faster than a plane.","distance":"21-100
