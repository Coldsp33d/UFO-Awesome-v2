(i remember something but thought it may have been lightning or a shooting star???) didnt think much about it until later that night i emailed it to my computer and downloaded it. i sent it to a couple of friends, which one suggested i send it to a woman in town that works for a digital advertising company. she called me over that weekend after she reviewed it on her home computer and asked me who i go this from (she was skeptical). she took it to her office and called me the following week and said she reviewed it on her work computer and it was authentic. no variation in the pixels from frame to frame, so there was no altering. she explained that an iphone video has about 31 frames per second. this object enters the field of view from the right bottom, goes behind a cloud's edge (not the cloud with the lightning) turns or banks towards the camera, then banks or turns upward in front of the thunder head and leaves the field of view. she said it was in either 11 or 12 frames, or about 1/3 of second, in which this object traveled at least several miles. i would estimate the cloud that the object went around was at least 5 miles away. she also informed me that there is a humming noise she could hear on her hifi stereo at work.(i can hear it better on my iphone than my dell laptop) this noise is heard just as the object appears in the distance and stops before it banks upward. this presents an issue in that it is certainly traveling faster than the speed of sound yet the noise the object emits stops before the objects passes. it also seems to change shape slightly as it banks, etc, like wings appear then dissapear. the object leaves a slight trail which can be seen with a high grade monitor. it looks like  disturbed atmosphere wake, rather than a comet or falling star trail. i have sent it to the lsu astronomy dept and they have no explanation. they sent it to alaska and france to astronomy experts. no help there either. lsu and their experts have ruled out sprites, elfs, tgf's, blue jets, etc. i will attach an unedited, a slow motion, and several slides from the video she gave me.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings,  Other,  Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":51573,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.8512389,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10152013-0010","longitude":-91.3790583,"occurred":1378520700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Louisiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,   Egg","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1381884684000,"summary":"Not much of an event when filmed, occurred too quickly.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/51573_submitter_file1__Orignoenhacementcopyright.mov","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/51573_submitter_file2__IMG3751SlowMolightened.mov","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/51573_submitter_file3__StormImageFrames1.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/51573_submitter_file4__StormImageFrames2.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/51573_submitter_file5__StormImageFrames5.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"70775","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":38,"locationName":"St. Francisville, Louisiana","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:237689"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At 1:30 am i was heading onto the freeway and i noticed something bright to my left and looked. at first i thought it was a huge star or some type of military base object. all of a sudden it shot up like a shooting star but then shot down and back to where it was. it was a second ordeal. thats when my heart stopped. im going 60 on the freeway and some type of energy made me keep looking at it not letting me pay attention to the roadi knew at this moment this wasnt something normal.I thought i was going crazy. i had to keep rubbing my eyes thinking maybe i was just making this up. then it started following me! i called my friend immediately. i told them what was happening they told me to stay on the phone that maybe they where using my radioactive waves. my phone kept dropping calls. on top of that at one point my phone turned off and i turned it back on and a thing on my phone popped up asking me if id like to turn on my cellular connection. well duh its a cellphone why would a message pop up like that? i knew it was following me because i lived 40 minutes away and it followed me for that long. every exit i got off of. you know how when your driving at night and you see the north star or the moon? well you take different exits and roads and the side that moon is on changes side from side from the direction your going. well this object stayed on my passenger side. when i stopped it stopped. i got out of my car and stopped at a gas station asked a random lady look am i crazy is this object moving? at first she said no and looked down and i said please mam please look again and she did and she said holy s**t its coming in our direction. i told the woman what was happening and she said leave it alone stop watching as long as it wasn't hurting us. but i couldn't let go. it sounds super crazy and i still feel crazy but it was like something was watching me and it was listening to me. no happy feeling. i felt danger. oh i forgot to  tell you this all started over lake erie. water. i felt like it was tapping into my phone call i felt a strike of energy through out my body. like it knew i was intrigued so they took advantage of me watching. i lost contact don't ask me how its like i cant remember. i woke up not remembering. i didn't tell you the weirdest part. you know how i told you about my cell phone going crazy well when i went into my house i went to turn on my mudroom light and it didn't work. i thought my mom was playing a joke on me making fun of me. i kept trying to flick the switch a hundred times. so i went upstairs in the dark and flicked the switch that works as well for the same room and it worked. so i was like what so i went back and tried the other switch that wasn't working and it turned on. like some energy through my fingertips. i also wanted to mention another reason i knew it was no airplane helicopter radar thing or military thing was because while i was on the free way it had 3 random bolts of lighting come from the top very quickly. like some type of radiation thing. i felt like i saw one streak of lighting bolt underneath as well very light. i never felt like this before. i don't connect people for such things. but with this i felt like i needed to talk to someone about it. someone who understands and doesn't think i'm crazy.

star and also what i believe is a satellite in the sky west of our home. my eyes now automatically scan the skies in that direction. however, on the morning of october 14, 2013 i saw something unlike anything i had seen before.\r\n\r\ni ran back in to grab my video camera and yelled for my wife, who came outside immediately. our next door neighbor was on her front porch smoking a cigarette. the three of us watched the object moving and hovering.\r\n\r\nwe surmised that it was nothing more than a remote controlled aircraft. then, just for our own peace of mind, got into our car and went searching for anyone outside who might be flying such a craft. in the meantime, the object had disappeared from sight.\r\n\r\nwe drove around the neighborhood and around the area but found no one outside or any evidence of any activity. this is when everything started to point to something besides our initial assumptions.\r\n\r\nthe most unsettling thing about the experience is not knowing or

try to capture at least part of the path of the international space station as it traversed 40 degrees up from the horizon, from wnw to ne.  i'd watched it two nights earlier, when it was 81 degrees up, but was not able to really capture it with my camera that night, and realized i was zooming in too much, and hadn't gotten out there early enough to do justice to the camera settings, and kind of figured out what i'd need to do to get some better shots if i could try again.  that was friday night, 10/11/13.\r\n   sunday night, i knew from the nasa website that the station would be visible at 7:45 pm in the location and direction described above.  i have a canon sx50 hs camera, with a maximum time exposure shutter speed of 15 seconds.  at 15 seconds, i can get stars, and my hope was to get stars, and to photograph the station as a line of light across the sky.  i didn't zoom in much, because i wanted to make sure to include the whole path of the station during each 15 second exposure.  it worked pretty well, though i could have zoomed in a little more, and will do so if i get a next time opportunity.  \r\n   i took four photos.  and did get the station's path for the full 15 seconds in each of the four shots, rotating the camera from wnw to ne a bit for each shot.  it was nice.  i did not see any unusual lights in the sky with my naked eye as i took these photos, and neither did my wife or our neighbor.\r\n   the led or lcd viewing screen on my camera isn't real big, though i can zoom in when viewing it, and i was able to see that i did get the line of light of the station's path during the exposure.  in the first two photos (wnw and nw), i noticed another light in the sky (in the photo) that i hadn't seen with my eyes, or in the screen viewfinder.  and in the 4th photo (more ne) i noticed orbs near the power line tower.  when i uploaded the photos to my laptop, and could crop and enlarge them, i was amazed to see that yellow-green light/shape in the first two photos.  overlapping the path of the station in the first photo, then obviously in the second shot, it hadn't moved like the station had.  it was still in the same place, same shape, etc.  then i saw the orbs in the 4th photo.  there's a string of power lines immediately north of the apartment building we live in.  one orb was pretty bright... the one by the tower, and there was at least one other orb, in the lower left of the photo.  i've photographed orbs before, but never that big.\r\n   i post a lot of nature and moon photos on facebook, and someone suggested i sent these to you.  i'm sending you the uncropped, original photos.  i figure you can zoom in on them as you please.  i'd be glad to send you the cropped ones, but doubt that will be needed.
