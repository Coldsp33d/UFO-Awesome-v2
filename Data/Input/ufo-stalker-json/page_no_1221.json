stay focused in our conversation because i kept looking back at the bright star. i knew it wasn't an airplane because it was not moving it was just there but it was so bright and larger than a regular star. my boyfriend and i continued talking and maybe like 20 minutes passed when i looked back up and noticed the star had moved. it was lower than when i first saw it and it wasn't like a little lower it had moved enough for me to notice it right away. i pointed that out to my boyfriend but he really didn't think much of it and i don't think he had really looked at it anyway. i didn't actually see it move because i took my eyes off of it for a little bit. it was stationary or hovered in place. i ended up getting out of the car and going inside the house because my brother got home. i don't know what happened to it and i didn't go back to check on it, though i kept thinking about it and now wish i would've grabbed some benaculurs. i looked up sightings in my area and found a few stories of people reporting seeing the same thing these past few months.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":51551,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.933770923649654,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10142013-0023","longitude":-95.55577530714982,"occurred":1381546800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1381794929000,"summary":"Star

that appeared to me to be the constellation \"orion\". i immediately knew something was wrong. orion should not be visible on a clear blue day and not in that location as i see it in the south early in the morning when i leave for work. also in that same instant, i noticed they were moving south. i then sprang from my chair to run in to the house an yell at my other family members to come and see the \"ufos\" i was witnessing. they all ran outside and also witnessed the lights and we could now only see 4 and they had changed formation similar to half of an octagon. then 3 lights hovered in one spot while the fourth made a turn toward the west. it then turned back toward us and then suddenly an additional light came streaking across the sky and disappeared out of sight below the tree tops. the speed made me think of a bullet.I then noticed that all but one of the lights were gone. it appeared to slowly get smaller as if it were going away from me and became impossible to see. one family member phoned a friend and told tell her to come out and see if she could see anything. while on the phone we began to observe more lights coming out of the north. shortly there after my son and i witnessed another light streaking across the sky. i was extremely happy to have another person witness what i had seen earlier. we were then informed by the person we had called, that they had just witnessed a streaking light across the sky. several family members along with myself witnessed many lights with time elapsing in between sightings over a period of approximately an hour an forty five minutes. we were finally able to photograph three of the objects. you will have to magnify the image to see them. it simply doesn't show any detail. it is as we saw them \"white lights\" in the sky. through binoculars it somewhat appeared as if there was a dark ring around the object.It was somewhat blurred. the objects for the most part moved slower than airplane speed which could be observed at the same time. they all eventually left our area to every direction except north. i know this sounds crazy but, we can not explain what we saw.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then

both seen several things over the years and attribute that to the fact that we actually pay attention to the sky. i have \"the night sky\" app on my cell phone to help identify planets, satellites, and things we don't recognize.\r\n   saturday night at approx. 8:15 pm, 10-12-13, give or take ten or fifteen minutes, we noticed a very bright light in the north rising on the horizon. this unusually bright light caught our attention but we then looked away as my son had to blow his nose. this did not take very long, and when he was done he noticed the light had risen a lot in that thirty seconds or so. he called my attention to it and we began watching it rise higher and higher very fast. it seemed to be going mostly north to south with maybe a slight south westerly heading of a few degrees. when it was 1/4th the way from horizon to directly overhead it was apparent it was even more odd. the light was so large and bright for an object seemingly so high in the sky, it obscured the craft. i used my night sky app to identify the thing. here is one curiosity, the object,(or a satellite near it was called rb- something/something with a 14 in it. then suddenly the light which was five to ten times the size and brightness of a bright planet like venus was that night which was setting a few degrees south of straight west, this light suddenly flashed brighter and dimer about four or five times almost like a camera flash, then it went out. i was still looking at the app on my phone which now no longer showed the satellite. i moved the phone to the south and the satellite number now was low in the south. the object was still where it was with a very dim front light now and lights began appearing in the rear of it. by dim i mean almost not visible. the rear lights began to be visible as it passed overhead heading south. eventually they were shown to be two big rectangle white lights on the rear. no red, no flashing, no other lights. this object was huge and high enough i would say out of the atmosphere. about fifteen or twenty degrees passed directly up to the south an airliner (standard type airline visible high up passed under this thing and the size difference was incredible. one of the rear rectangle lights was twice the length or more of the airliner. considering the fact that it must have been a very long high distance above the plane that makes it two large to imagine. my guess would be a half mile wide at the very least but that's speculation. this object continued to go in a straight line to the south never descending as it would following the horizon. it just went directly in a straight line never lowering at about 50 deg. above horizon till it was not visible any longer. the only way it could have done that was to leave earth and keep going out into space. it took at least five minutes till we could not make out the lights any more. wish we would have had binoculars. this was a really strange occurrence.\r\n  imagine an airliner at 50 deg above south horizon going left to right. it would be small against the night sky and hundreds of miles away maybe 1/16th inch at arms length long. then this thing going south and at the point they meet from your vantage point one of the rear lights on this object, much much higher than the plane, is three times the length of the plane. not knowing the distance difference but knowing the plane is a high one that makes the width across the rear of the unknown craft 6 to 7 times minimum the length of the airliner jet a 757 at least in my estimation.\r\n   i admit without knowing actual distances all is speculation as to actual size. this leaves two main points that deem this sighting worthy of being reported. 1.- the very size of the thing. 2.- the way it just stayed at the approximate same height to the south, 50 deg. up), and then just continues off and away from earth not lowering to the horizon. lastly not included in the reasons above but worth mentioning is the fact the night sky app on my phone seemed to id this thing as a satellite then not then it id'ed a different thing as that satellite after it was high enough that the front light was not needed to obscure it any longer, but this is just my take on being \"curious\".","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

in what looked to be in the opposite direction at about a 45* angle. the object began swaying back and forth from left to right while continuing to move forward in a straight line. the object was visable for approx 5 mins before disappearing behind the apartment building across from mine. at the same time there were multiple aircraft in the area that were also visible due to an airport in the area. my first thought was that it was just another airplane, but then i thought to myself that it was strange how none of the others were just 1 solid bright white light. all the other aircraft were the typical blinking blue/red lights and were moving perfectly straight. the object i saw had no blinking/flashing lights.  after i lost sight of the object i just stared at the sky and felt very
