 well i do.  now i only have photos and video again at that port on october 1st.  i don't know why i missed the 29th and 30th because i didn't have wifi access.  on october 1st there were big things going on in port canaveral.  got a lot of stills and video.  there were a whole bunch of these very bleary somewhat big dots but not perfectly round.  anyhow most of them changed their shape and just disappeared all together.  again there were orangy/yellow \"dots\" as well as white.  some bright and some not so much.  some i could see white lines (even on the white \"dots\") developing before my eyes.  some had one and some  had two.  some dots seem to split in half and a white line would form vertically whereas some were horizontal.  when i went back later that night and the next morning, everything was gone.  haven't seen any activity since then, but i keep looking.  now just a few days ago that ship that was in bermuda before came back.  this time it was facing the right direction.  i made a point of start watching it before dusk.  i had checked into the port earlier in the day to see if it would show up when it was still light out.  at first there was nothing there.  then i was thinking i was seeing this object again but wasn't sure.  a matter of a few minutes later i was definitely seeing it, but it was a faint color blue. as time went by it got a more solid shape and darker blue.  eventually it was black as i had seen on previous trips.  oh this time there was a ship parked in that other location in the port.  the two ships bows were facing each other and fairly close.  now this time there were like three faint white \"dots\" between the two bows.  the other things i had been seeing in port canaveral were not perfectly round like these i was seeing in bermuda.  i would like to know what all that stuff is....From circus shape tents to disappearing and changing shaped \"dots\" to big black objects in the sky are.  got any answers for me?  they don't fly, so technically they are not ufo's.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":51517,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":26.1317084,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10132013-0017","longitude":-80.1406286,"occurred":1355040000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Blimp,   Circle,   Disc,   Flash,   Sphere,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1381707842000,"summary":"3 different events (and dates) over cruise ship ports.  two in florida & one i in bermuda","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":308,"locationName":"Fort Lauderdale, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:239152"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less, Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was venting to a friend on the phone. i live near a pond, i had just gotten out of work it was about 1:30am october 10th. i was sitting in a fold up chair with my supper in my lap when i noticed lights, they weren't very bright. they were large dim lights about the size of a small car's hub cap 16\"-18\". they appeared to be that size guessing from the distance. it was at the other end of the sky ne of me. i couldn't see any structure in between the lights just the lights. they were lined up like ducks, like a triangle without the bottom line. there were about 6-8 lights on each side and it seemed to be maybe 100ft above the pine trees. it crossed the sky right over me towards the sw then the lights just faded out. it didnt zip off or anything the lights just faded out but the craziest thing about it is there was absolutely no sound which being that close eliminates anything man made. i just wish someone else saw and or reoorted it cause im stil shaken up and wondering if im losing it but i know what i saw and it was way to low, big and silent to be of the world.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":51516,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.258003,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10132013-0016","longitude":-69.4427989,"occurred":1381388400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maine","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1381699897000,"summary":"It appeared out of no where, flew by the faded","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"04073","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":3,"locationName":"Maine","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:239153"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Sunrise","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was traveling north on i-17 in sunrise, florida. as i was approaching the 4 story chrysler/jeep/dodge dealership on my right, i first noticed 4 red/orange lights above the left side of the road. the lights were about 50 ft. above the ground. the lights were in the exact shape of the left half of an octagon. about 2 seconds later as i was still driving north, i noticed 3 of the same red/orange lights on the right hand side of the road. this group of the red/orange lights outlined the shape of a large triangle and it was hovering/descending south. the triangle formation was lower in altitude compared to the first formation. i drove right under the triangle formation as it was moving over my car.

luminescent type lights underneath in a set pattern of a circle and perhaps rectangular in shape. they did not appear to pulsate, rotate, or change pattern in any way and were white in color. the object seemed to be a polished silver color but because of the low cloud cover it was difficult to be certain. there did not appear to be any other noticable features such as rotation of the disc other than a sudden change in direction followed by it hovering in one spot. i very briefly (2 seconds) looked down away from straining my neck muscles from looking straight up and when i did look up again it had disappeared.\r\n\r\ni mentioned this sighting to my wife but she thought i was joking. this sighting was not reported for the same reasons. this made me doubt what i saw but something

50mph. just before turning at 90 degrees. during this phase, i noticed a much slower speed. it hovered about 5-10 seconds but missed the departure direction and speed. \r\n\r\n ","distance":"101-500

right at 15:00 hrs. was stopped discussing what to do about dinner. we were looking/facing the north when i noticed, a good mile away what i initially though were two parachutists under canopy. i asked my girlfriend if she saw what i was seeing and she did. i continued looking and saw the objects were approaching and not descending. i also saw one of the objects moving into and away from the one/other object. i think this movement was what initially caused me to think of them as parachutists, like if they were doing some canopy relative work. the objects continued to move toward us and it became my impression that they were gradually ascending and that they were spherical in nature and silent. the one object remained on a true and steady course and the other object would maintain like a wingmans distance and then rapidly approach the one object to a very close distance, move left or right, jinx about a bit, and then resume a distance. as they continued to approach i got out of the car to hopefully get a clearer sight of them. at this time they were probably at about a 45-50 degree angle above the horizon to me. i commented that they seemed to have some reflectivity to their greyish/leaden colored surface. the sky was overcast with some light coming through. as they got overhead it was my impression that they were probably approx. 1500 - 2000 ft. up. the one that had been darting about had separated more and disappeared into the overcast. the one that had been steady had by now taken a course to the s.E. and continued to gradually gain altitude and soon disappeared into the overcast, appeared again on its' heading and then finally disappeared into the overcast not to be seen again. the entire sighting probably lasted 7 to maybe 10 minutes.  when i originally saw them to the north they were approx.20 degrees above the horizon. through out the sighting i only felt a growing curiosity as i realized i couldn't attribute what i was seeing to any type of aircraft or airfoil, balloon. the rock steady course taken by the one and the \"playful\" attitude of the other in such very close proximity to the steady one ruled out, for me, windborn objects. \r\n   if anybody else in this area saw these objects i'd sure appreciate an email from you guys. if there is anything else i can do to help feel free to contact me.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

coming out of the east. it appeared to be at a normal aircraft altitude, but i could see that the light was solid red and not strobing like a normal navigation light would. i grabbed my 10x50 binoculars from the house and observed that the object was comprised of 3 lights altogether, with the red light being on the starboard side. the other two lights were white (lead light and port side).\r\n\r\nthe 3 lights were in a triangle pattern and remained as solid lights for the entire duration i observed it (approx. 7 minutes)as it headed away from me going due west. as the craft was nearly directly above me, the red starboard light suddenly went from the bright red, to a matching white of the other two lights on the craft.\r\n\r\nas the craft was cruising at the speed of a normal aircraft, my guess would be about 500mph and at a altitude of about 40,000 ft. my guess would be that the craft size was that of about a normal airliner. \r\n\r\nif i had held a ruler at arms length, i would say that the lights on the craft would of been evenly spaced, about a quarter of a inch apart from each other. i could easily see the craft with the naked eye. i tried to look for details on the craft with my binoculars that would tell me if this was a normal aircraft, but i did not see any of the normal tell/tale signs. there were no strobing navigation lights and no tail section lights\r\nat all.\r\n\r\ni consider aviation as a hobby of mine and enjoy aviation history. i am familiar with most aircraft and can easily identify known aircraft & detect objects in the night sky like satellites, the space station, landing lights of approaching aircraft, etc,... i believe that most individuals would not of noticed this particular sighting as unusual and dismissed it as a normal aircraft flying overhead. i knew better. \r\n\r\nthank you!","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
