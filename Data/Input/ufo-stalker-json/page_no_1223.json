east on york lane off to the north or to the skies on our left. as it was at this point was just a spot light floating in the sky and appeared to be slowly turning east as it was facing south at first sight. i do not put much stock in lights in the sky so i wrote it off as a helicopter using a spotlight. then we turned north off york lane onto south salem. when we passed a red brick house on the left . i saw a triangle shaped craft between 50 and 75 feet off the ground.At first glance i could not make sense of what i was looking at. then it looked to change shape,a second later as we were at this point directly under it. i screamed at mother to stop the car so i could get i-phone footage of it. but she was terrified and looked at it once but refused to take a second look. and even sped up to avoid it. i stuck my head out the window and watched it roll upward with no forward momentum. then it stopped and i could see it plain as day as there was a 3/4 moon directly behind it. there were a line of cars behind us. so someone else   \r\nhad to have seen it. i can only hope others saw it and will report what they saw to provide validity to what we witnessed. last i saw of it it was heading toward the west on a path that i am certain would have taken it directly over\r\nnovella arkansas which is on the west side of the river www of our position at that time. i believe i lost some time. please note the craft moved off at a slow steady rate of approximately 20 mph. until it was just a light in the distance. i pleaded with mother to chase after it. it's behaviour made me feel they were looking for a secluded place to land perhaps for repairs.I would like someone to go with me to try and find a landing spot somewhere close to the river as they often land near large water sources and i think i know exactly where they put down at. all mufon investigators please contact me so we can set up an expedient expedition asap. i am a skilled artist and would be happy to draw up exactly what i and mother saw.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,  Louvres","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

6:05, and we were stargazing before leaving because the sky was so clear.  we noticed an object that was roughly as large as saturn, as saturn was out for us to compare it, but it was blueish white and it started in a stationary position near the little dipper then started quickly traveling north east.  at first we thought it might be a satellite but it started making rapid turns and getting brighter.  when it stopped moving and paused for a short time, then darted away in a rapid sharp angle turn.  \r\nthen roughly 1 minute later in the same area of sky that the first object darted away to, a second object appeared, this one was roughly the same red color as mars, but it was much brighter and a bit larger.  this object moved to the east in a raped curving s turn then also halted for roughly 20 seconds and rapidly darted away in the same direction the first object vanished to.  \r\nwe thought they might be satellites at first, but i've seen the i.S.S. fly over and several other satellites and these were far brighter, moved far faster, were much larger, and turned and darted far faster than any satellite i've ever seen!  finally, after the red object vanished, there was a large white streak that was roughly as wide as a cigarette, and at it's speed left a large streak about (to our eyes) 3 inches end to end.  what made us question if it was a meteor was that it was going in the same direction that the first two objects vanished to and the streak didn't dissipate like the tail of a shooting star would, rather it stayed solid and all vanished at once.  almost looking like a ship jumping to warp speed on start trek.  now, had we only saw one of these object i wouldn't question what we saw.  but given that there were three in such close proximity, all going in the same direction, it made us all question what we were seeing.  seeing these objects made all three of us elated, and extremely alert.  as though we had just drank a gallon of coffee, and we work third shift and were all talking about how tired we were no more than 5 minutes prior to witnessing this.  it was almost like these object overhead revitalized us!","distance":"Over One

park/mon valley rc airfield that evening.\r\n\r\naround 7:00 pm i noticed an extremely bright \"star\" in the northwest sky. my wife was also with us and we took turns looking at the object for around forty minutes.  we sighted the object along our frequency pin board and it appeared to be stationary and in synchronous orbit.\r\n\r\nthe reason i noticed it was that stars do not show in the pennsylvania skies at 7:00 pm in july.  the object appeared to be a white ring with a dark center.  in addition there were curly lines  descending from either side of the object, that put my in mind of jewish dreadlocks.  i don't know how else to describe what we saw.  all of us agreed with my description.\r\n\r\nafter about 40 minutes, i happened to be looking through the binoculars, when the object appeared to explode and hundreds of white \"shards\" shot out of the object at about 280 degrees, and disappeared.  in place of the object was a red disk about half the size of the original object.  it held for about a three count, dropped straight down, the distance of about four diameters of the red disk, split in two, again about four diameters of the red disk, paused for a three count and then totally disappeared.  i have described the objects in relative diameters of the object, as i have no way of accurately relating size.\r\n\r\ni later noted in the news that one of the galaxy satellites (i think g4) went off-line, never to function again, 24 hours after our siting.  we have wondered if what we'd seen was a test of an anti-satellite weapon.\r\n\r\nnote:  the above date is an estimate, as it was a long time ago.  i would really like to know what we saw, as my friend and i are both electrical engineers (ret) and have based our lives on facts and science.  if you have any ideas as to what it might have been, i'd sure like to know.  thanks! g. wilson

not at all uncommon in our industry, it then descended behind a hill. i continued on my way west and at times would see the object in the distance first to the east then after a time to the west i really wasnt concerned as this is common in the oil and gas industry dealing with pipelines, but i became concerned when i noticed it approaching us ( my pickup and 5 tractor-trailer trucks ) we all slowed a bit but still found nothing strange about this situation almost immediately it was upon us and following us sideways as we proceeded west on the highway, by now all i could see was two of the very bright very white illuminating lights from the lower section of the airframe, the lights were so bright it illuminated the forward section of the airframe, it occurred to me that the skin of the craft was a dull white-cream-grey organic looking patterned ( as in swirled raised featured designs ) brightly lit, this was not aircraft skin, i've worked on aircraft. this was so very close to me and i began to get a bit concerned, and quite angry it followed us sideways for approximately 2 to 3 miles where i turned off to drive north and lost site of the craft. im a professional scientist and a total skeptic this infuriated me, later my wife whom i had called as i exited the highway and drove north told me i was enraged and she couldn't understand why, my question is why there were no reports of this encounter and why i was involved as i am still quite uncomfortable about all of this.","distance":"21-100

place, doha, the capital of qatar. it was getting dark. it almost was. i was in a car going on rawdat al khail street, towards doha. i was outside the city, just at the edge. there were many well lit low-rise buildings around me, and a brightly lit six-lane dual carriageway road, the one i mentioned above. straight ahead, several kilometers away, were the bright lights of the high-rise area of the city. there was a lot of traffic. i saw a plane or two take off far away, as they usually do every few minutes, and the airport was far away. suddenly, i saw 4 strange lights coming my way, as if there was a police car in the sky! it was most unnatural. i am a careful sky observer, so i know what i am looking at. aircraft lights are small, but the lights i just saw were larger, relative to aircraft lights. there were no other interfering areal objects like planes or helicopters anywhere near the lights i saw. even then i had assumed that they were plane or helicopter lights, although it did not seem so. about the lights: there were 2 green lights, both constant, and one red light which was not constant, it seemed to be moving/flashing/blinking in a clockwise manner. all 4 lights seemed to be part of a single disc. all 4 of them were like quadrants of the disc. the entire ufo was a single one, not multiple ufos. the ufo came from the north-west. so, from my view, it came from ahead and left. both green lights of the disc occupied the left half of the disc, and the one red light kept moving from the top right position to the bottom right position in a clockwise manner and then back to the top right position and so on. i had initially assumed that it was a plane or a helicopter, due to its straight path. when it came vertically above me, almost like perpendicular, in the one or two seconds i got to observe, i could not see any wings or blades or tail (which a plane or a helicopter would have) against the dark blue sky, even after straining my eyes. this made me think it was a ufo, and remember, i am a careful sky observer. plus, i could not distinguish its skin color, but i remember it looked quite dark, almost black. this observation, too, in just one second, as it passed above me. it passed above me, then passed above the road and diagonally crossed it. by the way, it was flying quite low, hardly one or a few hundred feet above the ground. its diameter looked like it was several meters large. well, after passing above the road, it abruptly stopped in mid-air! this further convinced me that it was a ufo. that red light blinking continued on, and just as i was about to pull the cellphone to take a picture, our car sped away, and i lost sight of the object a minute or two later, as some larger buildings obstructed my view. and one more important thing: there was no sound from the ufo. well, even helicopters can stop in mid-air, but if one would fly so low, it would have made a considerable amount of noise. planes don't stop in mid-air, and helicopters are definitely not circular or disc shaped with lights on their entire base. even military helicopters make some noise when flying so low. my doubts were completely cleared the next day, when my colleague told me that he too  had seen the ufo and that it went around the area for a long time. many of his friends had also seen it, he told me. i am quite convinced that it was a real ufo. as for my feelings and reactions during and after the sighting, i was really excited about it and wanted to see it again.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, Unknown,

corner of my eye towards the northwest, when my spouse advised me to look towards the northwest because of a light that she observed that shot down from the sky. at first i thought it was a plane as it was coming our way! then i noticed that it was pulsating in a red orange manor moving slow about 4 to 5 hundred feet above the ground heading southeast making no nose and i realized it was not a plane or a helicopter. then my spouse advised me of another object of the same nature that shot down from the same direction as the first one did and proceeded on the same flight path as the first object.\r\nupon observing them i got very curious, we saw these objects maintaining a level height moving above our home towards kirkland air force base se. then observed the two objects ascending upwards in a high rate of speed until out of sight! at that point because my spouse and i had watched these objects with both of us ending up in the front yard! i looked towards the northwest and noticed several more of the same objects shooting down stopping and start moving laterally towards us at the same flight path as the first two, a total of nine objects where observed, i contact the albuquerque police dept. to see if these objects where being reported and was advised that no other reports had been called in, they gave me a number to call which was the number to the air traffic control on the air base to see if they could give us info on the sightings. upon calling and talking to the controller and giving him a description of what we where observing, he said they may be air force jets taking off and i advised him that these where not jets! or any type of aircraft i know of, and i advised him that these objects where headed his direction, as i was on the phone with him, and he advised that he had no visual on any objects coming his way of which i just could not believe because we where fallowing these objects as they headed the direction of the air base and went strait up!! we where perplexed at what we saw it was very bizarre! to say the least, we could not believe what we had just observed, the whole event took about 20 mins. these objects where on a flight path no question about it, they look like a barrel shaped object's that glowed and pulsated in orange red they looked to have been about maybe the size of a bus with a whitish light on the bottom part!. the albuquerque police contacted me at around 11:45 to advised me that a police office observed the objects and thought them to be flairs? and as i spoke to the dispatch person, i advised that flairs don't fly across the terrain on a flight path then go up! into the sky!! and she didn't know how to reply and noted that other people had called in on the objects!. i don't know if these were military, or skunk works air craft or what but these object moved without sound and moved weird and shot up into the sky! flairs don't do that!!! this was very unbelievable as my spouse and i looked at each other with disbelief. i have held back cause no one will believe you and you know your going to get laughed at if you bring it to light! i saw your program on tv and thought i would share this with you for what it's worth, but very accurate none the less as to what we saw. thank you joe macias              ","distance":"101-500

was on my way to meet some friends for our usual thursday night beer(s).  \r\n  \r\ni left my place at roughly 7:15 and arrived at the bus stop about 2 minutes later. the bus was scheduled to stop there at 7:22\r\nas i crossed the street i noticed there were 3 people waiting for the bus, 1 to the south of the stop and 2 inside the shelter, even though the sky was clear that evening. what first caught my attention were 3 lights which initially i thought were spotlights for the tennis stadium.\r\nthe lights seemed to be hovering, still, and very much aligned. \r\nfor a second i pondered maybe some celestial alignment, but these were no planets, in my humble opinion. \r\ni knew i had a dilemma on my hands, as more people gathered at the bustop;\r\ndo i miss my bus to stare at these odd lights which could end up to just be planes or helicopters?  i watched for a minute or two and eventually the light furthest away turned to the right. the other 2 lights seemed to be flickering a bit more at this point, although their flickers all throughout were very subtle.  i could see the bus approaching and decided to hop on.  i gazed back at the lights as long as i could.  they were still there as the bus took me downtown.\r\ni should also note that i could see other planes flying, one seemingly behind them ( seemed far away and had a blinking (blue) light, going the same direction from south to north as the furthest light also did.  i live just below the flight path so constant planes flying overhead not far from the bus stop.  \r\ni regret not taking any photos or videos, i don't know why it didn't occur to me to do so at the time. maybe it's because don't have a fancy i phone.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional
