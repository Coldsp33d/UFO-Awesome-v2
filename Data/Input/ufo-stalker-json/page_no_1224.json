similar of what myself & wife saw about 10 miles south of marble falls, texas in the 1980's. it was a very dark but very clear night about 9 pm.   finally i saw something almost exactly what we saw on tv. a huge dark black object with dimly lit rectangular windows. looked like a very slow moving house with no roof. it made no sound whatsoever & couldn't see any objects in the windows. it was very slowly moving from north to south about 60 feet above the highway we were on. now at least i know we're not the only ones who have seen a similar object of this kind. no telling how many others have seen a similar object but haven't reported it to anyone. i have no idea if anyone else saw it that night as we continued on our way home to stillhouse resivor close to harker heights, texas. thanks to mufon's efforts of making it known to the public there are unexplained objects everywhere. kinda wish i could see it again & be ready to take live video of it to pass on to mufon.","distance":"21-100

whiteish-blue light. i asked him if it was moving, and he had confirmed that it was. it started out moving really slowly, but picked up pace fairly quickly. as it was moving through the sky, it would take a straight path, and then it would look like it was slithering through the sky, almost like a snake would slither. after a few more minutes of watching it, sean went to get his girlfriend chyenne from the house so she could see it. while he was gone, the object came to a dead stop out of nowhere. sean had only been gone for a couple seconds before he returned with chyenne. by the time we were all back together the object had moved from as far as the eye could see from one side of the sky to the other. as the object reached the horizon it made an abrupt turn to the left just before it had disappeared. soon after the sighting, we began to hear strange noises in the woods behind his house. we can't, with any confidence, say that the object that we saw in the sky, and the unusual noises we heard in the woods following the sighting are related, but what we can all agree on is that we've never heard any thing like these noises coming from these woods before. and we've sure never seen

right above me was a weird looking plane or maybe a drone, it was really short, like the tail end or the back end was shorter than most planes and it flew by this cloud like, circular object in the sky and there was no clouds in the sky, it was clear blue and this object was stationary, it wasn't moving back and forth, it was staying still so i thought that was weird, there was nothing else in the sky in that vicinity at that time. so i went into my apartment to get my binoculars to see if i could see it through my binoculars and went back outside and leaned up against my car. it took me a second to find this object in the sky again because if you are not looking for it, it would be hard to spot it in the clear blue sky so i found it again and tried to look through my binoculars and i couldn't focus them to see the object so then i thought maybe i can get my phone out and take pictures of it and maybe i can see this object in the pictures so i went back into my apartment and got my phone and came back out and had a hard time finding the object again but i did and starting taking pictures of the object at a couple different angles so i took about 4 different pictures and guess what? i got the object in one of the pictures but i have to magnify it in order to see it but you can clearly see that something small and cloud like is in the clear sky, if you magnify it, you can see it, its there.\r\nnow with me being a firm believer on ufos and aliens, of course my first thought was its a ufo but now i'm not sure because it could just be a satellite because i know that the

stargazing to the south on a clear night while cooking dinner.  i observed a triangular shaped craft approaching from the south.  i thought it odd that it did not have the green and red flashing lights that ordinary aircraft exhibit during nighttime flight.  the second thing i noticed is that the craft did not make sound.  the vehicle made an abrupt, instantaneous 90 degree turn without slowing.  i got up, ran, opened the patio door and shouted to my wife, \"come quick, i see a ufo, this is for real!\"  \r\n\r\nmy wife made it out the door in time to see the vehicle from it's rear side as it traveled to the north east.  she confirmed that what we observed did not resemble an ordinary aircraft, and that it did not emit sound.  i observed 5 bright white lights that formed an elongated triangle:  each point of the triangle had a light.  on each side of the triangle, a light was positioned approximately  halfway between the the leading front light, and the two lights forming the points of the tail.  i'd estimate the object's altitude to be between higher than 2,000 feet, but lower than 7,000 feet.  the object was larger than any jet that i have seen.  considering it's size, it is difficult to estimate it's speed, but it was faster than a low flying single engine propeller craft, and slower than a commercial jet liner. \r\n\r\nthis is the very first time that i have observed an unidentified object flying in the sky.  was it some form of experimental military aircraft, or a craft that came from some other planet?  that i do not know.  what i do know is that i

milk. came out and decided to take in the lovely day; i had been inside all day at work. the sky was blue as blue could be (with only a very few sparse upper atmosphere clouds (very high, very thin, hardly any though). as i circled taking it all in (from west towards the east), suddenly i spotted a very small and extremely high up shiny silver object. i stopped and stared, and stared somemore; it did not move. it was too early for stars. it appeared extremely silver and shiny (my guess from the low western sun). i was flabbergasted.\r\n\r\ni must have stood there staring up into the sky for at least 20 minutes. a gentleman came along and asked me what i was staring at. at that point, it was centered between 2 very thin, yet noticeable clouds --- i pointed up, and said look between those 2 clouds. he looked up and said 'oh yea' and asked what it was... i stumbled for words, not really spitting any out. i did manage to tell him that it hadn't moved since i spotted it. he then went into the liquor store, bought his 'whatever' and upon coming back out, asked if it was still there and had it moved. i nodded to still there, said no it hadn't moved --- he looked up and again asked what it was.... i again fumbled for words (one doesn't really say, 'ufo' and be believed). he again said what was it, then in his own words said, \"et\"? i said, quite possibly perhaps. he said i was scaring him and he proceeded home. i quickly ran to the back door of the store and asked the owner if he had any binoculars.... and of course he did not.\r\n\r\ni must have stared for almost 50 minutes or so, not wanting to leave -- but wanting to leave. i live 5 minutes from that location. i knew if i could get home that i had camera, binoculars, compass, whatever --- at home that could help me document the moment. i finally decided that i had taken in this incredible moment long enough, and if i didn't try to get home (twilight was coming very shortly) - that i'd have absolutely no chance to see it better from home.\r\n\r\ni raced home, i pulled out my binoculars and watched it. it took some time to 'refind it' as the sky was vast (in binocular-view), but there it was still!!!! it had not moved. i didn't think that my camera could catch it in low-light sky at that point so  watched until real stars starting appearing faintly and finally the completely sun set and there was no distinguishing it from stars. \r\n\r\n\r\na few footnotes to add....\r\n\r\n** it was extremely hard to tell if this was a cigar-shaped, or dumbell-shaped object. it did not appear as an oval. it was so high and my eyes just could not properly focus on the 'shape' of it. i might have to insist however that it appeared dumbbell-shaped most of the time, however cigar-shaped would have been my first thought except that very often it appeared to have 2 round ends on it.\r\n\r\n** quite often it went transparent. i do not think it was due to extremely thin clouds at the same altitude. while it might have been my eyes, there appeared to almost be a fuzzy grey-black transparent cloud/something around it when it went transparent. i saw that everytime it went transparent. almost, as crazy as it sounds ---- as though it had a shield around it, or entered a slightly different realm for the moment. once it showed itself again, the greyish fuzziness around it disappeared. i do not think that it was my eyes creating that fuzziness, otherwise why wouldn't i see the fuzziness all the time while watching it.\r\n\r\n** while watching it from the parking lot, an extremely high-flying aircraft flew perhaps 10 degrees to it's right. while i have no clue how high the object was, it went transparent as the aircraft flew by. it appeared that the two might have been in the same way upper airspace (both extremely high up there)... the aircraft was so very tiny leaving a contrail behind it.... it was very high up there. it certainly appeared as though the object was being cautious and did not want the aircraft to notice it whether with their instruments or maybe even perhaps with their own eyes.\r\n\r\n** at some point, i realized that i had my cell phone. although a crappy phone camera, i did pull it out and took some pictures. sadly, i can't see a thing in any of them. when enlarged, they're too artifacted to see anything in the blue sky other than blue sky.\r\n\r\n** one final note. and this i've no clue what it was, perhaps nothing. but at one point (this too was while in the parking lot), there appeared something much lower and to my right up in the sky. i watched it and watched it and it flew an extremely straight line and it never waivered. it's speed never increased nor decreased, it did not go up or down at all. i watched it until it was gone from my eyesight, i think it just sort of got too small and blended into the sky. it was a very light brown colored triangle. i thought it to poss be a balloon or a bag but watching it proved that it neither. it was fairly small, but at it's height - possibly the size of a car? it had no dimensional look to it whatsoever; it was flat..... no sides, no top, no bottom. it flew with 1 point forward and the

to take in the lovely day; i had been inside all day at work. the sky was blue as blue could be (with only a very few sparse upper atmosphere clouds (very high, very thin, hardly any though). as i circled taking it all in (from west towards the east), suddenly i spotted a very small and extremely high up shiny silver object. i stopped and stared, and stared somemore; it did not move. it was too early for stars. it appeared extremely silver and shiny (my guess from the low western sun). i was flabbergasted.\r\n\r\ni must have stood there staring up into the sky for at least 20 minutes. a gentleman came along and asked me what i was staring at. at that point, it was centered between 2 very thin, yet noticeable clouds --- i pointed up, and said look between those 2 clouds. he looked up and said 'oh yea' and asked what it was... i stumbled for words, not really spitting any out. i did manage to tell him that it hadn't moved since i spotted it. he then went into the liquor store, bought his 'whatever' and upon coming back out, asked if it was still there and had it moved. i nodded to still there, said no it hadn't moved --- he looked up and again asked what it was.... i again fumbled for words (one doesn't really say, 'ufo' and be believed). he again said what was it, then in his own words said, \"et\"? i said, quite possibly perhaps. he said i was scaring him and he proceeded home. i quickly ran to the back door of the store and asked the owner if he had any binoculars.... and of course he did not.\r\n\r\ni must have stared for almost 50 minutes or so, not wanting to leave -- but wanting to leave. i live 5 minutes from that location. i knew if i could get home that i had camera, binoculars, compass, whatever --- at home that could help me document the moment. i finally decided that i had taken in this incredible moment long enough, and if i didn't try to get home (twilight was coming very shortly) - that i'd have absolutely no chance to see it better from home.\r\n\r\ni raced home, i pulled out my binoculars and watched it. it took some time to 'refind it' as the sky was vast (in binocular-view), but there it was still!!!! it had not moved. i didn't think that my camera could catch it in low-light sky at that point so  watched until real stars starting appearing faintly and finally the completely sun set and there was no distinguishing it from stars. \r\n\r\n\r\na few footnotes to add....\r\n\r\n** it was extremely hard to tell if this was a cigar-shaped, or dumbell-shaped object. it did not appear as an oval. it was so high and my eyes just could not properly focus on the 'shape' of it. i might have to insist however that it appeared dumbbell-shaped most of the time, however cigar-shaped would have been my first thought except that very often it appeared to have 2 round ends on it.\r\n\r\n** quite often it went transparent. i do not think it was due to extremely thin clouds at the same altitude. while it might have been my eyes, there appeared to almost be a fuzzy grey-black transparent cloud/something around it when it went transparent. i saw that everytime it went transparent. almost, as crazy as it sounds ---- as though it had a shield around it, or entered a slightly different realm for the moment. once it showed itself again, the greyish fuzziness around it disappeared. i do not think that it was my eyes creating that fuzziness, otherwise why wouldn't i see the fuzziness all the time while watching it.\r\n\r\n** while watching it from the parking lot, an extremely high-flying aircraft flew perhaps 10 degrees to it's right. while i have no clue how high the object was, it went transparent as the aircraft flew by. it appeared that the two might have been in the same way upper airspace (both extremely high up there)... the aircraft was so very tiny leaving a contrail behind it.... it was very high up there. it certainly appeared as though the object was being cautious and did not want the aircraft to notice it whether with their instruments or maybe even perhaps with their own eyes.\r\n\r\n** at some point, i realized that i had my cell phone. although a crappy phone camera, i did pull it out and took some pictures. sadly, i can't see a thing in any of them. when enlarged, they're too artifacted to see anything in the blue sky other than blue sky.\r\n\r\n** one final note. and this i've no clue what it was, perhaps nothing. but at one point (this too was while in the parking lot), there appeared something much lower and to my right up in the sky. i watched it and watched it and it flew an extremely straight line and it never waivered. it's speed never increased nor decreased, it did not go up or down at all. i watched it until it was gone from my eyesight, i think it just sort of got too small and blended into the sky. it was a very light brown colored triangle. i thought it to poss be a balloon or a bag but watching it proved that it neither. it was fairly small, but at it's height - possibly the size of a car? it had no dimensional look to it whatsoever; it was flat..... no sides, no top, no bottom. it flew with 1 point forward and the other 2 points basically ---- 1 up, 1 down. it was very weird considering what i was seeing otherwise at the time. it flew much lower, think ballon-height when you can still see it pretty well (although not too low and

wanted my 10-year-old boy to come outside to look at the moon and venus. as we stared at it for a very quick moment owing that my son was interrupted from his video game and forced to see this site, he said, \"okay, i saw it!\" however, as he turned away to go back into the house, he said, \"hey dad; what's that?!\" in the northern sky, almost 180 degrees north from where the moon and venus were, there was a large, perfectly round ball in the sky being illuminated by the sun.  the reason i know it was the sun illuminating this object is for the same reason all the planets are illuminated at night - planets do not give off their own light; neither does the moon.  it takes the sun far enough below the horizon casting its light toward the heavens (outer space); and, whatever objects happen to be high enough to catch those sunrays is going to be illuminated!  this is the case of the ball we saw.  when my son saw this and got my attention, i could not take my eyes off of it.  i told my son to run in the house and get his mother.  he did and left the front door opened on his return to stare at the ball.  she was slow coming, so i hollered for her to hurry up.  she came running, began to stare at what we were staring at, and could not comment!  we all just stood in the front yard staring at the ball. \r\n\r\ni began to tell my family the following facts as we all stood there in agreement and amazement:\r\n1) there were no flashing lights; \r\n2) it looked just like someone was in the sky holding a light bulb; the ball was perfectly shaped round, not oval like some planets, but rather absolutely perfectly round - just like the lighted end of a light bulb;\r\n3) there was no sound; and, we live in the country where there are no other distracting sounds; and,\r\n4) as it sat still, and as i was focused on it to see if it was moving like an airplane; like a drown; like a helicopter; like a space shuttle; like a satellite; or like a space station, i saw it very, very slightly zigzag.  the zigzag was almost undetectable because it was not going across the sky; it was as though it was moving in the direction of space when it did the little zigzag; nevertheless, the ball was still the same shape, very big!  it never moved left or right.  it also appeared as though it came back just a bit, but i am not 100 percent it moved backwards.  while it was just sitting there, it ascended as far as the eye could see to a point so small, it was as small as the smallest star in the northern distant deep space ��� until it continued to get even smaller until it was undetectable.  \r\n\r\ngoing from a big ball, bigger than anything i had ever seen in the sky, and moving in the direction of deep space in a matter of two seconds, seems reasonably certain to say it was a controlled spacecraft of advanced knowledge. \r\n\r\nnow that two days have gone by and i have had time to verify in my mind all the facts, i surmised that if one were to count, \"zero, zero, one; zero, zero, two,\" that���s how fast it went into deep space.  \r\n\r\nit did not ever go across the sky.  it never made a sound.  it had no flashing lights.  there were no other objects or airplanes anywhere near it. we did not see it arrive. it just sat there, and we stared at it for approximately three minutes. when it left, it did not go straight up.  it went in the exact angle towards deep space as those distant faraway northern stars reside ��� the tiny ones the naked eye can only see by not staring directly at them.  the bottom line, it was freaky!!! \r\n\r\nmy questions are:\r\njust how far away was this ball when we saw it?  that can never be answered because i believe it was being illuminated by the sun. because it was night, and in order for objects to be illuminated by the sun at night, as our planets are, objects have to be a lot higher than we realize. an airplane passenger jet, for example, would not have been illuminated by the sun at this time of night; and, they fly approximately five miles high.  when they are five miles high, or even one mile high, they look just like airplanes. \r\nend

chicago, somewhere near midway airport.\r\n\r\ndetails: me and my mom were driving to downtown chicago when we saw two unmoving points of light that looked like stars above the horizon.I only noticed them because they looked like stars and i know you cant see stars during the day, also i thought it was strange they didn't move so they couldn't be planes. they were placed apart from eachother horizontally one a little lower than the other. the two points as i said did not move but they would fade in and out. there were planes in the sky at various altitudes but all moved steadily and none shone as brightly if at all. the \"stars\" eventually faded out to much smaller points, eventually i either lost track of them or they just disappeared. there were no buildings or towers nearby that these lights could have come from. at first i thought they might be planes but when i saw they didn't move i knew they weren't, they stayed in one place for too long to be planes. \r\n\r\nweather: some clouds low on the horizon but clear skies everywhere else. the points were above the clouded horizon quite far up in the sky.\r\n\r\nsecond sighting\r\nsame day\r\n8:20 am\r\nlocation: driving on lake shore drive\r\nnorth east direction toward chicago.\r\n\r\ni saw one smaller point of light in the sky above chicago. they appeared to be faint and faded in and out a couple of times before disappearing.\r\n\r\nat about that time i saw another faint light flickered over the lake a few times\r\n\r\ni saw two helicopters, one over the lake hovering in place, another moving over the city. neither seemed high up enough to be the points of light and they were black. it is possible that the points of light could have been reflections on helicopters but unlikely. the points of light didn't appear to be any sort of plane or helicopter and they would probably have to be much higher up to appear so small and distant. i know what helicopters and planes look like at high altitudes, and these points of lights didn't resemble either.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nlater the same day,maybe 3 hours or so had passed since the first sightings i saw a couple more of these lights as we were driving away from chicago. both were very faint and brief, one appeared to be in front of some thin clouds, either that or it was shining through the cloud. as we moved away from the city however i no longer saw these lights. we drove out to indiana that day for some errands and i scanned the sky there as well. no lights. it appears that these lights can only be seen near the chicago area and over the lake.\r\n\r\n\r\nup until this point i have never seen a ufo. so i was very excited when i saw these. i have tried to explain them many ways, like maybe their helicopters? very unlikely. weather balloons? im not even sure what those look like but i dont think thats what they were. i spent the rest of the day scanning the sky for any similar phenomena, but i haven't sighted anything since. i do plan to if i get the chance bring my telescope and a camera to downtown chicago or somewhere nearby to see if i can get pictures. unfortunately though my camera is old and not good quality so im not sure what good that would do. if anyone has seen these strange star like objects near chicago please let me know, or even if you have sighted them else where. this is my first post here but i am sure that people will be able to comment. i really would appreciate feed back. also if you have any explanations for what i saw let me know. if it turns out to be something normal and terrestrial i may be a bit disappointed but i still would want to know, i am definitely open to any explanations.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":51440,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.8847536,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10102013-0016","longitude":-87.6225482,"occurred":1381416300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1381458803000,"summary":"Stationary

que, segun lo que pense en ese momento podrian llegar a ser luces del mirador, que se ven desde ese lugar, pero cuando giro mi cabeza para ver de que se trataba, no entendia que era lo que veia, por que esperaba ver luces de alguna supuesta fiesta que se solian hacer en el mirador; el tema es que detube mi marca para poder obserbar mejor de que se trataba, y cuando me detengo y miro bien me di cuenta que estaba viendo un objeto que volaba al raz de las copas de los arboles, era un objeto muy grande de unos 15 metros de largo por 4 de ancho, tenia forma obalada, pero solo se veia su silueta y obviamente las luces que en un principio me llamaron la atencion, las cuales giraban y delataban un movimiento circular de las mismas. una vez reconocido el objeto me asuste, y lo primero que hice fue ver si alguien mas veia lo que yo estaba viendo, pero los autos pasaban por el puente sin para ni mirar, era de noche y no habia nadie cercano como para corroborar. cuando vuelvo a ver el objeto

front of my parents house in salem, oregon facing south. the sky was very clear that night and, after a minute or two i spotted something that at first i thought might have been a far off plane. it came out from behind a group of trees that was sw of us flying at a very low altitude (the object was parallel with the tops of the trees), and heading east at a very slow pace. i was confused because it was low flying, slow and noiseless, so i alerted my wife to it and she immediately noticed it also. we were observing what appeared to be a small bluish-white light with the occasional blink of red light that seemed to be too off tempo to be a planes. after a minute or so, it finally went behind a larger tree that is taller than the others around it. interestingly, i noticed that before it reached the tree it changed direction  going slightly up. then, as it was behind the tree, it changed course completely and was now going west with jumpy, erratic movements. almost like it was caught on a fishing line and was getting reeled in, at first fast then slow, then almost motionless all the while with an occasional blink of red. this startled me and i exclaimed out loud to my wife and myself. ending up behind the same group of trees that i originally first saw it fly out of, it then changed course again coming back out of the trees going east. at that moment, it was very bright and shone through the trees whitish light. coming into the clearing, it was clearly visible with a star-like shining white-blue light that was glinting off of a dark shape. the light was brightest on the right side and on the left is where the red blinking light was located. finally, with the same unpredictable skip-like movements, it flew behind the tall tree and at that time shone a very bright white light right through the tree at us that illuminated the area. this made us booth exclaim aloud and as we watched it, it smoothly came out of the other side of the tree, hovering east parallel to the smaller treetops. it slowly moved east then seemed to stop and descend behind the trees where we lost sight of it for a minute. we knew it was there and shortly later we caught sight of it moving just below the tree tops, kind of going up and down. it was like it was playing hide and seek with us and it made awkward movements right above the trees, going side to side and up and down. ascending slowly into the sky, it made all sorts of movements, going in all directions. at this time it was clearly visible and i tried desperately to make out what it looked like. it was like a blue-white arrowhead shaped light that was very radiant and star-like. the light it produce seemed to be bouncing off of its own shape on all sides, especially on the right which was clearly arch-like, and the bottom. now it started slowly moving west, growing in brightness and gaining a clearly defined central triangular light. going behind the tall tree, it moved in an unexplainable pattern and then slowed dramatically. at this point, i was very shaken up and when i saw it moving around i was like a frightened animal shaking in fear. it was just beyond the tall tree and what amazed me is that it changed from the white light i was seeing to an incredible golden radiance. it stood almost motionless and seemed to be growing much more radiant than before. the shape looked exactly like an angel. continually moving west, it seemed to turn slightly and stop. that is when we saw something extraordinary. it now had a translucent golden arrow-head shape encompassing the central light and two constant red lights on its left side, one atop the other. the central light was brilliant golden with the same arrowhead shape and light coming from all sides. then moving west at a quicker pace, i noticed that the central light could have been three lights grouping together in a triad formation right before it disappeared behind a large group of trees and we lost sight of it for good. \r\n\ti watched this object the entire time it was in view, never taking my eyes from it. in the beginning of the encounter, i had thought that my eyes were playing tricks on me but as i continued to watch, i knew my eyes were fine and i was witnessing something incredible. i was amazed and astounded at what i had seen and exclaimed a lot during the event. its magnificent star-like radiance left me awestruck. by the time it was leaving, it was large, bright and obvious in the sky, and the golden triangle that surrounded it was very clearly defined. the way this object moved is absolutely unexplainable and confirmed to me that it was definitely not one of our typical aircraft. the event lasted about 15 minutes.

brother off at his house down the road, they had seen a green streak across the sky we thought it may be the comets everyone is talking about. we arrived back home and as we were walking up the steps i had an urge to look at the stars.I went to the porch railing, which is facing east, and looked up to see a bight light, it seemed to glow purple but when i blinked thinking it was my eyes playing tricks on me it started to glow light green. it was moving a slow pace south bound. i called for my husband still thinking it was my eyes playing tricks, he came out and i asked him to look up and tell me what he sees. he looked up and his mouth got wide i asked him if it was just me or was that star moving he said yes it was moving. he ran inside to get our video camera, as he came back and started his camera it started to slowly descend down toward us at the same slow pace it had been traveling south at. it did not descend very far before stopping and hovering. we stayed out there for hours watching it pulse different colors and swinging back and forth. while filming we noticed that there were several aircraft in the area coming quite close with the ufo, they kept flying by and the coming back as if they were also watching what we were seeing. finally at sunrise the ufo ascended and disappeared. the aircraft that had been flying around the whole time continued to fly around our house for an hour looking for the ufo.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then
