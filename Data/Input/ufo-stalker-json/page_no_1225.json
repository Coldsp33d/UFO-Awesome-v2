(dare i say ufo??) & it was heading north, crossing portage avenue, between cavalier drive and david street. it was not simply a bright ball in the sky, but a larger plane-like craft (with what appeared to be short and wide wings) and the entire thing was so glowing red-orange like hot molten metal emitting flames, with no noise, and low enough that you knew it was unlikely any of the the following - commercial plane; helicopter; air balloon; flares; meteorite, and it  moved north-westward and appeared parallel to the ground (not ascending or descending). i was about 1.5 blocks away from my home, walking northward in a business parking lot, just off portage/bedson street at 7:42pm (cst). there was a nurse-aide who had just left her workplace and was heading to her parked vehicle - when she yell out loud to me twice ''what is that!'' she pointed above, and i looked upward, and just above to my right side was a large brilliantly illuminated plane-shaped craft that was like nothing i could simply imagine. it was moving north-west (winnipeg james a. richardson international airport, cfb winnipeg airport and st andrews airport are all north-east of my location and the craft). the two of us just stopped in the lot, looking up at the object/craft to watch in shock and awe, then wondering what the object was going to do next, as it appeared to hover for a few seconds, and then it slowly continued it's path. there was no plane exhaust and no appearance of any aviation navigation flashing lights to signify a plane or helicopter in flight. the craft appeared like it had solid and defined framing, yet the centre oblong shaped capsule actually looked unworldly translucent with glittering sparkles. the appearance i can describe - like the entire craft was an inferno of red-orange molten metal on the exterior along with fuzzy flames emitting the entire perimeter of its frame, with the capsule's translucent visual appearance both with many hundreds of white diamond glitter sparkles, and red flickering fire-embers. i cannot fully speak for the other woman, but i suspect she felt much like i did, realizing what we saw could not possibly be of this world. within 1.5 to 2 minutes after we saw the object, it had moved in its path approximately 2 or 3 city blocks away, when we last witnessed the object go beyond a couple of 3-level condo blocks, before it was out of sight. the nurse was going to drive several blocks north-westward to see if the craft would be in view again, also thinking the object may be close to a couple of schools approximately 5 to 6 city blocks away. as i continued my walk home, i saw approximately 6 elementary aged kids playing in my condo's courtyard along with a couple of concerned parents who had just stepped outdoors, as the children were so excited to witness what i saw. i decided not to approach them as i was not sure how much information to share as to what i observed - not wanting to put fear into the mothers, or their children. i did ask a friend you lives a bit north-west of me earlier today, and she was indoors before 7:30 pm last evening and did not see anything unusual. i also spoke to my uncle this evening about my experience, and he worked on boeing aircraft for 30+ years, and he considers the object to be very unlikely a commercial aircraft.","distance":"101-500

communication with beings, possible abductions/contact in the past, etc. against my control, i walked to a chair (one i usually don't sit in) in my living room and gazed out the back door. i noticed a bright glowing gold craft appear in the sky, shortly followed by another beside it. i ran outside to stare at them. they displayed movement and light in which i've never thought possible of any aircraft. i noticed they shut their lights off, and i turned around and noticed my parents inside my house. i went back inside to tell them the great news, but they dismissed it. my mom then left and my step-dad went to bed. i kept staring out the back door, and i saw them again. i ran to my room to grab the dislocated scope of a gun to get a better look at them. when i went back outside, they were glowing very bright, with bursts of light. i walked out into a field to get closer. as i gazed upon the crafts, i felt an inner joy, a great bliss, in which i've never felt before. i periodically lost control of my body, and it seemed as if i offered myself to the crafts. i don't have much memory from that, but the next thing i remember was me holding up the scope to get a glimpse of the second craft, it seemed to come closer to me. i viewed it with great detail, it looked like nothing i could even imagine. it also seemed to let out a white light, which seemed as if it was aimed in my direction. i then took the scope away and saw beings maybe 15 feet away from me. i became overwrought with fear, and i began to hyperventilate. i turned to run, but i didn't make it far. i found myself unable to control myself, and i turned around to stare at them more. it appeared as if one came towards me, and at that moment, i managed to turn and run away. i remained outside and called a close friend, emotionally breaking down. i still noticed the beings, but i looked away for a few seconds and they were gone, and i saw the crafts in the sky again. as i write this, i grow

birding binoculars we both observed some details on the dome itself resembling possibly a row of arched shaped windows from the base of the dome.Niether of us could see any wings but my wife said she

around i noticed a bright light moving across the sky. it looked similar to\r\na satellite but i was not sure what it was. then i saw another and another and more. below is a culmination of less then 1 hour of viewing the skies and the total\r\namount of these so-called satellites i viewed.\r\n\r\nat 04:47 a.M. i had been looking through my 10 x 50 bushnell binoculars above me. i was facing south the entire time and noticed an object looking \r\nlike a satellite come into view. it was moving from the northwest towards the southeast. it stayed relatively straight from that point on where i lost it about\r\n45 degrees above the southeastern horizon. \r\n\r\nat 04:50 a.M. again looking straight up, i noticed a bright object moving from the north to the towards the south.\r\nthe object was lost at the southern horizon. \r\n\r\nat 04:52 a.M. i was looking around for more objects when another came into view moving from the north towards the south where i lost it just \r\nabove the southern horizon.\r\n\r\nat 05:05 a.M. i noticed another bright object that came into view moving from the north towards the south where i lost it just \r\nabove the southern horizon again.\r\n\r\nat 05:12 a.M. i noticed another bright object that came into view moving from the south towards the north where i lost it just \r\nabove the northern horizon this time.\r\n\r\nat 05:18 a.M. i noticed another bright object that came into view moving from the south towards the north where i lost it just \r\nabove the northern horizon this time.\r\n\r\nat 05:20 a.M. i noticed another bright object that came into view moving from the north towards the south this time where i lost it just \r\nabove the southern horizon again.\r\n\r\nat 05:30 a.M. i noticed another bright object that came into view this time moving from the west towards the east where i lost it above the eastern \r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nso within 43 minutes, in the early morning hours of monday october 7th, 2013, there were 8 objects flying every which way crisscrossing the phoenix\r\nskies. they all had the characterization of looking like satellites going across the skies. none of the objects were the same colors. some light blue, \r\nsome yellow, some white in color. none seemed to be the same size either. some larger and some smaller. the speed was not consistent, \r\neach moving at it's own speed across the sky. some fast some slow. none though were as fast as a meteorite. no object changed directions either. \r\nwhat ever way they were pointing when i first observed them is the direction they kept going until i lost sight of them below the horizon. \r\nthere were several high flying airplanes and a helicopter flying at the same time too.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

dim, followed quickly by the center light until it is no longer visible. i have never seen it reappear the same night. there have been three adult witnesses to this and we all agree on the description. first, we believed it to be spica, then venus. but planets do not \"dim away\" nor do they have three distinct lights. we first observed this in september and filed a report at that time. i have contacted our local control tower as we are a few miles from an airport, but they could offer no explanation. after so many subsequent sightings i have decided to file an updated/new report for

toward salt lake city/interstate 80 enjoying the autumn leaves on oct. 8th, 2013 approximately 430-5pm mst. relatively few cars were on the winding mountain road and the sky was very overcast. while driving on a fairly straight portion of the road, a glowing white light caught my eye. the spherical object was approximately the size of a cantaloupe or basketball and was hovering stationary near the top of a large tree. the object seemed to shimmer white light yet did not blink lights and did not change light color. it was a glowing ball of white transparent light. i quickly braked and grabbed my iphone (which was in camera mode as i had been stopping periodically to take pictures of the autumn leaves) and snapped a picture of the glowing orb. mere seconds later, the orb appeared on the opposite side of the 2-lane road at approximately the same height off the ground yet i did not witness the orb move from one location to the other. it was simply as if it \"disappeared\" as it moved between locations within seconds. i quickly snapped a second picture before the object simply was no longer visible. no longer seeing the object, i proceeding in driving toward my destination. once in slc, i stopped to look at the two pictures of the object i had taken. i was surprised to see that the object (which had appeared bright white to my eyes at the time i observed and photographed the object) appeared glowing green, not white, in the two photographs! the lighted object i witnessed and photographed was not a reflection from another vehicle or street sign, nor was it a malfunction of my iphone camera (inasmuch as i have taken literally hundreds of photos of this season's autumn leaves on the iphone at varying times of the day and early evening and have never seen a reflective green spherical object inadvertently appear in any of them). the green orbs shown in the attached photographs are what appeared to the naked eye as white glowing orbs. i do not know what it

walked backwards keeping it insight for about 20 seconds then we lost sight of it. there was no noise, no lights on the craft. its seem sort of  \"stealthy\" to me. after that we sat back down then

sit with coffee. i noticed what appeared to be a low star alone in the sky at about 45 deg above the horizon to the north west. the object appeared to be about the size of an aspirin, hovering stationary next to the telegraph pole across the street and had a bright twinkling white light. i wanted a better look at the object that didn't move for ten minutes and got my field spotting scope. observed through the spotting scope and field glasses, the object appeared to move rapidly around a central point and change colors rapidly from white to red, green, and blue predominantly.\r\nthe object danced around a central point in small arcs that seemed to trace paths similar to the models of the atom you see in high school. i went inside to tell my daughter, her boyfriend, and my grandson to look out a front window and confirm my observation. the boyfriend and my grandson came down to the porch to observe outside, through the scope and binoculars and saw exactly the same patterns i described above. the time was 9:30 pm. the boyfriend observed a more faint object at the 10 o'clock position from the original doing exactly what the first object was doing. my eyesight was not good enough to see the second object. my grandson claimed to see something red shoot out of the bottom of the original object that we could not see with our naked eyes. we were amazed how much the object traced wild orbits around a center and constantly changed colors when observed through binoculars. this was very apparent because we were observing the object so close to the right edge of a telegraph pole. we gave up watching at 10 o'clock pm and went inside. for 1 full hour we watched two apparently stationary objects dance in wild orbits when observed through binoculars. the object appeared to be located over owego, new york from our geographical location.","distance":"Over One
