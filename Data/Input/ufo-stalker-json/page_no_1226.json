street. houses looked slightly unfamiliar while i thought this. it didn't take long to discover that i was on my street.\r\n\r\nthen i got out of my car, and looked up. thinking about how clear the sky was tonight and how beautiful the stars looked. i turned around from my car south, still looking up and saw a light.\r\n\r\n(two nights before this i had what i believe to be a premonition that i might see a ufo. the last phase of the dream i was on before waking involved a ufo somehow, i was looking at one or something. my recollection of the dream is hazy. i was thinking in the dream, and after i woke, that the time 5:30am kept reoccurring. like i was supposed to remember that time, in fact, my impression was that i should be awake at 5:30am at my house in the living room waiting for the time to go outside and look. i thought this in the morning and several times later in the day when i was actually awake. this i also did not do, i was in a different city and asleep. that 5:30am was the morning of today; the day of the sighting.)\r\n\r\nit looked to be the brightness of a plane. slightly brighter. one solid light, no blinking. a little too bright to be a satellite. i looked at it wondering when a second light zig-zagged quickly behind it. it appeared and disappeared in about a seconds time and appeared to be behind the object.\r\n\r\nthe light turned slightly towards the north-east. i had to move from the middle of my street to the front yard because it went behind a tree. it got brighter significantly, then dimmer, then disappeared. it was still faint enough that you could see it shoot in a line in a slanted direction. i had the impression of seeing several zig-zags that were incredibly faint after this.\r\n\r\nit had left a very short time before airplanes began flying east towards its last location. they seemed to behave normally.\r\n\r\ni'll mention now that dogs were barking on and off whenever something was visible. in seemingly similar location to where it was in the sky.\r\n\r\nthe light reappeared slightly dimmer moving like a satellite would with some variation. i would wave to this sort of light and it would brighten accordingly on several occasions. it felt like an acknowledgement, a hello. i heard my neighbors on their porch wondering why i was staring at the sky. i invited them over, the one who walked over, got there in time to miss it. they said, \"so you believe in ufos?\" only a few seconds too late!\r\n\r\nsome time after this i began paying attention to what i had already ignored, thinking it to be a plane. it had numerous white lights, some perhaps yellowish, and maybe a red one. after a few seconds of viewing they did turn out to be all-white. blinking in a random sequence quickly and spastically. it bobbed up and down subtly, and disappeared behind the tree line. this was in the ne heading east.\r\n\r\nnext was the same as the earlier ones, it was fainter, and in more of a straight line path. i thought this one could have been a satellite. i watched, and and it seemed to respond to one of these questions i was thinking when another light blinked behind it (as with the zig-zag earlier). at the time of this blink, the tvs in both mine and my neighbors house flashed. you know what it looks like when a tv goes from a dark scene to a bright one, and you're viewing the light bounce from outside? i'm assuming it was with the tvs and not a surge in the lights of both houses. either way, it happened at the same time as the blink. again i waved hello and it brightened before speeding up and dimming.\r\n\r\ni was talking on the phone waiting to see something else (there were several minutes between each incident, at various times), when i turned north to see a low, tree level (but several blocks away i think), object descending! about three solid bright glowing yellow, dark-yellow, yellow-orange lights with a black mass of the object. it seemed to be triangle. it also seemed to turn from on its side to reveal this. it was close! it made no noise, and descended through the trees. i joked on the phone that it was landing, and after it disappeared below the trees in my vision it could have. i worried that it may have crashed, but if it did, it would put it somewhere in residential royal oak. so unless i hear something on the news or the web, i'm assuming it just descended and then faded away that's why i didn't chase after it to try to keep my eye on it, but i still kinda wish i would have. i had a moment of silent prayer for the well-being of the whatever it is or was, on that note. then had a similar feeling as when i first turned on my block, like a profound blink. in the realm of thought, or other dimensions? it was a good feeling, similar ones have occurred in other experiences. after that i had the suspicion that there would be no more activity for now. i hung around outside for a while, but the dogs had stopped barking.\r\n\r\ni'm going back outside now for a little while. what a beautiful thing! it's a really great feeling. i feel so blessed and honored to have witnessed these things, and in front of my own house no less, at the exact time that i was outside to notice. wow!\r\n\r\n\r\npeace","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

 it was between 4:15 and 4:30.  it was cloudy and oddly that's why i think i noticed the five darker oddly shaped objects in the sky. i told my mother to stop the car and watched them.  the biggest one was hovering at the center of the four smaller objects and the closest thing that i can describe it as is a half moon shape.  this is because it appeared to change slightly in shape.  the four other shapes closely resembled triangles and they moved all about in different patterns around the big center object.  they seemed to \"dance and weave\" with the most constant pattern reminding me of a dna double helix.  at one point all five seemed to merge before the four smaller ones broke off and did their dance again.  like i said it was cloudy so even though i could definitely make them out, i couldn't notice in detail anything but their shape. in the clouds all five were black shadows against the grey clouds.\r\ni knew right away that these were no ordinary aircraft and that what we were seeing was a ufo.  being a believer but never seeing one i was both very excited and a bit frightened i'm not afraid to admit.  my mother who is not a believer in the slightest was dumbfounded and sat silent as i enthusiastically rambled on about the objects and justification at last to all of those who think we believers are crazy. after about 4 minutes or so, she must have been too freaked out and started driving again even though i protested very loudly and adamantly. as far as i could tell they were still there cause i kept looking until i couldn't see them anymore.  the strangest thing was when we got to my brother's house he and his girlfriend said they saw something similar a few nights back in beckett ma.\r\ni really wish i wrote down exact time and date like a believer should have but sadly i didn't.  i figured i'd never forget the exact time and all but i have.  but i will never forget what i saw.  it was amazing!  luckily (and maybe oddly) a week later after dropping my mom off at work on a cloudy (again)morning i briefly saw what appeared to be another object but this time it was just 1 but looked similar to the bigger object that i saw before. this time it was flying and disappeared in the clouds.  wish i contacted you guys sooner!  any info would be great.  i have just started looking around and researching to see if there were similar sightings especially in my area.  i hope so! feel free to email me.  thanks for your

at sherman and raymond to get a glimpse of what we were seeing and the cluster of three disappeared but the other one became invisible right before our eyes. at this time there was a large air liner

red/orange objects that appeared to be reflecting light that was actually on the other side of the objects as the sun was setting on the side of the objects that we could not see. there was no

this area has a lot of air traffic, the military flies f-15s at regular intervals, at times, multiple times during the week.  to the north lies blacksburg, va which has a small airport, this airport has various craft from cesnas, twin turboprop beechcraft and can accomendate for citations and leer jets.  forty miles away is a regional airport located in roanoke, va, the craft that operate out of the airport are large commuter planes.\r\nthinking nothing of the large craft overhead as i have seen aircraft at night like that before, i looked to the south and joked if i would see something.  a couple of co-workers have said that they have seen something in the night sky previously the week before last.  \r\ni observed on the horizon a glowing red object, as i watched the object hovered, moved slowly back and forth, then jutted back at an extreme speed.  the object continued to hover slowly changing directions, at this time the objected stopped and moved revealing a second object that went in the opposite direction.\r\nas i watched i tried to call attention to a co worker who was taking break outside with me, asking him to look at what i was watching.  my coworker said,\"yeah, yeah, it's a helicopter\", there was no sound though.  the slow moving aircraft i saw had sound.  i was becoming excited and after a few minutes wrote down notes of what i saw and how it behaved.  \r\nthe sighting lasted for approximately ten minutes and ended as the objects left slowly and disappeared over the horizon.\r\n\r\ni am including a scan of my notes image from google maps of the break area and hill that the object was witnessed and also a short 3d animation of the object as best as i can recreate while my memory is

about most of what i have seen over the years.  however, a day or so afterward, i decided to document this one. \r\nas i was sky watching for meteors i saw a light very high in the sky.  i watched the light come from the east. it was a white light not blinking or anything else.  it appeared to be on the edge of the atmosphere, either inside the atmosphere or just outside. similar to seeing a satellite flying above only much faster.  as i watched it fly across the sky, i saw it turning to the south until i could not see it anymore.  this did not take long from beginning to end.  i have seen satellites before and they do not go through the sky quite that fast. i have seen the space station go through up in the sky and it does not go that fast. satellites, the space station or meteors do not change direction. not sure what it was but it did not seem like anything i have seen before, nor something we have.  i believe the aircraft we have here on earth are required to have a beacon light.  i did not see anything like that on this craft.  i did not have a camera with me.  even if i did i do not think it could have caught the low grade light from the object.  ironically, i had two new marks on my wrist and knee that were all approximately 1/4 inch long and newly scabbed over.  not a deep cut with a heavy scab buy i could feel them when i rubbed my fingers over them.  i can still see the marks on my wrist and knee. the marks on my wrist are approximately 1 1/2 inches apart, and the marks on my knee are approximately 3 inches apart.  i did not scratch myself in these areas.  if it were one point instead of 4 points so similar in size and shape i would not think it was strange.  i took a photo of these a couple of days after i noticed the marks.  i also would think less of these if it were not for the fact i have other scars on my body that have no reason for being there. i have never broken a bone and yet i have a scar on my forearm and on the top of my foot.  i have had strange bruising in the past (at the time i just shrugged off) of four dime size bruises on my upper arm.  all similar in size and spacing. similar to someone pressing my arm with fingertips hard enough to bruise. i have a scar on my left hand between my thumb and forefinger and can feel some sort of object deep under the skin in that area.  \r\ni have no idea if i was ever

this thing in the ski.  2..The reason i looked up in this area is because about 1-2 months earlier i saw this same thing or lite behaving the same way moving very slowly in the ski (same direction),only the first sighting the time was about 1 or so a.M. in the morning. this second sighting the time was about 7:30 pm. or so. when i first noticed it, it wasn't quit all the way dark out yet and you could see something in the ski(not a lite, just an object) by the time i got my phone and started taping, it was getting dark and you can see this lite. the only thing i can think what it was that makes any sense is maybe some gps plane (because i saw it twice in same area behaving the same way) or a ufo. as you can see in the video, its moving very slow. i also have a picture that i took from my droid phone (that is not active in service, i just use it for pics and video) from the time i first saw it, i got in my truck and drove down the street to get a better look at it because the tree tops were blocking it alittle. i pulled in a parking lot and took a pic of it, and a small video. then i drove about 3-4 blocks or so to get a better look at it and that's when i shot the video. you can see the moon next to it in the video. after taking video of it, i left and got something to eat at bk. i drove across the bridge to go back home and i looked up and it was still up there in the ski at around 8:00 pm. in the same area. when i pulled in my driveway back home, looked up and it was gone. i don't know if the pic and videos got uploaded or downloaded (whichever is correct)to this site or not, but i have them on my phone and on my computer. if they didn't, i can try to email them to you. i was able to upload them from my phone to my computer.

visibility.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

back deck and saw what first appeared to be a fireball low in the sky. however upon closer observation, the object was not a fireball as it was traveling in a horizontal path. bright orange triangle shaped object with very bright color. observed object for approx. 1-2 minutes. i called my neighbor to see if they had seen it, and as we were talking, another similiar object flew over in the same path. neighbor's observed the same thing. bright orange triangular object traveling in the same direction. as we talked about the direction, i went out my front door, and saw the third set of exactly the same thing in the sky heading again from sw to ne. neighbors also went into their front yard and followed it. the third object traveled in the same path but lights went out at about the 1:00 position on a clock, after it passed over the neighbors house on the north side, this time much closer. objects were all silent. a small commuter type jet flew approx 2 miles east following the columbia river, but much higher at the same time, so that pilot should have seen the second object as it was directly in front of him, although lower in elevation.","distance":"21-100

few seconds but it looked like it was in front of my face well i changed location on top of a hill in my front yard after i was admiring the strange moving stars as usual win the dull gray object became more visual this time but it appeared much smaller this time and i was facing a different direction in the sky i watched it looked like it was glitching threw the night sky thin it was gone..I have witnessed multiple encounters of strange objects in osgood on multiple occasions i dont under stand how people dont believe something strange is going on in the sky's at night and thin again those people probably never actually pay to much attention or as opened minded as to what is rill happening out in our souler system planes dont just stop in mid flight and vanish.. i mean if we have invited some new technology i would love to be enlighten but in till that happens i will keep looking for unexplained encounters on what i seen and the strange stars that i allows see at night...
