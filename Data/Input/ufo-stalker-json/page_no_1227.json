States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On sunday evening, oct. 6 at 9:00pm, my daughter and i were traveling west  on highway 40 over rabbit ears pass on my way home to steamboat springs area from denver. i had just rounded a corner into a straight-away near buffalo park trail road (there is a small dirt parking lot there that was empty) when i noticed two white lights straight ahead in the distance that i initially thought were venus and another dimmer star to the lower left. all of a sudden the lower white light began to descend and disappeared behind a stand of tall pine trees. it had an erratic path of descent and seemed to wave back and forth rather than just fall straight down.\r\n\r\njust as the smaller white light disappeared, i saw the larger light that i thought was venus begin to grow as it approached rather quickly. at this point i told my daughter to look up and she immediately saw the object as it sped towards us. the growing round white light developed a red border that transitioned in to a solid red red light. as the object approached, i noticed that there was also a blinking light behind it but am not sure if this blinking light was white or red. a very short bright green line had also appeared just below and to the immediate left of the solid red light. the object then slowed and swerved to the right (north) towards our truck. when the object was positioned just to the left in front of us, it dropped in elevation and began to slowly pass overhead.\r\n\r\nas the object slowly moved above us, we could see that the short green line was actually a long flat bright rectangular strip. from the new overhead perspective, this strip extended just a bit in front of the solid red light and stretched quite a bit behind it. my daughter and i both remarked about how crisp and clear the green box angles were and how there was no glow given how bright the green light was. i have previously worked with low powered lasers (<100mw), and would say the green color was exactly at 532nm. there seemed to be some glow from the red light and flashing light in the rear, but we were unable to see any reflections on a craft body or wing/propeller parts--all we could see were the lights. not sure if there was a sound.\r\n\r\ninitially i was unsure of the object's size. as the object was flying towards us, i thought it might be something small like a drone or rc airplane/helicopter because it arrived so fast and its flight path had such quick but smooth directional changes. however, once it was above us, the object slowed considerably--almost to a hover, and we were able to see it clearly before passing underneath. i was traveling between 70-65 mph, so anything small should have zipped right over us. once the object passed out of view above our windshield, we were unable to see it again out the back window or rearview mirrors. my daughter did not want to stop and get a better look.\r\n\r\ni would love to know what your group might think this was, because i have never seen a solid object emit such a bright green light","distance":"101-500

end of the highway. we were in sleeping bags under the stars, no tent.Something woke me up around 3am and right above our heads just above the treeline was a craft moving very slowly from left to right.The treetops were in a circular shape and one third of this craft blocked out the stars. as it slowly moved to the right i saw red and white lights on what seemed like the side of the ship. i could not make out the shape of it.As the rear of the craft passed over us i noticed the rear was lit up. it was sort of oval shaped and  it was very bright and the orange-yellow colors in this oval seemed to move or flicker.After it passed beyond the treeline and out of our sight,i got out of the sleeping bag and ran down a footpath in the same direction as the craft but saw nothing .The whole episode took about a minute or so.It was almost 40 years ago but i remember that minute or so like it was yesterday.One more thing, when i say it was moving slow above the treeline ,it was going no faster than a person taking a very, very slow walk. the humming i mentioned was weird, you could almost feel it as well as hear it.  i spent some time in u.S. air force. i have been around b-52s, b-47s and some fighters of the time ande we had nothing that i know of that could travel almost silently at treetop level going 2 or 3 mph. i will never forget that night.

beach, ca and north laguna beach, ca, my mother observed what looked like an oil driller platform (there are three of them about 10 miles or more north towards huntington beach, ca or long beach, ca. and earlier on the way up to newport beach, ca we were looking out towards catalina island and there was a layer of haze or smog and the mountain tops of catalina were only visable), but as my mom told me to look out over the coast and out toward the ocean to the left about 3 degrees to the left from catalina island and directly as high as the island mountains elevation wise, there was a horizontal platform with nothing under it , my eyes adjusted for about 5 seconds then my brother saw it and noted that it was disturbing the ocean water underneath like a helicopter or a hover craft(which i've seen down in oceanside ,ca marine corps/navy often operate those off the coast) but this was at the same height as the catalina island mountain tops and seemed miles away from me and was bigger than any helicopter or airliner, so 20 seconds after i first saw it from left to right, it disappeared but wasn't instantanious it took a sec and half to disappear(like a windshield wiper), then it was gone for about 15 seconds then reappeared left to right again. at first i thought it was a oil drilling platform thats how far and big it was, then i thought it was a helicopter cause it was hundreds of feet off the ground and was affecting the water below it, like a helicopter(i could see white wash under it, like high winds), then i thought it was a hover craft but it was too far off the ground, and i thought when it disappeared from left to right i thought the helicopter was hovering and rotating and when it disappeared, that was when it was facing me. but after about a minute and 50 seconds all together it disappeared and was never seen again the whole way home. whatever it was, it was big, far away, and wasn't a helicopter or hovercraft, and was bigger than any yacht or sail boat i've ever seen but it was also off the ground and hovering didn't move at all but i was in a moving car so maybe, but i didn't see it move, just disappear, then reappear, then disappear again and it was gone the white wash under it was gone, and my whole family was dumbfounded...3 of my family saw it the driver didn't get to see it but when i described it to him he said thats not a helicopter or boat or hover craft. it looked cigar shaped, really long and narrow like a platform.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

outside watching what appeared to be a satellite making its way from the south sky to the north, when all three of us at the same time saw out of our peripheral what first appeared as a circular grouping of birds surrounded in a fog, flying very fast. within seconds it was obvious they weren't birds as we all noticed the circular formation was pretty much a near perfect grid with a few around the sides that  kept it from being a perfect circle.  in no more than 10 seconds at very low altitude, the cluster flawlessly formed a v shape, and then again, flawlessly went into a straight line (side by side) formation, all at very high speed, and all silently of course. our \"low altitude\" field of view, staring straight up with obstructions was approximately 1-2 miles. i would guess 600 mph or greater at no more than a few thousand feet. we all agree that they weren't really lit up, but more like reflections of horizon and ground light. almost transparent looking. i was obviously amazed and at the same time very disturbed at what we saw. basically this \"other worldly\" synchronized night formation flying was a display of power and precision beyond a critical thinkers comprehension. made me realize in that moment we are no match for what flew over. magnificent and frightening all in a few seconds. i would consider this one a life altering event. holy smokes!! or as

my deck,starting about june of 2012,most recently starting about jan 2013,the number of these objects have increased rom 1-2 to as many as 4-5.They appear out of no where below the line of star up above,it starts as a faint dim light and develops into a round pulsating ball of light of flashing red lights on the top,bright white gold light in the middle with green,blue on the bottom.With binoculars,the lights appear to spin,dip and dive  and make sharp sudden turns in a holding pattern,with the binoculars,the lights seems to be still.On oct.3.2013, a large huge bright light froms in the sw sky and hoovers at about 7:45pm,the other flashing round objects seems to form at different time frames.The bright light fades in brightness at about 9:15pm,begins to pulse in the colors of red on the top,gold in the center with blue-green on the bottom,and fades to blackness by 9:20pm.The other lights begin to also fade in brightness and are all gone by 10pm.Ther has been an episode in 2012,when a huge basketbakk size orange glowing light appeared thur the trees and popped otout above the the tops of the tres and hoover for a few minutes and floated across the sky toward the east and disappeared.I had no idea as to what the objects were,maybe a star,but i was able to see the object form from a small black dim spot into a round ball of a flashing colored object.I felt no fear,very interested as to what it was and to why oit appears to form at the same time same place evening.Maybe a star coming out,but the surrounding stars are completely w/o any behaviours of the flashing balls of light and the stars donot flash,spin around,dip and dive across a small area of space at a very quick pace.I first began to see these object as a flash of light in the corner of my eyes.I was sooo concerned about the flashing of light in my eyes,i saw my eye care dr.Who told me my eyes were ok with a good eye exam.I didn not tell him i was seeing flashing balls of light in the

class arrived for the day's fun sliding the slide and having fun with other school kids that were there also on a class trip.Myself and some of my classmates became bored so we decided to make our own fun.We scaled a fence to another section of the playground,there we came upon a swimming pool area.In this new area we can see that the pool haven't been used in years there was so many leaves in the pool that it's color was dark green.We began throwing rocks in the pool until we again became bored,so we scaled another fence.This new area put us out in the park there was a pathway to our right,as we began to walk down pathway i heard a female voice from behind me say \"stop children\". when i looked back there was this \"green lady\" hanging from this tree,when she came out of the tree i can see that she had scaly skin like a lizard,her shin had a design pattern which covered her from top to bottom,as if her skin was also her clothes.She walked on 2 feet and she had a small slit for a mouth.When she spoke to us we can hear her in our heads,her mouth never opened or moved.We hot tailed it back over the fences and i have never been back.I can not remember all my classmates that was there.After 30yrs of questions i found 1 classmate that remember this incident,there were probably 5-6 of us.Also thru some research i found an article from the times daily-google news archive dated 10/6/1959 which describes an incident about a green lady chasing school children with a knife.This does not fit the description nor the same green lady that appeared to us.I witnessed something truly amazing and out of this world.I feel very blesses to have experience this and truly lucky that i can finally share my story with professional people instead of the non believers.\r\n  ","distance":"20
