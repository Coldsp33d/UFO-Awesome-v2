because of their quick, 90 and 45 degree direction changes. they would freeze and then all move again. i first thought it could be satellites, but i've seen them in orbit before and they just move in one direction across the sky, not stop, reverse, then freeze and repeat. 7 orbs all at once, this made me ponder. the 7 objects were already on the move when i notice them, as i notice them they froze, which i thought was odd. i continued to observe, all 7 then move to different locations in the sky as a cluster then froze again and again, this repeated 3 times then they remained stationary for 5 minutes then they all disappeared. this incident clearly had an affect on me as i've remembered it all these years, i would like answers for it. i am mostly confused by what i witnessed that day

having a smoke, talking about our work days, and out of the corner of my fiancee's eye, over the roof, a round, glowing orange object, making no sound whatsoever, moving slowly, appeared and she yelled for me to turn around. i saw the object as it was descending and we both ran to the railing astonished, as this was the exact same object we had seen in the area two years before (we filed a report then too in the same area and we had 2 other witnesses to that sighting... ) i had my phone with me and hit the zoom and snapped a picture of the object as it was descending behind the tree line over our neighbor's house. the picture sucks, showing only a pinprick of orange light, but that's not what it looked like to the naked eye, but while i was intent on focusing the camera, my fiancee saw a small white round glowing object drop out of the bottom of the orange sphere and then it descended low enough to be obscured by the trees.  it was 9:00 pm est when we first saw it, the camera phone shot will have the time and date stamped on it and we will upload it for what it's worth.  at exactly 9:20 pm est, the object reappeared above the same tree and and it was smaller, and looked much farther away then during our first sighting.  we ran out into the front yard, hoping for a less obscured viewing but the trees that line our street prevented us from even seeing it amidst the branches.  we both tried to guestimate how large it was, using the plane that was passing by, higher and over the object by about 4 inches in the sky (we live by lunken airport and are familiar with planes landing and taking off) and since we aren't experts or pilots, have no frame of reference to judge exactly how high it was in the sky. the plane was a few millimeters long, with the usual flashing beacon light and it was probably on it's way away, and the plane had taken off from lunken as it was ascending and silent and this object was a golf ball size in comparison... and the plane was silent, and the object was too and it dwarfed the size of the plane so we're not sure how high either one was since there was no sound.  we had a sighting like this, exactly like this unidentified glowing orange sphere, but that object we saw and reported, split into two smaller orange spheres but this one did not... so we are basically speechless that we are seeing the same exact thing once again, without the splitting, at about the same time of year from 2 years ago.  since we saw the first one two years ago, we were careful to at least get the exact time and we are hoping that anyone else in the area who saw the same thing will report. i called my fiancee's mom who lives only a few miles away so she could run out and look up in the sky to see if she saw it, but she did not see it (her neighborhood is hilly and older with lots of trees as well) we have run through all the possibilities of what conventional or explainable object could appear and hover, then keep moving but we still, like the first sighting, cannot think of what it could be. it was not flares, it was not a hot air balloon, it is not a night-time blimp, and we don't think it was a remote-controlled device due to it's size and the way it moved. it was too slow to be any of those we are guessing and obviously we ruled out meteorite, because we have seen videos of those etc. if it's possible to file a foa request at lunken airport for the radar tower asap, we would highly recommend you do so if at all possible, since we know your office is there and that would be awesome! i stopped in to chat one day and i remember how you told me that you have to be quick in doing the foa filing, so that is why i am reporting it directly after the event.  i am dying to know what this is and if there is a logical explanation i would love to know! if you would call me, and tell me how to file for the foa file from the radar tower, i will do the leg work just to satisfy my curiosity!!! please don't hold the photo against this report, it's truly terrible, we know that!!  we scoff at similar photos but it's all we have!  thanks for all you do mufon!

moving in a straight away direction right before it faded away from sight. right out of the first bit of dispersment came out another brightly lit orb headed straight down. this one did not disperse anything. then once again right before i lost view of it behind a tree a third started moving upward then crossing right over the sky. at the same time as this happening ...The kids pointed out an

bedroom has a five foot wide window that offers an excellent view of the lower land and the night sky.  most nights i sleep with the curtains opened so i can see the sky.  i planned to read before i slept. a minute or two later while arranging my pillows so i could read, i saw a light just above the horizon.  the sky was solid dark gray clouds.  beneath, the trees in back of my house formed a corridor to the visible horizon. i thought the light was a star.  i remembered i hadn't made a wish on a star for many years so i quoted the childhood twinkle, twinkle little star, etc. and made a wish. after a few moments of observing the tiny light i realized it was moving toward me.  at first, i thought it was a small airplane then as the light grew larger i thought it was a helicopter.  as it got closer i realized it was not an aircraft.  it was a ufo and unlike anything i had seen before.  i was mesmerized and delighted to see it.  it continued in a straight line until it was halfway between me and the horizon. before me was a yellow and gold glowing sphere around whose edges was what appeared to be a shifting transparent energy field of red and blue.  there was a gentle, comfortable energy that i could feel and i was at peace and happy.  it was like meeting a friend one hadn't seen in a long time.  the path of the ufo was upward from a horizon considerably lower than the top of the hill where i live.  it came straight toward my house.  it got more brilliant in light/energy.  it began to ascend and came nearer and nearer.  i had a feeling that its path was intentional and not willy nilly nor unplanned.  at one point i felt that i was somehow part of it.  it was getting so close i couldn't believe it.  i thought happily to myself, \"it's going to go right over the house!\"  wrong.  no sooner did i think that than it veered sharply to its right - my left - and behind treetops disappearing entirely at the edge of my window.  i felt sadness temporarily and then gratitude that i had see the ufo. the event lasted about ten minutes.

tropical storm karen cover the whole sky. i was looking at a small airplane flying under cloud ceiling and with small blinking red and white light in what appeared to be an approach course from the south toward the miami international airport. i notice this very bright sphere of light just bigger that an aspirin but smaller that a penny as it broke the cloud ceiling to the left of the airplane but not close to it. right away i felt it was a ufo, i have previous military training to identified aircrafts. the object broke the cloud ceiling in a 20 degree angle, corrected to 45 for lest than a second and change to 20 again to go into the clouds. reappear again doing a similar maneuver to go back in to the clouds. i got up right away and looked to see if i could see it further down in the direction that was heading but it did not appear again. only the small airplane that i observe before could be seen. the speed was fast, faster that the airplane but not blinding fast. i felt that either the object broke cloud cover by mistake or in purpose since it did the same maneuver twice. my wife got home just minutes after, i told her what i just saw. she described my face as surprise and awe. i lost sight as the object went into cloud cover the second time.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path
