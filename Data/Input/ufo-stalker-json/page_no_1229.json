chat before he leaves for work.\r\ni was sitting facing away from the house, and noticed the triangle gliding by above his head and yelled......\"look at that, look at that\". he immediately looked up and saw it.\r\ni knew that it wasn't anything i'd ever seen before, ergo my yelling for my brother to look at it.\r\nthe object was approximately 300 feet out from the side of the house and approximately 100 feet above the treetop.  it glided by quickly and soundlessly from west to east. the shape was a perfect triangle with approximately 6-7 evenly spaced lights on all three sides aiming down (not on the sides of the craft). they were perfectly round and glowed hazy white.  the craft was approximately 90-100 feet long.\r\nat first we were trying to think of anything else it could be, but we both knew what we had seen. there are only about four people i shared this with because they know me well and wouldn't question what i saw.\r\nbelieve it or not, we were both calm and mesmerized and i had an incredibly peaceful feeling afterward.\r\nunfortunately the craft was in sight 4-5 long seconds.....It was low over the treetops and we lost sight of it. there was no sense trying to run out to the street for a better look because it was moving too fast.\r\nwe both know what we saw. i've not been able to find pictures on any site that matches this.  please ......It was not birds or a plane. planes absolutely wouldn't fly that low...And they would have been heard a long way. my eyesight is 20/20 and i can hear well.\r\nto be honest......We're happy with the knowledge that we've observed this object.  most people aren't that fortunate.\r\nof course i didn't have a camera at 6am having coffee on the patio....And even if i did, turning it on and finding the object within a second would have been impossible.  that is my only regret.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

that everything was surreal is the best way i can describe it and i had gone to let my dog out into the garden to do his toilet before locking the house down for the night and i had walked around the back of my house to keep an eye on him when suddenly i saw what looked like a huey helicopter the kind that you tend to see in films about vietnam and with a door gunner except it was transparent as it was bright orange and gave off the bright orange light and looked as if it had no tail and made no sound at all and was hovering at first and then started to fly over head as it did so at one point it was on a level with me where i could see through it and could see what looked like a piolet in a white helmet and a green flying suit like raf piolets wear and in the position that would of been wear a door gunner would of been standing was what looked like another human man but with either a dark navy blue type uniform on or black and it resembled the uniform like what a british police officer would wear but with no helmet or cap and it flew then over head with no sound at all going slowly at first but then picking up speed and going faster than i know that any helicopter could ever fly or any fighter jet as i am ex raf i am fully aware what speeds such aircraft that we have can achieve as it picked up speed and in only a few seconds it flew over several miles away and stopped and began to hover and i think the one entity that was in the door gunner position had seen me as it suddenly changed direction and started to come back towards me but only came back about a quarter of the distance it had flown away from me and then stopped and hovered for a little longer and then headed back to the point it had reached when it had flown away from me the first time and then went at a 90 degree angle too its flight path and shot off at great speed vanishing from my line of sight in only seconds covering many miles far faster than any jet could achieve i only wish i could be lucky and see this or any other ufo again while i have a camera handy though so i could get proof and not just have a simple story and description of the event and what i saw as i would love to see and communicate with any alien or aliens if that is what they are and what i saw all dates and times are only approximate as i did not know who to report it to or if there was anyone to report it to and did not wish to be ridiculed or make people think i was seeing things as i do haver terminal cancer and am aware that some of the drugs i am on can cause halucinations at times but my doctors have assured me that this would not be the case now as i have been taking the drugs i need and use for far too long to have this type of thing happening to me now and if i was going to be halucinating it would of occured at the very start of taking the drugs i need and use to combat the cancer i have and this ufo that i saw had no tail that i could see so had no tail rotor nor did it have any main rotor blades overhead to keep it in the air and made no sound at all when flying and hovering over head at any time and i am used to the sound of helicopters and other engines from normal aircraft and helicopters and often see and hear the local police helicopter flying over head and around the area so i know it was not any kind of helicopter or any other type of conventional aircraft that i am familiar with be it civilian or military and this aircraft had no other lights that other aircraft use for navigation purposes and to show and let other piolets in the area know that the aircraft is about and in what direction it is travelling nor did it have any kind of anti collison light under neath it or any other lights that i could see and the orange light that it was giving off did not seem to have any natural source that i could see or make out such as a bulb or a spot light or search light or any other kinds of lights of any kind internally or externally and it just looked like a ball of orange light that surrounded the whole craft and no engines or any moving parts of any kind could be seen just the crafts shape and one occupant seated in what would be the piolets position as the craft being transparent you could not even see the seat the piolet was sitting in but you could see that the piolet was seated in some kind of seat and the other occupant was just standing in what apperead to be the door gunners position and was not seated at all yet the manouvers that the craft was performing did not seem to affect this occupant that was standing and nothing could be seen that would be holding him in or keeping him held upright such as a safety harness or similar items that would be worn by someone if they were standing in this position to prevent them falling out of the aircraft if the doors were open or that they could hold onto to remain upright if and when the aircraft banked or made any other kind of manouver which would in normal circumstances make it impiossible for a normal person to remain on there feet without holding onto something or having some kind of harness to stop them from falling        ","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet
