do. i have a swing set in the sw corner\r\nof my yard and i walked toward it when a movement caught my eye and i looked up toward the sw and saw something coming toward me in the sky. i had no idea what it was. at first i thought it was only one object but as it got a little closer i saw 3 objects. one was in the front and the other 2 were in the back forming a triangle formation. they were all the same \r\ndistance apart from each other, say 20-30 feet and did not seem to be connected. they were about 100 to 150 feet off the ground moving at about 25mph toward the ne. i remember thinking that i possibly could have hit them with a 12 gauge shotgun since i use to hunt when younger. i also thought that their shape, as well as i could make out, was like a wooden whiskey barrel or wine barrel about the size of a 55 gallon drum in a horizontal (not vertical) position. they came from the sw which is the direction of new orleans international airport only about 1 1/2 miles away\r\nwhich i thought was very odd. afterwards i thought did they \"launch\" it or see it? they had no wings, blades, balloons, lights, or sound. they passed directly over me. then i yelled to my stepson to come quick to see \r\nit and he came out of the house quickly and i pointed toward the northeast\r\nsince they had just passed over me and he said \"i see it.\" seconds later it was out of sight. they did not appear metallic and i did not or could \r\nnot see any markings. i have never seen anything like this before and could not understand what was powering it. at that time i did not have a computer and i just let it go. having a computer now i found this reporting site and decided to submit this information to you because my \r\ncuriosity would like to know what i saw if possible. it may have a simple explanation that i am just not aware of. \r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

around 8:20-8:30pm october 10th, 2017.  driving south down robinson rd., looking left to the east towards rosa flora greenhouses, i was looking at the wind turbine in the orange light of the greenhouses and the thick fog. i noticed a blimp-like shape \"hovering\" about 50-200 feet from the top of the wind turbine.  it was the colour of the fog and light given off by the greenhouses but i could see a definite ovalish blimp outline against the farm light.  \r\ni was travelling at about 90km/hr and slowed to 40 or 50kms/hr once i noticed the shape in the fog.  it gave off no sound and had no lights, no planes or stars where out or visible at the time and as i slowed the van it moved away from the wind turbine heading north, northeast slowly.  \r\nonce it was away from the light of the greenhouses i lost sight of the outline and it disappeared into the dark.\r\nmy first thought was that it may be somekind of drone or i was seeing the odd side of a plane or something that was being used at the farm but it was too big it seemed, and again, had no lights.  as i drove on i wasn't sure at all at what i saw and tried to explain to myself what it was... i couldn't think of anything.  i thought by now, four days later, i'd have forgotten about it but it's stuck with me.  couldn't think of who to tell other than my parents and finally decided to report it.  i've been driving the same route every day since and haven't seen anything else.  and nothing that's even close to the wind turbine.\r\n\r\nnot sure what to make of it.  i feel fine.  curious as a cat but feel

flying over weekly and monthly but this object was different. the shiny disc had no tail section that i could see at its far distance.It was reflecting sunlight off its silvery body. it was travelling quite fast from the west and, from northwest of me to northeast of me. it was moving earthward during its course at a very slight angle. then , i was surprised to see a second shiny disc object approaching the first one from above and behind . i thought maybe it was 2 fighter jets joining up or on a close collision course. then, the second object leveled off beside and slightly above the first disc as they both continued eastward parallel to each other and disappeared beyond and behind the trees lining my high bank side of the st. joseph river.I am a freelance photographer and only

(i'm pretty good with the height , because there is a mountain across the lake from the sighting.)so i thought to myself that the green light was the starboard running light of a military jet taking a close look at this cluster of colored balls of light frozen over the other side of the lake....\r\n  and now here is the reason i thought you guys might be interested.....\r\nthese lights just blinked out, so i told my wife about the killer ufo i had seen (she said \"another one...That's nice.)all night we had gusts of wind up to 80 mph and fires broke out all over the place...Including the \"sulpher\" fire directly below where the cluster had been hovering the night before !

(which opens out towards the south) and i noticed an incredibly brilliant red, pulsating, circular, very large craft!  it was night time with a dark, practically, cloudless sky, and the craft looked like it was hovering near the western slope of the n. cheyenne mt. canyon.  we can see the will roger's shrine when directly looking in this direction, so - the red craft was above the level of the shrkne, diagonally, to the upper right from the shrine.  also, i noticed a bright white orb, that was in front of the very left side of the craft, illuminating, this white orb, also, would turn off in front of our very eyes & then back on again, on that left side, also.  this orb, in size, appeared, to be the same height as the craft...Okay, so then i say to chris, who was sleeping - ^you won't believe this! i've never seen anything like this before!\"  so, chris, got up & came to the front door - he was astonished, too! this thing was huge!  chris says, \"over 300 feet.\"  now, we are looking directly south from our third floor apartment window @the very top of 21st street!  we have the grand, panoramic, bird's eye view, here!  chris saw exactly as i just described above\r\nwe both witnessed this white orb, that was over in front of the craft, to the left, take off, heading west (to the right) from the craft, and just before it did that, we noticed a red orb that was just behind it. so,in fact,what happened rather quickly was - as that white orb was shooting out towards the west, the red orb (that was right behind it) shot out to the east.  it looked as if we were 'in on' some type of 'operation/routine,' that appeared well organized,'symmetrical' & 'streamlined.' both of these orbs headed in opposite directions from each other (the white orb heading west and the red orb heading east).  the orb heading west, appeared, to go out just about only far as the canyon and then returned back to the craft in a smooth gliding, speedy line into the right side of the craft.  then the red orb,that headed east from the craft, then smoothly glided, just like the white orb did, into the left side of the craft.  also, the red orb, would also turn to white - so it seemed confusing at first about how many orbs (because of the one that would turn from red to white), however, it appeared to be only 2 orbs.  they were at equal height & proximity from each other when they were on either side of the craft from each other & heading in those opposite directions - it could of been described as a 'highly synchronized ballet.'\r\n\r\nchris & i watched this type of activity go on until about 21:50 mst (aprox. 20 min.).  at the very end, and chris had just stepped away from the window, and this craft started to really pulsate with the bright red light, almost some orange here & there - i couldn't believe it - it turned into a cross in the sky 'literally'right before my very eyes!  chris, just happened at the wrong time, when he stepped away - and, yes, chris was taking a video, but he may of missed this.  so, what i saw of this extremely, red, pulsating cross in the sky, that it turned into in front of my very eyes, as i couldn't believe what i was seeing, as it seemed surreal!  there were many white  windows in a row in both directions of the cross. it was pulsating so intensely, as it was changing into the cross, and a circle of red light illuminating around it and then it went black, like it disappeared.  saw no vapor.  i don't remember seeing the 2 orbs anymore, but i'm pretty sure that i saw a smallish white light (not as bright as the white orb) and that - was exactly on the top of that mountain, in the very center, above the will river's shrine, and to the right of the bank of the tall, red, antennas.\r\n\r\nthat is all.\r\n\r\nbarb & chris\r\n\r\nattachments:  video & photos.\r\n\r\nplease contact me as i have concise colored pencil drawings of what it looked like as a cross.  i just can't seem to get this file over to you and it's very important!!!
