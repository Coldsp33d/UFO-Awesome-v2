he laughed and said no, you are the first. well he wanted to know if i have had anything to drink? which i replied, i do not drink or do drugs. so he sent me 2 patrol cars out to investigate if i was a deranged person. upon the arrival of the 2 patrolman we did not talk much for they were in ah over the sight of the ufo's. we picked out 5 that we could see around our small town and also around my farm home. no one could explain what we witnessed but the officers did agree, they were ufo's. the time now was about 1 am when they left and i went to bed. but, if those officers were non-believer before they talked with me. they definitely believed when they left. i told them that the activity starts around 9-10 pm when they are the closest to the town. we will be looking up again tonight and into the following night to see this wonderest event.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"03:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":51260,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.8211845,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10022013-0005","longitude":-91.1391977,"occurred":1380515400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1380730021000,"summary":"Large ufo hovered over the city of warrenton,mo.","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"63383","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2,"locationName":"Warrenton, Missouri","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:245747"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Washington","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"For the last three years i have done a lot of research on nibiru along with several other topics. i spent a lot of time this summer up in the mountains camping,taking pictures and videos in the mountains and at home. there have been on numerous occasions that i have experienced things that i can't explain, or for that matter don't understand why i able to see the things that i have seen. but i can tell you that i have communicated with something that looked human to me but was accompanied by five other grays. the human looking girl acknowledged to me that she was with the grays as she was holding hands with one of the grays.It was not a threatening experience that i had, i would have to say they were friendly and did not try to harm me in any way. i have got many more amazing pictures and videos that i will show you and go into further detail about when you contact me.

ascend from the lake area over the trees, i cannot say if they came from the lake itself but, i did see them ascend from the trees in that direction and travel silently in a south easterly direction. one of the first objects traveled west and i lost sight of it. i witnessed one other object last night ascending from the same area and traveling in the same south easterly direction. some of the objects appeared first as a single light changing color and then additional lights were flashing like it was a small helicopter however none of the objects made any noise that i could detect. the dogs in the area were not barking. please see the videos. i will post more of these sightings if they continue to occur. note: i also witnessed an orange/red fireball ascending towards my home from the

my husband was with me and saw it as well.  we decided to video it and look at it through binoculars.  the same pulsing ball as before on the video but it looked like it could be multiple lights through the binoculars.  we went to our second floor to get a better look and that's where we saw it move slowly up and down and back and forth.  it would dip below the tree line and come back up.  eventually it went down so far that we could no longer see it.  i am not sure what we saw, and being that i've seen it a few times it could be nothing...But i figured it was strange enough maybe

observation and thinking and discussing the sun and planets and galaxies.  as we lay on the top of my jeep very comfortably we both watched and talked about the sky.  we pondered if a certain star was venus.  we pondered how our sun looks from other planets.  we pondered how earth looked in our galaky.  we talked about the speed of light and how amazing it is, how it humurously sparkles at us.  we witnessed shooting stars that were blurry....Quite a few...So we made it a mission to lay there for about an hour or so as we viewed the night sky hoping to see more shooting stars.  i joked that the shooting stars we wwere seeing were unusual, faded..So i wondered maybe it was due to the clear night and they were very far away.  i joked were they meteorites...Or aliens???Haha...Because who knows what form an alien might present itself.  we saw a few planes fly by....Then awed at a helicopter.  none too close together.  as we lay there i remember her directing my attention to this misty movement asking what is that?  almost directly 75 degrees in front of us...In a very regular vision field.  i could not answer.  it was moth like shape....Triangular bust seemed to have more points.  with appx 5 dull lights at its points.  maybe they seemed to pulsate,. but they were faint.  i wondered if it might be a stealth bomber with its lights off as it resembled having some sort of star like camoflauge...Knowingt that was unlikey..  it seemed very high in altitude...And moved so quickly i could compare it to moving 5-10 times faster than any the other two planes or any other plane ive ever seen.  it did not make a single noise.  as it continued in a straight path across the sky and our eyes both followed and heads turned watching and wondering, it slowly began to fade out of view  (which i am not sure most people could see, we both have exquisite vision, and she was surprised i could see what she was describing, she thought she was imagining , and i reassured no she hadnt been imagining)  we were both sober, and clear headed.  just observers.  i couldnt help but think it might be some military item, and i joked that if the military had craft like that, then we are really amazing.  i witnessed it a few moments longer than she, as it faded out of sight.  i begged for it to return in my mind, but to no avail.  i remember discussing past strange sightings in my life prior to seeing this happen, but none were this intriguing....Or defined.  or shared.  i can remember laughing at a certain constellation of stars in the distance saying look how they sparkle unlike the rest...Their must be life there!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line
