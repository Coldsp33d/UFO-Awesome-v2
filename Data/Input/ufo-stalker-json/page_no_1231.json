(imagine seeing the pleides only twice the size, then zipping across the sky in 3 or 4 seconds on a flat trajectory. that is exactly what it looks like)\r\n\r\nmy initial reaction was probably a jaw drop and then i pointed and said, \"look!\". it was almost gone by then but my gf got scared and wanted to go inside. i did notice that when it fades away that it doesn't get closer to the horizon. it just stays on a flat trajectory and then fades from view. my initial thought was it was a cluster of stealth bombers (yes, that was my initial thought) because that was the only thing that could have been low enough to move across the sky that fast and not have flashing lights or be heard. but, after research and asking friends, it seems stealth bombers are very loud and there was perfectly silent. after going over the experience in my head many times, it seems the lights were much too high for it to have been that. and although it's hard to explain, there was just something too eerie and 'inhuman' about it. too fast, too quiet, no blinking lights, no hard shape.\r\n\r\nmy gf is also very intelligent, rational person and was really frightened after seeing it. after going inside, i wanted to confirm what we both saw, so i asked her to logically explain what it was and she had no answer. \"was is a satellite?\" -no. \"was it a jet?\" -no. \"was it a meteorite?\" -no.\r\n\r\nsummary\r\nthe other 2 experiences were nearly identical. each time has been between 10pm-1am in the summer. same light formation, same silence but extreme speed across the sky. very

earlier i had been commenting on how clear the sky was.  i kept looking up today wondering about the cme reported and looking for chem planes.  i could not believe it.  i was so stunned at first, somewhat mesmerized.  my teenage daughter was with me as i had just picked her up from class.  i started yelling, \"what is that omg, what is that??? look, look!!\" she said she didn't see any thing.  i turned her head slightly as it was above us but also right in front of us.  she was like, \"i don't know, i think it's a balloon\"  then it shot up and west. she said, \"that is not a balloon!\"  the light had changed and people were honking.  it was a very busy intersection and i couldn't believe people weren't looking up.  we were heading west and i kept trying to keep track of it.  it shot around; zig-zagged when it was right in front of us again it went from clear to silver to clear and sometimes iridescent;  with tails or tentacles hanging from it...They were light green, purple and pink..Maybe yellow.  i was trying to find a place to pullover when it shot up.  i pulled into what we call \"the bus barn\"; where public school buses are parked.  it came back toward us and just hovered. it eventually just disappeared.  it was there and then it was gone!   i got a still shot of it which only looks like a bright object.  you can barely make out the tentacles, but you can see them if you enlarge it. i also have a very short video. i was just aiming the camera at this point because i could not see it through the lens of my phone.   i waited several hours before i sent it to my computer.  when i watched the video i could not believe it! there was a second object; long cigar shaped that flew by at such a rapid speed i did not even see it with my naked eye.  it may have been some light reflection from somewhere but i had my phone/camera out the window; window was down.  i sent a message to local weather station.  they asked for the pic but have not responded.  i have to know, was this just a weather balloon?  was the second object some light reflection?  most importantly, i cannot stop thinking about it.  it did not look like a space \"craft\".  it looked like an actual being itself.  also, i am extremely irritable tonight and just want to be left alone.  almost like the very presence of someone else is extremely annoying.  i feel like i've had some kind of experience and believe me...I have never believed in et's.  i saw something else recently too on sept. 6th.  i have only been looking to the skies in anticipation of ison.  oh! and shortly after it was gone and we were driving home, there were very low flying planes; not just small engine planes but a jet as well.  the jet was headed south and was still west of us.  weather balloon?  please tell me!  if you watch the video, watch full screen.  i didn't see the second object until i had it on full screen which also makes me think it was a digital anomaly.  thank you!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

orange glow.\r\n  when the third one disappeared as the others had, we scanned the skies but did not see any more. i noticed on your map that reports say 5 to 8 of these were seen in the ny/nj area so maybe we caught the tail end of the sightings.\r\n  i thought is was very cool and i was excited. my husband went right to the computer when we got home, which was only three blocks away from where we saw them, and googled \"orange orbs in the sky\". several youtube videos came up of very similar sightings to what we saw. i will be watching tonight to see if they return.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

hands with's above the horizon until i noticed that one of the flashing lights was blue. it was the brightest non-moon object in the sky. the sky was clear with no clouds at any altitude. observed with binoculars but was unable to tell shape of object. i asked my fiance what colors she was observing and confirmed red, yellow, green, white and blue. object remained stationary for 45 minutes cycling colors randomly. the lights at times seemed directional at times sphere-like at times rectangular/cigar-shaped or a cross as its aspect changed. it was too distant to see a superstructure with any clarity even with 8 power binoculars. observed two aircraft (red/white navigation lights at much less intensity than the object).  one traveled south at a relatively high rate of speed towards the object and then banked right and traveled quickly out of view to the west. another traveled north along the horizon at relatively high rate of speed to the east of the object about ten minutes later. total time of observing the aircraft was approximately one minute per observation. given time of night and nature of flight patterns i speculate that they were air national guard from burlington, vt. i attempted to take a video but the camera-phone was less than ideal, it is shaky and i upset a sleeping bird.\r\n\r\nstopped viewing for about ten-15 minutes at the 45 minute mark approximately. returned to the window and saw that the original light had moved west and was partially obscured by a tree limb.  the observed several lights, originally thought to be stars but noticed they flickered.  binoculars showed the same light emission patterns.  there were 5 additional lights arranged roughly north to south with varying intensity due to distance with two advanced farther to the west forming a roughly l shape, though i believe there was a salient in the formation as the dimmest and closest to the horizon object was not the tip of the l..  the lights maintained this formation and drifted slowly west until they were obscured by a tree. total time observed was approximately 1 hour with a break.\r\n\r\ni have observed aircraft in this area for thirty years and have seen all manner of usaf and commercial aircraft at night as there was a air force base here formerly.  i have observed helicopters and i believe a drone in the area as well at night.  these lights were unlike anything i have seen in the night sky. i can't explain what i saw, i do not believe in extra terrestrials and i can see no rational reason for any craft to use lights in this fashion. nevertheless, we saw what we saw even if it defies explanation.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

direction from my home.  i pointed it out to my 20 yr old son. it seemed to be glowing cherry red and then slowing changed to a bright orange color.  we took the dogs back inside and we both came out with my nikon binoculars (10x50).  \r\nwhen we came back outside, we had momentary lost the object, but after a few second, noticed that it had went below the tree-line and is now raising back to the initial altitude above the tree/house line.\r\ni noticed that a fast corporate jet had just flown over my house (probably taken off from st.Pete airport and there was another commerical jet south bound at a higher altitude.\r\ni was able to focus in on both of those jets and see the individual lights onboard clearly.  but, when i focused on the bright red object, it just showed up as a bright sphere.  it was so bright that it seemed to have a 'aura or halo\" around it.  it seemed to slowly change from a bright red to a bright orange and then a bright yellow in color.\r\nwe both watched it change from a westerly upward direction to a southern directtion, it seemed to be a dull yellowish color as it flew southward and out of site within 15-20 seconds.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

degrees above the horizon. the light appeared to be about three lights bunched together of which one was extremely bright, altogether much larger than any star. at first i thought that it was an aircraft turning from a northerly to a westerly direction with its landing light on. the bethlehem airport is located to the south of us. i soon realised that it was not turning but slowly moving northwards but also dropping at the same time. at around this time i also noticed the flashing light of an aircraft mush higher in the sky about 85 degrees above the horizon more to the south. i failed to notice in which direction the aircraft was moving (south to durban or north to johannesburg). the bright light then suddenly developed a cloud around it, at first small but gradually grew in size. the cloud was a perfect circle but appeared out of focus, the centre of which contained the light, now not so large but still focused and fairly bright. i went into the house fetched my reading glasses and my wife. we watched a while before i fetched my cell phone and took some photo's in which the round cloud is visible but nothing defined can be seen. the cloud around the light appeared to flatten out at the bottom when it reached about 10 degrees above the horizon, at this point east from us. the cloud and light disappeared as it became obstructed by the tree top and houses.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
