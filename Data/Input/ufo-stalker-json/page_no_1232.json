tail, or larger end.  see pics and vid.  my wife observed it at this point with binoculars, and agreed it was brighter than any star, was not moving, and was definitely not an airplane. we decided to drive down our hill to the bottom at street level, and could see the object in the sky, stationary , brighter than anything in the sky, and observed it with binoculars for 40 min. it began to get dark, and the object was aspirin size in the sky, brighter than any star that began to appear. not being able to see any defined shape, we figured it was very large and very far away, as the shape was not definite as an airplane would be through the same binoculars. i had to field a phone call and when i came out the object was gone. i took a hd video which somewhat shows a shape, a a couple vids

davenport, iowa, my brother, cousin, and their 2 friends witnessed a \"ufo sighting\" over the port luisa wildlife refuge.  we had witnessed the unidentifiable object early in the morning while standing on our deck that overlooks the lake and a large part of the refuge.  it appeared quite obviously to us, looking similarly to a ball of light changing shape and size, direction, color, and appearing and disappearing in wildly frequent scattered patterns.  it sounded like helicopter blades chopping at the air but gave no visual or even slight other hint that it behaved as a helicopter would let alone anything else commonly seen in today's skies.  \r\nas you will notice in the video, the object does not move or act as any object, flying or not, would in today's world.  it seems to move erratically through the sky and mostly materialize from one spot in the sky to another in an instant.  if you slow the video down, you can even see the apparent light from the ufo changing shapes and moving in a spiral motion often changing the direction of the spiral as it appears from one spot to another.\r\nwhile watching, it was very apparent from the start that this was something that was out of the ordinary which was what first lead our attention to it.  we all just kept trying to explain to ourselves what it was.  it was very exciting and yet mysterious.  we knew we were seeing and experiencing something truly rare and out of the ordinary.  eventually, (not included in the video), we stopped filming and just gazed in wonder as it didn't appear to be catching anything on the phones we were recording on.  the object appeared much greater in size, shape, detail, and various colors than it appears on the video taken from a cell phone (the only way we could document at the given moment).  it kept getting closer and closer and it worried us all a bit.  we chose to go inside but once we started walking to go back inside it seemed to get closer and closer.  we were all shaken up by this and chose to stay inside and not document or view this object any further due to it's mysterious nature and our questions of its intent was and if it had known that it was being observed by us.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:40:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,  Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

more amazed when it either reduced in size or simply had turned to what appeared to be due north.  it took a trajectory of what appeared to be directly at an airplane flying south.  when the paths of the plane and the object crossed - it was the first time i realized that the object was already at a much higher altitude and that the object was moving at a speed that left me stunned.  i mean...Literally stunned!  it was a crystal clear night, i have excellent vision, and in my 45 years i have never seen anything i could not explain.  \r\n\r\noriginally, i thought the object flew out

inside to tell my wife and even reported it to the local news station (seemed silly, but i had to know if others saw this.  i am a rationale guy, and i am not sure what it was that i saw - but i know it was there and i know i saw that fireball change direction.  i never felt afraid, just bewildered and a lot of second-guessing.  if anyone else saw it, or anybody can check if one of the planes saw it - please let me know.  i smoked a cigarette tonight a 9pm, no object to go along with a bad habit tonight.

too close to the buildings. i watched people on the beach to see reactions because the pier lights and hotel lights lit up the area, but they seemed uninterested so it must have been a toy or something that was explained. i videoed but it did not pick it up well.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

went out onto my 2nd story flat kitchen roof to relax and watch the sky as i very often do to look at the constellations sometimes the odd bit of stardust and passing satellites. just before the sighting i was observing the hunter in the south-east as i turned my head to find another constellation a pea green flash caught my eye in the south west.I locked on to it as i did it was pulsating from pea green to a dirty white then more of a burnt orange rather than a copper then to a dull gold more like brass in colour. when i first seen it,it was static then started to move slowly then stopped again after maybe 30seconds. a short beam of light omitted from the object, but this beam did not touch the ground then the object moved very quick and came to a stop almost as quick. distance traveled unknown as no reference points. then the object droped about 30degrees,again the beam was seen then the object moved to the south-east still in plain sight,as amazing as all this was the next bit really made me think deep. what i seen next was really weird the object came to a stop still pulsating and just seemed to cloak and then nothing. many things went through my head as to what it was. this was no airplane no chopper no hot air balloon because they are not allowed to fly in the u.K. at night and no blimp. i watch the night sky on a regular basis and can explain away many,many things after the event i went back inside and sat down for maybe an hour thinking did i see what i seen!!! this is my first sighting and hope it wont be my last. this object was under intelligent

very similar to what you see on pilot whales as they feed and/or show off for the camera. what was most striking was an appeared lack of wings and fact that at aprox 5-7 miles away was a minimum of 16\" wide/long at arms length and was going right over top of what i'm sure was residential areas in and around wdm. i have seen the hercules up close and flew in c141 aircraft in the miltary and can say that this object was 5x larger than any c141 i've seen going to and from dsm intl. i called and spoke with the duty officer at dsm intl. i asked if they had just had a monster of an aircraft land at the ap, he indicated not to his knowledge and that he would know. after i explained what i saw and asked about their ever being the \"super transport\" at the ap, he indicated that they do occasionally get the hercules, in  the event \"the president and company\" come to town as they \"carry in special vehicles etc... .\" and that the air guard handles all those flights and is not required to share the info with the city ap. so, in the event we actually observed something like the c-17 globemaster at that distance the atmosheric conditions had to be perfect to translate into the size of craft we observed. i'm more than willing to accept the forgoing conclusion but the size of the thing seems to preclude the dsm intl ap from having adequate space for a landing. the craft had to have been (assuming our guess-timation on overland distance and height correct.) several hundred feet long (700-1000ft). i can't say for an absolute it wasn't some super transport but the two

turn to the southwest to see if saturn was still above the horizon(saturn was stunning to view with the naked eye a couple hours earlier). i looked up and almost directly overhead appr. 80deg from directly overhead i noticed a bright redish orange-yellow sphere stationary , hovering a little lower than the local air traffic observed in the sky simultaneously. i yelled to my dad through an open window, the orange fireball ufos are back.(we observed the same exact type of ufo, hovering in the same exact spot about the same distance from the ground. )he immediately ran outside. as we were both fumbling with our devices to get a picture or video the sphere silently ascended towards the southern skys above the commercial jets flying west. at this point the sphere began pulsating as it continued to ascend out of our atmosphere, until it slowly dimmed out like a satellite in the night sky. neptune was present in the approximate area of the sky where this object flew off to. june,7 of this year i experienced this same type of object displaying the same behaviors, the same hovering distance overhead, same spot in the sky, even ascended in the same exact part of the sky as previously. the only difference is the first sighting there were 5 spheres hovering overhead, then they slowly ascended the  same direction one by one. about a minute later, one by one 4 more vertically ascended from the treeline on the other side of the corn field in front of my house. once the first 3 were above the trees they went one by one horizontally right above the trees to about the same spot the first 5 were hovering. a final 4th one rose from the treeline as the 3 went horizontal to the \"hovering spot\". this last one started to come towards us unlike the others until it was about 150ft from us. it hovered overhead as the 3 ascended into the night sky one after the other, then this last one followed the others. i was able to get pictures of the 3flying horizontally above treeline. no luck with pictures for this second sighting. \r\n  i am feeling a lot of frustration at this point because nobody can tell me what it is i keep seeing in my yard, why i keep seeing

were at least two other couples in the parking lot, we all observed this together, everyone saw the same thing by our comments. \r\nin the center of the sighting there was a circle formation of distinct yellow-orange \"orbs\", about 8 to 10 in a circle just hovering, no sound at all. these orbs seemed to be glowing, there was another hue in them, smaller, maybe like a small dot of white and a small dot of red, but overall yellow-orange.\r\nobjects were entering and also leaving this circle. more would come from east to west in a line, traveling quite fast in an upward line at an angle of 45 degrees. these objects would join the circle, then to the right going from east to west objects would leave the circle and scatter off in the distance somewhat randomly, as they receded the objects got smaller, dimmer, then disappeared. \r\na commercial jet flew right past this circle and these orbs were about half the size of the jet. if you held your arm out in an extended fashion a dime in your fingertips would obscure the object. can't estimate size because can't estimate distance from us.\r\nwhen joining the circle the objects moved much faster than the jet. in the circle they

could see that the object was huge. no pulsesating lights just bright. my friend saw it aswell. i tried to take a picture of the object with my cell phone and my phone started to blink than shut off. im a professinal photographer i specialize in landscape photography. i also navigated my sailboat of the coast of mexico for a year traveling. i know the position of the stars and it was not a star. it was below the horizon and was to big and to close to my position to be a star.About 13 mins later i went outside to see it again a the object was gone.But the same stars that were there at the time of the sighting were still there.","distance":"Over One

noticed there was a lot of local airport traffic circling the area as the planes always do on  busy weekend as they wait for clearance to land. the planes were due east from my location. i started to turn to the southwest to see if saturn was still above the horizon(saturn was stunning to view with the naked eye a couple hours earlier). i looked up and almost directly overhead appr. 80deg from directly overhead i noticed a bright redish orange-yellow sphere stationary , hovering a little lower than the local air traffic observed in the sky simultaneously. i yelled to my dad through an open window, the orange fireball ufos are back.(we observed the same exact type of ufo, hovering in the same exact spot about the same distance from the ground. )he immediately ran outside. as we were both fumbling with our devices to get a picture or video the sphere silently ascended towards the southern skys above the commercial jets flying west. at this point the sphere began pulsating as it continued to ascend out of our atmosphere, until it slowly dimmed out like a satellite in the night sky. neptune was present in the approximate area of the sky where this object flew off to. june,7 of this year i experienced this same type of object displaying the same behaviors, the same hovering distance overhead, same spot in the sky, even ascended in the same exact part of the sky as previously. the only difference is the first sighting there were 5 spheres hovering overhead, then they slowly ascended the  same direction one by one. about a minute later, one by one 4 more vertically ascended from the treeline on the other side of the corn field in front of my house. once the first 3 were above the trees they went one by one horizontally right above the trees to about the same spot the first 5 were hovering. a final 4th one rose from the treeline as the 3 went horizontal to the \"hovering spot\". this last one started to come towards us unlike the others until it was about 150ft from us. it hovered overhead as the 3 ascended into the night sky one after the other, then this last one followed the others. i was able to get pictures of the 3flying horizontally above treeline. no luck with pictures for this second sighting. \r\n  i am feeling a lot of frustration at this point because nobody can tell me what it is i keep seeing in my yard, why i keep seeing them, and where \"off\" earth are they going?","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,
