view of these things falling. it took me a while to get down there yet these things were still in the sky. my boyfirend ran ahead of me and said the object traveled to the west and finally fell out of eyesight. like i stated earlier this is the second night we have seen strange things in sky. after this experience we left to go how about 2 hours later. on our way home i seen 2 orange lights similar to the ones we saw fall only these 2 were traveling toward each other then got smaller and smaller out of view as to travel

which would be somewhat east and there was just 1 light.  can't remember if it blinked or not.  none of the lights seemed to move, they were just in same spot.  they blinked on and off kind of in a stair step pattern.  appeared to be either white or maybe kind of amber in color.  there were 3 of us that watched them for about 30 mins.  i got scared so we went in house.  the lights were still there when we went in.  the one to the north in front of us i thought was drifting towards us but i really don't think it was.  i was more scared than anything and probably appeared to be doing that.  that is when i said take me to the house now.  my same son has seen these lights before one time in the climax springs missouri (not far from macks creek area).  we called whiteman air force base and asked if any planes were out and they told us no.  they could have not been flares.  the lights never moved the whole time we watched them.  they stayed in the same spot.  i probably wrong on the date
