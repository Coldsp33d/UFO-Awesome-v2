a clear warm evening in a no cloud sky, a large, white glowing barbell type object hovered in the south western section of the sky (approximately 10 or 15 degrees west of the large, flat southern  mesa behind the big park grade school). though the object was only at a +/- 1000 foot altitude it hovered in the same spot for a period of about 20 to 30 minutes and made no noticeable noise. \r\ni was able to take three photos of the object and as soon as i can figure out how to download the jpegs from my droid to my pc i will forward the pictures to anyone who might express an interest in seeing them.\r\nunfortunately, at the time i was unable to continue watching the object or see it arrive or depart so my estimation of 20 to 30 minutes was the amount of time i was able to view and photograph it. though i am now retired from the military i have flown and parachuted from a great number of aircraft as well as having worked in the gemini program as part of a crew in retrieving the bell shaped capsules in in the south china sea; therefore, from this and other past sightings and photos and videos i have taken i believe i know what flies and is not ours as well as what we are still not capable of. going out on a limb i don't believe this is one of ours unless it was designed and came from a future earth date and site!","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the stars. \r\nat 5:31 a.M. as i was searching for that last object, an extremely bright yellowish and much larger object came into view from behind the same tree\r\nmoving quite fast from the

some time in the military and saw a lot of ac-130s and chinooks it was much bigger than either one. if you ever go to the super walmart it was about the size of the store front looking at it where it was head on. it hovered for a good 15 minutes i could see it because the lights on it were huge as well. it was dark colored couldnt make out any markings or anything but just a general shape which was only what i could describe as a incredibly huge plane. the lights were circular yellow orange color and had something wierd to them almost like when you shine a spotlight in the rain but different maybe more like when you see dust particles in the beam of a lazer but as close as it was it was defenentily to far for me to see rain in lights (and it wasnt raining at the time either). it kept

night sky, through my side door���s window, which faces south. intermittent sleep that night and while i was walking down my hallway i first noticed at a glance the moon being very bright, and glancing thru the window i immediately spotted a cluster of blinking lights where i had never noticed any previous to this night.\r\nas close a meteorological report as i can make it, the night was very clear with a very bright three-quarter moon, and it not in any direct line of or view of these lights, and only very, very high altitude wisps of a cloud here and there. very many stars very clearly seen throughout the sky as well. winds aloft in our southern sky were forecast at 6 to 9 mph at 6000 ft., not unusual for that time of night, and time of year. \r\nthe lights were in the southern sky, at 152 degrees relative, declination of about 25 degrees from the horizon, a very tight cluster of blinking lights. not fixed per location per se, but slightly bobbing up and down and some side-to-side motion, always in unison, but always remaining within about a five degree arc, or circle, that same spot of the sky. difficult to define the distance to the lights but based upon the ease i could see the lights changing and alternating, i���ll estimate them approximately two to five miles distant. \r\nmulticolored, reds, blues, greens, with a very bright white always staying in its center of the cluster, all alternating colors from one side of the cluster to another, and from to bottom and back again, with no  discernible pattern as i could observe. at no time did the cluster of lights separate, but stayed in its configuration throughout the observation, which lasted at least forty-five minutes, uninterrupted during that period, with the lights remaining in the same relative position. about forty-five minutes into the event, i observed the cluster had changed position to about forty degrees declination and to approximately 195 degrees relative. i did not observe this movement as i had moved away for about five minutes from the window, it was when i returned to it i instantly noted they had moved. the cluster then remained in its new position for some time, approximately thirty minutes, when at that time they simply vanished. one moment they were there, the next they weren���t. \r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

final turn leading to my work-site. it was dark at this hour of the morning. as i drove up the heavily treed road, i suddenly noticed what looked like a greenish firework ember falling slowly down into the tree line above me. all of a sudden, a huge, yet silent flash went off which trained my eyes away from the \"ember', glancing all around me.It was very much like a lightening flash, except greenish.\r\ni remember gripping my steering wheel tightly while expecting to hear a boom as it made me think \"bomb\". no sooner did i think \"bomb\" there were multiple flashes of green illuminations darting all around me and my vehicle.I've equated this in current times to feeling as though i were in a microwave oven.These flashes were so bright that i could see right through the trees and hillside terrain. i thought \"what the heck, is someone welding?\" no sooner did this thought cross my mind, i glanced up to see a light very high above me just dropping downward at an incredible rate of speed. here, i thought \"meteor\" but i just closed my eyes tightly even though it was heading right for me and my vehicle. but then nothing. when i'd opened my eyes, the interior of my car was filled with a yellowish glow. as i looked up this time, i'll never forget what i saw for as long as i live. a ufo was the only category that my mind could fit this thing into. it hovered in mid air directly above the power lines, and directly above me. i took in the object for approximately 3-4 seconds. it was metallic in appearance with a grooved bottom, rectangular in shape and had lights coming off it's corners. as it was right over me, i only had this view of it. it had to be three to four times the size of my car at least. the entire event was absolutely silent. after three to four seconds, i floored it right under this thing as fast as i could. once i made it up the road, i glanced back, but to my surprise, it was gone. i went into my job but i believe that i was in a state of shock. i told no one and seemed to be on auto pilot through my day. however, by the time i came home that evening, i became highly troubled and disturbed by the event. i felt sick all weekend, called out sick that monday. i was literally afraid to return to my job and drive the scenic route. it was quite the experience. upon calling out sick that monday,\r\ni did report my experience to the ufo reporting center, but my report was incomplete. i felt desperate to find some answers myself but just could not tell my whole truth due to the fact that it was so outrageous. in hindsight, it's good as i had to grapple with it myself first. this is why i'm reporting it now-in full.\r\nyou question your sanity with such an event, question if you hallucinated everything, and you're afraid to tell anyone because they might think you're completely nuts. i knew that i had to pull myself together, and as hard as it was, i went and got myself evaluated as a result of the event.  this was a really difficult risk for me to take, but once i was able to prove to them and myself that i was of sound mind, it gave me the courage to move forward in my life. the good news..I'm not crazy, and i do have to live with the fact that i will not ever know if i hallucinated it, or not. i simply have to accept it and move on, which i've done.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

alien/ufo phenomenon, so i began to study it more and more. most of time i never saw it move with the naked eye but there was an exception. one night i was talking to my father about 8:40 at night. i was outside and leaning up against my pickup truck. my father tends to be long winded when he speaks so i knew that if i went outside that i would have plenty of time to observe the object. it shows up almost every night, but on this particular night i saw it slowly move from right to left. i also decided to film it on another night around the same time using a sony video camera with night shot and night shot plus technology. when i used the night shot plus technology the object appears to draw letters or shapes in the sky. i filmed it doing this for about 20-30 minutes. there were two other
