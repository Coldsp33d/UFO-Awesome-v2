much smaller bits of light approach and leave from the larger ball of light i ran to get my telescope to focus on it but its very old and cheap a kids model and all i could see though it was a ball of

it- it was awe-inspiring, and beautiful. \r\n\r\nfor a moment i thought maybe the lights from the show caught its attention. but it appeared to come from the sierras (mountain range) and went across the entire sky. \r\n\r\ni came here to see if anyone saw it, please contact me if others did...\r\n\r\nand i was not on any drugs or alcohol.\r\n","distance":"Over One

on hiway 61.  just south of lagrainge,mo i noticed an orb or starlike object moving north,not fast really,maybe 200 to 300 mph.It kept heading north,then split into 3 objects into a perfect triangle never stopping or hovering.  proceeded north,for maybe 30 to 60 seconds,then all 3 broke formation in maybe 2 seconds,heading in different directions.15 to 20 min's later the sky was covered with aircraft maybe 3 to 5 aircraft (with)navigation lights.That lasted about 1 to 2 hours.It was kind a funny,they new something was heading thier way and scrammed the heck outa there!It's a pretty rural area,and i've never noticed that many aircraft at that time of day or nite.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with
