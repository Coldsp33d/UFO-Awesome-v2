the sun hadn't reached over the top of short mountain yet. at first when i saw the object i thought it was a jet that was far, far off with chemicals or smoke trailing behind it. but then as i watched it i realized that it looked rather odd. it wasn't acting like smoke. and it wasn't moving like a cloud either. the sky was totally clear so it couldn't have been a cloud. it was too small and didn't move like a lenticular cloud either. it looked as if it was shimmering. i don't know if it was because the sunlight was reflecting off of it or it was spinning and had flashing white lights on it. it started over to the right, above the mountain, and started moving left/north bound over the top of the mountain. i am not exactly sure how fast it was moving, but it took it about 7 to 8 minutes to move from there over to the tree line and out of my sight. in the video it's pretty hard to make out it's best viewed full screen and in high quality. i am sorry for the poor video, but it was a spur of the moment filming and my camera isn't the best and i have no tripod to sit it on. i see star-like ufo's rather often at night here since i live out in the country where it's easy to see the stars.

seen one glow blue-green during descent. within the appx. 3 seconds i saw this object it glowed blue-green then dimmed then brightened up again. it appeared to slow down each time while glowing which

bright blue. it lasted about 4-5 seconds. as soon as i saw the object i paid close attention to see what it was doing. at about 5 seconds it disappeared into nothing. it was moving very fast like a shooting star, but it was lower than a plane would be. i was struck that it was an actual object shaped like a blue disc (like a flame that flickered) and moving very fast. my first thought on seeing it was \"the shape looks like a persons lips\". what i mean by lips is skinny on the ends and thick in the middle. the disc shape is a better way of describing it. i thought about pulling onto a side road to see if i could see it again in some big open field. i felt excited driving home. i was trying to think about what i had seen. i searched on twitter to see if anyone saw it too. there was a car behind me that may or may not have seen it. we were both in line of the object in the sky at the same time.\r\n\r\ni thought about telling people about it, and they would say, \"it was fireworks.\" i

ever seen before. too bright and not the right color to be a plane, and no noise whatsoever. my first thought was possibly a shooting star. however, it was flying horizontally and did not ���burn out��� or leave a trail. \r\n\r\nseconds later 2 more red-orange lights ���appeared���  to the right of the first light, approx. 3-5 miles away from the first sighting. they were headed towards me. there was no sound and the lights did not flash. i listened for jet engines, propellers or helicopter noise and there was none. based on their appeared proximity to me i should have heard something but they were silent. they were not the same color as any airplane or helicopter lights i had ever seen. \r\n\r\nthey appeared to be flying horizontally but not in a perfect flight pattern. the light on the left started to ascend upwards until it simply disappeared. after it disappeared the light on the right also ascended upwards until it too simply disappeared. i watched the lights shrink until they were the same size as the stars next to them and just kept going. the speed of the ascension was swift, much more so than any helicopter is capable of doing. it took about 3 or 4 seconds for it to travel from a very large brilliant light within approx. 7,000 feet distance from me and an approx. altitude of the same until it was a mere ���speck���, incredibly high in the sky. \r\n\r\nthis all

however, i can bet radar would have picked the object up. the object also seemed to be friendly and there were times during the duration i saw other smaller white objects around it for less than a second. when i asked if they could change colour they did at the time period of 12-15 min. the object became more circular and changed from bright white to red orange to red then faded out to look like a very dim white star. i did not observe the object after 15 min. i normally do not make reports unless the object is a bit more significant in scale/size/colour/duration; although i see objects usually once a week or more. i also have an extensive military aircraft background and have seen objects of significance while on missions. lastly, i want to give my sincere thanks to you for providing this service and thankful you are also featured on coast to coast often!","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":50984,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.0831817,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09222013-0015","longitude":-106.6253161,"occurred":1379815200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Mexico","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1379887650000,"summary":"Bright ufo object by sandia mountains, albuquerque, nm","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Albuquerque, New Mexico","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:254497"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"San Antonio","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I work at 911 callcenter and we received numorous calls from citizens claiming to have witnessed orange sphere lights in the sky.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":50983,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.407559091392393,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09222013-0014","longitude":-98.54776413190315,"occurred":1379826840000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Fireball,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1379886024000,"summary":"Orange glowing orbs","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"78207","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"San Antonio, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:254498"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Nampa","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"In the foothill south of nampa i was taking pictures of my grandson for school  did not see the object at first until i looked at them on my computer \r\nhad know idea what they were  5 objects just flying away from my area since i did not see them at first i had no reactions again did not see them at first i was looking at my grandson","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":50982,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.5435272,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09222013-0013","longitude":-116.5542524,"occurred":1362862680000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Idaho","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1379879822000,"summary":"Don;t have any idea what they were","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/50982_submitter_file1__IMG3406.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/50982_submitter_file2__IMG3407.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"83651","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":196,"locationName":"Nampa, Idaho","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:254499"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop, 500 Feet or Less","city":"Falmouth","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Family members and i were coming home from a trip to the red river gorge in two separate vehicles, traveling north on us highway 27 in northern ky. passing out of falmouth ky around 9pm, we saw a bright yellowish-orange light ascending out of the tree line to the north east.  as we watched, trying to understand what we were seeing, more lights followed the first, forming a delta triangular formation. this formation ascended until it was overhead traveling in an ascending southeast direction.  at this point, we all felt this was an unusual event, and possible extraterrestrial in nature. the driver of the vehicle that i was in, pulled over to the side of the road, so that we could get a better view and take pictures/video.  (we had cameras handy because of our daytrip to natural bridge ky, and the kids taking pictures of things along the road trip home.)  the car following us pulled over behind us, and we all got out to view the event.  as we watched, more lights trailed the first group, following a roughly straight-line path to the southeast.  during this first event, we saw a series of approximately 13 lights in all.  the lights were a steady bright yellow-orange, moved steadily but slowly across the sky, almost hovering at times, and followed a clear arc across the sky passing directly overhead, and then moving past us until they began to disappear fading out in the far southeastern sky.  there were 6 adults, 3 teens and two kids with us, and we all had varying reactions to the events.  i was excited and exhilarated.  some of us were scared and disturbed.  others were dumbstruck and confused, trying to come up with a rational explanation for the strange series of lights. i felt consistently that we were viewing ufo's and possibly extraterrestrial spacecraft. other explanations which were thrown out were: chinese lanterns/flares/missiles/and unknown military aircraft.  the lights moved too controlled and deliberately across the sky, rising steadily and moving at a relatively constant pace to be anything random or unmanned/controlled.  as we watched, the first lights began to break formation and one light sped up and jumped ahead until fading out of sight.  all the lights moved to the same area of the sky before likewise fading out.  having watched the lights for roughly 12 minutes, we began to become concerned, and even scared.  if this was not a series of extraterrestrial spacecraft, then we might be watching missile launchings and could be about to experience a nuclear war and worse.  we wanted to get home and see if there was any related news reports or other possible explanations.  as we left the area, the lights continued to rise and fill the sky.  on the way home, other lights came up in a more horizontal string and then the sightings stopped.  overall, we figure there had been anywhere between 18 and 24 lights all following the same basic slow steady path across the sky. there were no news reports and no other related information corroborated our experience. during the event there was no accompanying sounds, the lights traveling through the sky in absolute silence. it was hard to determine any size or distance, as the objects may have been external lights attached to a larger object that we couldn't actually see, or the lights were themselves the objects and much higher in the sky.
