query whether they were not in fact some lighting separate to a 3pm glow reflected from the sun. no other objects were seen. my family also witnessed it.\r\n\r\nthe photos will need to be reduced tin file size to upload properly; something i will endeavor to do soon.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":50976,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-33.881788,"location":null,"logNumber":"AU-09222013-0007","longitude":151.126655,"occurred":1379889000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New South Wales","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval,   Teardrop","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1379842955000,"summary":"2 objects of different colors hovering before slow easterly path","tags":["hovering"],"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney","timeZoneName":"Australia/Sydney","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"2131","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Ashfield, New South Wales","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:255226"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Phoenix","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"While in the car driving south at 9:55 pm in north phoenix, az, i witnessed a very bright light race across the sky from south to southwest at a rapid speed.  it was approximately a mile away and it was approximately 60 degrees above the horizon.  it was light in the area due to the neighborhood and city lights.  therefore, i feel the light had to be unusually bright.  not a star but something much brighter.  i was shocked and wondered wat it could be.  i have lived in az all my life and neverhave seen anything like this.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":50975,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.60555391604721,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09222013-0006","longitude":-112.02882233467466,"occurred":1379825700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Bullet,   Missile,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1379842035000,"summary":"Saw a very bright light fly across the sky very fast. it was too bright and large to be a star.","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"85022","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Phoenix, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:255227"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Peconic","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":" at approximately 21:30 on friday, 21 september 2013 my wife and i witnessed 2 pairs of red orbs in the northern sky slowly traveling east & then northeast. each set of orbs, one pair slightly following another, moved silently, and maintained a precise formation insomuch as keeping the distance between each individual orb and its respective partner. the second pair was in a formation that had one orb slightly southwest in relation to the other, while the first pair was oriented in an east to west fashion. i have video of this event.

because we also saw another orange light and a red light in the opposite side of the sky and they were obviously not fireworks. after we saw the usual light, a helicopter appeared in the opposite side

(we had cameras handy because of our daytrip to natural bridge ky, and the kids taking pictures of things along the road trip home.)  the car following us pulled over behind us, and we all got out to view the event.  as we watched, more lights trailed the first group, following a roughly straight-line path to the southeast.  during this first event, we saw a series of approximately 13 lights in all.  the lights were a steady bright yellow-orange, moved steadily but slowly across the sky, almost hovering at times, and followed a clear arc across the sky passing directly overhead, and then moving past us until they began to disappear fading out in the far southeastern sky.  there were 6 adults, 3 teens and two kids with us, and we all had varying reactions to the events.  i was excited and exhilarated.  some of us were scared and disturbed.  others were dumbstruck and confused, trying to come up with a rational explanation for the strange series of lights. i felt consistently that we were viewing ufo's and possibly extraterrestrial spacecraft. other explanations which were thrown out were: chinese lanterns/flares/missiles/and unknown military aircraft.  the lights moved too controlled and deliberately across the sky, rising steadily and moving at a relatively constant pace to be anything random or unmanned/controlled.  as we watched, the first lights began to break formation and one light sped up and jumped ahead until fading out of sight.  all the lights moved to the same area of the sky before likewise fading out.  having watched the lights for roughly 12 minutes, we began to become concerned, and even scared.  if this was not a series of extraterrestrial spacecraft, then we might be watching missile launchings and could be about to experience a nuclear war and worse.  we wanted to get home and see if there was any related news reports or other possible explanations.  as we left the area, the lights continued to rise and fill the sky.  on the way home, other lights came up in a more horizontal string and then the sightings stopped.  overall, we figure there had been anywhere between 18 and 24 lights all following the same basic slow steady path across the sky. there were no news reports and no other related information corroborated our experience. during the event there was no accompanying sounds, the lights traveling through the sky in absolute silence. it was hard to determine any size or distance, as the objects may have been external lights attached to a larger object that we couldn't actually see, or the lights were themselves the objects and much higher in the sky.

had a window seat on the starboard side and was enjoying watching electrical storms dance across the northern sky. the big dipper was hanging low in the northern sky and was visible most of the time with the lightning activity below. intermittent patches of clouds sometimes obscured my view of the stars, but most of the time i had a spectacular view of the sky above a long line of storms to the north which stretched approximately from the mid-western states to western new mexico. \r\n\r\nit was after a short period of cloud obstruction when the strange lights appeared. \r\n\r\nif you were to mark a spot midway between a line joining the two stars at the end of the handle of the big dipper and draw a line perpendicular to and up from that line, the lights appeared on that line at a point about a third longer than the line joining the two stars. they were slightly brighter than those two stars and appeared white. at arm's length they were about a pinky finger's width apart. \r\n\r\ni'm familiar with that area of the sky and knew immediately that they couldn't have been stars, planets, or any other celestial body. my first thought was that they were satellites, so i watched them for any movement. they remained perfectly motionless like stars for about a full minute. then briefly for several seconds, my eyes were drawn to a few flashes of lighting below. then when i looked back up, the two lights had disappeared. i continued watching that area of the sky for at least 15 minutes afterwards but they never reappeared.

the house.  she noticed two lights in the sky and called for me to come and see them.  we observed two 'orb' type lights circling above us, at approximately 2-3000 ft altitude, describing a circular path, estimated to be 500 - 1,000 ft diameter.  the lights were a teal green in color, or a blue - green hue.  the lights themselves were not defined by any shape or hard surface, simply 'lights'. \r\n\r\nthe sky was clear, with low hanging cumulus clouds, drifting at around 5 knots from south to north.  the stars were visible, and there was no weather threatening, or nearby storms.  \r\n\r\nthe circling lights looked like undefined shapes, not delineated.  i first thought they could have been projected, like maybe some kids playing with laser pointers.  after observing these light continuously for over an hour, i became convinced they were not projected.  they were highly visible, and could be seen behind the clouds, between the clouds, and against the clouds. \r\n\r\nthe circular flight pattern did not vary, but the two lights would sometimes be very close together, and then separate until they were opposite each other, still moving in a circular pattern. round and round, not varying, just round and round.  it was fascinating to watch, and we both observed the lights for over an hour.  as the clouds moved across the sky, the lights were still there.  as the clouds disapated, the lights were still visible, but not as much as when the clouds were present.  \r\n\r\ni know about clouds, winds, elevation and altitude from being a navigator in my early days in the navy.  i was taught to observe weather, etc as part of my duties. \r\n\r\ni am certain there were others who saw these lights, and hope my observation will be confirmed.  i will be glad to discuss this with anyone from mufon, and you are welcome to contact me.  this was an interesting observation, and i will be looking again tonight to see if it is repeated. i have other sightings, including a uso sighting that i have never reported.  i have never seen a similar sight like the circling orbs i report here. \r\n\r\nthanks to mufon for being here, giving me an opportunity to relate this sighting to someone.  \r\n\r\nbest regards,\r\n\r\nsteve mason","distance":"501 Feet - 1

on my way home from work on the night of thursday,september 19th. i looked to my right (east, and observed a jet coming in towards the city airport. i then looked ahead towards downtown / yaletown, and saw what appeared to be an orange-red light about 40 degrees elevation to me. i first thought it was a crane light on one of the new sky rises going up in yaletown, but then noticed that it was becoming larger and coming towards me. it passed overhead just to the right of me (the jet spotted earlier was about 3 times as high and passed above and to the right of the object. i thought that it might be a chinese lantern, but it was moving too fast in a sw direction. it was glowing orange red--there didn't seem to be lights separate from the object. it looked angular, but i could not make out a distinct shape. i stopped, got off my bike, and watched the object cross the sky. it made no noise and did not seem to leave any kind of trail. i saw people walking on the other side of the bridge but no one seemed to take notice. there appeared a faint flicker from the front/top of the object as though on fire, but no actual flames were visible. i attempted to photograph it, but i was directly next to a street lamp and that is all i could see on my phone's screen. i called a friend who's apartment patio overlooked the west and asked if he could see it, but he replied that he could not. after about 2 1/2 - 3 minutes, the object had passed over me and disappeared on the sw horizon.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
