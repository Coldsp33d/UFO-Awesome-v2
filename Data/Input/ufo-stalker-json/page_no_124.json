middle of my forehead.  inside triangle is raised, puffy, with red spot in middle.  slight bluish tinge  inside puffy area, edges of triangle are flattened into skin about 1/4\" wide.  it is sore inside triangle, not sore elsewhere.  at friends' urging i looked for other markings, and remembered i had one from about 2 days ago on my left temple. that had started as a puffed area which i scratched & it became irritated. now it's a red mark in shape of triangle, point down with three brown dots inside.  it's been almost 5 hours now and the forehead mark is still there, slightly less inflamed.  i often awake with inexplicable bruises or marks anyway, but this is the most ridiculous and flagrant one i have ever seen in my entire life. \r\n\r\ncurrently i live in a fairly remote area in arizona, off a dirt road in an rv.  i'm o negative blood type and am on the red cross 'baby brigade' blood donor list (we on the brigade do not have a certain type of organism in our blood, so our blood can be safely given to premature babies...Most people have this organism in their blood).  i have hazel eyes and reddish tone to hair, which was more pronouncedly red when i was younger.  blood pressure is normally 90/65ish...Once recorded as low as 60/30 after a blood draw (which a friend said could not be true bec i would have died. well, obviously i didn't die, just got dizzy. staff held onto me and forced me to walk around blood center until pressure elevated).  temp usually about 96 degrees + varying decimal points.  i've never been able to have a live birth, only miscarriages. extremely sensitive ears, always wear earplugs or headphones. etc etc.  i've done healing work professionally, but have not done so for over 5 years.  i find this planet very hard to live in for many reasons, and often feel i was 'dropped' here as a cruel joke by close friends who would think it was funny.  not funny.  \r\n\r\nin 2010 i saw the textbook three amber lights that move together then disappear ufo type, just north of phoenix, az about 45mins before dusk.  next day the news reported it as a \"meteor\".  hard to explain why, but the lights were coming right at me and i felt they 'knew' me, or 'saw' me, me personally.  i wasn't scared.  when the three lights moved closer together, making a smaller type of triangle they poof, disappeared all at once.  i was sad, as i had wished they would have come over to me.  when i was about 10 i swear i saw a ufo, very low, in arlington ma at night.  but that was a long time ago!  \r\n\r\nas a child i thought i'd created my own written language which i used in my journal, to keep my thoughts private.  but after showing it to an arizona ufo enthusiast he said it was not a 'new' language, it was 'alien' language.  he also thought i had a lot of what he called screen memories, about school busses and planes, and even spaceships themselves with zero gravity inside. i find it very hard to believe that i could consistently be picked up into a spaceship and taken 'away' anywhere without my knowledge.  i just find that pretty unbelievable.  so i have never believed it.  this forehead indentation is the only thing that has ever had me really confounded.  \r\n\r\nin any case, i am attaching photos of what i have described. i would really really like to know what this is and what it's from.  the underlying muscles of the forehead could account for this shape, but i don't understand the indentations or puffiness.  even if it's some kind of natural medical phenomenon i'd like to know.

three lights slowly moved vertically and faded away.  remaining lights in their entirety were dull smoky red. no sound. became brighter with smoky grey/ black misty-like substance that appeared on their surface. appeared to rotate (swirling) slowly in all directions w/o any pattern.\r\n \r\nthree additional white lights appeared over south mountain. also reported by two other gentleman in discussion section of my mufon report.  one gave excellent description of the three white lights and their flight characteristics. their calculated speed-20 mph. he saw same 3 lights twice and timed their movement and used math to cal. speed. they remained in that general area near south mountain. he indicated the 3 lights were on a triangular base or craft. he had a map and a time schedule for the triangular craft and this was in the discussion section of my 2014 report. i've researched this info and decided craft was within 500 ft. of where my wife and i observed it. neither observer saw the 9 lights we saw. they were in back of those lights. that is the biggest mystery i have. how could they not see this formation? his very descriptive discussion was deleted eventually by mufon, for what reason i'm not aware of. he was very adament  that it was a triangular soundless flying craft. his discussion report would be excellent info for investigators.\r\n\r\n5:55  - 6:00 pm a private aircraft came into view flying toward the front of the ufo formation, flying perhaps slightly lower. we live  a  mile from the main runway of queen city airport where this aircraft probably had just taken off from. his altitude was around 800 feet. that would put the ufo's around an altitude of 1000 - 1400 ft. \r\n\r\nour attention  was diverted away from the aircraft by a round white light that came on inside and near the bottom of each ufo. these were similar to a landing light on an aircraft and slowly went on and off /on. no pattern. no beam was hitting the ground that we could see.\r\nthe ufo's remained stationary. we drove on lehigh st. to emmaus.  one of the 3 white lights (triangular craft) was not far from us (400 ft. or less). blocked from getting closer by a moving norfolk southern freight train. very good look at the light which was bright amber almost like large flames flickering and moving upright or vertical but seemed contained in an invisible  enclosure like an old tear shaped christmas tree ball. very, very impressive and pretty. months passed.  i came across a u-tube one hour movie titled \"the phoenix lights-the documentary. a skeptics discovery \"that we are not alone\":  based on book by lynne d. kitier, md. she witnessed the phoenix lights. just after 17 minutes into the film there was a beautiful computer graphic rendition of those lights which were exactly like the lights we saw except our lights were dull red.                                     \r\n\r\ni am retired. was employed in field of engineering most of my life where observation was an important leg of my work. i completed  5 years of college. my last 10 years of employment was with the penna. dept. of transportation working as a field engineering tech. in their traffic safety dept. where observing was a very critical aspect of my position. \r\ni'm a military veteran and for 13 months in korea i pulled night guard duty directly behind the rear of the dmz between north and south korea.  observing once again was paramount to my work.\r\ni have been an aviation enthusiast since 1st grade in elementary school and also built many (beyond comprehension) model aircraft thru the years and attended many air shows.\r\nat 5:45pm  on the sighting day the perfect formation coming out of the south is what initially caught our attention plus our parked car was facing that direction.I did not want to leave my wife alone while i looked for my camera in our house. plus this was too intriguing to leave. we actually watched in awe knowing these were ufos. after a life time of engineering discipline i am now more receptive to the unknown.   \r\n\r\ni always thought it would be cool to see a ufo and since we saw this 20 minute show it's far better than that.  \r\n","distance":"501 Feet -

3:50pm. as we exit i5 north, and turn right onto hwy 89, i look at the sky. something doesn't feel right. i stare at the sky some more. then it dawns on me, the weird line in the clouds. i say aloud \"hey guys, does the sky look weird to you or is it just me? that line in the sky doesnt seem normal.\" my partner and friend agreed that something seemed off. i stared at the sky. the line resembled a contrail left by a plane. except... contrails disappear behind clouds and become visible once again in the patches of blue sky. and contrails are very thin and high up. this line could be seen weaving in and out of the clouds and blue sky. (picture attached). it was also very thick, and appeared to be much lower in the sky than a normal contrail left by a plane.\r\nwe started examining the clouds more. maybe we were seeing things that werent there. maybe not. i got the distinct vibe that something was happening though. i noticed more lines in the sky, almost like gridwork... many trails in the sky leading towards a point farther south/south east.(pictures attached)\r\nwe observed that some of the cloud formations were strange.(pictures attached) very wispy, almost too wispy. i had the instinctive feeling that i should pull out my phone and take some photos and videos. so i did. as i was looking around, maybe about 8 minutes into the drive, i saw something. at least, i think. again it could be my mind showing me what i want to see. but i was looking south east ish, but up towards the sun. i saw a disk shape with a dome on top and below. but it was just an outline, and the shape itself looked as though it were made of clouds and sunlight. i only saw the faintest outline of the edges, almost like the bright sun was cutting through a cloaking device, making the outline of the craft visible? i saw for only a short instant and then it was gone. it was a surreal feeling in that instant, and in that moment i knew i was seeing something, but after it was gone i started to question myself. did i really see that?\r\nas we arrived at our destination at our friends house, i began to look through my videos and take some screenshots. something inside me was saying, \"put thise images under a filter! solarize the images and see if you see anything!\" i don't know why but i knew i had to do that. what i found was strange. some of my images of the clouds, when out under a solarization filter, show nothing but blank sky. and other images, show strange heat sources and patterns in the sky and clouds. i have included these photos as well. there is what appears to be some vaguely disc shaped heat sources, and some possibly triangular shapes. some heat sources are massive and some are just small flecks. one photo i took showed no heat sources under the solarization filter, but there are 2 distinctly saucer shaped things in between the clouds, partially concealed by the cloud. we went into our friends house to hang out and after about an hour we left. when we left there were still some odd lines in the sky but the cloud cover had become very....\"normal\" looking. no patches of blue sky, just a completely flat overcast. my partner and i left and headed over 89 back towards mt shasta city. on the way, i saw what is called a sundog. a patch of rainbow in the sky. i've seen sundog once or twice before, but this one seemed different. it was more blurry at the edges but the longer i stared at it the more certain i was that it was a perfect sphere. when we arrived in mt shasta city to get gas, i could no longer see it. \r\ni am only able to upload 10 files with this report. however i have much more photos and videos i am unable to submit and would like to be able to so that a team could really analyze it

(original story typed around 7pm on 8/24/2017)i went out for around 6 hours last night with friends and as i was returning home around 3 30 a.M i noticed a large ufo above the treetops flashing multiple colors of lights behind and to the southeast of  the gas station on stacer road and highway 662.  as i grew nearer i could tell it was moving slowly.  i started driving slow  south  on stacer  around 15-20 mph and lost it halfway down stacer. turned east on pollack and cleared the two curves near the nursing home and  i saw it or possibly another one cross pollack near multzer crushed stone and lost it again until i pulled into my apartments on pollack.  went straight to side of building when i pulled in and immediately noticed it  far away and it had gained altitude and seemed stationary and resembled the stars we see that flash red,green ,yellow or white and watched it until sometime after 4 a.M. and remembered my green laser and that many people have gotten some sort reaction from ufo s from them . so i started hitting it for brief moments with no reaction but my hand was shaky and that puts the beam all over the place at distance.  walking to the privacy fence on east side of complex i live in i put  the laser on the fence and put a steady beam on the object that had moved but barely noticeable.  as soon as the beam stayed on it steady for 1 second it moved as to where leaves and tree limbs blocked it's view. i continued this game for around 10 minutes with this craft moving so much i am sure someone would notice besides me.  as this progressed the object became what i perceived as agitated and would start doing fast and  very tight  circle patterns or bounce all around in a very tight pattern.  after 9 or 10 times of doing this it did something to me,the laser batteries and i discovered awhile later my phone battery was drained to 7 percent . the feeling i had when i felt it'd shot something at me or onto me was fear,eyes giving me tremors in my eyelids that have continued today and drainage from eyes.  i saw the object do it when it seemed to elongate and became what was very close to a boomerang shape and craft had a long row of led looking lights all the way across its shape with no more colors flashing. then it went back ro the red,green yellow flashing . so i continued this with the laser but into only would work for about 3 seconds then shut down and the object would slowly move behind tree cover. . the ufo had reacted 3-5 times where i felt it did something to me and it was same feeling each time.  i also witnessed several large orbs eminating  very bright light and it looked like it was over downtown newburghm and maybe 4-5000 feet also multiple fast movers..  they most certainly know when i am watching them.Pics and video are from samsung note 3. also witnessed 4 daytime  ufos mimic birds of prey then didapear with leelend 2 days ago.  update!  tonight (11/24/17)just one single one  showed up but it amazed 4 more people from my household and 2 neighbors from across the street. everyone was mind blown.  but something occurred to me between 3 am and 7 but besides watching these things i did nothing else .  since my first very close encounter over 2 years i  started seeing things but briefly.  the  the last 4-5 months it has really stepped up. i am going to need night vision to film them.    oh! blow up one of the stills i took of the first object and tell me what yous it.   i am making this public in hopes theers who witnessed this. i have seen this ufo on multiple occasions ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"03:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":87278,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.93571680584922,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10112017-0006","longitude":-87.42183309316482,"occurred":1506222600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1507718945000,"summary":"Observed pulsating craft changing directions and close at beginiing. used laser and it became upset.","tags":["video","ufo","lights","flash","disc"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":1509278247576,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":32,"maxtempi":90,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":25,"meantempi":77,"meanvism":15,"meanvisi":9,"mintempm":17,"mintempi":63,"minvism":11,"minvisi":7,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":32,"maxtempi":90,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":25,"meantempi":77,"meanvism":15,"meanvisi":9,"mintempm":17,"mintempi":63,"minvism":11,"minvisi":7,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"47630","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":17,"locationName":"Newburgh, Indiana","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:15183"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less, Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Pasadena","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving south down strawberry rd in pasadena, texas when i saw three lights creating a triangle form in the distance. i parked and watched since they seemed to just hover in place, blinking. it was pretty dark since this is a back road and the lights didn't move as a normal aircraft would.\r\nthey moved slowly, but always maintained the triangle form and position. after maybe 30 minutes, a fourth appeared and a diamond form was created. the lights seemed to flicker randomly. this lasted for 3 hours. then they suddenly went off in separate directions. i observed this happening again for a few more years around the same time of year.

flashlight beam shooting down in our back yard but the light never touched the ground and no source was seen nor any sound was heard. days later she spoke of her \"little alien friends\" and mentioned the name galaca. now as a 9 year old she had a memory surface of that night. she said she was sitting on a floor, bound by a sticky substance that resembled spaghetti. she said she saw short creatures some grey some green. they were speaking among themselves in a nonsense language, she says. and they were observing her closely. i dont know if i was taken as well but i did have a flashback where i was laying on a table looking up. i drew a picture of what i saw. it was a silver shiny web shaped curved ceiling with small holes. behind it a purple, red and green glow of colors shone thru the holes. and hanging from it was a black

20 people including kids. i initially had something catch my eye  in the south east sky around 1,000 feet at an angle of around 50 degrees to the ground.  we initially thought it was maybe some silver balloons as we could see three round shiny objects. it became apparent that it was actually one object triangular in shape with three bright lights.  the object hovered and moved around slowly making no sound at all. we could see this object move behind a cloud and then back again.  it began to climb to around 2,000 plus feet.  we thought maybe it was a drione but the object was much larger than any drone i’ve seen and was metallic. we did not observe any strobe pattern  or flashing lights just the three solid lights which did increase and decrease in intensity. i did manage to capture a couple of still shots and it can be seen that this is clearly a triangular shakes object with 3 equally spaced bright white lights. we watched this object for around 30 minutes until it climbed to 3,000 feet and above and made its way into the south east sky. during its movement it appeared that this object was moving and spinning slowly.  i immediately began to film it with my iphone.
