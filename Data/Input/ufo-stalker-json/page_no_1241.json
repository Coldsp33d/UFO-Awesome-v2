could not see anything that may of been wing lights. the objects shape and real size is unknown because it was around 1 am and all i seen was the lights moving. what was also strange was the speed of the object. it seemed to be flying way faster than the planes going to and from dia. i was heading west on i-70 after work and it was heading north around 3 or 4 miles away and about 1 mile above the ground.It seemed to be traveling about 4 or 5 times faster and was about 4 times longer than jets i see near the airport. i lost sight of the object as it flew too far north.","distance":"Over One

drive to the vanpool stop.  so it must have been about 4:05am to 4:008am.  i noticed a bright orangeish light above the treetops...About the height you'd expect a helicopter to be...That appeared to be hovering in the distance, directly in front, and above me.  i thought at first that it was a helicopter scanning the highway, but it was too far east of the highway for that.  as i continued toward it, it appeared to be a slender ovoid shape with three large white blinking likes in front, and several red blinking lights on the right side, and several blue blinking lights on the left side.  the colored lights were at the extreme ends on either side of the shape.  when i saw the colors of the lights i thought it must be a jetliner, flying very low.  sometimes, when they are seen head on their movement is imperceptible.  but it was so low!  then i could see that it was moving very slowly and silently, straight north, and slightly, along the east side of the road that i was driving on.  as i got nearer, and almost even with it, i was looking at it from the driver's seat, up through the windshield and to the left.  i slowed almost to a stop and continued to stare at it as it passed me.  there was a very bright, and very full moon, which silhouetted it against the dark, cloudless sky.  as i came even with it, i discerned it to be shaped like a boomerang, or a wing, but with no fuselage, and no tail.  there was absolutely no sound.  i thought i could see windows between the sets of lights, but they were dark.  it appeared to be a dull gray color.  i wanted to stop and get out to snap a picture with my cell phone, but i was worried i'd miss my vanpool to work.  it continued on slowly northward, maybe 100 or more feet, or so above the treetops.  it appeared to be very large.  at first sight i thought it must be a 747, because it appeared that large, but on reflection, i think it was even bigger than that.  and it appeared flat.  i continued down the road, with the object above and behind me, until it was obscured by trees.  i kept thinking that i couldn't be seeing what i was seeing, and it must be some sort of military craft or jet.  but it was so silent, and slow, i don't see how it could be.  i didn't tell anyone about it until i got home, and decided that i would report it, to see if there were any other reported sightings from others on the road at that early hour.  my reaction was one of puzzlement...Trying to figure out what i saw.  it just didn't look like anything i've seen before.

sky.  at around 2 pm she went back to pick the kids up from school and noticed a larger crowd staring and pointing in the sky saying look at the ufos. she then called me and told me what was happening and i ran home and got my video camera and went down to 23rd street and 8th avenue. when i got there there was a large crowd around 40-60 people standing around, also there were news trucks from abc news 7 and ny1. what i saw was a large object that was stationary and fading in and out and there were multiple shiny orb shaped objects that were flying by also fading in and out. i was unable to capture the objects on video at 23rd street and 8th avenue, so i started to walk towards 24th street and as i looked north east (towards the empire state building) i noticed a very bright silver orb and it was flying low it was bobbing up and down and wobbling.  it stopped for a few seconds and hovered then shot straight up. i was able to take a video for a few seconds. i did not think i got anything but when i slowed it down you can see the orb flying then when i zoom in alittle you can see that the object is triangle shaped.\r\n\r\nduring the sighting there were people saying that they saw 2 military jets fly over at hi altitude also at around 6:30pm all planes were diverted in the area due to a gas leak at the regional��� air traffic control center in westbury , new york that

the surface of the object, only then for it to be completely blinked out and seen flying fast by again, then returning to the exact location in the sky to hover. someone else must have seen this today. this isn't the first sighting in this exact same area i have seen with the naked eye. there must be a portal where they are coming in and out of, or it must be a preferred location or secret

could be heard, even at greater distances, while also running with the proper flashing navigation lights. the red orbs however were all coming from the south and heading north following the exact same path--one after another. i watched for ten minutes and counted over ten within that time span. one group of two were tailing each other at a close distance--approximately 500-1000 ft. oddly, every

was out with our kids taking a walk. she stated that she was one street over from our house and that she was watching a \"weird light in the sky\" and when i asked what it was doing she stated that it was bouncing up and down in the sky and moving in an odd way that she had never seen before and that it wasn't making any noise at all. i could here my son in the back ground talking about the light and how he thought it wasn't right. i proceeded to put my shoes on and i asked her where the lights where and i determined that i could walk a very short distance to the top of a nearby hill and see it. i hung the phone up and ran from my house to the top of the hill where i witnessed 2 lights which appeared to be on a single object moving in the sky, the lights were red and green orbs which were very bright and steady and not pulsating. they moved from right to left very quickly and then quickly decended down behind a row of trees (there was a cell phone tower in the approx. area of the object and the object was higher than the tower in the air, the trees the object went behind were right behind the tower. after the event i drove to the tower and there was no working lights on the tower) i watched the object move behind the trees and then it acended back in to the sky. at that point i ran to my neighbors house which was very close to where i was and asked him to come see the object, but by the time we got back to my original viewing point the object had disappeared. we waited for a time but there was no sign of the object again. after returning home and speaking to my girlfriend she stated that she had the object in sight along with both of my children for approx. 15 minutes and she watched the object move in the air in a way that she has never seen an aircraft move before. she stated that the object was \"bouncing\" in the air and then it moved at an extreme rate of speed from side to side, this all occurred prior to me seeing the object. after i lost sight with the object my girlfriend stated that the object decended back below the trees and appeared to land in an unoccupied wooded area not far from residences. after i arrived home we got in to my truck and drove to the approx. area where i thought the object was and we drove down a state highway approx. 4 miles to the local airport, upon arriving at the airport we didn't see any air craft activity and the field and main hangar was dark. we then drove down along the local river and did not see anything out of normal, we then drove up to the area where she thought she saw it land, after driving around the perimeter of the area there were no signs of any activity and there were no lights in the woods. after i asked my girlfriend stated that after the object disappeared that it never reappeared again and i also never saw it again. during the event there was other air traffic in the area, but they were easy to identify as air planes where as this object defied anything i have ever seen.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

to the hotel i saw the orange orb-like object and it had a huge orange glowing tail behind it, but only briefly. the huge tail and the unique orange glow were what caught my eye, it was almost impossible not to see it if you looked anywhere south at that time. after 5 seconds or so the tail disappeared but the orange orb remained. i quickly drove into the parking lot and stopped so i could get out and get a better look. it disappeared completely for approximately 20 seconds then re-appeared slightly east of the last position i saw it in. it seemed just a bit smaller at this time, still bigger than a star but smaller than when i saw it with the tail. slowly it grew a bit bigger once more, then started moving east toward the atlantic, seemingly due east at first then it seemed to change direction and head south east. the object made several direction changes during the entire time i watched it, none drastic, but definitely enough of a direction change that there was no question it changed course. initially i thought maybe it was a meteor burning up in the atmosphere but it wasn't moving very fast at all and as i previously stated the tail disappeared but the orb remained where it was for at least 15 seconds before it disappeared and re-appeared. this makes the 3rd glowing orange orb that i've seen in the past 2 years, and at this point i was actually excited to see it. i lost sight of the object because it kept heading east/south east until it was too far away to see anymore. there were plenty of planes in the area due to traffic at lvi, and this object was much bigger and easily discernible from any common man-made aircraft. i hope someone else saw this one, it was awesome. if i were to guess the amount of time i actually watched it, i would say 4-6 minutes total. i was too damn excited to note the exact time i started and stopped watching, but it was somewhere around 11 p.M. sept. 6th 2013 (a friday night), and wasn't around for long before it moved so far south and east that i couldn't see it anymore.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

blvd when i noticed out of the upper portion of my front windshield that there was a green light coming through the low cloud cover so i smiled and glanced up to see the airplane as the only green light i assumed would come through was tht of a plane wing when i caught something which apparently came from space so fast that coming through the clouds so quickly made it seem as if a plane was just decending but then it stopped under the clouds and my eyes widened and then it shot 90 degrees from the outer space to earth direction to east from my position like a shooting star. the object was clearly two colors of green and blue and appeared oval in my memory though moving like thst may have made a circular ufo appear oval. my initial response was \"finally and wow, that just happened, but despite my prefrontal cortex saying \"cool, everything is okay and that was awesome\" my body was freaking out. my organs seemed to be in shock. it was hard to deal with and began effecting my mind because if my brain and body are acting this way even though i prefer to act another then this must be more serious then i imagined. i recalled a study where distilled water was effected by an object or label and decided to go to the park up the street midnight and get palm fruit to mix with distilled water so i could bathe in it and hope the vibration did something for my organs and mind. it seemed to help and ever since ive been watching the sky, trying to meditate and communicate, searching for more answers than ever before. i have always been higher consciousness, since a very young age, but this was the first time i saw something by myself with such a low environmental influence or prank potential to take the credit. i tried finding a site to connect and report the sighting and see if anyone else was talking bout it but never found anything. after seeing serius with dr steven greer, i found this site and reported it asap, with about an hour digging up details to recall the
