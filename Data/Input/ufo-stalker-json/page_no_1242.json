(channel islands) between 8 and 9 p.M. i went out to take a walk along the harbor that ran parallel to harbor blvd. in a northern direction. it was a very quiet night and no one else was around. i believe but not sure that it was a friday. i glanced towards the west (toward the open ocean) where a line of homes were. at that exact time i noticed a light above a home (but i knew it was further out over water) rising straight up...Slowly. as it rose, it was getting brighter and bigger (almost the size of a quarter at arms length at the largest). as it rose, (no sounds could be heard due to distance i believe) i notice the bottom part of the object looked like a welders flame, triangular (wide at the top and pointed at the bottom). then, it stopped ascending, the ball of light collapsed and became a small starlike point of light and began to fly in a straight line towards the south (l.A.) as if it were a plane. it actually behaved like a typical plane en route into l.A.X. with blinking aviation lights. i kept track of it until i couldn't see it anymore. by the time i realized i should take a picture or video, it was already a small light going south and nothing came out in the picture but darkness. this whole incident lasted no more than 5 minutes between the time i noticed it acsending and losing it flying towards l.A.\r\ninteresting sighting to say the least.\r\nthank

or 5th. of this month blew my mind, but this one is disturbing. \r\n\r\na very bright green orb came out of the water on to the sand, then flattened itself. (i'm insane, right?)  yes, it flattened. this highly odd sight then ventured at speeds i can hardly explain, raced down the shoreline, around the sand, over a public beach restroom, back to it original spot, then disappeared back in the water.  did it again after about 3 minutes.  never witnessed it again after that, and i stayed on my waterfront patio quite some time after that, looking, as you can imagine.  two sightings in two weeks.  the aerial was an unknown shape; quite distant, although noticeable purple, red, green, yellow, let's just say \"rainbow\" lights running around the shape of it.  my husband actually witnessed that one.  i know i am not going mad.  i'm beginning to feel this is a highly active area here by the bay.  i just wish someone could explain the 'water orb\" to me. i know what i witnessed.  i just cannot wrap my head around it.  and my feelings on this?   wish someone else could have witnessed this.  highly anxious to see it again.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:00:25","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":50867,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.8211373,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09162013-0021","longitude":-97.3902699,"occurred":1379392020000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Flash","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1379399099000,"summary":"Green blurred orb comming out of bay onto sand/ erratic movement","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"78402","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Corpus Christi, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:257500"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Sitting in my living room i noticed a bright object outside my window around 9 pm.  it was a large bright orange glowing orb moving slowly in an ascending arc high in the sky.  i was thinking about the size and color being unusual as another one appeared... like it had been shot out of something because it appeared out of nowhere where i first noticed the first one.  in the sky from my viewpoint it was larger than an aspirin but smaller than a dime... so much larger than a star or plane lights...And constant glow, not blinking . the bright orange color was very unusual.  then a third one appeared but it seemed more reddish orange.   they followed the same path and disappeared out of my view.  they were moving slowly but the sighting was less than 2 minutes.  i didn't hear any noise and i was thinking if it could be some sort of fireworks but my dog always barks at them and she didn't notice.
