lights at a distance between the trees rising as if it were fireworks. looking up towards the moon i noticed they were traveling from the south to the north going directly above my head. they were at a very high altitude. going in a straight line at a constant speed i counted about a dozen red lights. this line, not a perfect formation lasted about 2 minutes, directly after this i noticed two airplanes, coming from the southeast. they were at a low enough altitude for me to see the whole shape of the plane. these two planes crossed paths. this is unusual because i would consider this a near crash. would you please investigate this situation. i was in my proper fram of mind and this is not a hoax. at least check about the near miss with the two planes. one plane was on an intercept course towards the redlights. the lights dissappeared before downtown . there was no trail of light. the red lights were a perfect circle as they were approaching me, while overhead and as the past me. this in itself is unusual.\r\n i did not take pictures but i was not the only one who saw this. the sky was clear that night. the objects were very high and about half inch in diameter.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

in an arcing motion lasting about 15sec similar of what you would expect to see from a shooting star or meteor although there was no light emitting trail. the brightness of the object varied then stopped, it lit up bright then went dimmed  blacked out.  it seemed to come out of nowhere.  \r\n\r\nit relit, shot up at an angle in a wobbling motion, the object was randomly lighting up and off going in a wobbling circular motion  like trying to gain attitude then falling somewhat. this last for about 3-5 minutes. varying from left to right, up and down and  lights sporadically going on and off then the object  seemed to stabilized  \r\n\r\ni continued to watch for about 1minute  the object would go completely dark staying in one spot to  fully illuminated and then randomly blinking three or four times  then go dark this occurred a few times.  at this point my dog distracted me and i looked down. when i looked back up to the sky the light/object was gone.","distance":"Over One

backyard to star gaze, it was a clear cool night with no cloud cover, and the was moon positioned in the southern sky. i noticed planes and even some satellites. i decided to bring out my camera with my tripod to photograph the stars, something i hadn't tried before. my photos turned out great, and i was surprised to see so many stars, some i couldn't even see with the naked eye. however, in three sets of photos, i noticed some objects i could not explain. i'd like to mention that i took photos of planes and satellites, and they made a trail, due to the exposure rate i had set on my camera, so i know what they look like in a photo. there is also a small airport about a mile from the home, so i'm familiar with conventional aircraft in the area. in these sets, i had photos taken of the same area over the course of about a minute, so as to see the movement of the stars. i have three sets of three photos each to report.\r\n\r\nin one of the sets, the second photo revealed a squiggly object, which only appeared in that photo, neither the preceding nor proceeding photo had any shot of this object. it appeared as two squiggles, but that is because of minor shaking by me. the time stamp of this set is 8:18:24 p.M ,8:18:34 p.M, and 8:18:44 p.M. photos are 7017 to 7019.\r\n\r\nin the second set of photos, an object appears in the second photo, in the bottom right quadrant of the frame. it is above and to the right of binary stars, or two stars next to each other, but then disappears.  the timestamp of this set is 10:34:55 p.M, 10:35:10 p.M, and 10:35:29 p.M. photos are 7106 to 7108.\r\n\r\nthe last set has an object appearing in each of the photos of the set, in the bottom right quadrant of the frames, seen moving in the opposite direction of the stars.It can be seen about 35 degrees to the right from the pink star at the bottom of the photo, and then moving southwest in the frame, between two two stars! the timestamp of this set is 10:39:39 p.M, 10:39:56 p.M, and 10:40:14 p.M. photos are 7118 to 7120. \r\n\r\ni showed these photos to my family, and edited the photos in order to see the objects more clearly, but am still unsure of what they are. i have the raw images available for further analysis, as/if necessary. we just want to know what they are, as it has us stumped. there was another set of five photos wherein an object is in the upper right side of the frame, moving down as the photos progress, but it is very faint, and so it isn't included in this report.

ringing.Then i went on to my back porch and noticed silver balls appearing out of the darkness.I noticed how they were rising out of the ground and covered by reflective surface.Within minutes the fog cleared and it became visible a large metallic shape.Id guess it was miles across.I thought i was loseing it.\r\nthe next night i noticed the lights were ,moveing around in the back yard.I know every star and these did not make since these were not of ground but at a height of 50 feet away.I became aware of them and have been documenting everything since then.Know they are comeing right up to me and allowing me to capture them clearly.I have amazing proof of how they work.They hide in front of a lightsource and project there image threw that source.Much like a hologram does.They are watching every neighbour and scanning us.They are talking to me but i wont report that here.This is not one sighting its been every day since and i have taken a thousand images and want it all to be released.Also i wont say everything here.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"12:18:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,  Other","flightPath":"Hovering then

moving across the sky so i then thought it might be a satellite but moving much faster than satellites that i had seen in the past. i kept watching as it traveled across the sky and then it turned upward and as it ascended it faded out. i was trying to get my brother to look but by the time he turned it was gone. i then called my dad and let him know what just occurred.
