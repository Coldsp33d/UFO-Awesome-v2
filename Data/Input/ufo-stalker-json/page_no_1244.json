was in my room studying for an upcoming exam. out of the window, i spotted a very bright white light, fairly close to the horizon. at first i dismissed it as some conventional aircraft (most likely a plane) but after a few separate glances i thought it wasn't moving at all. just hovering, but far too bright to be a star (especially since i live in the middle of a city). due to recent sightings i'd had from my bedroom window before, i decided to film the light for a while to see if i could capture any abnormalities, thinking to myself if there was nothing i would delete the video and never tell anyone i was silly enough to record it.\r\n\r\nas i started recording, the object began to move ever so slowly to the east. it maintained a fairly constant speed and barely even seemed to be moving. i started to think i was just seeing a plane at an odd angle and it was nothing. just before i shut off the recording function on my phone, a second light appeared right next to the first. it was identical in shape, size and color. the first continued to move to the east, and as i review the tape i realize it did slowly gain speed. the second object moved at a slower pace, but headed in the same general direction as the first.\r\n\r\ni followed their continual movement as it moved south-east of the starting position. eventually i could no longer see them from the window with the camera or my naked eye. i was shocked and somewhat frightened by the experience, and immediately went to show my mother the video. i was also very excited to catch something so odd on video, and have since been unable to explain the sudden appearance of the second object from no where.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering

called me into her bedroom to look at something outside. i went into her room and looked out the window and saw three orange lights. one looked almost flame like while the other two looked more like actual lights. i stared at the flame like one thinking it must be a meteor, but i've seen a meteor before and the more i looked at it the more i knew that it wasn't one. my grandmother said when she first saw it she thought it was a firework because it started out as a pinwheel shape and spread out, but there was no fireworks. once i got into her room to see them they were moving straight and in more a triangular shape, these lights were pretty low, pulsating, moving very slowly and in a straight path. some would disappear and reappear. so after watching from the window for a minuet i ran out into the living room to grab my cell phone and ran outside. in that 20 seconds it took me to get outside the three lights next to our house had disappeared and they either appeared across the street or new ones formed. again there were three distinctive pulsating lights, none of them were flame like this time they were all bright orange lights. they again were moving very slowly and steady, some other orange lights would appear and disappear but these three stayed put. at times it appeared as if they were hovering and then they would slowly start moving again. after a minuet most of the lights disappeared except for two. they were heading in the same direction in unison. then the one on the \"top\" started to slowly make it's way toward the light on the bottom. once they got close to each other the lights disappeared into thin air and never appeared again....As i witnessed this i pulled out my cellphone and started recording. i have a 22 second video showing the two lights. the whole encounter lasted a good 3 to 4 mins i would say. i have lived in this neighborhood for over 20yrs and i have never seen anything like this before. i was completely mystified, my sister and i were looking at each other like did we really just see what we think we saw? we both watch a ton of alien and ufo shows but never in a million years did we ever think we would see something like that. i firmly believe we witnessed a ufo.

rates of speed. he became suspicious when the craft began to make quick loops and it appeared to be doing tricks in the sky. it would move abruptly from side to side and up and down and then in a circular pattern again. suddenly on the video the craft disappears into thin air. he says that the beam resurfaced approximately 400-500 feet in the sky and began to turn in circles so fast that it appeared to distort the part of the sky that was within the circle it made. he described it to have the same effect of heat rising from the grown and seeing how it slightly distorts the image of the

smooth,but like hexagonal sections,which all seemed to contain the wonderful light show.\r\n\r\ni was amazed and stunned, like the saying goes,like a rabbit caught in the headlights of a car.The

still haunts me and i just need people to know about it. a few years ago i was living at my grandpas house in the hills of clearlake california. he worked out of town and was only at the house a few times a month, so i was fairly secluded. lake county is, for the most part, a very rural area. my house was on the top of a hill near the highway, but still very quiet.. \r\nnow, i've always had trouble sleeping and i had actually gotten to bed at a reasonable hour that night, but i woke up around 4am feeling restless. i wasnt surprised at this behavior, it happened often around the time, so i stepped outside to get some fresh air. i had been hearing strange things outside around my house that week so decided to grab my flashlight. i mean hearing strange things i mean like footsteps and almost guttural noises, growls and low grunts.. i thought it was maybe a deer? a bobcat? a cougar? whatever. i wanted to scare it away, or at least just see what it was.. but to my surprise that night when i shined my light out at where the noise was coming from, i saw glowing eyes and something stood up. tall, at least it seemed to me. it was about 3ft taller than the grass around it, which was probably about 4ft tall itself.. it seemed mad and i was so scared that i couldnt even scream. i wanted to and tried because i had family that lived nearby, i thought maybe they could see what i was seeing, or maybe i could scare this.. thing, away from me. but i couldnt get myself to make a noise, like something was blocking me. i tried hard to yell as loud as i could, nothing came out. and then i remember getting a very good look at this thing.. its skin was brownish, light brown splotched with dark brown with kind of a grey shade to it. it seemed to have holes in its body on its shoulder, arms, neck, chest... it had a humanoid frame ridges on its arms legs chest and head.. its head was larger than normal, and so were its eyes, almost almond shaped, but still kind of rounded. the skin seemed like sharks skin, texture wise, or like what elephant skin without all the wrinkles would look.. \r\nafter i had tried to scream i found myself stuck staring at its eyes, frozen in fear, standing on my deck in my boxers(thats actually an important detail) and its eyes went from pitch black to having kind of human eyes. a round pupil and cornea, except it turned amber, vibrant amber and spurred up like a flame.. then i blacked out. i remember feeling myself being moved like i weighed nothing, as if i was a child. i rememer some dialogue even, but thats a different story. \r\ni woke up the next morning with no immediate recollection of what happened, found it strange that i was on the top of my covers, fully clothed, and facing the wrong way on my bed.. i told myself this was only a dream until i started thinking about it more.. things don't add up. they still don't. someone please help me make sense of this..\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less,
