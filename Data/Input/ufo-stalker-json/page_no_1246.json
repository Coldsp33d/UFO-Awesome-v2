in wise county in texas, we also live on 5 acres in the country, myself and my two daughters were sitting outside on our back porch one night around 9:30ish playing with our new kittens only a couple months old, all the sudden from the corner of my eye on the east side of our house i see these 4 objects shaped like diamonds or kites whichever you want to choose, they were a very pretty red color, and one of them was bigger then the other 3, and they stay close together hovering low, maybe treetop, but they were not huge like a spaceship, they come around to directly face us {now facing south} stop and it almost seems like watching us for a few seconds, although i could not see inside the object it just felt like that, i guess you could say i was not believing what i was seeing, i tell my oldest daughter to run get the camera, when she comes back out they have moved over to the other side of our house now west, and just sit there a few seconds, she tried to take a picture but it did not work, i think she was just nervous and did not wind it because it was not a digital camera...Then they move back south and go out a little ways onto the property that backs up to ours, still just hovering, then they spread out, sit there a few seconds, then ascend into the sky {never making a sound this whole time} and just like that they are gone...They never twirl, or spin just kind of move this way and that...Left, right, up, down. i read about y'all on youtube so came here to your site to tell this story, i always wondered if anyone else saw them that night and maybe reported it, i never did, and would not have known who to contact anyway, so here is my story, it may be to old to be of any interest to y'all, but thought i would tell it anyway.

could have been over walnut creek too. i walked out onto the deck of the back yard with the lights off.  i had a creepy feeling like someone was in the bushes so i went back in and turned the light on. i walked out and went all the way to the end which is the length of the house.  i turned around and started walking back to the other end of the deck when i see it just over the tree tops. we have tall trees all around so it could not be too far away. i was dumbstruck at what i saw and immediately thought it was not man made. \r\n\r\nit was a boomerang shape, but reminded me of a nintendo game controller.  so it had a u shape curve at the front, but had stuff in the middle.  i thought it was translucent with a blue glow over the whole thing.  there was one white light on each end of the arms.  there seemed to be a red/orange faint hue at a large circle at the front center curved part, but it didn't stay on. \r\n\r\ni stood there for at least 40 seconds while it did not make a move or make a sound.  when i was sure i was looking at something i could not explain, i screamed for my mom to come outside and check it out. i was very excited and loud about it, waving my arms trying to get her to hustle. as soon as i yelled for her the craft began to move very slowly. it was almost done changing shape by the time she was able to look.\r\n\r\nit seemed like the two arms, the ends with the white lights began to move towards each other. if you put your arms straight out in front of your and begin to move them together and the left arm goes slightly above your right would be what it looked like to me.  so then the two white lights are now vertical and the ship looks like it morphed into a tube.  one white light at top and bottom and its all illuminated blue in the middle, there may have been softer faint white lights in the middle. it begins to float away with crooked movement, it seemed like the tube bent a little bit in the middle for a second. it floated up and moved east very slowly behind the trees.  total viewing time is approximately 2 minutes. \r\n\r\ni was shocked, scared, and totally excited at the same time.\r\n\r\ni got in my car and tried to follow it, but i never saw it after it went behind the trees.  i did see a black helicopter moving very fast towards the direction of my sighting.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

blurry.  however, nothing else we observed was blurry.  it was therefore not the binoculars; it was the object.  it appeared to have a strange aura.  tonight i thought it looked like the top of a jellyfish--round, transparent--or perhaps the top of a parachute.  it was not an aircraft or a bird or insect.  it was not a balloon or plastic bag.  it held a steady course, moving faster than such wind-blown objects. we could come up with no reasonable, logical, natural explanation for what we witnessed.  it flew across the sky in a straight line with no sound or deviation of movement--just a strange fuzzy aura around it. it eventually flew out of view. i told my wife i would go online tonight and see if i could find anyone else who may have seen such an object.  sure enough, i did see a few online descriptions of \"flying jellyfish.\"  however, this object had no tentacles or appendages hanging beneath its basic round structure.  with the binoculars, i got the impression that it may have had several seams radiating from its center toward the perimeter, like an umbrella. in fact, the round edge may have been more like an umbrella than a perfect circle.  strange to see this thing

sighting to mufon but i was still 17 at the time & needed consent from my parents, now i'm 20. so now i can explain my report  without any age problems.\r\n\r\nalso the photos i provided are of the exact location. i found the closest example of how the diamond craft i saw looked like & putting it in some of the  positions if hovered pass, also the craft i saw is about double the size of what i've shown in the video, this craft was so massive that as it hovered above me it took up the entire night sky, i could not see any light coming from the moon, only light i saw was coming from the bottom of the craft. with that being said i can begin my very 1st sighting.\r\n\r\n\r\napril 19th, 2010. i sneaked out of the house on this night & walked a few miles to my friends house. around 11 at night i began to walk back home.\r\ni'm on dean road surrounded by dense florida forest on both sides.\r\ni'm walking on the side of a dangerous road with many fast moving cars driving. i'm on the right side of the road as i begin to walk the bridge location shown in pictures. \r\n\r\nfirst thing i noticed before i even saw the craft a faint sound from the north east coming closer & closer. this sound sounded like some strange type of radar or tracking device it had a rhythm to it which very much got my attention, so while walking i keep on looking above the tree line when i finally see something large slowly hovering above the tree line you see in the photo which my guess would be 20 feet or less from the bridge in which i was walking on so this became such a very close distance  ufo sighting that very quickly i knew exactly what this was cause i could see everything in such factual detail.\r\n\r\nso now the object is still slowly hovering, still making that faint radar sound yet i could not hear any type of engine, what i heard was a very faint sound that i could also feel. my theory is what i felt was gravity/air being pushed down against me, remember how close this sighting is, hence why i could feel the hover craft at work. it took a good 15-20 seconds for the craft to fully reveal its full size which i have stated before it was massive. this very much felt like what could be a mothership.\r\n\r\nat this time cars driving by were honking at me cause all they saw me doing was looking straight up in the sky without looking at the road cause this too precious to not keep my eyes on it. also i feel that most cars driving may not have seen this craft. not sure on that part.\r\n\r\nso now we are at the next 45 seconds where the craft is in full view still slowly hovering above me taking up the entire night sky, like i said before i could not see the moonlight what so ever, so use the picture of the location as a reference to the size, imagine the entire sky being taken up, truly massive & mesmerizing.\r\n\r\nthe all black massive diamond shaped craft had many random blinking lights in random locations & random colors ranging from the ones i checked out before. still the craft hovering slowly above me & the bridge, still hearing the radar sounds & hearing & feeling the air being pushed down by the hovering device. i begin to run a bit to stay in sight as the craft begins to hover away to the treeline on the left of the location i showed. \r\n\r\nnow is when im off the bridge & on grass as the craft is now over the treeline to my left getting further & further away while i hear the radar sound & very faint hovering getting further away. i am beyond jaw dropped yet totally understand what just happened, me coming from puerto rico a huge hot spot for ufo activity, my dad has seen many in pr & my older brother was abducted by greys in pr too, i know this is off topic but i have to say this, about my brother, after his abduction he noticed a small metal object in his skin, he showed me as a kid & till this day still has it on his arm... ok now back to my 1st sighting.\r\n\r\nby this point i can not see the craft anymore but still can hear the radar until it all is out of sight. by this point my entire life had changed right in front of me, it was like experiencing a science fiction movie & i'm a science fiction writer so this experience plus the ones that followed with the next 2 years after this give me... lots of experience on the subject. \r\n\r\nnow something very strange that relates to this sighting & my next sighting which strangely enough happened exactly 1 year after the event i just explained, i will explain my 2nd sighting since it was very brief.\r\n\r\napril 19th, 2011\r\nat a friends house in their backyard. all my friends were drinking & doing keg stands, i do not drink at all, so i'm entirely sober while everyone is entirely drunk, loud & not aware at all of the night sky. me on the other hand is just looking up in the sky cause by this point in my life this something i would do regularly, always keeping an eye on the sky.\r\n\r\nso during the time it takes for a keg stand is how fast this far away star/orb like all blue in color craft quickly hovers into my view of the night sky making such impossible sharp turns, in comparison to a bee or dragonfly flying how they just fly here, there or anywhere. so this is exactly what this craft did within the 10-15 second keg stand. the craft came in & out of view within this short time hovering in such a fast manor.\r\n\r\nthen they finished doing the keg stand for the host of the party while everyone cheering & very drunk i'm there still looking at the sky just in case it comes back into view... i told my friends later that night & they thought i was crazy, they all know about my 1st sighting, this is when i noticed that days date, april 19th, 2011. this is when i noticed the 1 year difference between both sightings. i'm not suggesting that these two crafts are the same one cause they are not. both craft varied in its qualities. it's very strange how my first 2 sightings occurred 1 year apart, for the sightings that followed those were 6 months to a year after this event. \r\n\r\nso now i leave off on this sighting report, i know it is very late, i tried reporting sometime after the 1st sighting happened & had complications cause of my age at the time that i didn't want to deal with.\r\n\r\ni will try & post my other sightings very soon. these others sightings are just as strange.
