first time we seen the object it was just a hovering, star-like, multi-coloured light off my back deck. it moved slowly but stayed in the same area of the sky. the second time was a bit different, a plane flew by what looked like the same object. the plane kept moving and slowly got bigger and bigger till it passed overhead. however the glowing object (same as the prior night) stayed in the same area. after a few seconds the object started to drop rapidly then just stopped. the object was in the same location as the prior night, the object looked the exact same and did the exact same movements. the object was seen the second night for hours. i would continuously go outside and still see it, sometimes it would be in a slightly different location or have a different coloured glow

side (or each wing?), and one in the center above all the other lights. the object flew in the same manner, erratic. we couldn't believe it. the object then flew right over king george road, we hopped in the car to chase it. chased it towards kensington where it flew low and started gaining speed. it then disappeared for about 5 minutes as we drove around and couldn't find it anywhere. as were driving towards memorial and powerline we see the same object hovering over the fields towards powerline and governors road. the object had turned off all flashing red,blue,pink lights and was staying almost perfectly still with only its white bright light one (which had a weird pulse to it). the object started to rise a bit and we realized there was no way we could catch it. we drove back to my house (where we seen the first 2 sightings) and seen the same object over in the same area as it was the first 2 times hovering by powerline and memorial. it started pulsing again like usual and moved to the left, to the right, and up and down. then just sat there like it had the other nights. we watched it for another hour or so then went inside. a few hours later i went outside and it was gone.

the southeast & noticed a bright orange orb floating slowly in an easterly direction. i called for my wife and she and i watched the bright object as it moved below heavy cloud cover. the orange light moved slowly until it eventually disappeared into the clouds. this was our 4th or 5th sighting of this type of object. i see them as all being the exact same type of object however my wife feels that one of the objects was different. it sounds funny but she felt that one of the sightings we had was more spiritual in nature. that encounter was followed by the sighting of a white canine that we'd never seen before on our property. i am familiar with chinese lanterns however i have never seen one close up. i find it strange that we've seen these months apart at different times of the evening. sometimes they pulsate randomly. sometimes the brightness is consistent. there is never any type of trail but at times it has seemed to either ascend or descend. when we saw our first object i thought

a third light seeming to hang below. the lower light seemed to be slowly swinging left to right. as we watched, a fourth light(red) came on above the two upper lights,slightly to the left. next,two green lights appeared to the right and left of the red light. here's where it gets really weird, the two green lights rotated first left 180 degrees,then right 180 around the red light as all three swung slowly to the left and right. it almost appeared as if they were waving to us like they knew we had noticed them. then the colored lights went out but the white lights stayed on.Initially the

decided to take a walk down a quiet street where there was a small beach to watch the stars. there were two men fishing in the darkness at the beach and they moved off down the beach when we sat down. we stayed for about 15 minutes and were about to leave when i looked straight up at the stars and slightly behind us overhead a 'fireball' was moving slowly towards the ocean from the direction of the hills. we were sitting in front of a high wall so could not see very far behind so do not know where it came from. only that it was big about the size of a 3/4 moon, and moving in a straight line right over the restaurant we had come from or so it seemed. we wondered what it was. i first thought it was a ufo but tried to reason that it could be a meteor but it had no tail, no sound and was too

smoking a cigarette, like i normally do, and i noticed this bright star that i saw the other day and then it disappeared the other day too. so because i knew that it wasn't a star because i noticed it the other day and then it was gone, i looked at it very carefully. it just looked like the brightest star in the sky but i noticed that it was bouncing around, so to speak. it was moving up and down and left and right and maybe forwards and backwards but i couldn't tell. it was mostly a white light but i noticed a little bit of color in there too. \r\n\r\ni actually went inside of my house and got my mother to show the ufo to her. she came out on to the porch and noticed it was moving around in place too. she didn't watch it as long as i did but at first she said \"i see it moving up, it must be an airplane\". then i called her out maybe 20 minutes later to show her that it was still in the same spot, but not exactly. airplanes don't hover and bounce around in place like this ufo did. and then later i called her out on the front porch to look at it one last time because the ufo was moving behind a big tree in the neighbors yard. (the ufo was pretty far away and pretty high up but not that far away because i saw it.) so the last time she went on the porch she had to go way to the left side of the porch to see the ufo that was slowly moving behind the tree. \r\n\r\ni watched the ufo for maybe 1 hour or so, give or take. the coolest thing about it was that it was basically hovering in place but it was bouncing around from left to right and up and down. i definitely noticed that it was moving because i sat on a seat on my porch and put a power line in between me and the ufo. i then kept my head very still and i noticed that the ufo was going up and down relative to that power line wire that was blocking the ufo. at first the ufo was above that same power line wire and by the time it moved behind the tree it was below that power line wire, and by quite a bit too. so from my perspective it descended. \r\n\r\nso at first i thought it was a star but i knew the other day that there was a \"star\" that just disappeared from the sky so i thought it might be a similar ufo and that's why i watched for so long or otherwise i would have passed it off for a bright star. \r\n\r\nmy feelings were that i think the aliens are coming to visit. i was a little amazed that i noticed the ufo bouncing in place and then move so much, but very, very slowly. \r\n\r\ni lost sight of the ufo because it went behind a big tree in my neighbors yard. \r\n\r\nthanks!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":50696,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.64125867753398,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09082013-0025","longitude":-70.95018063414055,"occurred":1378701000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1378708751000,"summary":"It looked like a bright star was bouncing around and moving until i couldnt see it any more.

i95, and traffic was very heavy that day.  it started backing up about 2 miles from the scudders falls bridge, which spans the delaware river that separates nj and pa.  about a half mile from the bridge there is a nice view of the western sky and treeline in pennsylvania before going down the hill to the bridge.  since mercer county airport is nearby, it is common to see planes approaching the airport from that direction.  i was sitting in bumper to bumper traffic at this spot and i noticed a large, glowing object that looked much bigger than a plane, appeared to be stationary, and was over the treeline in pa.  not too far and to the left of the object was a dark, rectangular object that was slowly moving with a \"speck\" in front of it. even from that distance i could tell that the \"speck\" was a small plane towing a rectangular sign, like you see at the jersey shore.  i watched the 3 objects for for a few seconds, but glanced away to make sure the traffic wasn't moving.  i looked back, and the large, strange object was gone!  the plane and sign were still there. i did notice that the plane and sign were moving away from where the strange object was.  i looked and looked, but could not find the odd looking aircraft.  traffic had began to move, and i crossed the bridge into pennsylvania.  \r\n\r\nas i passed the exit for yardley/newtown, (the second exit in pa from the bridge) i caught a glimpse of a huge object in the air to the right of the exit!  i wanted to get off the exit to get a better look, but there was a very long line of cars in the exit lane.  after i passed under the underpass and then passed the cars entering 95 south from that exit, i saw the object again for a couple of seconds.  it had jagged, protruding sides, was white, looked big and not very high up.  since i was passing by in my car, i could not tell if it was moving or making any noise.  it definitely was not a regular plane or helicopter.  unfortunately i could only view this thing for a couple of seconds because the trees on the side of the road obscured it.  i did see the biplane towing the sign, which was advertising univest right after seeing the unknown object. it was on the opposite side of i95, and i saw it again when i got off at the 413 penndel exit.  i did not see the unknown object again, though. my only regret is not pulling off the highway so that i could view the unidentified aircraft better.  because of the heavy traffic conditions, i knew i would have a hard time getting back onto i95. there must be other people who saw this strange object.  it was rush hour, and the traffic was horrendous that day!  the object had to be visible from route 332 and township line road (shadybrook farm area).\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

and my parrots in the outside aviaries. \r\ni went for a walk to check how far the flames were and how immanent a threat.\r\n\r\nso i looked up the mountain on our property to see if i could see flames and not just smoke. so i noticed a 'plane' fly over. we get a lot of small planes around here, but then when i looked at it. it had no wings.\r\n\r\ni looked at it again, like a butterfly without wings, how does it fly? that couldn't possibly work is what i thought. if i had to describe it, from my view point in 2d.\r\n\r\nit was a long cream coloured rectangle with almost like a attachment on the back end. like the hilt of a sword. it was not going fast, same speed as a little plane would fly, but no wings.\r\n\r\nnot fast enough for a missle and there were no line behind it. it was just weird.\r\n\r\nhonestly it didn't have a lot of relevance at the moment the fire and the possibility of losing my home was a much bigger concern on my mind, i kept on my walk and checked on the flames and the wind speed.\r\n\r\nalso if anyone ever shows up here asking about ufos i'll send you packing.
