my desk/computer in my home.  the lights were so bright and stationary (and therefore very different from what i usually see from this window, i.E. normal airplane traffic and occasional helicopters) that i got in my car and drove to the top of a hill near my house.  the lights then separated into several pulsating orange/red lights.  the lights stayed in fixed position (i.E. did not move/float/dissipate for several minutes). i took few photos with my phone and then took a video.  at first i thought they could be chinese lanterns, or some science experiment from some university students (i live very near san diego state university), but due to the fact that the same lights were seen in tijuana, mexico on the same night, it sort of rules out that logical explanation. i found two videos of these lights on youtube for the same night (september 28, 2017), both looking up from the ground.  one video is from san diego, and one is from a beach in tijuana, mexico.  my video timed itself as 8:31pm pacific time. i am unable to attach the video because it is too large, but i will attach 2 photos.  i will hopefully attend next local mufon meeting in san diego to show my

would go from a light orange to a dark orange. they were very small. there were also white lights as well. again, tiny tiny lights. then he started to notice orbs flying around with his naked eye. i couldn't see it. i grabbed my phone and in looking through the camera of my phone i could see the orbs. they would move no higher than 10' off the ground, literally to the ground. i got up to walk towards the small lights and the orbs would come towards me. i photographed a blue orb. the video i have of the orbs is not blue. at one point gff saw 8. they were all around me and also at my feet. only when i approached the tiny lights did the orbs move closer to me.\r\n\r\nat this point i turned around and looked the complete opposite direction and there at a 40 or 50 degree angle in the sky was a big round object.\r\nit was pulsating a code. flashing white and red colors as the code. there were fast blinks and slow, more methodical blinks. there were other normal street lights or typical lights you see at a campground. this was neither. i knew immediately this was a ufo. \r\n\r\ni look to my right 20 degree angle from a horizontal line through me to my right was a very bright pure star light. it was the purest color i have ever seen. the only way i can describe it is looking into a pure diamond in the day light. it is beautiful white perfection. the same exact light to my left. both of these lights were roughly 10' hovering off the ground, and roughly 30 yards each away from me. the blinking light in the sky and these two lights formed a perfect triangle. as i turned back around i could now see more small lights. don and i were directly in the center of this phenomenon. i captured video of an orb bouncing around with the main ufo in the air. multiple videos of orbs lining up with main pulsating object. i could not capture video of all three at a time. they were too far apart.\r\nthe star like ufo to my right was blinking ever so slowly at one point, appearing to signal the one on my left. i have this on video. i never saw the one on my left blink.\r\n\r\nthe light to my right was just left of a tree. i looked to the right of the tree and i could literally see, as best i can describe it as gravity displacement from the light. the objects to the right, were all waving in this displacement. it was literally only about a 5' displacement. \r\n\r\nthe last thing we noticed was the sky above us and to the right was a deep haunted blue color. it was a massive color. as far as you could see it was this color. again, above and only to the right. it did blink, ever so slightly from the deep blue to black. i have never seen the sky this color in my life.\r\n\r\nalso, during this experience we would look up and see one tree moving vigorously from the \"wind\" but the tree right next to it was not moving at all. \r\n\r\ni cannot explain what i saw. i have never seen anything like this in my life. it was an unbelievable experience. i was in awe and not scared. i was only scared to walk towards the objects to my right and left, and did not.\r\n\r\nnote:i have a lot of video. i will not release the rights to your organization. a member of your team is welcome to meet with me to view them.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

avenue near carleton university.  overcast skies, low clouds.  i noticed in the sky directly in front of me a large number of small lights (about 20-30 lights) flashing in the sky just above clouds in sequential pattern format (like choreography - travelling in a light pattern.  at first, i thought it was a light show of some sort, but then realized that the light show was directly over the 6 lanes of road, so the light show idea could not make sense at all.  then, noticed a larger series of lights in the form of a disc quite low behind the clouds, just over the road ahead of me.  the lights flashed in a sequential format - a few white lights at a time, rotating around in a circle format (from this format, i could tell it was a disc shape object, by the way the lights were forming a perfect circle).  then, as i continued driving closer to downtown, i looked out the car window again and saw the lights take off in all different directions and then vanish in the night sky.  \r\n\r\nsince i was driving, i was not able to take photos.  i quickly turned around and watched the sky to the south direction on the same road, but saw nothing.  \r\n\r\ni wonder if anyone else noticed as it was quite a spectacle in the sky for just a few (5) minutes, but clearly something other than an airplane (round, no sound, hovering low in the sky just behind the clouds, sequential flashing lights).  and, when the lights took off in all directions, again no sound, just ultra fast dispersement and then nothing.  no one can convince me that this light display was fireworks, a low-flying plane, a weather balloon, etc.  this was clearly something beyond comprehension.  it would be interesting to see other reports from ottawa tonight - all seeing the same thing as we saw.\r\n\r\nit was quite thrilling to see something of this size.  it was huge.  and the smaller lights with it - about 20 or 30 all travelling together.  wow.\r\n\r\nand, no - i was not drinking or taking any drugs.  i had a clear head, good vision, and sound mind.  my husband was with me in the car and he saw the exact same things that i saw.  two witnesses.","distance":"101-500
