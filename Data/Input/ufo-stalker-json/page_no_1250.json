go home. at the same time my dog was sitting on my porch watching my girlfriend leave as well. after she left, i attempted to let my dog back into my house but he refused so i let him stay outside a little longer knowing he was not going to want to be there out much longer. i waited at my door and decided to look at the sky to search for stars and enjoy the night sky. i looked straight ahead towards the east and saw a commercial airplane that was miles away coming my way towards the west! not less than a second later to the southeast of my position i saw a greenish-white orb zoom past over my neighborhood coming from the west and heading to the east at an astonishing speed! it lasted no more than two seconds and disappeared before my eyes! i did not blink at all and nothing got in my way. the ufo was silent and did not leave any trails what so ever. it did not blink but instead maintained the glowing light it gave off. right after i saw the ufo i looked back at the airplane and it was still coming in the same direction and same location it was before i saw the ufo. then i let my dog in and called my girlfriend to tell her the exciting and bizarre news! i also yelled for my family to tell them what i saw as well even though i knew most of them were going to be skeptical. then i continued to look at the sky to see if i could see anything like it again! i know this was not a commercial airplane because for thirteen years i lived near o'hare international airport and i am familiar with their speed, size, lights, and sound. i know it was not a small airplane because they fly around where i live now and i know how fast they travel and how they look, sound, and how their lights blink on and off. none of the aircraft i have seen before, have a non-blinking light. it amazes me at how fast this thing traveled and how it did not make any sound at all and disappeared before my eyes. i must admit while i was excited to see it, i felt a little scared because i did not know what it's intentions were and i still don't. this is a mystery and i hope one day i can solve it and figure out what was going on in the night sky above me!","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet -

been thunderstorms to the south of us and and lite and dark gray clouds persisted as they moved in a se direction.  no rain at the time of the sighting tho the pavement showed there must have been a brief shower.  no lightning/thunder at the time i was there.  breeze, but not windy. comfortable temperature.  as i drove up the upgrade from the rr crossing, i was the only vehicle going either way...Very quiet traffic day.  i was ~ a bit n of the shadow pines apt. complex when i noted the larger white rectangular box-like 'thing' crossing 56th st. from east to west.  i noted i had not seen anything approaching and no vehicle like a truck pulling it, and then realized there were no wheels.  it appeared to move straight across the street about roof height, but not necessarily over the rooftops.  maybe going about 20-30 mph.  if it had turned off 56th st., straightened out and was being towed, i don't think it could have gone that fast that quickly.  behind it was the horizon with the dark gray clouds.  it seemed to just disappear.  i was going about 45 mph, the speed limit, and in the southbound lane, which widens at the point where shadow pines ln is, at which time i moved to the curb lane (southbound).  as i passed madalyn rd, i looked down it to the west and saw nothing...Just houses, a few cars parked on the street.  no trucks, no trailers, no activity at all.  i didn't note any trailers parked anywhere.  the street curves some, but i was only a few seconds behind and could see quite a ways down, and saw nothing like what i had seen crossing the roadway.\r\n\r\noverall, it seemed, like i noted, about the size of a popup camper when everything is packed and stowed.  except there were no other vehicles.  my window was down halfway and the radio was quite low with blues music, but i heard nothing unusual, as engines, or anything.  \r\n\r\ni was surprised to see nothing down the side street.  it made me feel, \"am i losing my mind?\"  \"what was that?!\"  \"is this how alzheimer's (or other dementia) starts?\"  i have always believed we could have 'visitors', because 'we' are indeed here.  but this is the first i recall an 'event' such as this.  i still don't know any more about it, and would like to.   i am willing to accept a reasonable explanation for what i saw, but no one has had one at all, let alone one that makes sense.  i thought and thought about whether i'd missed something.  it wasn't a 'flash' of a 'feeling' or a 'sight'...It was definitely moving directly across the path i was on...And then gone when i approached just a few secs. later.
