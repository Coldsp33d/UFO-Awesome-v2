facing north. as i walked towards the door/window i didn't see it and thought it was gone but as i backed up it came into view again so it was fairly high. i went to a different window in the house and saw it still, pulsating and every so often it would appear to have a ring. next i got the binoculars and couldn't believe what i saw. it was very far, i could see red, white, blue and green flashing lights and at times i could see a small disc shaped object. i say small because i needed the binoculars to be sure. in addition, it seemed to have a couple small - tiny small - lights come out of it. at this time i awoke my husband to have proof. he observed the same details as me and returned to bed. during this time the object started in the center of the window above my front door, moved slightly to the left and ended up to the right which told me i was not seeing a planet or star. in addition, it was a beautiful star filled sky. the stars were very bright, none were pulsating but this and it was very near the big dipper. i tried to take pictures with my iphone but they look like a white dot. so i attempted to take them with my canon 40d with a high aperture and no flash but they aren't good because the object was so far away it appears solid white. i was not able to capture the flashing/twinkling/sparkly lights. i can however see a red, green, and white, dot of light around the perimeter of the main object. notice in the 3 pictures the location of the red, blue and white lights in perspective to the main object are different in each image. the main object remained unmoved until around first light when you could still see the stars but it was gone. i didn't see it leave. my daughter woke up and we didn't want her to be afraid.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":50430,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.991421544792054,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09042013-0020","longitude":-94.32250646805053,"occurred":1378292400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1378339894000,"summary":"Pulsating/flashing multiple lights on an object in the northern sky","tags":["disc","lights"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/50430_submitter_file1__IMG2650.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/50430_submitter_file2__IMG2651.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/50430_submitter_file3__IMG2652.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"64064","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Lee's Summit, Missouri","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:262931"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed","city":"Edgewater","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Not here","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings,  Other","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":50429,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.9965754,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09042013-0019","longitude":-80.8985958,"occurred":1359705600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1378339505000,"summary":"Touched and examined","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"32141","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":215,"locationName":"Edgewater, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:262932"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed","city":"Michigan City","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I went salmon fishing on lake michigan at the michigan city light house at 5 a.M on 9/3. i noticed at 5;15 as i was casting north and looking north west at downtown chicago when i noticed a bright star take off and fly from west to east over the lake,flying real fast then slow down then rael fast then flew east to west then headed up the chicago coast north then headed back out to the lake east and up untill it dissapeared.A few minites later there it was again,this bright star stationary,then it flew from west to east at a 40% angle till it hit the water and it was gone again. a few minites went by and there it was again.This time i saw two of then flying in the same direction. one, i could see well,the other was a  mile or so from the other and you could barly see the second one.This went on for 24 minites. the next morning 9/4,i got out there to fish,instead i sat at the pinic tables and looked over the water and saw the same thing but this time they were further out in the middle of the lake and you could barly see them.I will try tonite and see what happens.I go fishing a lot in the dark and, am quite familar with all the nite skys lights, and this is the second sighting i have had over lake michigan in 45 years.These on 9/3 and 9/4 were orbs.

(44 mg) lets see what i can do.\r\npictures coming of what i saw???\r\n\r\n\r\ni know this is a bit strange but, seeing these objects was amazing\r\nand more curious. you know - we hear of ufo's and there's much debate \r\nas to they're existence and being a computer guy and engineer - well - i\r\nhave my doubts about a lot however, this is the first time that i saw something\r\nup hand which more than incredible. you might see one i suppose and not knowing what\r\nit is - well - it becomes a ufo however - when the whole \"freaking\" family shows up - you have to wonder.\r\nthere are too many scientists, people of knowledge that have presented evidence but, then again you say - we ain't caught one yet?? to that they say - yes we have. where do you go with it and is there substance.\r\nfrom what i saw - i'm a believer now.\r\ni'm going to pass one more thought to you - my last \"encounter\" if you will was monday evening and i tried to get pictures as well.\r\none tuesday morning i was whipped and - i crawled to the bed and made it down\r\nquickly (as you know i just got out of the hospital) when i awoke - i couldn't get my bearings - the bed was not under me. i was on my back on the bedroom floor facing the kitchen, the trash bucket turned over. i figured i'd take care of it later and made my way to the bed once again.\r\nas i lay, there was dripping coming from my mouth and i knew i must have taken a dive somehow (not recalling) and split my bottom lip but, on what??? getting up latter in which you worried, i checked the floor - no blood. i checked the doors (as if i might have passed out and hit one head on) - nothing. i checked my gums and my mouth but noticed my lips were not lacerated - not cut - and the injury didn't look like a hit to the mouth.\r\nrather - it looked like it had been \"burned\" inside my gums. it is healing now but - a point to ponder.\r\n\r\n\r\nexactly what i saw.\r\nsecondly, (no there are no woman except you). my neighbor came up this morning to ask how i was feeling and if i need anything - give a call. meanwhile she asked if i had chicken?? (that's all she seems to eat) she's having\r\nguests and running a bit low.\r\nwhile i was getting her supplies, chicken - asked her if she had seen anything unusual on sunday evening? she said, \"no but had to close her shades/blinds because the whole area was lit up and she didn't know why\". just annoying.

predators.\r\n\r\ntwo days later, the exact same occurrence took place. this is an event i have never seen since the lakes were constructed in 1972. so i took a close look at this fish, (a largemouth bass) and found parts of the fish missing. eyes, internal organs, anal area and a very strange 5/8\" (inch) perfectly round hole near the spinal area. no blood was present. having heard in the past that a hole of this caliber is common to mutilated animal cases. i handled the fish with surgical gloves, photographed the fish from many angles and then froze it.\r\n\r\ni then called linda moulton

allows, so for example, i could only fit two of the major stars in a constellation within the frame at a time. therefore this is a pretty small area of the sky (in twenty to thirty seconds the object traveled about the distance in the sky of half the length of a dollar bill if held up in front of your face).  i verified through skywatch that this was not a satellite.  i know that the two weather balloon launches that happen in vegas daily are in a completely different direction and besides, this traveled from side to side.  it was also not a meteor as it had no tail and clearly had its own power, in addition it faded both into sight and out of sight.\r\n\r\ni noticed the object as it faded into visibility close to the area i was currently photographing.  it started a pale blue green and

this summer. instead he pointed to the s/w area of the sky about 25 degrees or so up from the horizon. there was an unusual light in the sky. my husband said it caught his attention because it was so bright and the colour was such a bright shade of red- both characteristics together seemed strange to him. \r\nit was moving horizontally from right to left, sw to w, across the southern sky. at first i thought it was a jet plane with its red landing lights flickering as they sometimes do. but the light was flickering and pulsating not just flickering/blinking. \r\nthe light seemed to be under intelligent control. it was a very controlled movement, not like one that was natural, i.E. movement due to wind. \r\n\r\nit seemed to be moving at the same rate of speed as a jet plane at some distance. have no idea how big the light source was or how fast it was going. the light changed colour from red to orange. i don't think plane lights change colour. it also faded in intensity plus it was flickering and pulsating. then the light brightened up again and then changed colour, again, this time to bright blood red. then the light changed colour from bright blood red to bright purple or violet. \r\n\r\nat that point, i said no, that's not right. planes are never a bright, reddish-purple-violet, flickering, pulsating light... \r\nthen the light changed colour again back to orange red

in a straight path but was panning left to right like a dial on a meter. it had no faa lights. i was surprised & confused at the same time. all 6 of us lost sight of the object when it passed over a building. when i first saw it i thought it was a blimp as well as the others. we realized that no blimps fly that high & blimps make a humming noise. this object was silent. its glow was also something that made all of us think it wasn't a blimp. i have spoken to lillian waters about this sighting in the kgra chat room & was encouraged to file this
