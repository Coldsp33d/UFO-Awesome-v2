cloud. the time was about 8pm saturday. as a smoker i would step outside to smoke as i am not allowed to do so in the house. \r\nthe house i live in is detached with no immediate neighbour but with an excellent view across the river wye to out lying fields.\r\nbeing on the side of hill, i only have an easterly view from north to south. as i lite my cigarette i notice a cloud forming in the northern part of the sky, my initial reaction was this was an asteroid and it was heading straight for me. i looked in to the window of the house and saw my wife watching tv and decided to leave her be as we were about to be destroyed and i could see no reason to upset her or the children .  i don't know why i thought this.\r\n\r\nthe cloud got bigger and bigger and eventually started to glow red, this reinforced my opinion of imminent death from this asteroid. the cloud evaporated and all i could see was this reddish glowing object, at that point i knew this was not an asteroid. i was unable to move from the spot i stood and just kept watching as it got bigger. it passed overhead and now i could see it was perfectly round but with an angular tail as long as the width of the big round disc.\r\n\r\nthe outline was very clear but i could not see the object directly as the orange/red glow was too strong but i could make out the outline. it continued on in the same trajectory and suddenly blinked out of view in the southen part of the sky.\r\n\r\nthe emotions running through me made met think about why is it i can see this and nasa or ceti couldn't ?\r\n\r\ni then remembered i had a mobile phone with a camara (blackberry) so i walked in to the house and set it up to take pictures. about a minute later a second bright orange orb arrived at the exact same place where the cloud first appeared. i took a picture of it but it must have been darker than i realised as the picture shows a reddish object but black all around

was sitting on my north-facing front steps reading email messages (and playing words with friends) on my phone when i observed what i thought was an airplane with landing lights on coming in my direction. what caught my attention was the single bright light was a yellowish orange color and very bright with no distinct features-airplane landing lights are usually more white light - and my home is not on the flight path for the local county airport. the light/object appeared to hover (though could have been moving directly at me) for around 30-40 seconds, then it changed direction moving slowly towards the east. as i watched, it grew less bright and seemed to very slightly lose some altitude. to my surprise a small round glowing piece (of something) dropped off of the light/object. the glowing piece dropped straight down as the bright light/object continued to slowly move eastward.\r\nthe light/object then drifted behind the top of a tree, but when it reappeared i saw another glowing object dropped straight down from the light/object. neither glowing piece seemed to have any sideways momentum as if they were dropped from a moving vehicle... they just went straight down from the point they were released. they also dropped at a greater speed than the light/object was moving horizontally\r\nafter the second piece dropped, the light/object changed color from the bright yellowish-orange to more of a bluish white and it dimmed appreciably. i had the impression that it kind of a banded structure coloration with bands of light-bluish and white light. (the light/object also seemed  to be fairly spherical.) as the light/object changed color it also began to lose altitude. it then passed out of view behind trees and the hillside. i noted the time to be 1:05am.\r\nthe time that the light/object took from when it changed direction until it disappeared from view also was maybe 30-40 seconds.\r\nthrough out the observation i heard no noise from the light/object, nor did i see any smoke or emissions.\r\nabout an hour later i also observed a set of three individual flashes of bright white light that flashed with a pause of about 6-8 seconds between. these small point flashes appeared higher above the horizon in what seemed to be a triangular pattern. i thought they could be a very high altitude airplane, but there was only single point of light in each flash, not a cluster of several lights (and not in a typical flight path that i have seen before.)  and to my surprise (again) there was a dim flash of light (like a shooting star) only it went up towards where i had observed the three light flashes. connected?? coincidence??\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

Henderso","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I want to start by stating a few things.  i have lived next to major international airports, small municipal airports, executive airports, air force bases, and the national guard.  i have observed just about every type of flying craft in the air at one point or another, including satellites, weather balloons, high flying flocks of birds, launched spacecraft, military jets, bombers, etc. and feel that i am able to recognize something out of the ordinary in the sky.  i also have spent most of my life in the desert southwest of the usa and have seen my fair share of military aircraft, both experimental and not.  i am an astronomy buff and a photographer.\r\n\r\ni was driving to a store, travelling almost due west.  i am always looking up at the sky watching the approaching and departing planes coming to and from henderson executive airport and mccarran international airport.  this night i had been watching the planes on approach as where i was driving they both had approaching planes coming in pretty low and there were quite a few due to the upcoming weekend and holiday.  i noticed an object much higher than a plane due to the fact that it first appeared by becoming visible by fading from a deep orange-red to a yellow-white light in about a second.  since i have seen a lot of these objects in the skies over vegas i watched knowing it would most likely do something odd.  once visible it moved to the right a bit (south), stopped, then moved to the left (north), and stopped again (these objects always remind me of bugs in the way they move and dart around).  i had been approaching a red light as i watched this, so i grabbed my iphone and began recording video once i had stopped (fair warning, mute sound on the video.  my stereo was cranked and i didn't have time to turn it off).  at this point the object began to move slowly to the east (going from about 80 degrees west to almost directly above me at 90 degrees).  it seemed to slow and pick up speed.  once the red light changed i quickly pulled over and tried to spot the object again, but in the twenty seconds it had taken me to get off the road it had already vanished.\r\n\r\nvideo notes:  the object is located in the middle of the screen, slightly towards the bottom when the video starts.  there is a visible star in the upper right corner that you can use to track the object against.  again, mute the sound.  i had my stereo blasting and had no time to turn it down as i was recording while stopped at a light.  my apologies for the quality.  this was taken with an iphone.\r\n\r\nwhen i first starting seeing these objects (sometimes individually, sometimes in groups) it really freaked me out.  i first saw them in a group late at night and their behavior truly reminded me of bugs.  las vegas is a very heavy light pollution area, so when you see what look like stars (except they don't twinkle) moving around very slowly in various directions, stopping, then moving in different directions, you notice.  since then i've been trying to record video and images of the objects i see (including others of different descriptions, including a few odd ones during the day on 8/9/13 and 8/10/13).  i've obtained a very nice dslr and telephoto lens and have purchased a tripod for my iphone to help assist in capturing video.  a new camcorder in also on my list.  i'd say about half of my sightings have been witnessed either by my boyfriend or someone else in the city (as i've confirmed by seeing other peoples' reports after the fact).  i don't really get freaked out anymore because this has been so common.\r\n\r\ni have five images from much earlier this same day of another of these objects moving across the sky at about 4:45am.  i was using my new dslr and telephoto lens to take pictures of the stars and noticed one moving from east to west (i was facing nnw). i was lucky enough to have the camera already on the tripod so i quickly snapped a few shots.  as this is unlikely to be the exact same object, i will submit these images in a separate report.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

a minute it turned bright red. then, it turned back to the original bright white light and started to ascend up so high that it finaly looked like a very distant star. it vanished right after. i tried to call the chandler municipal airport tower control but i got the recorder stating that they were closed as today is labor day. i called phoenix sky harbor and reported my findings while it was turning orange/red. i saw the same type of sphere/light on sept. 11, 2009 around the same time 7:00-7:40 pm in apache junction. i felt frustrated that i could not videotape the object especially when it changed colors and ascended  vanished so quickly.
