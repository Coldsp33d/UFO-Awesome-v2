( i live out in the country part of ohio so a lot of corn and bean fields around us as well.\r\n2. a friend pointe it out because they didn't know what it was and we all had then looked at it as well noticing it. and it was out of the ordinary for around here so we were kinda shocked in a way because we had noticed it and was something we never would expect to see.\r\n3. at first before i even looked at it i said its probably just a plane then i looked and it was clearly not a plane at all. at second glance i seemed to think it was a bit orb shaped so round and wasn't normal again.\r\n4. the object seemed to possibly be pretty big not for sure though because i couldn't tell completely. the object seemed to have red lights that seemed glowing but giving off a good amount of light as it were some kind of exterior lights of some sort. the action of the lights were a bit strange because we were sitting on the hay bails and it seemed like they may have been rising up/ hovering up then a little toward us then they both changed directions at the same time. they also stayed nice and lighten up and sorta bright for about a minute and a half then went out then came back on for a few seconds then finally disappeared as if they were going higher and into/ over or out above the clouds where we couldn't see. the motion of it seemed to be coming north then suddenly changed to going north west real quick also note there was no wind tonight.\r\n5. my feeling was shocked because i had a few months before witnessed another thing/ possible ufo sitting i didn't report. so i was a bit shocked in thinking maybe i witnessed another and felt the need to share. my immediate reaction of seeing it was to video it which i did and have some ok video of it. my action after word was talking to my friends about it as we watched the sky for anything else and then when i got home i decided i would report it because it really seemed strange to me and out of the ordinary. during the sighting i kinda felt like wow is that possibly what we all think it is and we all agreed of it being possibly a ufo and they told me to record it. after the sitting i got some goose bumps thinking about it while we all talked about it we all got them because we talked about what tv shows had said happen after the sightings and or what seemed out of the ordinary. \r\n6. we had lost sight of the object by the light going out either by going into/ up and over the clouds or higher to where we couldn't see so the light sorta faded into the clouds and disappeared and we waited awhile to see if anything came out of the clouds but we didn't see anything. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

began to increase speed significantly as i watched it. it was ejecting what appeared to be red and blue balls of light that shot off in random directions. there was a sparkling trail behind them and they basically flew off and dissapeared. i could hear no sound emitted. picked up great speed and went out of sight. we could still see balls of light ejecting in the distance before losing sight all together. we both were shocked and basically clueless as to what we had seen. i have been around aviation my whole life and ice never seen anything like it. i have seen military jets drop flares and this was not like any i have seen. i called my dad, who has been in aviation 50 years and he too was clueless.

a bright orange color and appeared to be very low altitude. he said the object slowed down, came to a complete stop and then was hovering. he yelled to me to hurry and come outside and then pointed to

looking at it through the night vision goggles my brother observed the object spinning with no tail, no sound, was not a helicopter or aircraft as a commercial plane was seen passing by later. \r\n\r\nwe witnessed the object hovering for a few minutes. my brother ran back inside to get a stronger scope and it then moved to the left (north east) very quickly. it began to ascend slowy and the

(most of the photos i got captured motion and light trails, so i have omitted those, but saved them.) my husband had his video recorder on a tripod and captured video, as well....Which gives a good indication of our vantage point. (we are unable to successfully upload the video but if mufon would like to see it, please contact us via email.) it was not doing it's obvious ascending/descending, zig-zagging as the previous nights but was agile and moving in a pattern on approach (5 minutes) and once hovering it stayed in place low on the horizon (10 minutes.) silence, again. there is no way this could be a helicopter, airplane, model aircraft, chinese lantern, hot air balloon, star, missile, flare, et al. it's movements, agility, changes in flight pattern and general color combined with no blinking lights on it, really leaves us feeling that this is something we have never seen. and this happened three nights in a row. the first two nights, we came outside around the same time and it was already positioned, hovering in the west, above the tree line at a distance of estimated 3 miles. (read previous reports.) last night, we watched it approach from the south west to the western point of the previous nights. we will be outside and ready at 8:45 tonight (september 1, 2013) to see if it comes back. we hope it does, but what could it mean?\r\n\r\n*one other odd thing. there were no stars out because it had been raining and was cloudy, but clearing up. in many of the photos during the period of time it was hovering, tiny points of light (like stars) in the thousands were all around in the sky around this thing, not visible to the naked eye. zoom in on the photos, to see what i mean. i do not attribute them to artifacts in the camera or pixelation as they do not appear in any of the earlier photographs. they are of less concern than the glowing orb visiting our area three nights in a row, but interesting, just the same.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then

a lot of planes (commercial and private) as well as helicopters. i almost instantly ruled out the light that were heading directly towards my home, was a plane or helicopter.  as the 3 identical objects approached in a single file, all proceeded to slow down when directly over me/my home.  i had a great view of the objects, they appeared to descend to about 500-1000 ft as they slowly flew over me. they were white translucent like that illuminated a skeleton on a plane, with wings that were outlined in bright red. i was amazed, excited and very curious. once they passed they seamed to transform back into the orange/red spheres. this could be from the distant from me they covered in seconds.  i immediately called my wife and she came out to witness the 3 spheres head north; its was when i was telling my wife where i first saw them we turned around and a 4th object was heading in the same direction as the first three. the 4th object repeated the same pattern as the others

between 35-40 degree elevation from horizon.  moving in a west to southeastern direction.  altitude, based on penny to dime sized, i would guess 3000-2000 agl (above ground level) hard to tell because the object was super brightly illuminated.  like a huge landing light, but.. it was internally lit.  not gasseous.  but it was like spectral light. no trail.  if it had been a landing light, it would have had a projection beam.  no sound whatsoever. distance traveled, i am guessing but probably 5 miles or less..Because it appeared west of the line of trees in our neighborhood and moved in a line to be over our house in the distance of probably a mile or two. i would say a mile or 2 horizontally from me slant range, because when the spectral light faded, i could see a round orb, that faded into nothingness.  that took probably 10-15 seconds.  \r\nthe overall time i observed this object was probably 90 seconds.  i did not have a watch or my cell phone on me at the time.  i checked the clock in the house and it read 11:48pm.  so i am estimating he time to be 11:45 when i first noticed it.  could have been :47 past i don't know.  my dog was acting kind of weird.  she came outside and
