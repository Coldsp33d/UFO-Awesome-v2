this very very bright orange light appears above the treeline across the street. so bright it captures my attention from the show i was watching. it was slowly rising above the tree line.  it was just so odd, because it was so bright. i got up and went to the window and watched the light hover. at first i thought someone lit off a firework, but it was way bigger and brighter than a firework and it didnt explode, it hovered. then i thought it may be a helicopter flying towards me. but there was no sound. then it seemed to float off to the north, and then started to ascend. once i realized it couldnt be a helicopter i grabbed my phone to take a video. it started asending and them the color of the lights seemed to change. eventually, as you can see in the video....The light just disappears. so i stood there staring for awhile wondering what i just witnessed, if anything. after a few minutes.....A new big bright orange/yellow light rises above the treeline. i turned my phone on as soon as i saw it and filmed it. this one did not hover.....It just ascended...Until as you can see the light just fades out. \r\n\r\nthe first video is of the first one...Which i didnt start taking until it

in the sky that i couldn't explain. at first there was 3 bright lights (of a orange/yellow color), appeared to be in the formation of a triangle. they didn't move, but hovered in the air. they were a good distance away, but still very bright. they were low enough to seem close, but high enough not to be a tower or connected to the ground. after about 5 mins of watching these, another set of 3 lights appeared nearby the first set. for a few minutes you could see both units hovering nearby each other. then the first set disappeared quickly. this same thing reoccured multiple times for the next 30 minutes. the lights would appear and disappear quickly, but always in different positions than the last. when appearing or disappearing, there was no flashing or moving. they did not shoot from the ground or from the sky, they just appeared. \r\nas i continued to drive, the lights didn't change but became hidden by the mountain range. after driving for another 15 minutes, i could see them again on the other side of the mountain range.\r\nnow i was closer than ever, and the lights were super bright! they were so bright that i'm sure they could be visible from miles away. i estimate they were 20 miles south of where i pulled off to look. \r\ni spotted this event in between indio, ca and the arizona border on highway 10. they were south of highway 10. \r\nthe lights continued to

curiosity. within seconds, the light was passing to the right of me, still blinking. i got a pretty good look at what seemed to by just a blue light. i know it was dark, but i couldn't see anything holding it there or any other physical object around it or attached to it. it seemed to be about the size of a tire, and less than 500 feet in the air. it was dark though, so i could be incorrect. it was definitely pretty low regardless. the strangest part was that there was no sound. all of my windows were down, and i felt a breeze come through my car as it passed, but it was dead silent throughout the whole encounter. i looked in my rear view mirrors after it passed, but couldn't see anything. in hindsight, i should have gotten out of the car. i would have taken a picture, but i was more focused on figuring out what was happening at the time. i just thought it was strange, but after hearing about other strange events on the very same night in florida, i figured there was a

redhill. i was walking across a playing field where there was very little street lighting. when i noticed up ahead of me in the night sky 3 dull orange lights in a straight line. it immediately caught my eye as i walk the route everynight and always look at the stars. each light was bigger than anything else in the sky at the time and they was bigger than any planet i have seen with the naked eye. as i stopped to view the object i was trying to work out if the lights was part of the same object. it appeared that it was and i could make out a blurred outline (translucent) of something around the outside lights. i focused on the object more and could make out red pulsating lights between the orange lights.(no sound from the obect)\r\nthere was a few planes in the sky at the start of the sighting but they was far away from the object up and lights on them was the size of stars. one of the planes was flying across the sky of my perspective of the object which made it clear that these lights were stationary. \r\ni had stopped walking and was stood in the middle of the playing field focused on the object and i was calling my girlfriend to come out of her house and to look at it to confirm what i was seeing but the was too much light pollution for her to see it. then a fighter jet flew over my head quite low and was heading the direction of the lights. as it flew to wards them the lights didnt move in a direction. it was although the lights disappeared gradually together or the object flew straight ahead away from me.\r\nas i continued my journey after 5 minutes i could hear a helicopter as i looked up i could see 2 army helicopters heading the same direction. \r\n

be farmers or hunters because they would need an enormous amount of power to cast the beams up into the sky like that especially because the radius of the light beams was more than 20ft. i felt really cold and worried that something wrong was happening in front of me. this was the same situation from my friend as well. the lights just suddenly stopped after 10 seconds of viewing them and the light dissipated into the sky.\r\n\r\nmy personal opinion:\r\nthe lights were no more than 500yards from eggbrough power station so i think that they were using power from the power station to send a

9:15 at night. (see previous report.) at 9:10, last night, we (husband, myself and 2 children) went out to the back patio and in the same area, at the same altitude, there was the same kind of ufo as we saw the night before. it began moving up, down, left right, in one general area. going up and below the tree line. we found this really hard to believe because of the previous night's experience. same object golden, orangish colored ball of light. zigzagging flight pattern. moving almost effortlessly. after observing it for about 10 minutes, it lowered down and traveled s-sw until we could no longer see it. about 20 minutes later, we saw it again, in the sw sky, but very high up in the air. we watched it travel a vast length of the sky before disappearing after a minute or less. about 20 minutes after that, we saw a slow moving aircraft approaching our house from the north. as it traveled over our heads, it had a low rumbling engine sound and we saw that it had 3 bright white circular lights on the underneath, forming a triangle with a red bright light in the center. the lights were signaling in a beaconish sort of pattern. white would blink and then the red. we have never seen anything like that either, but suspected that it was a man-made craft of sorts. certainly nothing like the fiery ball of light we had witnessed two nights in a row. but the odds of seeing this recon-like craft about 40 minutes after our 2nd night in a row of a ufo sighting in the same spot, at the same time, was pretty strange, we must admit. we will be looking in the same area in the low sky tonight at 9:00 to see if this ball of light appears again. honestly, the strangest thing we have ever seen.","distance":"Over One
