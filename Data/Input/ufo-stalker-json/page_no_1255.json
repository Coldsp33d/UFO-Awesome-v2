thought this was a strange star for a very long time because it reliably remains in the same place sometimes night after night. august 29th 2013 for the first time i observed it move location and also appear to release a smaller orb then reabsorb it. it did not move far just went behind some trees. i went out and checked the new location and it was still same object doing the same light show. it makes no sounds but it very noticeable in the sky. i lost sight only because i had to go to sleep. it was still in the sky when i went to sleep around 11:00pm. since it shows up a lot my next sighting i will try a video camera with a zoom lens and document this. when i get that i will send this along, so it can be analyzed. thanks for your help with this. i really would like to know what this could

color changes took place, then at great speed moved to another position paused for a few seconds, shot off to another location, paused (1 second).Then shot off to another position in the sky (to change colors). moved again (possibly in 30 degree angle to its original path).It then paused for a few more seconds in the sky, moved very fast to another position, pausing for a few seconds,again at 30 degrees approx. it then shot across the sky, nw direction\r\nand disappeared in a split second. i have flying experience, i was in gulf war 1. this was not a helicopter or an aircraft. its movements and speed were not of this world.\r\n5. i'm watching a ufo again. the zig zag actions of its flight path made me move about looking up (with a stiff neck). i felt it was trying to be noticed.\r\n6. it shot off across the sky in a nw direction so to be out of sight. \r\n\r\ni will be informing our local ufo group(12 in number), at the next meeting in september.\r\nkeep up the good

month a star like (bright object) that at first i was not sure if it was a ufo or a star. i live in a condo and usually go out briefly for some air, the first time i saw this light it was hovering in the sky (above 500 ft) by the miami airport (i have a good sense of direction and i could tell it was by the miami intl airport)at a high altitude. i thought it was a plane descending in the distance but after 10 minutes the light remain there, the sky was clear and it was about 8:30pm at aprox 8:50pm i noticed that the light had changed direction so i knew it was not a star.  this event has then repeated for the past month, i am going to say since early august of 2013, and now the light has been in a sw position in what it seems the same direction. the event is always the same, a bright object in the distance (at first it looks like a plane, since we have heavy traffic in the miami metropolitan area) but it isn't. last night 8/29 at about 9:00pm i saw something that i have never witness,,,,i saw the light again or object, i went back in to my apartment again and came out. i kept looking at this object and it looked as if the light disappear for a few seconds, then the light reappeared again only to disappear a few moments later. the best example i could describe is as if you were watching a bright object at a distance and in an instance you see it disappear before your eyes, like if something was sipping it. this event made me realize and gave provided me evidence that what i been watching for the past weeks is not a star. i will try taking a picture of it this time.","distance":"Over One
