lights, they don't hover, that low we'd of heard it, & it would of been long gone. helicopter,  no again, stayed too long, no noise, that low we could identify that.  satellite, no, it would not appear to move & wouldn't be so low.  this was a large kind of egg shaped, very bright white star type thing, w like spikes  of white light appearing to come out in different directions on the bottom.  we noticed it wasn���t ���going anywhere���,  as i drove we noticed it appeared to follow as i drove south on hwy 41.  each red light i stopped, it stopped.  we looked at it using the wires on telephone poles & tree tops to mark its spot,  waiting for it to go beyond the points, but it didn���t,  till id drive.  i turned west on wiscon rd & it did too.  it stayed to the right.  i turned south on california, it did.  i stopped 4 times on california street for up to 15 mins waiting for it to move with my car stopped.  it didn���t go anywhere.  i pulled out my cell phone.  it was hard to see looking at the screen, we took pictures & video  on the highest zoom, but they do not look as bright or big as it did.  with our eyes it appeared still, while looking at the camera/video screen, it appeared to shake up & down a bit.  i turned west on spring hill drive,  now we entered the city area with more cars & businesses.  it started going back & forth crossing the road a couple times.  then we turned south on mariner.  again it crossed the road a couple times, & started moving further from us.   all this time it went along as slow or fast as i drove, stopping when i stopped.\r\nwhen i turned east to go to my older sons home, it hovered a bit, then we lost sight of it.  i stopped, btu we didn���t see it anymore.  tonight it was cloudy at that time, in that area, with barely any stars seen.  this object was lower than the clouds.  we kept wondering if anyone else saw it or felt they too were being followed.  the drive was about 15 to 18 miles.   because i stopped  to watch, it took us just under/over an hour.  \r\nthe kids were saying they were scared,  yet we were all intrigued, curious, wanting a concrete answer.  all 4 wanted to stop  & what to see what it did.  all had, have a strange feeling, like was it? could it be?  really? aliens? why?  why the cat & mouse game?  now it���s late & i am nervous.  i need to sleep to work in the am.  but am nervous, not knowing what happened, what will happen etc. \r\ni have 3 pictures & two videos.  which don't seem to show it well.  also my son & grandson took the video with the car window open  & the

light southwest of my field of vision. i asked my friend \"hey, does that light look like a star to you?\", as i pointed towrds the light. she said \"no, it's rather large -- what the heck kind of plane is that taking off?!\" i looked to the right of the light i was looking at attentively, and i saw under the darkening sky a fighter plane taking off from the airport's tarmac, racing up and towards the left, heading soutwest towards the bright light in the sky, followed by another fighter plane. it was dark, i'm guessing these were two f-15s. no flood lights in either fighter, just red flashing lights under their bellies, both f-15s heading towards the light in the sky fast. i tried hard not to lose track of the fighter planes or their flashing lights as they disappeared in the distance, always heading towards the light in the sky, but i couldn't follow them for more than a few seconds. first i stopped hearing their roaring engines, then i stopped seeing their bodies, and lastly their flashing red lights. gone, just like that. my friend takes i-70 west towards lake saint louis, past the bridge over the missouri river. for about ten minutes after the fighter planes i kept my eyes trained on the bright light in the sky until it was no longer southwest of my field of vision but rather to the south, and lastly southeast of our moving car's vantage point. the light never moved from the original position where it was as we were leaving the airport and saw the scrambling f-15s. i lost track of the light in the sky when my friend exited i-70 to look for the address

hovering low in the sky. it resembled two black balloons, hovering 200 feet up. it was clear with some clouds and sunset was still somewhat off with not any breeze at ground level.I felt sure i could give it a positive id but had trouble with the way it maintained a perfect fixed point in hover. that fact became more puzzling as time went on. ten, twenty, thirty then forty minutes elapsed without the slightest waver not only in respect to  the ground but relative to the two objects being observed. it's stubborn motionlessness frustrated me. i called several people to confirm the sighting which they did from different points of view that many others witnessed at my location. one contact managed to observe it for about five minutes before it went on a very slow move. he was successful in chasing it until he got within 300 to 400 feet of ground zero. zero being the spot that the main object would be directly above. he gave a guess of 200 feet off the ground and moving  a running mans pace horizontally. descending to 100 feet before losing line of sight due to tree tops. it was black to the absolute degree. perfectly circular, with no surface feature. it felt hesitant to describe it to me this way but a gave an analogy. he said it was if their was a sharp and perfectly circular black hole was punched into the blue sky that made no sound. the second circle was the same description but smaller trailing behind the first by 30-50 feet and bobbling. a small black plane was spotted at 7:30 at 500 feet approx and traveling in the direction of the sighting. and again circling  which was confirmed by another witness from different location but maintaing near time cell phone contact.In addition , i observed two helicopters hovering over the location where object was last seen before moving out of my line of sight. this was five hours later at 1:00 am. three reasons that could explain away an over active imagination is follows1). local coast guard conducting business however you rarely observe a cg chopper unless in transit to harbor to or from harbor station \"which is not at the babson resevoir and  i never saw two coastlines hovering together. no search lights and maintaing approx separation of 200 feet. 2). medical evac from omelet fields for boston hospital. not uncommon at all to hear and see civil medivac over this neighborhood especially because of close proximity to pickup point. being a resident of this neighborhood for 40 years, this nights helicopter activity was startling out of place. medivac a always come in low loud and do not circle or hover with complacency due to the obvious nature of life or death urgency .3). it could be a camera crew flight for footage of the gloucester based tv series \"wicked

saw nothing, i always look at my sky weather its day or not i love to look at my sky considering i moved here to pennsylvania two years ago from nyc where you can never see any stars at night or anything due to the pollution and lights. so that was one thing that i appreciated about my new clear night sky and the abundance of stars are amazing. some nights between the moon and stars i don`t even need a light to see outside even though its rural where i live and there are no streetlights which leaves it pitch black only to be lit by house lights car lights and planes, helicopters or lightning.I love it...So last night august 27 2013 after my call, i was looking at the sky from my front step through the top of the trees about 100 foot or so maybe more or less as i did not  measure it, but as i was looking up through the top of the trees directly in front of me and at the distance i already approximated to the best of my ability,out of nowhere a small tiny red light appeared through the trees so i noticed it and said 2 things to my self lets wait for this tiny red light to start blinking and the second think was i don`t see any whites or greens flashing either indicating a plain or helicopter or even a single engine plain, i see these all the time during the day and at night and i know the difference between them all, also i have pocono mountains municipal airport which is 14 miles from my house and tobyhanna army depot which is one of the largest in the country. so i see things all day and night so back to last night at about 8:52, so now is where it became odd first it was seen through the trees which would be awfully low to see a plain and second no noise was made as it started coming closer then it started to ascend above the trees and as it moved up it little not yet in full view still being blocked by the treetops and remaining branches and leaves. it then as if it wanted me to see it it moved left in full view just as the moon away from a cloud. it never blinked, its was a a red orb to say the least but it looked maybe like the size of a my truck tire, again my best estimation. but it was not just the orb being red it had a glow almost a burn, maybe plasma and around this orb there was an orange hue like an aura. then the object in my full view it split apart forming three perfect little orbs with the same awe shocking colors. so as soon as the split they formed a little triangle and then it started to spin around and then while still triangular it started to spin in the opposite direction, then they started to go vertical and it looked like the did some sort of a waltz or gymnastics almost playing with each other, at this time i was stunned at what i was witnessing they became the little triangle orbs and started moving right and in less than a nanosecond it morphed back into its original form and moved to the right, at which time clearly nervous i took out my cell phone to rec it so i had to look away look down at my phone i pressed the camera button and it was on camera so i had to switch it to video so i held it up and all i could see was complete darkness nothing at all, so i put my phone away the orb there floating away now i go in my house grab my cannon i got it ran out of my house the orb still moving further away and as soon as i pushed the power button it i looked at the orb and as i looked at the orb it just vanished, gone, right into thin air. i got not no photo of the orb but the photo i did get was black with a little light of my floor or walk way lights meaning as soon as it vanished. i must have been starting to lift my right arm going to take the pic and instinctively snapped the shot as soon as my eyes saw it vanish grrr. so no i have no evidence but it does show that i was out side at the specified time and was trying to take a photo. never saw on before but always believed in them. i hope some one from mufon can contact me concerning things about certain events never being covered, lies, evidence  and statements and footage and articles that are not being covered.Articles suppressed in the media, scientists stating that life has been found outside this atmosphere, i guess the found nothing on mars since those rovers being up there since 2006 i think a scientist said they were ready to make a historic statement, then the next day nasa played it down saying it wasnt they found life but i dont really remember what she said but that was killed, we are actually receiveing thought to be radio signals from billions of miles away notes nasa, alien voices also confirmed by nasa from saturns rings but you can hear it it clearly sound like an alien voice not noise  explosions space junk colliding, you can actually listen to the voice anywhere youtube online. and the best is if a guy predicts an ex air force and norad guy that on oct 13 2010 aliens will show them selves over major cities, then it actually happens impossible, look at nyc on that date on youtube oct 13 2010 ufo or google it. i lived and worked in manhattan at that time and i never saw any of the news footage on the news that was on youtube i was shocked i almost felt robbed, cbs 2 news had a camera on these ufos for 8 mins and the were also there at night on a night cam over manhattan you can see that too. all this never covered by major news outlets is sickening. and no they were not ballons. what also was not covered was the airports shut down the airports and air space, besides ny airspace is watched  so closely that how can this even take place over this city for so long and saw by so many people....The russian faa said that umm the new york airports and air space has been closed because of a flap of ufos..That was never reported. our reason wht was somke in the terminals...Russia told the flight number of the plane wich left moscow and had to be diverted from its destination of new because of ufos. the more i look the more i see and it seems they are all over this year india china taiwan remote regions crazy and there are so much evidence of the orbs that seem to not to be able to be  photographed which im sure is their purpose...Thats all but can someone contact me to talk all about the stated above thank you.

Lake","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"While camping in northern michigan, i was viewing the stars with my night vision scope. between the hours of midnight and 1:00 am, every time i looked up i saw a light about as bright as a dim star maneuvering outside of normal parameters.\r\nwhen i looked up, it took at most about 1 minute for something out of the ordinary to appear. here are a few of the accounts:\r\n\r\ni saw a steady light enter from the south and exit to the north. its intensity was approximately as bright as an average background star. the speed was slightly slower than a typical meteorite, but didn't get bright as a meteor would burning up in our atmosphere. it took less than 3 seconds to traverse the visible sky. it's path was perfectly straight and did not appear to have any internal motion indicative of a low flying bird. it did not have strobe lights like an airplane would, pulsate like a tumbling satellite, or change intensity like a meteor would. i saw this similar scenario 3 times over the next hour. given its speed, it would be reasonable to assume the other events were the of same object - as i didn't note the direction of the other two instances.\r\n\r\na light resembling a star entered my field of view from the north with a constant speed on a direct southerly heading. the speed was approximately 3 times faster than a satellite. the elevation at which i first observed it was approximately 60 degrees. when it was still about 80 degrees to the north, its speed dropped in half and the path then became erratic for a few seconds, while still maintaining a southerly heading. then, without slowing down at all, it took an immediate left turn to the east while maintaining a constant speed and resumed a steady, non erratic path out of my view to the east.\r\n\r\na light that looked like a star was covering around large portions of the sky very quickly. it did not travel in a straight line, but was turning left and right, curving around the visible sky for over a minute. its speed appeared to be somewhere around 10 times faster than a satellite. it was a steady light, did not pulsate, strobe or change in intensity. i watched it for at least a minute until it took a straight path to the west out of view.\r\n\r\na light that looked like a star was maneuvering quickly at about 80 degrees above me to the south-west. i had a green laser that i was using to determine if it was close enough to be illuminated if it was a bug. the object seemed to actively avoid my light as i tried to light it up. after about 30 seconds, it faded out of sight. i then turned off the laser and adjusted the gain on my scope to see if i could find it again. i then saw a bright flash from where it disappeared and it then faded back into view. after its intensity returned to what it was before, it then exited the area on a perfectly straight path to the west.\r\n\r\ngiven that these objects danced around then left the area, it is possible that several of the instances were the same object coming back in to my field of view. also, since i was camping, i did observe some ashes ascending from time to time when the wind pushed them over my position. these ashes were visibly blurry as they were within a few hundred feet of me and all acted similar as they drifted upward.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

my bedroom window blinds.I got out of bed and went towards the blinds with the intention of finding out what was causing the light and the incredibly loud noise which sounded like a giant generator.I found i was too scared to open the blind which is unusual for me,being a naturally inquistive person.The last thing i remember is standing to the side of the window.Whats really strange is that i then forgot all about it.Months later it popped back into my mind and i realized that i dont remember going back to bed that night and i never resolved the situation.I also had a strange dream.In it i am laid on a raised table.Someone or something is beside me by my hip area.I am paralized but conscious.I am absolutely terrified as whatever procedure isgoing to be done is about to start.Then i hear a voice that says stop shes terrified.Out of my peripheral vision i can see a woman.She looks very human except for her high forehead and bluish tinge to her skin.She communicated psychicly.I asked why me? and was told it is because im special.Im sure a psychologist would have something to say about that and ive agonised about whether i should just keep quiet for fear of ridicule. what is also strange is the fact that there were chinook helicopters hovering over our estate before and after this event which were seen by many locals.Through my life aged 4,15,32,and 45 i have had dreams of a similar type.Now im wondering if they were more than
