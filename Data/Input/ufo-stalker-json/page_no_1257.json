just outside of casa grande, az. we were traveling at 55 - 60 mph and had just passed the intersection of n 11 mile corner road and e. kleck rd. it was daylight and the sun was above the horizon and to our right (west). we were and remain unable to identify a large shape we saw moving through the sky at that time.\r\n\r\ninitially, i noticed a large shape to my 10 o'clock at 15 - 20 degrees off the horizon. it was about three quarters of a mile distant and was moving east to west, parallel to highway 287 (about 1 mile away) and perpendicular to our direction of travel. i was about to dismiss the shape as a flock of birds until shimmering and/or reflected light caught my eye. i noted the shape undulated and flowed as would a flock of birds, but there were no birds visible in or around the shape. the shape was translucent with a diffuse edge. i could see sky through the shape. i commented to my wife, \"what is that?\" as i slowed the vehicle.\r\n\r\nmy wife acknowledged seeing the shape and expressed curiosity as i continued to drive. she agreed this was not a flock of birds and was similarly unable to identify what we were seeing. we observed the shape for about 10 seconds before it descended slightly and disappeared behind some trees: long enough to capture our interest but not long enough to get at the iphone to document the event. the shape reappeared a second or two later and changed direction. we further observed the shape for less than 5 seconds before it seemingly blended into the background and disappeared.\r\n\r\nafter initially sighting the shape, it passed behind a water tower located west of n 11 mile corner road. the tower is about 60 feet in height. we were roughly a half mile from the tower as the shape passed behind it. the shape was roughly 3 times the height of the tower with a length to height ratio of about 4 to 1. an absolute size for the shape is difficult to estimate as the shape was some distance beyond the tower.\r\n\r\nthe shape had no markings and appeared to be under its own power. the overall geometry was rectangular. it narrowed slightly at west end. corners were poorly defined and slightly rounded. the shape appeared thin, almost ribbon-like. my wife remarked it resembled a transparent advertising banner that moved like a flock of birds as it reflected sunlight and shimmered. it lacked a tow plane or any notable form of

night since then. they have not filmed them more than two or three times. they were out watching a meteor shower on the 12th (or the 11th?) and noticed an object that seemed to defy physicsanger hat changed colors. when they slowed down their video footage, you could see all colors of the rainbow. this was a mind altering event for them but they have been looking for the objects every night and have been seeing them and it seems that every night they are seeing more. tonight, the 27th, they came inside sometime after eleven and got my husband and me. i went outside right away. before my husband joined us, there were four teenagers with me in the driveway. we could see one object across the street above a neighbor's house that looked like it was far away but within the atmosphere and it was somewhat stationary but changing colors and moving back and forth and up and down. sometimes in small circles. north of that one, there were two more that appeared closer. one was faint but the other grew very bright as it was changing colors and then just disappeared. the second one also disappeared. the very first one remained there for about 10-15 more minutes and it gradually descended out of our sight line. the kids had seen some to the east and they all disappeard when i came outside. my husband only witnessed the one to the west that stayed there the longest. they all appeared round and to be changing colors and maybe shape. they also appeard to be far away yet still in our atmosphere. we saw planes flying overhead as this was happening. \r\ni had seen the footage and heard plenty of stories of the sightings of these objects over these past weeks from our kids and our friends  but this was the first time i saw any of it. it is hard to wrap my brain around it. especially the one that became brighter and then disappeared. when my son asked me to come out to look he said they had counted 12 and when i first went outside i felt overwhelmed because it was so hard to differentiate between a star and these strange objects but once i figured out how to spot them i felt like we were surrounded and strangely, like we were being watched. but they looked so far away. so strange. by the time we went inside, there were just normal things like stars and airplanes in the sky as far as we could tell.

was fishing out of this old juan boat and there was absolutely no one else on the water. the only other people that i saw out there that evening was a group of 12 to 15 people around a fire on a campsite  on opposite side of the like. believe me, you could tell and hear that they were there. however there was no one at that site for a while before the sighting.\r\n\ti was getting ready to leave when about 60 to 75 yards behind me.  a giant bright and glowing light appeared under the lakes surface. it was fairly large and had a light green green color to it with a rhythmic flashing of red and blue lights. \r\n\tthen the light began moving from western side of the lakes shore to the  eastern side and back to the other side a couple of times then it stopped almost near the center of the lake. at that moments it grew brighter and slightly larger than shot straight up in the air and into the sky and seemingly disappeared for a couple of seconds and reappered hovering right over the campsite that i mentioned earlier and disappeared again. then reappeared again maybe a minute later and shot up into the sky and went out of sight and i never saw it again.\r\n\ti drove my boat over to the site where the craft was hovering over as fast as i could get there. however, i did not recognize anything out of the ordinary. just a white ford truck with several bags of trash in the bed and a couple other sitting beside it. i did not see any one by the truck or in the immediate area.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":50216,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.6602223,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08272013-0011","longitude":-97.4744354,"occurred":1377327600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oklahoma","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1377664780000,"summary":"Light

come from them. after travelling about 100 yards passed us, they would gently flicker and then were gone. i inquired with my local news channel but got no response, and no one seemed to be airing any news of this. i took several photos, some on my canon, others on my cell, but no one seems to know what this was. i googled it and found that at roughly the same time, the same thing occurred in new york state as well...Also new zealand, london, illinois, and texas that same weekend. wtf? i am including the 3 pics i took from my cell, but the poor quality causes the lights to look streaked, which

of the pattern of three. upon seeing all of this i began to have this overwelming feeling of fear. it all seemed very menacing. i pulled out my binoculars hoping mabe it was just stars previously not noticed. i focus in and there was no doubt this was not stars i was looking at. the craft to the left was a ship with an exterior light and other running lights could faintly be seen behind it. the three ships in the orion belt pattern where just bright lights. the craft to the right was pulsating red, blue, green, and white, and shaped like saturn. i back the trailer in and noticed two people out side having a smoke. i show them the objects and one of them took out his phone to check google star maps. he then says they are not stars. i let the other guy look through my binoculars and he agreed with me that these are definatly not stars or satelites. for the next three or so hours i try to focus on my job but they maintained pattern and omniously hovered above. i called my wife at one point who was twenty miles away and she could clearly see them as well. at one point in the morning there were so many ships that they covered the sky. i work near the airport and there is constant air traffic but while these strange ships occupied the sky, there wasnt any other air traffic. after the sun came up all but two craft where gone and about 6:15 the last two dissappeared. shortly afterwards i seen a commercial jet for the first time in three hours. i sometimes see strange things working the night shift and never report it, but this is different in the fact that there was an armada of ships and they didnt mind beeing seen.

\r\nobject moving sw extremely slowly.  if it hadn't been occluded by a small tree branch, i might not have noticed it at all. at that point, it was very dim.  (i���m comparing magnitudes from nearby stars to estimate brightness of object.)\r\ni stepped back across my yard to get a better view, when the object abruptly changed 90��� south.  that is, away from me. it did not bank like an airplane. at no time, viewing visibly, or with the 10 x 40mm binoculars i grabbed, did i see anything resembling an ac (anti-collision) light that would be on any aircraft.  after a minute or two, the object began brightening and dimming.\r\n i began seeing faint flashes of yellow light emanating from the object which began to ���dance��� up and down, staying in same approx space.  multiple flashes of light around the object after 10 minutes of observation object dimmed and became still.\r\ni got a better look at it towards the end, as i believe it began gaining altitude. the object, which started out as a whitish color, gradually turned more yellow.  at the end, it became a golden color, but i believe that was caused by the rising sun reflecting off of it. when it was brightest, i observed through the binoculars, that the end closest to me was conical, much like the bottom of the command module from the apollo space program.  i was viewing this from off to one side.  the object appeared to taper off, but i couldn't tell if the other end was blunt, rounded or pointed.I wish i had thought to contact the control tower at allegheny county airport to see if they had a visual or radar contact.  it should have been visible directly to their e or se. i had to break off my observation at that point, in order to get to work on time.\r\ni had to break off my observation at that point, in order to get to work on time.\r\n(the next is some magnitudes for comparison.)\r\ndelta aquila is approx. a 3.5 magnitude star.  this is the star that was closest to the object at the start of my observation. the object was dimmer at first, but became much brighter later.\r\nat its brightest, i would say it was equal to viewing saturn, which has a magnitude of 0.\r\noh.  temp was approx 62.  wind was 4mph out of the south. barometric pressure was approx  3.2 and steady.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":50202,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.4023652,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08262013-0027","longitude":-79.8975712,"occurred":1377520500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cone","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1377582753000,"summary":"Slow moving object. sudden 90' turn. pulsated. brightened.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"15120","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Munhall, Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:265434"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Des Moines","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I had departed work at 3:35pm  friday august 23 while waiting at a red light i observed southwest flight wn476 departing seatac intl.  the blue and red colors were very recognizable as the commercial plane started to ascend i noticed a silver cigar shaped object in line of sight from my stopped vehicle past the sw flt and an additional 1/2 to 1 mile away at 70 degrees from the horizon.  the craft was not moving.  it look similar to the fuselage of a 737 american airliner, but i could not see any wings or tail structure.  a told my passenger do you see that object that's just hovering there.  he tried to look through the front windshield but due to the angle he was unable to see it.  suddenly a light cloud opened a track through it the vehicle disappeared but i could see a contrail coming from where the end of the cigar shape was. it was moving at a relatively slow speed.  i could no longer see the vehicle but i could follow its movement by the contrail.  the light changed i looked forward then quickly back and the cloud had a slice through it and the contrail was gone.\r\n\r\ni am an aerospace worker that works close to seatac airport.

asked, but it was earnest, and i asked for friendly ones only. about 15 minutes later i was looking at the sky from a chair in my front yard (head tilted back skyward), hoping to see a light zipping around the size of a star. the sky was clear and a large moon was rising, but not yet over the neighbor's tree level to the east, allowing for some darkness.Then pretty much right overhead i saw a form drifting east at about 200ft high and maybe 30mph. those numbers are only estimates. \r\nat first i thought, \"what the heck it that\" and then figured this could be a surprising cigar-form-ufo we so often hear about. since the sky was clear, with a little bit of city-light haze (but no clouds), i was at total loss to what this could be. i blinked my eyes and did a double check on the situation. since this object was mostly invisible, i questioned whether my eyes were playing tricks on the brain. but now i was alert and all i could do was keep tabs.\r\nit moved from overhead (with a darkish form) going east towards the moon (but off to my right or south ever so slightly). as it moved the only visible form seemed to be the moon's reflection on the front rim of this huge (100ft dia.) round silent object, that was otherwise absolutely invisible. this reflection looked like a wisp of cloud floating through the night sky. but since the shape never changed and the direction and speed was constant, it was easy to look away and then find it again. then as it veered to the right (or south), the leading edge reflection started to fade as the moon light would be visible to some other observer (south of me) and no longer to me. being as how this thing was in invisible-mode, i soon lost sight of it. the total visible flight time was about 30 to 45 seconds. i doubt others would have seen this. i was quite lucky it passed directly overhead and that the moon was aligned for a perfect reflection. obviously, i asked them (the space people)to come back over again (in the form of a prayer), but alas, this was probably just a coincidence. if anyone saw this, please confirm. it made me wonder if it was a military craft in silent-invisible-mode. i think space-people they could have done a better job, unless they came specifically to show me their \"reality\" as a confirmation of my request. the next step is to go outside of the city and make the same request. who knows, but those were my thoughts.Cheers\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional
