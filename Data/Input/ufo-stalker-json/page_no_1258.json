about 9:30 pm on saturday, august 24, i took my 3-year-old son outside into the backyard to talk with a good friend who was having a smoke, after most of the guests for my son���s birthday party earlier had left for the evening. it was a starlight night with some puffy large clouds scattered about. soon as i stepped into my yard, out of the corner of my eye, i caught two bright objects in the eastern sky. i looked up and saw two glowing orange orbs that appeared to be about the height of low commercial airplanes. i initially thought they might be satellites or bright planets. however, they were too bright and two low and were moving across the sky to the west, much like propelled aircraft. the more my friend and i studied them the more we couldn't figure out what they were. we actually laughed that maybe we were witnessing ufos. we thought the objects might be small airplanes but there was no sound or blinking lights. they seemed to be moving far too fast to be hot air balloons. they traveled too smoothly and quickly to be helicopters. we were really mystified as we couldn't conventionally describe what we were looking at. when this pair of orange glowing balls made their way to the west, originating in a straight line formation behind them - came 5 more. my friend counted a total of 7. i thought one of the last ones seemed to veer toward us ever briefly. however, they all seemed to follow along one after the other on the same trajectory across the sky. staring at one of them, i thought there was a certain dynamic flickering light in the center of the orb, almost like a steady upright flame. however, it seemed different than a normal fire, yet similar in an odd way. at this point, i was mesmerized by how serene they appeared, and also awestruck. when i initially saw the 5 additional objects that followed the original 2, i was momentarily nervous about what we were looking at. however, as i continued to study them as they arced across the sky from east to west, they seemed harmless and serene. the objects appeared to move slowly, but after they left completely, i gather they must have been traveling at a faster velocity than a commercial airplane to cover the sky in such a short amount of time. watching them leave, i was filled with wonder and fascination. my friend and i agreed we couldn't conventionally explain what we had just seen and that we had never seen anything like this in the night sky before. the objects disappeared one after the other into the western sky.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":50186,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.511494209549326,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08262013-0012","longitude":-79.98789266257056,"occurred":1377405000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1377546605000,"summary":"7 orange balls of energy arcing across sky one after the other in pittsburgh, pa northern suburbs","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"PA","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:265478"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Massey","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On august 20, 2013, my partner and i had travelled to sagamok first nation territory to scout out some film locations for a current project. during the evening of august 22nd, 2013, we camped at toulouse bay at my partner's mom's cabins which are located on the shores of the toulouse bay. approximately at 11:30 pm that evening, we were both sitting enjoying a campfire and discussing the days activities. when i looked up into the clear night sky, i made the comment on how beautiful it is to get out of the city and how bright the stars are. there before both of us was a bright penny sized white glowing object that was moving at a faster rate than most aircraft that i have seen. it was directly above us moving from the west to the east. the object did not make any sound whatsoever. it was totally silent as it passed over us. i first thought it was probably just a satellite but the object was to large to be that. i rushed and started my sony hdr-hc3 camera. i managed to capture 2 minutes of footage of this object flying away from us. the trees are visiable in the last part of the footage which gives you a perspective of how fast and the size of the object was when compared with the stationary trees. the object just faded out of sight as it moved away from us. i have never experienced anything like this before which was not explainable. after showing the footage taken to various members of the community of sagamok first nation, many stories of similar experiences started to emerge.

some distance from me.  i thought it was a plane at first, but then realized the large luminous lighting was going away from me instead of toward me...The light was very bright, bluish white...And a tint of red around the edges. it was higher in the sky at one point and seemed closest to me at that point. i lost sight  of it as i drove and was afraid when i came to a stop sign on the top of the hill, i'd not be able to see it. but there it was lower and was going more north east than the original direction i noticed when i first saw it. the intensity of the lighting never varied...It glowed around the edges. i had my cell phone but i couldn't get a picture of it from where i was. when i went southeast toward my house maybe 150 yards, it was on my  left going northeast....I stopped my car and took the photo. you can see the line of trees and the sky was clear that evening..So there were few clouds.  when i looked at the photo, it definitely had a triangular, boomerang shape. my headlights can be seen throwing some light out around the front of the car which had nothing to do with the object in the air.  it was strange to be alone in the middle of the night, nobody on the road but me and seeing this. but i was glad i had a camera of sorts to verify what i saw. from where i was and where the object was....It was bigger than i thought when i first saw it.  \r\nthe object simply moved quickly over the tree line and disappeared like some one had flipped a switch. there was no noise, and no planes in the area.  i thought this was rather curious as i see a lot of

first that i have reported. we were laying on a blanket on the ground, looking at the stars which is a regular activity, especially for my wife and i. there was one star-like object, very much brighter than anything else in the sky which appeared to come closer for a period of time before changing directions and moving farther away. it continued on a relatively straight heading becoming a little smaller in size, then appeared to stop, then start again. then suddenly moved faster, and just vanished. one minute it was there, then just gone. we were all in amazement at what we were seeing, the whole family witnessing one of these at the same time was a first. as i said, we have seen dozens of objects, unexplained lights, strange moving lights, and such things over the years we have lived in this area. this was a unique sighting, unlike any of the previous ones, and the fact that the object simply vanished was amazing.There were several other strange lights in the area during the night, after this one, none quite as wonderful. i will continue to watch the skies, each opportunity i get. i have known my whole life that we are not the only beings in the vastness of

time would be between 5:30am and 6am. while i was outside with him i tend to look up at the stars. i love the stars so when they are visible i look at them. as i was looking i noticed what appeared to be two boomerang shapes as one object. it had small lights on it to resemble stars but the object was solid. to me it resembled a consultation. it was about the size of a somewhat low flying commercial airplane, it travelled from north to south.  it didn't make a sound, it was very quite outside. i live off of i635 and
