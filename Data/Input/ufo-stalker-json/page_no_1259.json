i said \"i don't know, it's very bright and obviously moving very quickly so it's probably a low earth orbit satellite\". then when the object was about 10degrees above the tree line it just stopped dead.  my friend who was with me said \"i really don't feel comfortable at all right now what the f is that\".  also keep in mind that i'm much more pragmatic about these sorts of things as it's probably the 10th or 11th time i've seen something very strange in the sky like that over the years.  and in 3 cases captured on camera while taking scenic or sunset pictures sometimes with multiple glowing objects moving in frame in successive pictures while they changed positions in the sky and in the camera frame. if mufon is interested in those pictures i can dig them up off my previous digital camera.  so anyway the object hovered/remained in place for about 3 mins and then dissappeared in the blink of an eye - not like winked out but just gone. needless to say my friend was freaked out as the first time he's seen something like that and we wet back inside the house and told my dad and other friend the story.  the lake i have a house on is right in the middle of the ottawa river valley so we get some pretty extreme weather and is a major fly over point for transcontinental and regional type flights from ottawa to toronto so i've seen probably close to 1000 different types of planes fly over in my summers there and also hundreds of satelites, shooting stars, so i definitely know that what i saw was none of those because of the dead stop hovering for multiple minutes after it was moving very fast overhead and then just disappearing like that.  the night was dead quiet and completely clear and can always hear planes ever if they are at 40,000 ft. any questions please contact me by email provided in this report.

in the car in the parking space when i observed a single light in the sky brighter then venus which we saw during the drive there. i told my wife during the drive that venus is the brightest object after the moon in the night sky. we talked about it because the prior night she was telling our daughter it was the wishing star... so i was telling her what it actually was. so in the parking lot, i saw this bright light red/orange light to the west and knew it wasn't venus. due the closeness to jfk airport, i thought it may be a plane on approach. from our house on long island's south shore, we see this every night as the airliners approach from over the atlantic and then turn west towards jfk almost over our house. i didn't see any strobes or flashing lights that you see on any aircraft. about 45 seconds after seeing it, 2 more orbs appeared out of nowhere. we could see the distant tree line and the additional orbs did not come from behind the tree line. then about 15 seconds later 2 more appeared for a total of 5. they moved from about 25 degrees on the horizon to almost 45. then the lead orb abruptly turned right (north) at a right angle. it moved a little further very slowly, then stopped in a hover. the next 2 continued to move towards the first object then the last 2 moved closer. the original object never moved for the remaining 4 minutes or so, while the remaining 4 moved constantly, but very slowly. they all disappeared one by one with the original orb being the last one. the color did change from red/orange to orange/yellow as they got closer. the whole time we saw the objects, there were several aircraft that were observed both further away and closer and all of those aircraft we could see their strobes flashing. we never saw a strobe on any of the 5 orbs. i did get out and take 2 photos, zooming in as far as i can while resting the camera on the concrete base of a light pole. this was the second time in the last 14 months i have seen 5 orbs in the western sky. the first time was over farmingdale, ny about 2am 14 months ago. that time i shot 4 minutes of video with the same sony cybershot camera. i haven't figured out how to compress it yet to post the video. the pictures from last night are attached. i am a aircraft buff and have a strong knowledge of all types of aircraft, and i have no idea what it was that i saw but am 100% sure it was not an airplane or helicopter.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

thought was jupiter in the late evening sky. i had plans to come out after a shower and look at jupiter through my binoculars. by the time i actually got outside on my deck on the back of my house i was unable to find jupiter and had assumed that it had dropped below the horizon. i like to look at the stars at night anyhow. it was about 8:50 pm (est.) after a few minutes of star gazing (at about 8:58pm) i saw a rather bright light in the night sky, from my view point facing west and per my cell phone compass and a hand based map compass, the object (a bright white light about the size of aspirin, came out of the west (about 240 degrees approx)traveling from the west/southwest in an south/south east direction (210 degrees approx). i looked for aircraft marker lights (the red or green and the flashing/pulsing white marker light) but did not see any. i first saw the object with my naked eye, and then used my binoculars to see if i could see the any marker lights that may have been out of my range of vision with out the binoculars. i was not or did not see any such standard aircraft marker lights with my binoculars. i had my wife come out and look, (she did not use the binoculars) but she saw the light/object. we watched it for about 45 seconds. it was hard to judge the distance or speed of the object as it seemed to be what i would approximate at an upper altitude, what i would guess some jet airliners travel when near or at their upper limit of altitude,(my best guess on this maybe 20 to 30 thousand feet). a couple of things that i noticed was that there was no sound, that one would normally hear with a jet even at an upper altitude. i was a military brat and am versed in the delay of the sound of the engine and the relative position of the aircraft, as heard from a ground based observation. the second was that i could not see or make out any marker lights( as described above), as the moon had not risen in to the sky at this time to provide any additional lighting, i could not tell if there was a vapor/'chemtrail' from this object. the night sky was clear with no major cloud cover or systems in the area at the time of the viewing, only a little ambient light from surrounding ground based locations (city street lights and such).\r\nthe object traveled in a direction that took it over my roof from my perspective and was about to cross out of my view when i ran inside to get my video camera and then proceeded to my front door, to follow object from the front of my house, (unfortunately, the battery in my cam corder was dead and the 30 seconds or so it took me to get it out of the bag, (after entering the house from the back deck and then proceeding to the front door) i emerged and looked for the object in the sky from the front of my house vantage point and it was gone. i do not think that it was a comet or satellite, as i have seen several of these and am a novice star watcher, i am aware of what a meteor/shooting star. this is my first report to date. i am not sure what i saw, but thought it might be useful if it was an actual ufo and other saw and reported it.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

shooting stars (5 minutes in between). a few minutes after the second shooting star, we saw a very fast, oval like, object that had an orange glow. we first noticed the object when we were looking at a blinking star to the north east. when we first noticed the object we thought it was commercial plane. we then realized that planes do not glow orange or move as fast as the object we saw. the object was moving in a straight path moving outward to sea. the object was also gaining elevation as it was moving forward. during the sighting of the object were we very confused and debating what it could be. the object then disappeared as if it was never there. after the sighting we were in shock and very excited about our experience.
