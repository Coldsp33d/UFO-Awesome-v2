States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At my job, i work the night shift. i was on my lunch break at work. the time was around 3:30am. i just finished eating lunch and had a minor urge to go outside and look for ufos, something i do often on my breaks. i thought \"why not just give a quick look before i go back to work\". i walk outside and see the moon, very bright in the clear, cloudless sky. i stare at the moon and enjoy its beautiful. then i notice a reddish-orange star-like object to the direct left of the moon. it was slightly upper-left. i noticed that it was moving around slightly. i couldnt believe it. it looked like a star but it twitched and bobbed, and moved around randomly, erratic, kinda like a drawing made of small squiggly lines, as if it was trying to find its \"place\" in the sky near the moon.. sometimes it would \"freeze\" in place, the shortly after, it moved up and down and all sorts of random directions in small increments of distance. subtle but obvious too. i stare at this reddish-orange star-like object for the rest of my break. i decide last minute to get my friend, who is my supervisor, to check it out. three of my co-worker friends are hanging out inside the building where i work. i say \"hey guys, wanna see a ufo?\". they agree and follow me outside where the moon is. i tell them to look at the star-like object directly to the left of the moon. they all notice the movement of the \"star\". we are all perplexed at what we see. they say \"what if its a satellite? or an illusion?\" i dont think it could be a hovering satellite, nor any kind of illusion ive ever seen. i notice a plane flying by and i point out the size difference between the two and how the plane looks a lot closer than this starlike ufo. about 15mins go by, and my co-worker friends go back to work. i stay a little longer to see if anything else happens. it does the same strange, random moments over and over. i go back to work. my work has 15 minute breaks every 2 hours. im so excited to see it again, i take my break at 4:30am and go i straight to a nice spot in the dark street outside my workplace, so i can watch the ufo. the moon has across the sky, toward the north, but the ufo was still in the same distance from the moon as an hour ago. i take my fingers and measure how far it is from the moon. i put my pointer and middle finger at arms length, and decide the star-like ufo is about two finger distance from the moon. i noticed occasionally i would see a brief flash of light, maybe from the moon or sunlight? looked like a silver flash of light, tiny and very brief. happened when it moved around. i take some pictures and video. some pictures came out but the video is too dark to see the ufo bobbing/wiggling around near the moon. at this point i realize i need binoculars or a telescope if i want to be serious about ufo hunting. my break ends and i go back inside, back to work. its my last break, at 6am. the moon is again in a different spot in the sky, more north, and the starlike ufo is still hovering next to the moon, same distance as before. my friend billy and this new female named melissa are looking at it. melissa says \"is it alien?\". i say \"i dont know\". then billy, my coworker friend tells me about a time when he got off of work around 4am, laid back in his truck and saw a similar object. he said it moved fast in a circle, and just whipped away. he thought his eyes were playing tricks on him. while billy told his story, i stared at the object near the moon. at this point, i realize that the ufo must be attracted to the moon's gravity. how else could it keep a distance from the moon so consistently over such a long period of time? i tilt my head to the left so that the ufo is directly above the moon and sure enough, it looks like its hovering inside possibly the gravitational field of the moon. its like the ufo is tethered to the moon. it will move slightly left and right, and also up and down from that \"home\" hovering position but it tries to \"center\" itself in one area above the moon, trying to keep the object steady. the movement reminds me of how bob lazar describes ufos as moving \"goofy\" in the sky. then something interesting happens. i see a tiny bluish light moving across the sky near the moon. i then see the starlike ufo move up and away from this bluish light, then back down as it passes. i realize the bluish light was a satellite and it appeared that the ufo was trying to avoid collision as it moved up and away from the small satellite as it passed thru. the small bluish satellite continued to move away from the moon at a steady velocity.\r\nthe ufo continued to hover and make no noise whatsoever. which makes sense since it looked to be very far away. i go back inside and go back to work.\r\ni take another peek outside near sunrise, hoping to see a craft in the sunlight. i see the starlike ufo again in the twilight of morning around 7am, and its still doing its odd, subtle movements. i go back inside. i come back out one last time at 7:30am. the sun has risen but i can only barely see the moon now. i look for the starlike ufo, and its no where to be found. i lost it. i go back inside to my job. after work, around 8:50am, i am leaving my workplace and i look carefully at the moon for any craft. i do not see anything near the moon. its like its completely gone, only a memory now from the night-time. i keep looking but see nothing. i ride my scooter home and wonder if i will see the same starlike object again tonight.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"03:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

woke up coughing with croup again. we went outside in the cool air as his dr instructed us.  we were outside for 5-10 min.  it was just before daybreak and still pitch black out.  our porch light was on and shining on us.  we were looking at the sky at the big dipper and trying to find satellite's or planes as i tried to calm my son's cough.  we spotted 5 lights at the tail of the dipper in the north. the lights were in a perfect v and appeared like stars.  they were slowly traveling east to west much like a plane would. all the lights appeared the same.  i pointed them out to my son, he saw them and shouted out and also pointed at them.  immediately they stopped and slowly rotated until the v was pointed at our direction.  it then came directly overhead at 10 times the rate of speed of its original path.  it stopped directly overhead and slowly rotated back towards its original path and slowly returned and continued on its path until out of sight.  the entire time it was completely silent.  i've watched the space station, planes, satellite's,  helicopters go overhead on other occasions but have never seen anything move in these ways defying general flight norms and in such silence.  it moved as though it was gliding like a hawk circles its prey.  based on the lights as they appeared on the horizon compared to overhead it was quite high in the air and substantial in size, much larger than an airliner.  it was a solid mass as it passed stars disappeared behind it.  we returned to bed.  the only other strange thing was that when we went back in the house the lights would not turn on or off, if they were on they stayed on and off they stayed off.  my wife got up at this time and also did not understand why the lights would not turn on or off.  when we got up at 7:30 am that morning  all lights worked normally. this has been bothering us all day and we did some googling and found this site.  we have never witnessed or experienced anything like this before.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

ok. we had been looking at all the wind turbine fields and had just passed a field that was on both sides of the highway. i was driving (wife).  i just saw it, thinking it was a plane. it didn’t move, so i thought it may be a helicopter. it still didn’t move so i said something to my husband. after laughing about it being unknown, he dismissed it from being any kind of balloon, large or small. i convinced him to try taking pictures (he didn’t want me to stop). \r\n\r\n it was a beautiful bright clear day.  this object did not move. we could see no wires, nor tethers of any kind, holding it up, or in place. it did not waver,  or act like a balloon moving in the wind. there was no tear drop appearance like a weather balloon, nor hot air balloon. it was approximately 1:00 high as we moved north.  it was east of the turnpike. it was large. i saw it for several miles ne of our position as we drove north. i know this because we had been talking about it for several minutes when i saw the turnpike sign saying the toll booth was two miles ahead. my husband thinks it was around 1-3 miles east of the highway. because we didn’t stop, we didn’t get too much detail. it was totally a white orb, except a bit grayer underneath, i assume,  due to shadowing. we didn’t see any air disturbance. \r\n\r\nas we moved north, tree tops along the highway can be seen. my husband estimates them to be 35-45 feel tall. power lines next to the highway can be seen, as well.  it seemed to be above the fields. several other cars pulled over on the north and south side of the toll plaza, we think possibly to observe it, as well. this is conjecture. the highway was very busy. anyone looking up could see it. \r\n\r\nupon getting home and unpacking we checked the “live” photos my husband took from his iphone 7. any movement seen is from our speed along the highway and his hands holding the phone. this thing did not move. also, as we zoomed in on the photos he took, dark spots can be seen here and there around the edges of the orb. \r\n\r\nthis may be very explainable, but we have no ideas. we have not edited these photos in any way. \r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One
