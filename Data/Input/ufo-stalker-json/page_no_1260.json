light, brighter than a bright star, moving faster than an airplane would move, in the ssw sky. then two more lights appeared, moving at the same speed as the first light. they were precisely (it appeared to me) in a straight line. there was no sound. i watched for about 1 minute. then the first and third lights went out, leaving only the middle light to observe. it stopped moving in the path it was on suddenly, and stayed in place--again in the ssw sky. it dimmed and looked then like an ordinary star, but was slightly moving in a random, somewhat angled manner, little jerky movements. i watched it for about 5 minutes and decided to come in a write this report. no sound, too far away to see any shape. going back out to see if it still there.\r\ni figured out quickly they were not aircraft (no sound, moving too fast), and then decided that they were not air balloons, (again too fast, none of the whish sound that balloons make when they fire up the burner to elevate them). they certainly weren't flares because they were not dropping to the ground. many years ago, while living in syracuse i once saw three ufo's in the sky, but they were not as bright as these were, and formed a much tighter formation than these did tonight. my general feeling was interest, curiosity. i quickly eliminated what it \"wasn't\", and then realized it might well be a

was contacted by someone representing themselves as mufon investigator in that year. i was asked to tell my story somewhere down in detroit. i had to decline because i was working at the time. i'm now retired and have pondered my experience over the years, so much, i've investigated other reported sightings taking place in the same month and year to compare to my sighting. i was looking on a website listing sightings taken place in michigan, during march of 2000, finding to my surprise no listing by you or anyone else of my sighing. why i'm submitting again. \r\n\r\ni think(mystical universe website) still carries a archive of sightings reported to them over the years, at least it did when i looked up my sighting a couple of years ago. so rather go in depth here again. i'll report the basics you ask for, leaving you to check out the other websites archives or contact me for any additional info.\r\n\r\n1) michigan, huron county, heading south on bayport rd alias (colwood rd), working (driving) on the way home from a weekly delivery route. approx. 3:00 to 4:00 pm.    \r\n\r\n2) the sun reflecting off it, as it flew over a small patch of woods embedded between to farm fields.\r\n\r\n3) maybe, large ice or nickel meteorite, run away weather balloon or a low flying ,man made, satellite.\r\n\r\n4) mostly sphere in shape, made up of varied (in sizes) octagon shaped, flat like faucets in a unevenly cut diamond, making up it's entire round shape, and the only things to be definitely identified, all reflecting in the sun light a nickel shiny color to the whole of the object. best compared to as a unperfectly round soccer ball, with what maybe a tiny tail with a very little white exhaust, noticed has object passed in front of me.. it flew fast, like a low flying jet, flying above the trees as much as the trees were in height. figure 200ft. no sound as it passed in front of me as in a straight line west to east, me heading north to south. i estimate the size 25ft to 50ft.  \r\n\r\n5) thought a ice meteorite if there's such a thing or low flying satellite.  slowed and stopped the truck approx. a half a block away to observe as it passed in front of me and disappearing in seconds, blending into the farm fields, i thought it was going to crash, if not into lake huron, canada for sure. never heard a word of a impact.  the sighting has made a skeptic into a believer, baffling me all these years later.  \r\n\r\n6) it's speed allowed only 2 seconds of view once it passed in front of me, however the object coming from the west allowed much more time to observe because of angle to approach, north to south for me and west to east for it. can sketch the object if need be.

Victoria","country":"Mexico","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Ufo incident\r\nsierra del cautivo section\r\nsierra madre oriental\r\nat the point of the border of the states of tamsulipas and nuevo leon, approximately 30 miles north-northwest of ciudad victoria, tamaulipas, mexico\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe hours between 20:50, 2 august 2013 and 03:00 3 august 2013:\r\n\r\n\r\n     at that time it is usually possible to find me on the west-facing corridor of our little adobe home in a rural area about 25 miles northwest of ciudad victoria, tamaulipas.  the west-facing view gives a good point of observation of the complex of the sierra del cautivo, which is a cordillera of the general ranges of the sierra madre oriental.   the elevations change sharply from our place....At about 1,000 feet....To parallel ridges of increasingly high mountains that rise to over 5,000 feet within 5 miles of our little place and then on up to nearly 13,000 feet within 30 miles as one moves further to the west.   these mountains are essentially impenetrable,  very rugged.   go to our quinta tesoro de la sierra madre website and use our google earth feature to check out the area to the west. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n     this area has continuing mentions of ufo activity, as do many places in mexico.   it is not at all uncommon for the rural people to immediately extol tales of sightings, in the most matter-of-fact tones, once the subject is brought up.  i have seen peculiar, very high elevation (satellite level) activity on various occasions during the fifty years or so of my being present in the zone, generally known as the santa engracia area, named for the original spanish colonial hacienda whose original structure is still a useable facility, in the form of a very nice guest lodge.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      guests at that lodge, as well as our little place, have commented to us about their sightings, almost always the extremely high \"night-orbs\" that change directions suddenly and that travel radically much faster than either the common night-time satellites or jetliners.    a distinct minority of reports by any respondent pertain to lower elevation manifestation, but the tales, reports, and serious mention by reasonable people are not that uncommon.   so, in a way, i was prepared for, and unprepared for the occurrences of that episode that straddled the hours that accompany the change from the 2nd to the 3rd of august, 2013.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n      just before heavy rains that would fall three and four days later, my view through the gardens and foliage of our grounds was excellent to the west and the first three or four ridges of the sierra del cautivo.  it began suddenly during the last remaining light from the previous day.   the lingering summer sunset behind those mountains allowed for a bit of discernment of detail of the topography, especially it being the case that it is something that has long been programmed into this observer's brain's \"hard-drive\".  towards the base of the mountains to the direct, due west, an orb of pale yellowish light, flashed in right to left....Arriving from general direction of the famous site of the el chorrito religious sanctuary...About 40 miles straight line distance to the north.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n     my first notion was that i must have seen a lightning bug and dirty glasses or humidity or something played a trick on my perception.   a cleaning with the tail of my t-shirt, a further check for any particularly chubby or high-speed lightning bugs revealed neither impediment to normal perception.   then, as i rose up from my rocking chair, a number of the orbs came in on the same route in fairly quick succession.  all of them went to the openning in the otherwise solid wall of the sierra del cautivo...An openning caused by the canyon of el tigre, and the site of the famous springs by the same name.  the canyon itself stretches back a couple of score, very tortuous kilometres, much of which is presenced by springs that normally flow continuously.    the mountains here are also famous for semi-precious stones, gold, copper, some silver, and lead production, dating back to the colonial period ending around the beginning of the revolution of 1910.  there are also massive stands of pine and tropical oak that have gradually and steadily recovered during the past couple of generations.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n      in any regard, these orbs....All identical in my determination...Continued to move rapidly to that point that marks where the canyon of el tigre opens the sierra del cautivo.   the orbs would stop incredibly quickly...Essentially instantaneously.    there seemed to be...Perhaps....A bit of vacillation, and then the orbs would disappear into the canyon.   a few orbs continued down five miles further to the south and do their hovering at the canyon of the san pedros....Another spring-fed rivulet and canyon complex.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n     i went and stood on the iron cover of our pozo de barbacoa, which affords an even better view to the west.  we then went to the neighbour's gate...(very nearby...40 yards) where one could take in nearly the full length of the scene.   during all this time, orbs would come in on their mad dash to the canyon opennings, intermittently.  while the vast majority came in from the due north, there were a few that seemed to come in from the east-northeast, as though from the gulf of mexico.   foolishly, i did not immediately start a count, and it was known that any attempt at taking  pictures would be pointless.   during this time, i made a generous peanut butter and jelly sandwich and poured myself a large glass of milk, then returned to our corridor to consume it all.  my dog and the three cats had even begun to pick up on the rapid travellers and they joined me, gazing out to the west.   the intermittent, but sustained arrival of orbs continued.   at an early morning hour i did call my wife in texas to tell her what was being witnessed.  the few orbs that came from the east-northeast came closer to passing more or less \"overhead\", and they seemed to be about 2000 feet above ground level.   there was no sound associated with the flights, and the luminousness of the orbs did not seem to pass their light beyond the orbs themselves.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n     while at the earliest points of the observation, it was my thought that they were more numerous, but after counting the minutes and seconds between later appearances, my best estimate is that there were perhaps as many as 45 to 50 different orbs.   after eight seemed to come out of the sierra del cautivo and went back on a northeast trajectory....At extreme speed...Incomprehensible....Things went \"dead\" after 03:00 on the morning of the 3rd of august.   it was a sleepless night, but there was no tiredness or sleepiness.  we normally awaken around 03:30 anyway to prepare coffee and feed the animals.   then i will listen to a particular radio program from houston (kilt - 610 am) that deals with hunting and fishing issues.  i went out on several occasions, but saw no more orbs nor any other inexplicable manifestations.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\ni swear upon my faith that the above account is a fair and accurate representation of the events of the times and dates and locations cited\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nthanks for your time and interest.   any questions or comments will be received and responded to with interest and sincerity.

 since it's a still picture you have to look at it to see what i am talking about. then after looking at the second picture which i took like 5-10 seconds later, just to the right of the objects in the first photo, i noticed 4 faint black dots in the second picture. when i was taking the pictures i didn't see or hear any birds,jets, airplanes, helicopters, nothing. after i had seen the photo's i contacted and showed the picture to a sanger california paranormal radio talk show host jeffery gonzales, showed him the pictures and he didn't know what they were? i was really excited that i might have captured real ufo's but without the proper photo enhancing equipment i can't sit here honestly and say what they are. all i know is that i would like to know what i had captured in these 2 pictures and if they are explained to be something else then what i feel, that's fine with me. that's why i am contacting mufon. if mufon has there doubts then i assume i will hear from you. i feel that before you come to a conclusion you make sure what you say has to be supported and proved before saying anything. the camera i used is a olympus fe-230 7.1 digital camera and i did not use the zoom when taking these shots. my daughter tried to enhance the first picture so there will be 2 pictures of the first shot i took. the second picture i only have the picture without enhancement. the second photo if you look above the 3rd tree on the right side of the picture, right above it you can faintly see 4 black dots? i assume then these objects were moving north to south from where i was standing. i have no idea what i caught but do i believe in ufo's? yes i do and love to investigate all stories, photo's and video people show.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":50106,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.83956815652565,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08242013-0003","longitude":-119.67969272739847,"occurred":1376833860000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1377339231000,"summary":"Taking a picture of clouds in the morning as a thunderstorm had fizzled out.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/50106_submitter_file1__P8182292.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/50106_submitter_file2__108287046855361565241689869366n1.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/50106_submitter_file3__P8182293.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"93611","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":5,"locationName":"Clovis, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:265617"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Beverly","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was on my back porch on the third floor with my brother his girl friend and an old friend of ours. i first notice the object when i was looking up at the night sky. at first i thought it was a plane then i thought it was a satellite but the shape was all wrong. the object was moving very fast in a straight line towards the beach. it was red in color and it had a strange pattern on its surface that was not light up. i lost sight of it when it went past the trees.

he was driving home heading east on hwy 10 from their camper in the waupaca area. he asked us to go outside and see if we could see the swarm of bright lights in the sky west of us. \r\n we went outside and observed 5 distinct lights that were as bright as venus is in the sky right now, but not nearly as large, just as bright. they were more of a pinpoint from the distance we were at from the objects and almost looked like you were looking at a very bright led flashlight from a distance. they moved up and down and left to right with no apparent or distinguishable pattern of movement, the lights would flash on for about 2 seconds per flash, but did not flash in any regular pattern or time interval. while we observed them they seemed to be initially moving, darting, west, then came back east toward our direction, then went west again until they just went out of sight. we observed vapor trails occasionally while they darted about. there was no sound initially, but about a minute after they disappeared we heard what sounded like thunder coming from the west. \r\n  our son had a better observation. as he was driving home from the waupaca area heading east on hwy 10 he spotted these bright objects in the sky. he stopped and pulled over to observe them along with his wife and 2 children. he called quite a few people that also observed the lights as we did. he said they were swarming around each other like nothing he'd seen before because they were so fast. he has observed fighter planes dog fight training when in the army, but these object appeared much closer to one another and were moving much faster. he said there was no sound, which seemed odd to him because he would have expected to hear sound at his proximity to the objects. they then dispersed, flew west, then back to the east, then west again at great speed and disappeared.\r\n  following our observation of the bright lights, we observed 3 more objects moving from south to north. these appeared more satelite like, very much like the iss as it passes by. very bright, then fade out. first one was about 2 minutes following the dissappearance of the 5 bright objects. it came out a ssw direction heading north and was only lit a few seconds until it was about 40 degrees above ssw. the next one came from due south went directly over the zenith and disappeared at about 70 degrees above north. the third was just about 30 degrees more to the east, appeared from overhead heading north and disappeared at about 45 degrees above north. \r\nvery odd. \r\nafter that we observed fast moving aircraft. 2 came from the southeast, one fron northwest all moving fast. two of them crossed paths very near the area we observed the 5 objects, the other from the southeast went in a more westerly direction. we have never seen anything like this chain of events before. very odd.","distance":"Over One
