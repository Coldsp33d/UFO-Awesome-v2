to see the type craft. more surprising i could see there were round objects following behind in the contrail. one of the objects stayed with the flight until the last picture. the objects may have been illuminated by the sun as it was 8:30pm and the sun had just set. if that were the case then why not the objects in front as well. you can see the cloud formations in the sky do not change in the different pictures but the object/objects stay in the same place in the contrail. i am 65 years old and have lived my entire life near a large air force base. i spend a lot of time looking up. i would judge these objects to be in the 35000 to 40000 foot of altitude range. the other strange thing. the speed seemed to be somewhat faster then other aircraft i have recorded at that altitude. all the

brighter. venus could barely be seen at this time to the west, as the sun was still bright on the horizon.\r\n\r\nchecked the object with binoculars and could tell it was not a star or planet. looked at it with a telescope, and it looked like a shiney almost transparent bubble with a line hanging off the bottom with a shiny object dangling wildly on the other end of the line. tried to record it with a 40x zoom videocam, but could not pick up the small line and dangling object. tried to set the camera up on a tripod in case the object vanished, but was too late. after 20 minutes of observation, the object vanished against a clear blue sky while perfectly visable.\r\n\r\nthursday evening at 7:22pm saw an identical object as the night before. this time to the west. kept it in view with a telescope. after a few minutes, the object appeared to explode like a 4th of july fireworks mortar with a very bright yellow display hanging in the bright blue daylight sky. slowly, it appeared the debris was falling after it exploded. about two minutes later, another like object was observed to the south. watched this second object for a few minutes with a telescope, then put my videocam on a tripod and started recording. about 10 minutes later, this second object also appeared to explode against the clear blue sky! i analized the video of the object, and it appears that the second object seperated into 5 seperate disc when it broke appart. it looked just like a stack of poker chips falling one by one!\r\n\r\nlike i said, this might be weather balloons, but how in the world can

noticed vehicles driving off of the road.  there was a small glowing spherical object that was a bright white/yellow color coming towards me from north to south, and diving at vehicles.  i heard no sound, but there was a trail of light behind the object.  the size of it was a lot smaller than a car, but it was moving very quickly so i can't be certain as to the exact size. many cars and trucks ran off the road in an effort to avoid a collision with the object, some cars crashed, and some vehicles stopped to assist other cars, which drove off into the ditch.  the object flew right over my car, as i headed north, but did not affect my vehicle. it seemed to be running more cars off the road that were headed southbound.  i was too afraid to stop, and kept moving my car forward slowly to avoid colliding with other cars or trucks.  there were at least two 18-wheelers involved and many cars, at least 15 vehicles or more were involved. i last saw the object as it moved into some brush to the west of the highway, but i don't know if it landed. if i hadn't of seen this with my own two eyes i would never have believed it. the story was on the news about the crashes, however, not one word

wisconsin is my home.  my cousin and her husband scheduled a golf outing at glacier wood golf course in iola, wi.  iola is a small town about 18 miles due east of stevens point, wi.  our golf outing was rather long as we arrived shortly after 4pm cst and played 18 holes.  our group consisted of 6, with 4 of us actually golfing.  we decided to have some drinks on the course and played at our own pace.  by the time we reached the 16th hole it had become very dark so we scrambled the final 3 holes in the darkness.  we were met by two attendents who were waiting for us to finish up.  we finished our round shortly after 9pm.\r\n\r\non our way back, we were travelling west on hwy 161 toward stevens point to end our evening and head back home to wausau.  about two miles before reaching the intersection of hwy 161 and hwy 10 (about 9 miles due east of stevens point) i noticed from the back seat of our car two large, non-pulsating, white lights in the se sky while gazing at the stars.  i consider myself to be an amateur astronomer so i love tracking celestial bodies.  the lights were both on what i would call the nw-side of the object, or \"rear\".  i call it the \"rear\" of the craft because it moving very slowly in se vector that is perpendicular to the arrangement of the two lights.  the two lights were essentially arranged in a line with one light in the ne corner and one in the sw corner of the object.  i could not see a third light in the front of the object, but the space between the two lights and slightly in front of it (in the se direction) was solid black.  i know that it was a solid object because of the few stars it passed, it would leave a void of darkness until passing through.  it completely blacked out these stars while it tracked slowly across the sky, heading se.\r\n\r\ni immediately turned the attention of the craft to my girlfriend, sister, and brother-in-law, but they didn't really seem to care.  i don't even know if anyone else looked at it.  i got the best look at it as we stopped at the intersection of hwy 10 and hwy 161 and paused for our right-turn onto hwy 10.  from this point on we continued to head west in the vehicle as the object continued to slowly head se, away from us as a slow pace.  after about 3 miles of travelling west on hwy 10, i lost sight of the object due to our heading and the distance put between my line of sight.\r\n\r\nduring the entire time of my sighting, i made sure to remember the details so i could report it.  this was my first ufo sighting.  i have seen plenty of satellites, meteors, etc. tracking the skies, but never anything like this.  i have heard the stories of the triangle shaped craft, and this is the most apparent thing i can think of that compares to it.  the only difference being that the front of the craft didn't have a light that i could see on it.  however, the back two corners did.  i also know that this object was solid inbetween the lights and that solid space extended out toward the direction it was moving.  it is impossible to determine the height of the object, however.  i also made sure that i accurately estimated the zenith in the sky as well as the time and the apparent speed (speed is easy to track if you can see how far apart the lights are from one another).  in this case, the lights remained attached by darkness (a void or the solid part of the object) that swallowed the starlight as it passed.  as a result, i would say that the distance between the lights would shrink by half every 30 seconds or so.  keep in mind that this also includes us travelling ca. 70mph away from it.  however, when we were stopped, i estimate that the distance between the two rear lights shrank by half every minute.  this is only an estimate, however.\r\n\r\nduring the entire experience i made sure to stay calm and remember as many details as possible, knowing that i had to report it.  my only regret is waiting this long to actually do so, but the images are fresh in my mind.  i am highly educated (i hold a masters degree in geography), i watch the skies frequently, and i know a lot about aircraft.  as a kid i wanted to be a piolot.  i know about most aircraft out there as the janes aircraft dictionary series is one of my favorites.  be assured - this was not an airplane.  it was too large, too low (i estimate about 3000 feet above if the distance between the lights is 300 feet).  also, none of the lights were blinking and they were too big to be navigation lights.  they also were not green or red.  it was more like two large landing lights in both corners that never waned or moved.  i cannot speculate on sound, but it was very smooth and was in no hurry to traverse the skies.  there were other people on the road that night, including some that were travelling in the se direction of the craft on hwy 10.  maybe somone else saw it too.\r\n\r\ni hope this description helps.  i can make a map and even attempt to sketch what i saw if you like.\r\n\r\ndan berens","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

from under the canopy and walked into yard (to pass gas). he exclaimed \"what is that\" and pointed to the sky. he said to his daughter \"that looks like what your mom called and told you about.\" i walked over and looked and said it's the planet mars - because of the reddish color - then i realized it was too big to be a planet and it was moving in a north westerly direction. \r\n\r\nevery one

ascending my spouse noticed that our bedroom light switched on then off. the 2nd one also came from the south west & followed the same trajectory. it began to ascend but in an easterly direction until it was out of sight.\r\n\r\nthe first one was spherical & glowing orangish red. the second one was identical to the first one but it had a distinctly red segment along with the orange. there was no

during the sighting i was very excited, and awe struck. after the sighting i am left with questions. i would like mufon to look into our local airports radar (if possible) to see if they had anything \"unidentified\" that night. i mentioned my wife was very skeptical about ufo's but she could not deny that what we seen was not any conventional aircraft and therefore is/was a ufo. i believe it is important to note that roughly 1 minute after the sighting a commercial aircraft flew overhead at a low altitude with 3-4 red blinking lights and several white lights under the wings. this is drastically different from what we had witnessed only moments before. if necessary i would undergo a polygraph examination to what i witnessed.\r\n\r\nantonio m. jacob","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":50071,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.5656942,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08222013-0018","longitude":-87.8124939,"occurred":1376883780000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Wisconsin","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1377235580000,"summary":"My wife and i seen an orange light in the sky. my wife was a strong skeptic in ufo's, now her witnessing this event has wavered her skepticism.

lake. it was a calm and quiet night and you could see the stars and the lake was like glass.The sun had gone down. i was sitting and saw a red orange light come up and start floating towards my direction. it was very low and slow. i watched it and ran inside to get my binoculars, as i looked it looked like 2 objects  it had no navigation lights. it made no noise and did not flash or pulsate. just then another light came up and followed up the same path. the first light verred to the right. others followed same red, orange light, then they came faster and then they would double up and fly next to each other. some just vanished -while others went to my right (w). then i was not sure what i was seeing since it was so close and unusual.\r\nthen some minutes passed and again now to the west over the trees i see a lot of red orange orb lights bubbling up and around the trees. then a large orb came up and was followed by several other orb lights at least 25 or more followed, they just went and followed in a straight line and then the orbs just kept coming and then again formed 2 flying next to each other and then formed a triangle with other lights following in some sort of intelligent kind of formation. it was crazy and i don't know how these orbs could form a line, a pattern, and double up.\r\nafter this huge event i was in awe and dumbfounded, i sat for a couple of minutes- i looked over my shoulder and saw what looked like a bullet/pill white led light with a dull grey outline slowly move down in a straight line from the sky -like a star coming down from the sky. it slowly came down and  disappeared into the trees to my right. wow!\r\nthe area during this time was very dark almost pitch black. the area was also quiet with no people noise or boats. which i made the comment about.\r\nthen to my left i see again over the tree tops a line forming of these orange red lights that all do the same thing over again on the other side of the lake to the east. it looked like a a lead orange/red light would gather all the children and they would follow and make a triangle type  and intelligent type of formation, follow in single file and walk in doubles, with some sort of chaperon light following here and there.\r\nthen after that several minutes passed and again from the south straight in front of me came a lone violet/red light the biggest seen that night. it was almost oval like a football. soon it was followed about 2 minutes later by another large violet oval twin and then the first hovered and the other met with it. other round orbs came up behind red, orange, white in color and smaller and round. the lights went to my right (west) and all followed to they were all gone about 7 lights.\r\ncrazy night in beautiful michigan
