(a blast of static was recorded on my video when the object blasted up into space in a flash, even though the volume was turned off on the camcorder). i watched the video about 50 times and my neighbor about a dozen times, before the video was loss likely from a defective dvd disc. (still have the disc if someone knows how to retreive the video off of it?).I did save still shots of the video to my cellphone, but can not attach them here, but i can email them if needed. i drove to the area where the object was seen without seeing it further. i did note that high voltage power lines were in the area that the object was observed.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

20th, 2013, in the area of old carriage drive and homer watson blvd. in kitchener ontario. it was approximately 21:45, and i was driving home northwest on homer watson blvd. coming from cambridge. after passing the traffic lights at doon south drive i noticed what looked like a very slow moving glowing orange/yellow light ahead of me passing over homer watson, coming from old carriage drive. my apartment is on old carriage drive, so i have used my address in the fields above to note the location as it was extremely close by. it was barely moving at all. really just a very slow drift. it's position was roughly 30 to 35 feet above the utility poles and the object itself was also round/spherical and 30 feet in diameter. at first when i saw it i immediately thought it was a chinese lantern because of the soft glow and slow movement that you see in them, but i quickly realized the size of it and the shape was spherical. also, it did not flicker as it would from a flame. the glow was solid and did not pulsate or change at all. the object itself appeared to be solid with no features visible. i was in the left lane with a vehicle in front of me who quickly braked and i braked as well. the three vehicles in the lane to my right also braked and we all came to a stop on the road to observe this object. i did not take note of the lanes on the other side to see if anyone had stopped as i was watching the object intensely. i exited my car, along with the person in front and the person in the car to my right. i took out my cell phone to get a video as did the person in the vehicle beside mine. i could not access the camera or any other function of my phone. the person beside me said his phone was now dead and would not come back on, even though it was working just a moment ago. we observed the object for another 30 to 45 seconds. in that time it came to a brief stop (5-6 seconds) over the wooded area that lies between homer watson and mill park drive. it just hung in the air, completely motionless, the treetops were illuminated very softly. then the object resumed it's very slow pace continuing in the same direction heading north. the object's movement was slow, deliberate and did not waver or indicate that it was affected by wind. it appeared to be controlled and very smooth in its motion.\r\n\r\nthe person in the vehicle ahead of mine said he wanted to leave and was going to call the police when he got home. the person beside me said he wanted to leave now and got into his car and left, the vehicle ahead of him had already left. we did not communicate during the event except to say that our phones were not functioning. the traffic behind us had started to accumulate and cars were honking so i left and turned onto old carriage drive to head home. i turned my vehicle around to face the wooded area to see if i could still see the object but it was out of sight at this point. \r\n\r\ni called the police when i got into my apartment who said no one had reported any such thing and the dispatch operator didn't seem interested in my call. i called the breslau airport later that night and the person who took my call got the information from me and said that there were other calls about the same object but closer to the airport. they wouldn't provide me any other information so i ended the call. \r\n\r\ni can't say with any certainty what i saw, but i'll sum up the characteristics below;\r\n\r\n- orange/yellow soft glowing light approx. 30 feet in diameter\r\n- very slow moving, able to stop briefly then resume its course, indicating it was a controlled object and not a natural phenomenon\r\n- completely silent\r\n- no blinking lights or any other signals to indicate it was an            airplane or helicopter\r\n- was approximately 70 to 90 feet above the ground\r\n\r\nthat's what i saw and i'm still puzzled today. i wasn't frightened by the event, but i did feel unsettled and still do today. it just left me feeling very strange. please feel free to contact me if you require any other details.","distance":"101-500

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"  i was cleaning a vacant apartment on the 13th floor, ( i'm a maintenance guy for an apartment building in downtown detroit) on a sunny fall day.  \r\n\r\n  something kept reflecting sunlight into my eyes from out side, i ignored it the first few times, figuring it was a traffic helicopter or passenger jet. after about the 5th of 6th time i was annoyed and went to the window to see what was bouncing this sunlight at me. \r\n\r\n   right away i could see this shiny object off in the distance, maybe a couple miles away, maybe further.  at first it seemed to be stationary, so i figured it was a helicopter. as i'm looking at it starts to head in my direction, and as it gets closer it looks less and less like a helicopter.\r\n\r\n  it takes just a few seconds (maybe 8 seconds?) to close on my position, until finally it's only maybe 20 or 30ft outside the window i'm at on the 13th floor.  it's at my altitude, basically eye level with me, as it starts to rotate up on its side.\r\n\r\n  i'm in awe as this is happening, not frightened, or nervous, just amazed. the first thing that caught my eye as it rotated on to its side was a small pulsing red light in the center of the underside of the craft.\r\n\r\n  it's hard for me to explain the shape of the craft so i've included three drawings.  part of the reason it's taken me so long to make this report is because i've had a hard time getting the sketches just right.  \r\n\r\n  i've tried to draw this thing a few dozen times and i've never been happy with the results until now.  i can say with absolute certainty that the drawings i've included are exactly what i saw. i've also included a photo i took out of the window i was standing at, i took this photo at a much later date, just as a reference to the area. \r\n\r\n  basically the craft is in the shape of three saucers connected together in the center, only one dome on the top, but three \"pods\" for lack of a better word make up the body of the craft. it seems to be a polished metal, not a mirror finish like chrome, but a reflective metal surface.\r\n\r\n  so as it's tilting towards me i see the pulsing red light, and i see that each of the three pods has a round circular light in its center.  once the bottom of the craft is facing me the three white lights start blinking in a sequence, and the craft starts to rotate clockwise.  the blinking pattern gradually speeds up, and the rotation remains steady.\r\n\r\n  then another set of light around the outer edge of the three white lights start flashing, only these are multi colors. there are very vibrant blues and greens and orange and yellow and purples.\r\n\r\n  the sequence speeds up more and more until the whole thing is just a blur of lights, all the while rotating at the same steady pace.  then the lights just stopped suddenly, the craft rotated back down to it's upright position, and it hovered off to the north east around the side of my building and out of my line of sight.  \r\n\r\n  i never saw it shoot off at tremendous speeds or anything, it just hovered away.  i ran down to the street level and searched the sky to find it again, but i never saw it again.\r\n\r\n  i felt like the craft was trying to hypnotize me, but i don't think it worked, at least i never felt any different. \r\n\r\n  although i must say that since this event i've done a lot of research on ufos and the subject of abductions, and it seems most folks don't think anything other than a sighting happened to them either.  so i suppose there could be more to my story, but i remember looking at the clock after it left and i hadn't lost any time, so i'm assuming i wasn't a good candidate for abduction. \r\n\r\n  this is by far the strangest, most amazing thing that has ever happened to me.  even though it's been almost five years since it happened, i remember it like it was yesterday, and i'll never forget it.  it has changed my outlook on life for the better. i've made allot of positive changes in my life since my sighting and i feel blessed to have been witness to such an amazing thing.","distance":"21-100

gmt\r\n\r\n\r\nmultiple sightings of various ufos at close range, altitude and high altitude, taking place over two hours. \r\n\r\nat high altitudes on clear sky morning at sunrise there were four blurred, hazy green lights in a line formation with a fourth red light at a 90 degree angle to the lower green light. this object moved vertically up and down from position to position disturbing high altitude clouds. \r\n\r\ncloser to the ground, no more than a mile up three smaller single green lights moved around in different directions, covering miles in seconds and returning to hover. \r\n\r\nmuch closer to the ground, hovering silently 20 - 30 feet up from the observers, two medicine ball size, dull metallic 'orbs'. both with one small green light towards the top were seen in multiple locations. from the direction of one of these two small round objects came a silver metallic 'l' shaped object (not attached but disconnected moving independently) slowly hover/move down 10 feet closer to the ground. from this l shaped object came a translucent but with red light within, eel shaped but robotic object about one foot long and 10 inches wide. it came to within feet or inches of one observer. \r\n\r\nin the distance, hovering no more than 20 feet above the horizon, estimated to be about 1 - 2 miles away. a large silver metallic disk with a black band running horizontally along the middle seemed to hide behind a tree line. given away by the sun reflecting on its top.\r\n\r\nthe rest of the experience is a personal subject but i think the governments of this world really have to acknowledge and do something about this level of interference from other, more advanced and perhaps megalomaniac species.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500

kept an eye on it and realized the further i drove the more the objects formed a striaght line as i was completely east looking west of the objects, the furthest one in the distance dissappeared over the horizon of what i could see, the other three remained visible,  just a solid redish orange white colored light being emitted by these objects, they just stayed in their spot, no strobe lights, no green or red id lights, no movement, as i made my way further south i was trained on the stationary lights, about 4 minutes into the sighting i watched as the closest one to me started to move southwest and did a quick jump and shot away leaving the other two visible lights behind and i watched them til i drove out of sight, i filed a report to the police of ludington, they had an officer investigate it but i received no notice on the investigation, the woman on the phone said there was a water holding facility up there with lights similar to what i was explaining to her, but i assured

look at the stars,only to see a gigantic thing that i \r\nthought at first looked like a galaxy. it was stationary and was in the shape of a domed craft(the dome part was very tall). inside the the outline was what looked like a million stars. there was also wide bands of color around the thing like transparent-washy looking(red,blue and green). also a mist enveloped it(partially) and the mist was rotating slowly like around a planet. the countless lights that looked like twinkling stars didn't untwinkle. in the background you could make out a structure-city-like construct. i watched it for 5 minutes or so, went to get my camera, and the battery was dead(never happened before). the next night i had a friend over and we both went outside to smoke (we're both nightowls). i thought to myself-it's about the same time(after 1:00 am),i wonder if that thing is back. sure enough, there it was. i called him over to the same spot in between the cedars, and asked him-\"what do you think of that?!!!\" his reply was-\"they're here!\" we watched it for 5 or so minutes just floating there. couldn't tell how large it was(because it was so huge and not knowing how far away it was.)went to get the camera and remembered-the battery's dead. didn't charge it because i had no way of predicting it would return a second night. someone else had to see this. noone's talking or they never look up.Or just plain afraid. after processing this in my head a while, the only conclusion i came up with is-floating city (of sorts). the airport had to have a nervous breakdown. i wish i watched it for a
