(quality inn & suites, 3301 atlantic ave., ocean city md 21842, phone:  410-289-1234, fax: 410-289-0123) his wife and children were asleep inside the suite and the lights were out, except for a night light.\r\n\r\nthe witness��� position was: n 38* 21.697���   w 75* 04.263���  elevation: 20���.  \r\n\r\nthe night was clear with a minor degree of light diffusion from nearby hotels.  the moon had not yet risen and would not for several hours hence. above the horizon, due east, were occasional flashes of light, emmited by a thunderstorm occurring beyond the curvature.  several meteor streaks were observed by the witness as well as a number of commercial aircraft at standard cruising levels, before the sighting.  at approximately 10:00 - 10:15 pm the witness noticed a small orange light to the north that appeared to be quite low over the ocean surface at approximately 100 ��� 300 feet in altitude, moving in a southerly heading toward the witness at a rather rapid rate of speed.  within approximately 10 seconds, the light had reached the size of a full moon and was very bright ��� the brightness and color approximated the coloring and intensity of a setting sun.  \r\n\r\nthe witness had binoculars and focused them on the light.  with the magnification, the object appeared to be a glowing orange sphere with uniform color and brightness. the color was soft and muted and emanated from the interior of the sphere.  the sphere was pleasant and soothing to the eye. there were no other lights or visible characteristics appearing on the sphere.\r\n\r\nthe sphere was approximately 5 ��� 10 miles, north, of the witness when it reached its maximum size and it remained several hundred feet above the ocean surface.  at this point, the sphere began moving in an easterly direction, directly out to sea, and it diminished in size due to its increasing distance from the witness.  it continued on its easterly course for approximately 10 ��� 15 seconds until its size appeared to be that of a very large star.  at this point, the sphere commenced a straight climb of approximately 45* on a southerly heading.  the climb was rapid and it leveled off at approximately 10,000 feet.  it then continued straight and level on its southerly heading.  the angle of inclination of the sphere, at this point, was estimated at approximately 30*.\r\n\r\nthe sphere continued on its southerly, level course for approximately 10 seconds then turned to a south-easterly heading, in the general direction of the the thunderstorm, and continued on this course until it was no longer visible due to the increased distance from witness.\r\n\r\nthe witness continued to watch the sky for approximately 10 minutes thereafter. then, assuming the sighting had come to an end, he entered the suite and proceeded to the kitchen where he filled a bowl with caramel popcorn and returned to the balcony. the witness was absent from the balcony for approximately 5 minutes in procuring his snack.  he resumed watching the sky for any further activity.  after about 10 minutes, the witness noticed a second sphere in the same azimuth as he had initially seen the first sphere.  \r\n\r\nhis second sphere was identical to the first sphere in every respect.  it proceeded to follow the same maneuvers as did the first sphere at the same speed and altitudes.  it proceeded to the final south-easterly course and, like the first sphere, was no longer visible, after a short time, due to the increased distance from the witness.  approximately ten minutes after the second sphere's disappearance, a third sphere, identical to the first two, appeared in the same azimuth as the first two spheres and repeated the same course maneuvers, identical to the first two spheres.  this process continued, until a total of eight identical spheres observed. the sighting came to an end after the eighth sphere.  the elapsed time from beginning to end of the sighting was approximately 60 to 90 minutes.\r\n\r\nall the spheres were silent throughout their manuevers and their speed remained constant.  all legs of the course were flown in a straight flight pattern, with no irregular movements, and at a constant velocity.  the only aspect of their maneuvering that was anomalous was that their course changes appeared to be angular in nature, while normal aircraft require a curved course to change heading because of their dependence on air pressure differentials to accomplish flight and directional control.\r\n\r\nalthough the flight, velocity and climb characteristics of the spheres were unremarkable, as a former military pilot, the witness had never observed any aircraft of this appearance in the sky and had never witnessed any craft, at this close range, under precise directional control, do so in total silence.  these aspects of the sighting were, to the witness, totally anomalous to his experience.\r\n\r\nas a former military pilot, the witness ruled out the possibility of these objects being baloons, due to their precise, controlled maneuvering and their velocity and climb characteristics.  he also ruled out the possibility of their being blimps, due to their speed and maneuvering characteristics and, also, their physical appearance.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

daughter noticed two objects in the sky coming our direction.  although it was a full moon, there were a few clouds blocking the light; and whether because the sky was dark, or because the objects were, or both, we could not see a definite shape to them, only a red light in a star burst shape on the bottom.  based on the shape of the lights though, i would guess the objects were round, and about 30 feet across.  initially they both flew parallel to one another, at about the altitude of a small, single engine aircraft or helicopter (maybe 500 feet in altitude).  neither made any noise, and we didn't notice any kind of vapor trail or other lights.   \r\n\r\nbecause several large trees were blocking our view, we crossed the street.  as the approached our position, the distance between the objects widened.  when they were within a couple hundred feet of being directly overhead, the object on the right stopped completely and hovered, while the object on the left continued forward.  within seconds of stopping, the lights on the hovering object faded - similar to how light bulbs fade on a dimmer switch, until the light was almost, but not quite extinguished.  this took 30 seconds at most, and at that point, the object began to drift back along the course it had flown.  it was not moving as swiftly as it went backwards as it had when it came forwards, and the lights were so dim, i had to squint to see them. \r\n\r\nwithin less than a minute of the lights nearly disappearing on the first object, the lights of the second object faded the same way.  the lights on both objects remained in this \"barely there\" state for about 15 to 30 seconds and then disappeared completely.  at that point we could not see either object well enough to tell if they flew away, and in which direction.  oddly though, a dog in the neighborhood; which had started barking as the lights approached directly overhead the pool, stopped when the lights disappeared completely.  we did not see any other planes in the area at the time, but approximately five minutes later, a small plane flew somewhat low, overhead.  it did not circle or hover however, so i'm uncertain as to whether it was connected to the appearance of the objects, or not.    \r\n\r\n  ","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

move from behind a very tall pine tree, but it is very far away. as i watched it went out of view behind the pine tree, and then re-appeared. the white and red lights it emitted seemed to be turning, and blinking. i actually was quite amazed and thought that this can not be a satellite. it would take a dip, move left then right,\r\nand seemed like it was hovering in between movements. it would rest for about 10 seconds and repeat it's movements. it also moved in a diagonally path.\r\nit stayed in the east and travelled southward, i would lose view of it  shortly before dawn. i felt very excited, and also shocked. my heart rate increased only because i could not believe what i was seeing. i have shown relatives this event, and they also were quiet amazed. i would try to convince them to try to stay awake until 4am so they could witness how much larger it seemed, and how you could see the lights flashing more prominently also it's movements that were more visual at that time. the exact date is what i am referring to as my last sighting. i have been watching this for quiet some time, actually the last three summer's.

another plane that was so close it was going to hit us. it startled us, the object hovered, it spun in a circle motion and wobbled then quickly ascended above us. there were rain delays for departing planes and there were about 20 planes ahead of us waiting to take off, and several behind us lined up on the runways that we could see,so naturally i thought omg another plane. i was extremely frightened as i thought we were going to collide, as i continued to stare in horror i realized that this object was not an airplane. at first there appeared to be a mist or fog around this object, the sky at this time was sunny and was becoming cloudless. it was startling, but since we could not use our cell phones, none of us was able to obtain a photo. the object did not shine in the sunlight, it appeared to be metallic and grey and it had several circular \"lights\" around its edges in a line horizontal line formation, it paused at it approached and seem to just hover or be totally still, then zoomed upward. ufo or drone? i am convinced and my initial reaction was that i had just seen a ufo in broad daylight.","distance":"21-100 Feet,

patio at the back of the house which faces north. as we observed the moon we saw an aircraft light and heard the noise of the engines dissipate as it traveled away from us further north. suddenly my wife exclaimed that she could see 'another fireball' over the trees in the same general location. (apparently she had seen one a month prior.) as i followed her gaze i could see a bright orange/red sphere slowly moving above the trees and towards my right (west). as we watched this sphere pass, two additional spheres appeared of the same color. they formed something of a triangular formation and continued along the ne to sw path. no noise could be heard. they were moving slowly and did not change course nor change size/color. it seemed that the front of the spheres were more red and the rear more orange - almost as if they were on fire. we made our way to the front of the house to track the lights and then saw an additional set of three spheres emerge above the trees following the same course as the first set. there were six spheres total. we continued to watch as they traveled slowly out of sight behind the neighbor's trees. we live close to the airport and are used to seeing aircraft lights and the police/medical helicopters that frequently pass overhead, as well as the noises they create. however, we heard no noises from these lights. i offered to my wife that perhaps these were military flares used for exercises but we didn't see or hear any planes or helicopters chasing these lights and flares (as far as we know) don't fly. very strange sight to behold. unfortunately, we did not have the presence of mind to try to record this event. it only lasted about five minutes.

connersville,indiana.We had stopped to use the restroom.After getting out of the truck my friend said look a flying saucer pointing to a light in the sky.I had just finished my tour of duty with the u.S.A.F.Security police and trying to impress him and started to explain why it was not a ufo.Both of us became in grossed in watching the light that travelled from one side of the horizon to the other.First that night there was dead silence,one of those nights were sound travels.We could hear cars in the distance but see no lights anywhere.The object that passed over made no sound.A helicopter or light planes engine should have been heard as it passed by us.The object seemed to move to slow for a copter or plane it just seemed to drift slowly.During the sighting my friend and i did not speak till the object was out of sight.Afterwards we jumped back in the truck just sitting there being silent.My friend then looked at me and said when that thing passed by the moon did you see a( and before he could finish i said a dome).My friend then got two sheets of scrap paper and said draw what you saw and ill do the same.The drawing were almost exactly the same except the angle of view.After this we discussed this just a little trying to figure out the one diffence on the objects lights.We then went home and althought we always got together every week ne never spoke to anyone else about our experience not friend nor lover or co-workers.It was not for fear of ridicule we just shut up about it for at least a year.At this point it sounds like an average report until one night while rehashing the incident together we both realized that we saw the object from a distance that was to far away to see all the details we described and both drew on the paper.And to this day i have been haunted by this experience.It never goes a way for any length of time.Ive always want to be regressed to relive the experience.Gentleman i have to sign off for not in at work using their computer,i know this report is almost forty years old but its like yesterday to me.Last but not least i was a trained observer in usaf since then ive worked for two local police organizations im not a nut and and the description of the object will if contacted amaze you.There are no known planes the have this lighting

to the stop sign at the intersection of manor road when i immediately saw three very bright red-orange orbs in the sky directly infront of me. i cannot be sure their altitude or size but they were certainly above the tree line and below the clouds. the orbs were arranged in a triangular formation and remained still during my observation. it was rather cloudly out and no other stars could be observed (they were by far the brightest thing in the sky). the orbs appeared to be hovering right above route 22. after watching for a minute or two i made a right turn onto manor drive and my
