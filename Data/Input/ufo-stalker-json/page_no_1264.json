one hundred foot diameter on the ground originating from, i would guess, one hundred feet up.  i was within one half of a mile of this light and it was in an area where it is very sparsely wooded, mostly sagebrush.  i at first thought it was a law enforcement helicopter searching for someone or perhaps the wildlife division counting deer or after a poacher.  as i drew nearer my radio developed a large amount of static, which was odd as i was listening to a cassette tape, and my headlights flickered off and on a couple of times.  i got really scared at this point and then with the quickness of thought the light seemed to gather in but didn't go out, and then it shot straight up and out of sight into the sky, the only reason it disappeared, i believe, is that i couldn't see that far.  the whole event lasting between 30-40 seconds, with the ascension lasting less than 2 seconds, i remember telling myself that there was no man made craft on this planet that could travel that fast, this appeared to be moving faster than a bullet. this was around 1986 and although i don't remember the exact date, i remember the event as if it happened an hour ago.","distance":"501 Feet -

(another words 3x the first orange balls original size.\r\nthe orange single ball then moved from left to right back once again into the white cloud and you could see it stop within the cloud as the orange glow grew fainter and smaller until it finally disappeared in about 30 seconds from moving into the cloud.  once the orange ball was extinguished the white illuminated cloud began to shrink horizontally. (both cloud ends shrinking to the clouds center.)   the cloud was losing it's bright white glow and was dimming as it took on  the same dark grey color as their surrounding clouds. in about 3 minutes the cloud was completely gone from the sky.  there was nothing left that i could see in the location the cloud dissipated from.  the storm cloud to the south still continued to rain and lightening.   it was just spectacular to see.  i really and truly think it was a ufo or a group of them.  a light doesn't leave a cloud and then turn abruptly around and go back into the same cloud.  it never lowered it's altitude.  it maintained it's altitude the entire time and would move in and out of the illuminated white cloud.","distance":"Over One

moonlight exceptionally bright. wanting to locate orion, my gaze was initially to the left. immediately i sensed movement in the sky to my right. i turned and saw a structure moving slowly overhead, brightly lit, and unlike anything i have seen or heard described.\r\n it could not have been more than 300 feet away. it was shaped like a brick and was, by volume, the largest thing i have ever seen in flight. it had four sides, each rectangular, and ends that were about one third the area of the sides, also rectangular. the sides were approximately 90 to 100 feet long, with the ends 40 feet wide and 30 feet tall. it was moving toward and parallel to the rear of my house. at a point directly behind my house it would have been about 25 feet (horizontally) from the building. it moved very slow, maybe 10 miles per hour, and was alarmingly low, less than 200 feet.\r\n the color was dull black, solid, seamless, with no windows or doors. the two sides and end that i could see were perfectly flat and non reflective. the perimeter of the lower face (bottom) of the object was encircled with large red and green lights the size and shape of footballs. the colors alternated with every other one being red or green. the lights switched on and off in sequence running clockwise around the perimeter with at least four equally spaced points off simultaneously, giving the impression of rotation (as a theater marquee). these lights easily numbered more than one hundred. there was no sound.\r\n the movement of this thing was straight ahead, with no deviation in altitude nor laterally. its flight was completely independent. there was nothing above or below the object and nothing pulling or pushing it through the sky.\r\n i watched, never looking away, until it disappeared behind my house (about 15 seconds).\r\n there is much more to describe but no space left to write.

same time i was trembling not believing what i was seeing and i asked my girlfriend if she could see it as well.  she said yes and then we both watched it together, kind of zig-zag about if you will.  after a minute or two of this we saw a normal aircraft cruising at roughly 20,000 to 30, 000 feet traverse the sky.  there was not a light around and the stars (including the milky way) were very clear.  the blue light then moved as a clear pin point, like a star, and shot up high into the atmosphere near where the plane was and traveled much much faster.  it then blinked out and then reappeared at another point well below where the plane had been.  the object then shot with such great speed clear across the sky, stopped, and completely changed directions back towards the west where i first observed it.  i felt fear, wonder and confusion as this was happening.  my girlfriend then decided we had been there long enough and wanted to go.  during this time, i attempted to capture the object on my iphone, but, there was not enough light to capture the image much less the stars.  i will gladly upload the images of blackness that i do have in case you can enhance them.  the event lasted for roughly 10 minutes.   it was hard to tell the distance of the object, but, my best guess would be anywhere from 5000 to 20000ft high and several miles away.  but, like i said,

from a birthday party going east on delaware county road 100 s (which is better known as river valley road in the area) just outside of yorktown, indiana. a half-moon was out in the sky in the southeast and the few clouds were very high. many stars were visible even though the sun had gone down within the last hour. as we got about one mile from tiger drive, i noticed two flashing/pulsating lights over a crop field in the south east. the two lights were about 200-300 yards in the air. i pointed the lights out to my wife who had a better view from her passenger window. she immediately saw the lights and thought the lights were the top of a tower. and i also thought they might be the top lights on a tower. the lights consistently flashed a red/green light like an airplane or tower, and the lights were as high off the ground as a normal radio or cell phone tower. i immediately slowed the minivan down to about 30 mph as the lights continued to get closer to our right now more in the south. there appeared to be no movement and the lights were evenly spaced out from one another, which was roughly 10-20 feet. i was really getting excited as we approached the field that the lights were hovering over, because i could not explain what they were. they could have been airplanes, but they weren't moving. my wife was still convinced the lights were tower lights. my daughter and son in the backseat were both seeing the lights as i slowed to about 20 mph down the country road. we came to a place in the road where our vision was obstructed to the south by a group of trees. the lights were going to be directly to our south once we got past this small grouping of trees. it took less than 3 seconds for us to pass the trees, but the entire family lost the visual of the lights in that 3 seconds, and we did not see them once we passed the trees. i stopped the vehicle on the road just on the other side of the trees because the lights should have been directly south of us less than a 100 feet away in the sky. but the lights were not there. they were gone. i briefly jumped out of the car to scan the sky all around, but there was no visual on the lights. the area where the lights should have been was a large crop field (soybeans i believe) and there was a lot of open space to be able to see in all directions besides the large clump of roadside trees we had just passed. i jumped back into the van and asked everyone to look out their window, but no one could see the two lights. those lights should not have been able to disappear within that timeframe. disappointed, i jumped back in the car and told the family to stay on the lookout. i also turned my cell phone to camera/video mode just in case i saw them again. i continued east on river valley rd. still looking for the lights. i drove about 500 feet passed a small forest to our right and the lights were hovering in the sky at the same angle as before and the lights were flashing in the same manner. because the lights were again to our southeast, i wanted to drive further east on river valley road so we could get as close as possible. the trees became much thicker near the road in this area so my wife could not keep a constant visual of the lights. we drove about another tenth of a mile, and my wife said \"there they are.\" so, i stopped the car right next to a residence on our left. i grabbed my cell phone and jumped out of the car. as i jumped out of the car, i could only see one of the lights. for about 5 seconds it was not moving--just hovering, then it suddenly and quickly moved back towards the west into being blocked by the trees. i had my cell phone out but i could not get a picture or video. it happened too fast. i got back in the car and my wife and children described the same as me. previously in the soybean field, we had never seen the two lights actually move. but as we stopped the car the light took off quickly to the west and out of sight. my son in the backseat said that he saw the light go up into the sky and disappear. my wife and i did not see it disappear into the sky. i turned around in the house's driveway to our left and drove west back down river valley road. no one in the car saw the lights again.   we stopped in a dirt road driveway to a farm about a tenth of a mile west of the original sighting of the lights. i got out of the car and scanned the sky for about 2 minutes and could not see the lights again. i decided to drive east to morrow's meadow on the white river just off tiger drive, which was about just over a mile from the original sighting. from afar, i saw a group of campers on the river as i crossed the bridge. at morrow's meadow there was a small reunion of roughly 20 people. i do not believe anyone could have seen the lights from morrow's meadows. the two lights could not have been more than two football fields in altitude, and they were congregated just north of the white river that runs through yorktown, indiana. needless to say, we could not explain these hovering, pulsating red/green lights that were not making sounds.

a large group of lights low in the night sky. i am a dedicated sky watcher and have seen many odd things but this was like nothing i have ever witnessed. i am also very familiar with aircraft.\r\n  i called my wife and daughter to look and i ran outside onto the deck to witness the amazing spectacle of a huge mass of white lights in the ese direction, toward the snoqualmie pass area of the cascade mountains. there were dozens of lights all in close proximity to each other. ordinarily i would assume i was looking at aircraft lights but if these were airplanes there would have to have been 30 to 50 of them all in the same small sector of sky. they seemed to be moving in a southwesterly direction. they seemed to be a great distance from my location as they were not as bright as the airline planes that usually fly over my house on their way to seattle. they were not flashing nav lights like airplanes, they were solid white. also they moved slowly indicating that they were very far away, maybe 15-20 miles distant. the highest ones seemed almost to be in a line, tilting upward at the south end.\r\n  i have to say that what they reminded me most of was the pictures of the aaa fire over baghdad during the iraq war. there were just dozens of lights (craft) in a small area. it gave the appearance of a mass dogfight in slow motion. after a couple of minutes they began fading out until only a few bright ones remained and then they faded out also. then there was nothing. the lights seemed to make no sound but they were far away.\r\n  i am familiar with the chinese lantern type floating lights that people send up and have seen them many times. these did not match that description. there were too many and were too far away. they also moved too much for lanterns as the air was calm and no wind. also, chinese lantern don't fade out all at once.\r\n  if they were aircraft, there had to be dozens of them. only the military has that many aircraft. i thought, maybe the army at ft. lewis was holding some maneuvers or maybe all their helicopters were making a late night return to base from the yakima firing range, but how could they just fade out in a minute? were they military flares? it seems unlikely since the forests are dry and it would be crazy for them to be dropping flares over the trees.\r\n  maybe the oddest part of this sighting is that i can find no other report of this incident anywhere. we can't possibly be the only people who saw this. this spectacular event was in plain sight of a city of well over a million people and no one else saw it? i thought for sure it would be on the news or at least in the ufo reports from mufon but i don't see anything. anyone who was looking in the east could not have missed this incident.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

objects in the air. at first i thought it was 2 planes flying very close but then realized they weren't moving. then the split apart and the light emanating from them was unlike any plane i had ever seen. there was no sound that i could hear and they moved very little. they looked flat or disc shaped, maybe even like a boomerang. then i watched in pure shock as they shot up vertically into space at a ridiculous speed and vanished. i thought it was over but then my family and i saw a third one appear out of nowhere, this is when i grabbed my cell phone and tried to record it. my only regret is

traveling north on telegraph road about 10:15 pm on friday, august 16, 2013 in monroe county, michigan.  we were between albain & dunbar roads when my husband looked out his east-facing passenger side window and said, \"what are those orange lights in the sky?\" my husband and i both saw 2 glowing orange-red lights which were larger than stars or planets. they were stacked one above the other, and both appeared to be rising in the sky over the fields to the east of telegraph road.  my husband commented that these could not be planes because they did not have any flashing navigation lights and because they appeared to be rising in altitude rather than flying straight across the sky as a plane or a helicopter would do.  we both found the lights to be fascinating to watch, so we kept looking at them while our son drove.  not more than a few seconds passed before the original 2 lights became what appeared to be a string of about 6 or 7 reddish-orange lights rising upward.  we commented to each other that the lights may have been over lake erie, which would be a couple of miles to the east of telegraph road. the lower altitude lights appeared to be farther away from us and the higher altitude lights appeared larger & closer to us. very quickly after we observed the line of lights, there appeared a cluster of the same type of lights near the bottom of the line of lights. altogether, my husband counted 17 lights total, the topmost lights being in the formation of a line with a cluster of lights at the bottom.  after this, buildings began to obstruct our view, so we could only see the topmost couple of lights.  we drove to veterans park on the river raisin in monroe (just west of telegraph road) and parked to watch the uppermost lights, which were still glowing orange in the sky.  as soon as we parked, these 2 lights that we could still view over the treetops seemed to fade and grow dim and then they disappeared.  they did not fly away.  they disappeared.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

regional road.  the time was after 12:30 am.  a short distance past highway #6 which runs into port dover ontario, i saw a cluster of bright white lights through my front window.  these lights were much brighter than normal lights.  as i drove i watched the lights descending and i was trying to figure out how far away they were and what they were.  then they appeared to move into a straight line formation and start moving off to my left.  at that time i was slowing down to a stop on the side of the road to try and get a better look at what they were.  when i rolled down my window i then saw that it was a single craft and it had been right over my vehicle for a while as i drove.  i got out of the car and stood beside it at the side of the road and watched as this motionless craft hovered less than 50 ft above the field beside the road.  it made no noise. it didn't beam me up. and i wasn't afraid. the lights at this time were not visible. after several minutes it started to move south west and disappeared in about 5 seconds.  i have never seen anything move that fast. the night was clear and i had a great view of something i probably will never see again. not too many people believe me but my friend when i told him said his son came home after work at the same plant that night, had seen the same object but from down the road behind me.  he was very frightened. i had reported this to other groups but i have never been asked about my encounter. obviously my dates are going to be approximates since this happened years earlier.

certain regilarity in when you can see it, i have recorded this object using a sony hd camcorder and you can see clearly that is a point of light, like a star, but this object moves not is straight line, so this is not an astronomical object or a man made satellite, this day 08/16/13 i first spotted the object around 7:30pm, still in daylight, a star in daylight, it first appeared on the north direction lower over the horizon, usually it moves not to much around the same point, but on 08/16/13 it moves up all the way to the zenith, and then it fades away on the west direction around 8:24pm.\r\n\r\n that day also i noticed a silent drone flying around, i have reported that here too, this drone in first view do not appear to have tail or winds, that is in the footage, but an closer look at hd still shots shows what appear to be shades of back rotating blades, so it looks like this was a drone checking the area.\r\n\r\n as i mentioned before i have observed this anomalous object many times and i have many hours of video recording of it, but with very low zooming lens, that day i was expecting it with a 402x60mm telescope and i managed to get extensive footage using this telescope.\r\n\r\n be aware that this object looks to be in the top levels of the atmosphere or near space.\r\n\r\n the object appear to have structure, a structure that i can't describe, and this object \"eject\" something in a frequent basis.\r\n\r\n  i am attaching here a 200 seconds segment of footage part of an almost 40 minutes video recording that i have, that complete recording will be too big to upload here.\r\n\r\nthis was recorded using a modified security camera pc165dnr with 3-9mm lens attached to the telescope's eyepiece opening.\r\n\r\n  when watching this video, please decrease brightness and increase contrast, i have the wrong settings when recording it, but doing this adjustment will compensate for that. what you will see will be very strange and definitely very, very interesting.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:50:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,  Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

drove in the rain for two and a half hours and never saw one flash of lightning nor did we hear a single thunderclap.  \r\n\r\nas we were driving on skeet club road we saw a round or ball shaped object flash very brightly over the roadway three times.  it was a very soft light blue color and it was right over the roadway about tree top level or, a little less.  it appeared to be about fifteen feet across with fuzzy edges, not clearly defined.  it flashed very brightly, like the flash from a camera.  it flashed two times rapidly, then a second or two went by and it flashed again.  the first two times it flashed it was right in front of the car and the last time it flashed it was right over the car. \r\n\r\nwhen it flashed the first two times i saw it's shape as being round.  but, the edges were not clearly defined.  it was just a light blue, very bright flashing object. \r\n\r\ni didn't see anything unusual before the first flash.  what i saw was two very bright flashes and then a blue object that rapidly faded out.  then the third flash that was right over us so, we didn't see anything but the flash due to the roof of the car blocking our possible view of anything that might have been there.  if i had time i would have tried to stop the car rather than drive under it but, it all happened very rapidly and i never had time to react.  \r\n\r\ni suppose it could have been lightning and i started not to report it except that as far as i know there was no lightning associated with last night's rain.  it was cool all day with a light to moderate rain all day.
