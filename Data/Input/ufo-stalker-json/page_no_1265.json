(appeared as a blue light that started to the left of the object and sequentially moved step-by-step to the right of the object, with the previous blue sections slowly turning white as the blue light moved to the right, until it reset and started back from the left (meaning, the blue didn't sway back and forth, but went from one end *left* to the other *right* and once it reached the end *right* it almost immediately started again from the left.)\r\n\r\nwhile driving down walton, i tried to see if the object was moving in any way. with the occasional group of trees or buildings blocking my view, i was getting my best views of it while i was passing the lakes to my south (first creger lake, then upper silver lake, followed by silver lake then finally school house lake). at first i thought it was motionless and was just hovering there, but then it began to look as though it was moving slightly higher on the horizon, and possibly slightly west. then again, it was hard to tell.\r\n\r\ni kept wanting to stop and get a good look when passing by a lake that gave me a good view, but i didn't want to just stop in the middle of the road. finally i found the perfect place to park and get a good look. a genesis credit union parking lot directly across the street from school house lake. wide open view of the southern night sky. i get out of my car to see better while grabbing for my cell phone (old with horrible picture quality and doubted it would pick up what i had been seeing, but was worth the try.\r\n\r\nas i stepped out of my car facing south i was astonished to no longer see what i was before, but something much different, something that was even more awe inspiring. a large red-orange glowing orb of light slowly hovering higher on the horizon and to the west (same direction i thought the blue-white object might be moving). from my point of view it was just below and to the right of the moon, moving to the up and right direction.\r\n\r\nthis object was either considerably bigger, closer to my location, or both. it was large enough that i would say it appeared to be about 1/3 the size of that nights moon, but almost appeared to give off an aura that made it change in slightly larger and smaller. i don't know if this was a different object all together or if what i had seen earlier turned into this.\r\n\r\ni now have my cell phone camera out, centered on the object (which is in the middle of my perfect line of sight, with no obstructions anywhere near) and i am trying to see it on the screen of my phone, with no luck (crappy resolution camera). i quickly try going into the settings of my phone to make sure it is set for night time pictures, and had the highest resolution (which it was already on) this took no longer than 10-15 seconds to do, but as soon as i look back up the object had completely vanished. with how slow this object was moving, i should have been able to look away for a very long time and it still be in sight. as a rough estimate i will say it should have stayed in sight for 15 mins or so, maybe more.\r\n\r\nwith so many people at the woodward dream cruse, someone else had to have seen this.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

reflecting light was very bright and made it difficult to tell. i thought it was a police car. i lost sight going down hill and saw it again maybe 30 secs later when i crested the next hill. this time i saw it for a longer period of time and it appeared to be sitting stationary in the middle of the road. i was closer but having a harder time telling if it had a flashing red light. i still thought it was a police car and wondering if it was blocking the road. it was between me and 66. there was no road to turn off on between me and 66. i went down the hill again and when i came up it was gone. then i came up the next hill and i was where it had been sitting. i'd guess it was roughly a minute between where i lost sight of it and when i reached where it was sitting. i saw nothing a police car would be blocking the road for and i had a straight, clear view down the rest of the road (about 2,000-2,500 ft), all the way to 66 and saw no cars. if it turned off, it would have to be in someone's

when i saw a big metal pole barn on the south side of the road with all it's doors open. in it was a big black truck with red tail lights (i thought they were glowing) sitting in the barn. i thought \"oh, i must have seen that truck\". within a few seconds a tree blocked my view and when i saw the barn again, it was full of green farm machinery and a man was standing out front who i didn't see before. no black truck, nothing that looked like a black truck, or even looked like red tail lights. at this point, i was a little freaked and started thinking about the 'police car'. the state police vehicles are dark blue and i was not close enough to any city that it was likely to be their car. also the light i saw only flashed red and not blue. i would hate to report a police car sighting but

our campfire talking when a woman and her two kids walked by. she was talking about the sky and pointing to the stars. so we naturally looked up. the sky was full of stars and absolutely crystal clear...No clouds!\r\n\r\nmy husband pointed to one of our satellites flying quickly across the night sky from the west to the east. i saw the satellite and commented about how fast it was moving. then 30 seconds later, my husband pointed at another satellite moving in the same trajectory. \"impossible\" i said. \"that's too close together, they could crash into each other\". \r\n\r\nas we were watching the second object flying across the sky, suddenly it appeared to be \"falling\" to earth in mid flight, then it stops its decent and emits a huge white pulsating light for about 10 seconds, then soars straight up into the sky directly above us and disappears...No longer flying on the same trajectory path as the first satellite. \r\n\r\nmy husband and myself looked at each other in disbelief. we both said at exactly the same time, \"it looked like it was falling!!\" i knew it was a true physical observation, because when you experience something that could be life threatening, your heart skips a beat...Mine skipped several beats that night when i saw it fall. it looked like it was falling directly down on top of us in the campsite. \r\n\r\nthis ufo was approximately the same size and appearance as the previous satellite and had a glow (like the satellite) until it dropped out of that orbit and flashed a huge white light that night that dwarfed the other stars in the sky. both my husband and i truly thought it was going to crash onto our campsite until it turned off the light and immediately soared up into space. why did that happen so just my husband and i observed the object? no one else seemed concerned or was talking about it in camp. it was all very strange, but we both agreed, that was no satellite!!","distance":"Over One

stargazing and it was a perfect night for that, but we hadn't intended to.  \r\n\r\nwitness #1:\r\nit was 9:55 pm because i had just checked on kids before 10:00 news; i was on second floor.  without my glasses on, i glanced out a bedroom window and saw a large red light in the east.  thought nothing of it because we have high altitude jet traffic, but did think it was odd that it was so red/orange, bright and large.  within a minute, witness #2 came upstairs and told me to put my glasses on and 'look'; i was shocked by what i saw.  i knew it wasn't a jet and hoped it wasn't a ufo.  i was uncomfortable and uneasy about what i was seeing.  it took me a couple hours to go to sleep because i was upset.  and i still am upset when it gets dark.  this event has freaked me out!\r\n\r\ni saw one large red/orange fuzzy orb (about size of golfball - 60x star) in the se, about 60 degrees from horizon.  and three smaller red/orange orbs (about 30-40x star) in an isosceles triangular pattern (in general but the lengths fluctuated).  they were in the east and lower, about 45 degrees from horizon.  all of the orbs were very bright, very intense.  the larger orb stayed separate from the other three orbs, they seemed to hover or move slowly, no sound and no trail.  after 4 minutes or so, the smaller orbs started to become smaller but still bright; then they weren't present.  the larger orb remained in the se for about another 30 seconds, then started to get smaller but still bright, and finally no longer visible.  i couldn't get a perspective to determine if the larger orb was closer to us as compared to the smaller orbs.  i checked my watch after the last orb faded and it was 10:00. \r\n\r\ni didn't notice any drastic or dramatic movements between or by the orbs.  however, they did move about some (3-4 inches from my perspective) but didn't dart.    \r\n\r\nwhile the lights were present, i looked around the sky in their area and did not notice any jet activity.  for the next couple of hours, i'd look out the window every few minutes.  as i mentioned this really shook me up.  about 10:30 or so, i saw 3-4 planes (not jets) in the area where the lights had been.  and then i saw a meteor traveling from north to south; that was out the same eastward facing window where i watched the lights.   \r\n\r\ndon't know if this is related or not.  we have indoor house cats.  around 9:30 pm, one cat was sitting by the sliding door, which faces east (the direction we saw the lights), and started to growl and get agitated by twitching her tail.  she does this (growling and twitching) when the neighborhood tom is in the area, but he has not been by in several months.  i didn't think anything of this and so didn't get up to look outside.  the other cat was in the middle of the great room, about 5 feet from the tv, which was off, and she started to stare at the tv.\r\n\r\nwitness #2:\r\nwitness #2 was on first floor and was turning off house lights to go up to bed.  witness #2 saw the lights before #1.  #2 went to close the sliding glass door and saw brighter than normal lights out to the east.  there were three orbs in a triangular formation and a fourth clearly maneuvering to join them.  there was some jockeying around to get into a rough formation.  #2 went outside to further observe and watched the orbs for about 3-4 minutes, then went inside to have #1 look out the window.\r\n\r\nthe orbs were fuzzy, there wasn't a clear shape.  they were bright and the light pulsated.  as they moved away, the reddish-orange light faded to white.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional

(100 yds from while i was observing a very large orange ball of light hovering about 15 miles of my position. after a few minutes a billiards triangle shaped object swoops in as if sliding sideways to a decellerated speed on its edge. making it possible to clearly make out its outline and position of large soft white lights at each corner with a larger soft red center. i was quick on the draw already snapping pic while relaying what i was seeing to my friend and had the phone video camera rolling as it rolled flat never made a sound. i then noticed that there was another further south and then another etc. i counted 8 total all hovering at what appeared to be the same altitude. the triangle moved in an l shaped trajectory headed south toward the orange objects and so low it passed behind a grove of trees. when it emerged it appeared to be a helicopter. i don't mean i mis identified i mean looked like a white bottomed blue lit skid rail with a red rear prop light and white nose light which was not decernadble through the camera. it traveled about a mile before it banked right on its side and dove like a high diver into the trees again no sound and only about 3.5-5 miles away probably over meridean st. the orange lights would occasionally move in unison a short distance. the triangle never emerged. i had walked to within 150 ft of 240th and o.K. hwy when i was shocked to catch a third set of craft moving fast and low together almost the same way a roller coaster's carts look if there were only 2 carts and you could only make out two bright pulsing red lights in the loww front fog light position. with a single pastel blue pulsing light in the rear higher than the fronts significantly. they were silent, very low and directly south of me headed west to east. they were the smallest and shortest sighting. the entire event happened over a 1 mile stretch of road in the area that i spent the better part of 27 years. i have watched these skys from this area my entire life and only experienced something this life changing once before. it should be noted that imediately after the second craft dove into the trees there was an intense static in the air and the smell of ozone was that of an impending rain squall. however, there wasn't a single cloud in the sky nor mossquito to swat. please feel free to contact me for any additional info via email or phone. i have attached the video pictures of the triangle craft and balls of light. i assure you that this is legitt as i have spent every night listening to art bell and the coast to.Coast am program while watching the rural sky and have waited for the chance to share an important event. i believe this is that event. thanks for being available to us.

river from louisville, kentucky. there had been a very strong thunderstorm with a lot of rain but the rain had just about stopped and on the indiana side the sky was curiously clear. \r\n\r\nwe had just entered a section of the interstate that was under construction and there was only one narrow lane to drive in with not enough room to pull over.  suddenly i saw a black colored ufo with no shine on the south side of the freeway about 200ft. in the air at about the 10 o'clock position and it was just hovering while slightly wobbling and rotating with a small red light going around it.   it was around 30 ft. in diameter.\r\n\r\ni don't think there was any sound - just a swishing sound but that could have been my tires on the wet road. the bottom of the craft had something like diamond shaped window panels on the bottom and a very bright halogen blue light shining from the panels.  just before it went over the car i saw a tapered black pole that curves over the top of the craft and possibly one coming up from other side that i couldn't see. they didn't connect though but there was a gap about 2 feet or so between them. \r\n\r\ni asked my wife \"what is that?\" she had to reposition herself slightly because i was driving and she was in the passenger seat. after a few seconds it traveled slowly to the north side of i-64 and even though it was still sprinkling rain she stuck her head out the window to get a better view of it. at that point i could not see it because it was about 2 o'clock high. \r\n\r\nit was there just a few seconds and then it went back to the south side and i could see it better now. it slowly enveloped itself with water vapor (?)  it disappeared and then reappeared in the direction we were traveling and seemed also clone itself with 6 other craft evenly spaced following us down the interstate. they or it followed us for around 20 minutes. \r\n\r\nwhen we got to the illinois state line we were both totally exhausted and slept (or tried to) in the car at the rest stop for a few hours. \r\n\r\nwe also had a cell phone but no camera and the phone didn't have a camera in it (darn-it). \r\n\r\nwe have mentioned this only to a very

phoenix bird like ufo while looking north with the hillside behind me to the south. the object was darker blue in the middle with lighter blue semi solid outlining lines. the lighter blue outer edges had some white in them as well or maybe it was just the light itself emanating that made it appear as white. i first saw the object at about tree top hight appx 100 ft away coming directly down holt ave from north to south. the speed was relatively constant at appx 5 mph. absolutely no sound whatsoever. it was slowly descending and heading directly toward me. i was completely frozen in my place. i did not feel any physical constraints but mentally i was very confused as to what i was looking at. i don't remember being fearful but i was not happy to see it coming my way. i feel like the object was intelligent enough to know i was there and stop appx 20-30 ft away and hover about 5-10 ft off the ground. i would guess up to this point we are about 20-40 sec into the experience. my dog was standing right besides me just as transfixed as i was. zero barking or any noise coming from her at all. we both stood their motionless. i am somewhat confused as to what happened next as the phoenix bird (think nazi symbol of the phoenix shown in all ww2 propaganda videos) simply moved back ever so slightly and vanished. i say that i am slightly confused about the end bcd i can't really remember it going it was just gone if that makes any sense. i went inside and laid down tossing and turing for a few hours wrestling with what i had witnessed. i know what i saw but have no idea how to make any sense of it other than another intelligent life form. i witness quite a few other strange anomalies during my 2 years at the above location but nothing anywhere  near as unexplainable. i have quite a bit of psychological questions which pester my brain in regards to this incident. i was exhilarated to have seen the phoenix but i later had to question why i did not try and interact as i always thought i would do if something like this ever happened. i do believe the object was intelligent, aware of presence, and able to read my fear. i now unequivocally believe","distance":"21-100

little brother and parents. \r\n\r\none evening i was sitting right beside my bedroom window playing video games with my little brother (7 years old at the time). the window was about 1 foot away from my head. it was dark outside...So it must have been after 8 p.M. \r\n\r\nsuddenly, i noticed a green (\"slime green\") light/orb...A ball of light outside the window about the size of a volley ball come into view in the corner of my eye, from the right side of the window...About 1 foot away from my face!  startled, i pushed my brother back away from the window. my first thought was that someone was shining a flashlight into my bedroom window.  \r\n\r\nthe light did not hurt my eyes and i thought it was absolutely beautiful to look at. i was not afraid....I was in awe. the orb moved slowly towards the middle of the window in one straight line, then slightly circled in small circles as if it was trying to focus or \"looking in on\"  my brother and i...Then it stopped completely for about 2 seconds. it was definitely some kind of intelligence behind it and we felt like we were being watched.  then all the lights when out inside the house. the electricity was gone. i called my mother who was watching tv in the living room. after about 2-4 seconds, the orb flew up and out towards the left of the house. i looked out the window immediatelly and it was gone. it did not light up the night sky nor did i see any trace of it anywhere. it had just disappeared. \r\n\r\n ...The electricity went right back on after this.\r\n\r\nmy dad and i immediately went outside to see if there was anything there and we found nothing. no trace of anything. \r\n\r\na few days later, -during the day-, my little brother saw another orb/ball of light at the same window. i was not present to witness this event. \r\n(my brother will report his story to you in his own words in the next few days with some video he has made of this incident.)\r\n\r\nwe have carried our experiences with us all these years because we did not know where to turn. we tried telling our story to family members and close friends, but we were pretty much laughed at. we dismissed everything, thinking it was ball lightning, but today we know it was definitely not ball lightning. my brother and i are now living in germany and since 1991 have not had any more encounters or experiences of such kind.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then
