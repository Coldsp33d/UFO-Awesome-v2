watching the meteor shower. she had fallen asleep and i observed what appeared at first to be a dim star near the seven sisters star cluster. from my position, i was looking back to the east/southeast. i noticed that the light was moving and it appeared to be higher than planes fly, although being dark, it's hard to know for sure. the light appeared to fly in a roughly southerly direction until i could no longer see it due to the mountains. the light began quite dim, then disappeared. when it reappeared, it was substantially brighter than it's original luminosity. then, it went dark again. the cycle of dark, dim, dark, bright was visible to me for roughly 1.5 to 2 minutes; each phase of the cycle took approximately 2-3 seconds. the light appeared white in color.\r\n\r\nchances are, especially in nv, what i saw was a plane, but it appeared much higher than any i've seen before. i have no formal aviation training but have lived in the flight path of mccarran airport 8 years and am fairly familiar with their various entry and exit routes, given the wind, weather etc. this object appeared not only higher than expected but also appeared to be headed in a direction that i don't think i've seen before, however it is possible that being roughly 30 miles west of my house skewed my perspective. i also notice that there never seem to be flights originating from mccarran that early. perhaps it was just an international flight or some other one going somewhere quite far away. one thing i've noticed about planes even flying very high is that one can usually see one or both flashing lights on the wings which have a fairly frequent flash time/cycle. this object definitely had a much slower flash cycle, and i've never seen a plane that flashes with different luminosity each time, nor have i ever seen a plane go dark for several seconds as part of the light flash cycle.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"   i was on my way to work headed south from tularosa to alamogordo, new mexico.  at the time i was working at the radio shack in the white sands mall.  so it must have been around 12:00 pm.  usually i take us 70/54 but decided to take the rail road access road just because it was a change of pace.  the road is a slow road 50-mph max.  i spotted a black object that at i first thought was a water tank. the kind that supplies water to cities and i wondered when they had put up a tank.  but then i realized it was too high in the air and it had no support structure.  i would say the object was between 80 to 200 feet off the ground, moving slowly north to south approximately 30 to 50 mph.  it was probably somewhere between highway 70/54 and holoman afb property line.  i thought it might be a balloon, but if it was it was a very ridged structure. i saw no rotation, and could not make out any detail other than it was black and had a configuration like a water tank.  i followed it almost all the way into alamogordo when it began to descend, it landed in a grove of trees beyond what is called the la luz gate that lets employees onto holoman afb.  the access gate was locked so i was unable to get any closer than that.  when it landed i noticed a blue airforce pick up drive towards it.  i was unable to see much more because it disappeared behind the trees so i could not see any kind of recovery crew. the object descended slowly in the manner of a hot air balloon but with much finer control.  its controllability was not erratic at any time, nor did it act as a balloon would act.  prevailing winds are from southwest to northeast so it would have been going directly against the wind.  i saw no emergency vehicles or any indication of what was happening was unexpected.  my assumption however unusual the sighting was and it still is my assumption that it was some kind of experiment conducted by the air force.  i have never see an object like it before or since.  but to be honest i haven���t been looking.  i couldn���t tell you if it made noise because it was too far away ��� to no more than a mile away and i had (old car lots of noise) car engine noise.  when i stopped at the la luz gate and watched it land i didn���t hear any noise, but at that point it was still a good ��� mile away.  winds would have been such that the sound would have not carried to me unless it was extremely loud.  my times and dates may be off by a lot because i am trying to remember something that happened several years back.  i have 22 years experience in the airforce as an aircraft mechanic, and i am aware of most but not all aircraft configurations.  slow steady direction, no visible changes or erratic movement.  flight level was constant until it reached la luz gate then it did controlled and easy decent.   if i had held my arm out i could have covered the object with the end of a pencil eraser. i would say judging by the trees it went behind it was 25 to 30 feet wide and about the same tall.

slowed down to see if i could pinpoint an odd sound coming from my truck. i rolled the window down to listen for the sound then sped up to see if acceleration had any effect on the noise. about thirty to forty-five seconds of driving at about 20mph a coyote ran out in front of the truck crossing counce rd. headed north causing me to stop. i watched the coyote run down the embankment and into a field. he stopped directly next to a telephone pole. as i was still stopped looking at the coyote i noticed a light that at first i believed was connected to the pole. about 35 to 40 degrees above the horizon i saw three bright semi-pulsating lights in a triangular formation. \r\n\r\nmy first thought was they were helicopters in a tight formation. then i considered airplanes taking off from the memphis airport. i've lived in memphis most of my life and am very familiar with the take off/landing patterns of planes as fedex has their main hub there. this time of night was about right for the first inbound flights of the night. i leaned over to the passenger side window and looked back east and could see planes lined up for landing in the distance...Their front main white and red blinking tail and wing lights small but clearly visible. i looked back to the lights still hoovering in the same position and considered that perhaps it was a cellphone tower that was not too far away. i looked east again and spotted the tower blinking red.\r\n\r\nat this point i started driving again 20-30mph only taking my eyes off the lights for a few seconds to keep the truck on the road. this is the delta, and farms are everywhere. there were no obstruction to my visibility and the lights were situated perfectly above one of the fields. i was trying to figure out the distance when what i think was a helicopter passed between the two lower light in a downward angled path, that's when i realized they were either huge, or huge and farther away as the helicopter seemed like only a red blinking speck.\r\n\r\nby this time i had reached the intersection of counce rd. and ms hwy 3. my view was obstructed for a second or two as i turned right on to hwy.3. i considered trying to take video but figured it would look like every other dark and blurry night shots i'd ever seen. instead i called my friend...It was exactly 00:14. right when she answered the bottom right light shot quickly away to the east and stopped...Pulsated different colors for a short time...Three seconds at most then began to slowly move east until it completely disappeared. it reminded me of someone turning off a flashlight. \r\n\r\nthe top and bottom left lights remained in position until i reached the intersection of hwy 3 and old mississippi 304/713 when the top light began to slowly pulsate as the first but did not accelerate, instead it appeared to move slowly north or northeast and disappeared as the first did.\r\n\r\nonly the bottom left light remained. it did not move. it remained stationary and pulsated as the other two then slowly dimmed and disappeared. i ended the conversation with my friend, and said i'd be back shortly.\r\n\r\nlast night was perfectly clear and cool, odd for mid-august in mississippi, so the humidity was low as was the haze. it almost felt like fall.\r\n\r\nbefore i returned home i made a loop re-driving my route. at 00:42 i stopped the truck again on counce rd., but this time got out. there were still planes lined up for landing, but realized that where i had seen the lights were well southeast of the airport. they were perfectly framed by a horizon of trees, cropland, and stars above.\r\n\r\n\"i can't f**king believe this!\" was on continuous replay in my head, and apparently vocally as well. as my friend related after i returned home \"you kept repeating their formation, movements, and the pulsating white, blue, and green lights...And 'i can't f**king believe this'.\r\n\r\ni attached two sketches and a photo for what they're worth. clearly, for some reason i omitted the pole in both sketches. \r\n1855 - i did this morning\r\n1856 - was done after i returned home last night.\r\n6884 - pic i took this afternoon of location. cell phone tower is in middle\r\n       right above trees.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

10p.M.Ish. i noticed a beam of light coming from behind the house up in the sky.  it was moving somewhat slowly then was out of sight.  it was a bright white/yellowish light beaming across the sky the it just remained  still in a straight line. didn't move or anything.  i thought it was the strangest thing i had ever seen.  i told my friend on the phone go outside check it out.  so, she did and didn't see it. i said it's directly above my head in a straight line up in the sky.  i kept saying what is that and where is coming from?  she couldn't see it and then she got off the phone with me. i kept staring at the light trying to figure out what it was and where it was coming from.  i thought for a second maybe its a meteror shower still but then again they said it was on the 12th and 13th. i tried to take a picture from my cell phone and it was just blurred light. so, i deleted it and tried take it again.  still wouldn't turn out.  so, i gave up.  then i went inside when i came back outside about 5mins later it was gone.  like it disappeared.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
