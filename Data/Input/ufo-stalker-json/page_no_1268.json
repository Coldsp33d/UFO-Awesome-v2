30 minutes in the evening almost every night and at about 20 minutes into the walk we saw what we thought was a single airplane that had suddenly appeared at about 30 to 35 degrees above the horizon.  i can only guess that it must be a few miles south west of the luke air force base immediately to our southwest.  i didn't remember seeing it the moment before but we were engaged in conversation.  as i watched it, it appeared to be stationary and a much duller color than the fighter jets that we normally see traversing the skyway. it was silent but it was so far away that didn't bother me as jets at that same distance would have been virtually silent where we were. the fighter jets we normally see had a bright almost car-headlight white light when approaching you.  these orbs (for lack of a better term) were a much dimmer yellow/orange or amber color.  i drew my wife's attention to it and while i was discussing with her what it could be, it appeared to move to the right about 1 time it's own width and behind it was another amber light.  then it appeared that another light moved from directly behind it to the left and revealed itself from behind the second one.  this continued to happen on both sides of the first light/orb until it appears there was a straight line of 8 yellow lights, further convincing me these were not military aircraft.  the whole time the hovered and never rose or decreased in altitude.  they only moved left and right slowly and smoothly.  once they reached the stopping point they appeared to hover like this for several minutes and then slowly faded out like someone had them on a dimmer switch and faded them from full brightness (which was not really bright to begin with) to completely dark within 2.5 seconds in a nice smooth fadeout.  as soon as the outermost one on the right faded completely out, the next 3 to it's left faded out and finally all faded out except for the first orb.  then after 10 seconds or so of it being the final, remaining orb, it too then faded out completely.  then all were gone.  they appeared to be southwest of the air base and i would say they might be over goodyear, az or almost to the estrella mountain range.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path then

over the metro denver area. at roughly 4:15am on 8/14/13 i was driving westbound on 6th ave. 1/2 a mile away from the exit at wadsworth (south bound exit). i spotted an aircraft(?) above the walmart near 1st and wadsworth- roughly... just guessing, helicopter flight elevation, slow moving west to east. what struck me was how this craft resembled the previous two sightings i witnessed this year. the aircraft seems to be larger than a commercial airliner, with three bright white 'led' lights on the front forward facing underside and a smaller flashing white 'led' on the wingtip. the speed it was traveling was slow, possibly 90mph. as i drove off 6th ave. onto southbound wadsworth i could see the back underside of the aircraft. like my two previous sightings the underside 'flat pattern' of the yellowish lower lights is honeycombed patterned, triangle shaped layout i guess; non flashing. from this angle, looking directly at the back of the aircraft i could now see two flashing 'led' lights on the wingtips. and again, with my window rolled down, no sound from the craft could be heard. my feelings after each time i saw this object was that of awe: this thing is awesome! i would guess that it's a new type of military aircraft, if it is, this is some insane new technology that is far more advanced than the sr-71, stealth fighters and bombers we are used to seeing. please, if anybody is awake around 3am-4:30am and you live in the jefferson county area in denver- please keep an eye on the night skies and hopefully you'll see this 'thing' too! each time i saw this craft it was flying (roughly) from the south west (morrison) foothills area towards fitzsimmons/cu medical university area (east). if mufon is interested, i am a freelance illustrator and i can do a detailed sketch of what i witnessed.

watching shooting stars when i noticed a shadow on the pine tree reflected from my streetlamp that would last for a second i was thinking it was just a bug or a bird so i wasnt concerned. but a bug or a bird make noises, flutter and wont leave you alone and you definitely dont ... have a weird different feeling afterwards. this thing did not make a single noise, was to me then gone in a few seconds like a hawk swooping in at 1000 km per hour and i know exactly how fast that is because i see jets all the time because i live near an air force base and i was seriously freaked out.But even though it was swooping, there was no noise in fact it was like there was a controlled absence of noise if that makes any sense. so i started paying more attention and noticed how the stars would get blocked out as a moving circular shape moved towards me then leaving like a boomerang.Then i noticed this because i was hyperventilating but thinking \"oh maybe youre seeing things, so i kept my eyes wide open it kept on coming and each time i would see a bit more. after the 5th in around two hours (thats what it felt like) time i was so bloody freaked out.I never kept track of the time even though after a while i thought i should because in the beginning i thought \"oh youre just tired and getting a bit crazy\" and at the end i didnt keep track of the time because i was so freaked out and just wanted to leave. it felt like ten minute intervals (i was so sure it was nothing but at the end i wanted to get the hell outa there but this was some freaky s**t. i nearly fell as i tried to get off my roof because i was shaking so bad and it was around 8 minutes since i saw the last one so i thought its coming so  i went down the stair railing grabbed the door knob jumped inside my heart racing and i though oh f**k its gonna come inside for me so i went downstairs to where my grandma was sleeping because she snores and thought maybe just maybe that would mask my heavy scared breathing and curled up in a little ball tried not to move a muscle for an hour and even tried not to think about it because  thought maybe they could pick up on that on their radar or tracking technology(since i was so so so scared i didnt want to take any chances or risks couldnt sleep all night was so scared i didnt want to wake anyone up in case they started yelling and that might grab their attention and more people would be affected. i told my brother as soon as i thought it was possible and safe and what really freaked me out is he believed me because he saw a ufo (different one though)exact same area around the same time of night just a few days ago all i can say is that im not going to be able to sleep for a couple of nights unless i take a heavy sleep drug or something and i dont think i want to in case i have nightmares and im never going up on my roof or anywhere in the night time alone again. im just so happy im alive and have all my body parts and my mind works properly however maybe just maybe if i got that hypnosis thing like in the movie 4th kind maybe just maybe after my mind was probed something nasty would show up. sorry for all the rambling i am freakedout of my mind.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

bigger) falling from the sky. it looked like a green fireball with a long tail of green fire as well. right before it got to the tree line it seemed to slow down almost like it had released a parachute. it then either went out or disappeared behind trees but right before we lost sight of it it turned white and then red. it was extremely bright especially compared to anything else in the sky. we see planes all the time and it was much, much bigger and much brighter. the whole thing lasted around 3 or 4 seconds and then was gone. we were amazed and extremely confused because we had never seen anything like it in the sky.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:04","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

towards the south-south east sky when i noticed two lights, about the size of a star, moving in a straight line towards the north east, one following the other, with the trailing light seeming to be \"towed\". i thought my eyes were playing tricks on me but my wife noticed them about the same time i did. they did not appear to be any plane or satellite that i have ever observed. as i said before, the trailing light seemed like it was being towed by the leading light. they did not change direction and kept a constant speed and distance between them. the \"towed\" object looked like a car being towed by another car with a rope...It looked like the \"rope\" was slacking and then the leading light would pull it tight causing the towed object to jerk or wobble. as the lights got dimmer as they traveled,  starting at about the brightness of a medium brightness star to almost no light. the entire sighting lasted about 1-2 minutes. please contact me if more info will help. thankw for doing

the eastside of ann arbor, mi when this incident occurred just after midnight. \r\n\r\nweather conditions were at the time (i checked as soon as this event was over with weather.Gov for ann arbor municipal airport) - 56', clear skies, n wind 7mph, visability 10miles.  skies were dark with minimal surface lights at the location i was sitting.  i could see planes and stars in the distance from my location.  detroit metro aiport is about 25 miles east of this location\r\n\r\ni noticed a reddish glowing object (with a bright white center) approaching from the north relatively low in the horizon sky.  the object was extremely bright and emitted a constant glow which stood out against the black clearness behind it.  there were no blinking/flashing lights associated with the object that a plane or helicopter would have so i was not sure what it was.  it was moving at what appeared to be a relatively quick,constant pace.\r\n\r\nas it got closer, i could tell it was high off the ground (but nowhere near as high as planes in the background).  i could not make out the actual size as there was nothing behind it to visually compare with and the glow masked or covered any actual shape. \r\n\r\nit passed in front of my patrol car at about 75 degrees off the horizon as i had to tilt my head up and lean forward towards the windshield when it passed overhead in front of my location.  the object made no noise whatsoever.  there was no vehicular traffic or other background noise occuring at the time... there was no police chatter on my radio.  it was complete silence when it passed over my location.  i tried to light the object up with my spotlight but it did not reflect any light.  the glow was much brighter than my spotlight beam. \r\n\r\nas it started to get overhead, i began to film it with my in-car video system (moving the mounted camera with my hand).  i followed the object with my video and was able to zoom in on it before it had gotten too far south (out of camera view). the object was recorded on my video from 00:06:27hrs to 00:07:07hrs (40 seconds)\r\n\r\nonce it was past my video viewing range, i stepped out of my patrol car and tried to spotlight it again but it was out of the spotlight's range.  i continued to watch the light as it continued south and eventually it was out of sight. as it moved away, the glow remained constant but the size of the object got much smaller until it disappeared.  the speed of the object appeared to remain constant as did the path.\r\n\r\nmoments after losing sight of the object (which was well above any trees or structures), i observed a split-second flash/streak of light at a 45 degree angle left towards the east (between the distant horizon and sky/space).\r\n\r\nthe whole sighting event (from first observation north to when i lost sight of the object south) was about 2 min 30 sec.  the distance the object covered (moving north to south) from when i first noticed it i would estimate to be about 15-20 miles.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
