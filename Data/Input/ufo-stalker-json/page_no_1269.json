second identical craft on the same normal straight path but right to left as to head exactly towards the 1st craft. at this point we focused on the 2 as they were about the same size and same altitude as to be on a head on collision but moving casually as high up passenger jets apear to be moving from a ground perspective. then that's when it got weird. a 3rd craft appeared from the left and a 4th from the right and 5th from the left and so on until there was about 4 on each side heading in a head on collision path but moving very casual. for example extend both of your arms straight up above you as to give a double high5 to the sky not like diving in a pool but more like a hand stand now focus on your finger tips and slowly bring your hands together as to touch finger tips to finger tips, and stop, leaving about 1 inch of space so your hands don't touch. that's exactly what the objects did. once they met in the sky, both groups stopped at the same exact time not in any organized fashion just 4 on the left and 4 on the right all 4 next to each other on the left all 4 next to each other on the right and a gap between both groups. they did not move for what seemed to be minutes but was most likely 30-45 seconds. then they did a \"jump\". meaning we could see the quick movements of their path but more like a flash as if to continue their path in either direction but vanishing. we saw them all \"jump\" at the same time. they disappeared no smoke no noise no flash no lights. nothing just gone. 1. friends front yard looking skyward. 2 saw a second object.                    3 airplane.\r\n5: confused scared and afraid. i was 10 at the time and never had an interest in ufo's. i was so scared that i had my friends dad walk me home during they day not night time but broad day light, about 5 houses down from where we were, my friend ran inside his house and we didn't go outside all day after that..I remember telling my parents but as usual who believes anything a 10 year old has to say? \r\n6. they were facing each other and they did a \"jump\" very fast movements and vanished, turned invisible, teleported who knows? kinda like watching ants on the ground but

River","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was in canada for a week living in a fishing cabin.  it was 10 miles from the nearest road and the only access was by boat.  it was about 40 miles north of international falls.  \r\n\r\nin the early morning of thursday, 8/8 (~2:15am) i was awakened with the strong desire to go outside and see the stars.  not having done that while on that vacation i slowly pulled myself out of my warm bed (no heat in cabin), dressed and went outside to view the sky.\r\n\r\ni went down to the dock which had the best view and stood observing the incredible cloudless night sky.  i could see everything from the northwest all the way to the southwest.  due west was in the trees.  i watched a number of polar orbit satellites as they traversed the sky.  the milky way was incredibly vivid!  i also saw a half dozen meteors (easily detectible since they would quickly flare out, take a somewhat ballistic trajectory, and they were very fast).\r\n\r\nafter about 10 minutes i saw a particularly bright satellite (as bright as the brightest planet) appear just to the left of polaris (pretty close to yildun, the 2nd star of the little dipper handle).  again, this was a very bright object.\r\n\r\nthis object started a slow trajectory (very slow even compared with polar satellites) directly towards the point on the big dipper where the handle meets the pan.  it took ~30-40 seconds to make this transition across the sky and the trajectory was a very straight line!  but this wasn't all!\r\n\r\nafter ~5 seconds from first observation the large bright object started to spawn smaller objects moving away from the larger object in straight lines!!  these were much dimmer than the parent.  an example is that one left and moved down at an approximate 45 degree trajectory from the parent.  some of the ~20 objects in total continued on straight lines to the horizon, others (~30%) after getting a little distance from the parent took very sharp ~22.5 degree turns to come on the same trajectory as the parent.    some of the smaller objects made multiple 'angular' turns in different directions (~5 did this).  most of the objects maintained the same speed of the ���parent��� but ~7 of them sped off to the horizon at a much faster speed.\r\n\r\nall of the smaller objects \r\n\r\n1) left the parent in straight lines (~45% from parent trajectory), \r\n2) did not burn up, flare, or otherwise disintegrate,\r\n3) were observable until they went over the horizon.\r\n4) i didn't observe any blinking lights or other types of navigational lights on any objects.\r\n5) none of the objects ever took a curved trajectory, always straight lines.\r\n6) some of the smaller objects matched the parent in speed and trajectory while others were ~25 - 50% faster and quickly went over the horizon.\r\n7) some of the smaller objects went east, others west.  i didn't notice any

when parent was ~1 big dipper pan depth from handle (don't know how to otherwise describe distance).\r\n\r\nafter the large object reached the handle of the big dipper it quickly dimmed and was not visible. as a note, the big dipper was not too far from the horizon and visibility due to atmospheric thickness became worse the closer to the horizon the object was.\r\n\r\nwhole event lasted ~40

quick, very effective and after 40 seconds all assets were not visible and on their way to ultimate targets.  if only the us military could be this effective.\r\n\r\nwish they could have done a

think, when i feel something watching me from my feet. (i would like to clarify that since childhood paranormal things happen to me, then i could manage quite well the fear) i sat up to see who had this once at my feet, then i see what i never imagined seeing in my home. an alien, one which many describe, gray, approximately five feet, big eyes, long and black.\r\nmy intention was to talk to him, but then he approached me and held my thumb. that made me fall back and faint.\r\ni woke up, i was in a stone building with no glass windows, i went through one of those windows, i was alone, but then, through a window in front of me, a person came with a gun in his hand, shooting, someone else appeared behind me, shooting well, the first person i saw ran away, but one of his bullets went into my stomach, and had blood touched me, i fell back, as he watched the two men leave, shooting. something came behind me, grabbed my shirt and pulled me back. i fainted. when i awoke, i was in a operating room with two people, one to my left i could not see, only hear. and a doctor in front of me.\r\nfull of contempt, threw dust on my gunshot wound, now my wound had tubes coming out of it, the dust also fell on my face, my soul began to leave my body, i thought i would die, i listened to the person who had to my left, the person asking the doctor to save me, suddenly everything changed, i began to remember that people who had been shooting were not human, they were aliens, my soul back to the body, and i saw the doctor that was actually a alien, the other person on my left, still could not see. my attention went to the doctor, he was doing something to my injury, i tried to move, but could not, the doctor looked angry, i was worried it would not make things right, then the injection brought a very large, i do not know how, but i managed to free my right hand and took the doctor's hand, held the large injection and wrestled with the doctor, his skin was cold, dry, bony, but it was stronger than me. i argued with one hand and with the other he injected me. again, my soul began to leave the body, i thought i probably had died. but then, i woke up in my bed, the blankets on the floor, my body took a while to feel fully awake. i looked at my husband slept on my right.\r\ni picked up the blankets and went back to sleep. i thought it was a dream. the next morning i told my husband everything. the day went normal, but the unthinkable happened. the next morning, about 8 am, it was sunday, my husband woke up first, he felt that something was at our feet, then he saw an alien standing, looking at us when my husband reacted, the alien took a step back and disappeared.\r\ni should add:\r\nsince i was twelve, i used to write my dreams every day, if i try to remember this experience, without reading it, i can not remember exactly. but there are images that i do not forget, as the image of the alien doctor.\r\nmy husband is not afraid of the unknown. he was calm when he saw the being.","distance":"20 Feet or

13, 2013: me and my friends decided to have a normal grill party at a house in the outskits of a bigger city. once it got dark we were amazed by the stars and one of us came up with an idea to get some chairs and organize a so to say mini \"comethunt\". by this time it was around midnight and 7-8 of us were gazing directly up at the sky. i have a personal addiction to watch the stars almost every night, an because of this i'm quite confidant to say that i can distinguish stars from satellites and other commercial airplanes that usually cross our part of the sky. after sharing some of my knowledge with the others on what to look for, and what they can actually see, a good hour or so has gone by and we've seen about a dozen of comets (i apologise if i'm using the wrong term). one of us made a comment on how breath-taking the view is, and i responded by saying: \" yea, times like these that keep me believing that we are not alone out there. \" i have to admit that the mere idea of life existing anywhere else has always kept me secretly wanting to find out the \"truth\", i did my own researches based upon collecting every possible bit of data on topics concerning all the branches that lead out of the main idea of et life. my goal is to know about everything, even if its a lie, hoax, fake or maybe real, i wanna have my own personal database and by time trim of the unnecessary parts, and say \" yea guys, i knew this way back.\" nevermind i just think this information was needed to properly make a judgement. 1-2 minutes later it suddenly happened, on a clear part of the sky, this huge black object appeared, everybody yelled suddenly to score a new comet for themselves, but then we realised that its something different, it was definitely cigar shaped and quite large. had two lights , one on the very front and one on the back, they were red and quite bright. without any sound it made its way from w to e and while we were looking at it, it made a what happened to be like a small correction to its flightpath. this was the point when everybody was really excited, some of us were asking, what is that thing?, others were trying to help the rest spot it. in a short time period it started to speed up a little and fade out, this is the closest i can describe it, the interesting thing was that the lights came closer to each other, and at that moment i questioned myself, is that really one object ( maybe it was two separate just had an optical illusion of seeing it as one , or vice versa) . after fading, my first reaction and thought was simply : \" reptilians\" . i don't know why this came to my head, but it just simply did, after the sighting we summarized with the others what it might have been, and checked if any of us had missing time.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

was looking out of the south-west facing window of our apartment (near chauderon, lausanne) for meteorites (the peak of the perseid shower was last night). i had been leaning out of the darkened apartment for at least 15 minutes, which overlooks a darkened courtyard, so my eyes had become accustomed to the darkness.\r\n\r\nat roughly 1:45am, i saw an object moving rapidly on the left side of my field of view, roughly in a southern direction. i thought initially it must be a meteorite which i'd been spotting at the corner of my field of view for the last couple of nights, so turned to focus at it. i was surprised when it didn't disappear before i could focus on it and secondly thought it must be a  low flying plane. when focused on it i then noticed it was 3 lights/orbs in a perfect triangle formation, coming to an extended point at the front of the 3 and moving across the sky in a straight line to the west/north west. they were larger than any of the stars in the sky, or meteorites i'd seen, but much duller, almost blurry and of a yellowy-orangey tinge. the lights were constant in their brightness for the entire time and were only just bright enough to see. i watched it go across almost the entirety of the sky visible from my apartment window before it disappeared into cloud above to my right. this took somewhere around 7-8 seconds.\r\n\r\nit looked as though there was what i can only describe as heat haze around the lights and in between them all. i could not see a distinct outline of an object, but i had the impression it was a triangular black object with the lights being underneath it, rather than right on the extremities of the wings and nose as you would see on an aeroplane. there was a distinct lack of sound as it flew over (i don't really get any city noise at that time where i am), although i could swear i heard a quiet low humming noise, which seemed to linger for a few seconds after it had passed. \r\n\r\ni couldn't quite work out the perspective as i viewed it and it seemed either very large or very low (or perhaps both). i'd say it looked slightly larger than a passenger jet and like it was flying only a few hundred feet up. my initial thought was that it was following the north edge of lake geneva (it would have been over either that or the south side of town), but looking at a map it must have been heading in a north westerly direction the entire time i was viewing it and the lake takes a south-westerly turn on the west side of lausanne.\r\n\r\nmy reaction from about halfway through the sighting was for every hair on my body to stand on end. i felt shocked and after losing sight of it woke my fiance up to tell her, but she hugged me while half asleep and fell asleep again. that made me calm down a bit, but i then wrote my account down and told a friend on the internet. at about 2:15pm i went back to the window to watch out for lights rather than the meteorites which i'd now lost interest in and downloaded an app to enhance nighttime filming on my phone. i stood with my camera ready for the next 45 minutes or so taking some practice videos, but saw nothing more than a few more meteorites. the cloud cover had increased greatly by this point too, as only about 25% of the sky was visible, whereas it was more like 80-90% when i saw the lights.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
