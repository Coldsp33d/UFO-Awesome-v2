at the time and finishing up the end of my shift at nearly 1:15 am in the morning in a town called shawnee which is 5 miles north of tecumseh. i began driving down gordon cooper drive which leads directly into tecumseh when i noticed a large source of light coming from town, which i assumed were the baseball field lights left on presumably from a game that evening. i didn't think much about it and continued my drive home. \r\n\r\nafter exiting gordon cooper drive onto rangeline dr, which is where the baseball field is located, i noticed the lights were gone and i figured that someone had finally stopped by to turn them. i travelled onwards to the intersection of walnut and rangeline when i suddenly noticed an object hovering directly over. i immediately stopped my vehicle and got out to observe. \r\n\r\nthe object seemed to be hovering at no taller than 30 ft above the ground and i was able to gauge this measurement by the telephone pole that stood right by the intersection. there were no streetlights around, the only source of light available came from a closed gas station that sat on the corner. the object itself was no larger than the size of a lincoln continental in length and possibly 6' in height. it had two bulbous attachments underneath it's carriage, the sides of the object seemed to protrude outwards. it was metallic in color and even seemed to illuminate but not brightly. it made absolutely no noise. \r\n\r\ni walked into the middle of the intersection and could not take my eyes off of it. i began to look around me, looking for anyone else or even an oncoming vehicle that would at least assist me into not seeing this thing alone, but there was no one out. tecumseh is a very small town so it's no surprise that everyone was probably still asleep. i witnessed this object for at least 3 full minutes until it began to turn slightly nw and started to move away. again, it made no noise as it began to move away. i watched the object \"fly\" ne until it was out of sight. knowing the direction it was going (which would have been towards highway 177), i ran back to my car and started it up performing a u-turn directly in the intersection and headed north on rangeline to the 177 exit. \r\n\r\ni sped down rangeline to the 177 exit which was maybe just 8 blocks away. by the time i reached the exit i could see the object, now maybe slightly higher in elevation, and i could tell it was picking up speed. but as i reached the exit the object was now gone, having sped off at an alarming rate. \r\n\r\ni had only told a select few of my experience and even called in to art bell's coast to coast am to tell my story. sadly, he had to go to commercial as i started to tell my story. then i finally reported it to mufon sometime in 2005, but nothing ever came to light. to this day i have never read another ufo experience which described the object as i had seen it. \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100

some constellations and thinking i might see a meteor or two. i had been looking up for several minutes on and off, giving my neck a rest, when i saw a group of 3 lights coming from the west. at first i thought they might be forming a triangle but i noticed each one was changing position slightly as they moved across the sky (passing directly overhead) in approx 3-4 seconds. i want to say that they were cross shaped and flickering slightly, the best i can describe. if they made any sound i did not hear any. i thought to myself, 'did i just see that?, wow, what was that?' then i started to think of possible explanations. definitely not chinese lanterns. possibly some type of projected images/lights? didn't seem like it, don't know. also there is an air national guard base very close by. maybe some other intelligence? i then wondered if there might be more and i thought about my phone's camera and about a minute later i saw another group coming from , the best i can recall, roughly the same direction so i a bit nervously fumbled with my phone and couldn't open the camera fast enuf and just watched as they moved across the sky. they were the same kind of lights and there were about 5 of them this time. i felt a bit nervous and kind of excited at what i was seeing. i realized that the camera on my phone would likely not have picked any good images or video anyway. then a minute or so later i saw another group of the same lights , about 5-6 this time moving from the south over the lake to north across the sky in approx 3-4 seconds. they seemed to \"disappear\" or fade from sight when they were almost all the way across the sky to the north. in all 3 sightings the lights seemed be moving as a group and moving slightly within the group. best i can remember, one of the groups might have changed direction, but only slightly.\r\nthis was a first ever experience like this for me. would really love to know what these were.

com ovni e extraterrestes. posso afirmar que desde os meus 7 anos de idade venho tenho contato com diversos tipos de seres diferentes de nós.\r\nquando tinha 7 anos de idade eu havia ganho um tcr de meu pai, e naquele dia eu, ele e meu tio brincamos muito com o tcr. cegada em uma hora em que eles não quiseram brincar mais então fiquei sozinho com o tcr em um quarto onde ficava todos os meus brinquedos. em um certo momento o tcr parou de funcionar, e eu senti como se o quarto estivesse magnetizado, sabe uma sensação estranha. escutei logo em seguida umas pequenas batidas em minha janela e lá estava um ser estranho, parecia um louva-deus, com uns 2 metros de altura. eu fiquei estático e sem saber o que fazer. mais de repente ele tentou forçar a janela, e eu comecei a chorar e gritar, fazendo com meu pai e meu tio aparecessem.  fazendo o ser fugir. mais mesmo assim meu pai e meu tio circularam a casa para ver se encontravam a criatura.\r\nem outro momento foi na casa de minha avó eu deviria ter uns 10 anos de idade, estava dormindo em um quarto junto com um primo meu, quando eu vi alguma coisa passar por entre as camas e sair para o corredor, esse já parecia menor 1m60c para menos. sei que no dia seguinte minha tia mais nova estava com o cabelo cortado, e o quarto dele estava cheio de cabelo. minha avó até acusou meu primo, mais eu sabia que não tinha sido ele.\r\na outra vez eu estava indo com alguns amigos para o bali hai, uma balada que tem na cidade de balneário piçarras, quando vi no céu uma luz forte. mais de repente a luz ficou mais e se direcionou para o cão. bem em cima de onde nós estávamos. eu sei que neste dia eu acordei já estava em casa, e eu era o único que se lembrava do que havia acontecido.\r\nnuma outra vez eu estava dormindo em uma lanchonete para cuidar dela, e essa lanchonete e era à beira mar.  quando na madrugada eu vi uma luz forte atravessar a porta de madeira e vir para cima de mim. notei que era um ser feito de luz. ele me transmitia muita paz. diferente dos outros dois seres eu havia visto anteriormente. me lembro dele pairando sobre mim, e eu nem ele falava mais nós entendíamos. senti muitas coisas que para descrever aqui creio que não consiga, mais estou a disposição em esclarecer. \r\no outra vez eu estava voltando d casa de um amigo e quando eu ia subir para entrar na minha rua eu vi 5 luzes vindo em minha direção. de repente eu olhei para e havia um ser iluminado também, mais esse dava para ver que por baixo da luz tinha um ser muito parecido com o ser humano mais tinha aquela luz forte, sei que ele chegou perto de mim eu cai de joelhos. acabei acordando embaixo de uma figueira muito longe dali, cheguei em casa de manhã.\r\ncreio que tenho muito a ser dito, pois escuto eles, e não estou usando isso para me aparecer, mais sim por ver a necessidade de repassar o que tenho vivido.\r\n","distance":"N/A","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":87196,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":null,"location":null,"logNumber":"BR-10072017-0021","longitude":null,"occurred":474060000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":null,"reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1507418995000,"summary":"Flutuava

andromeda galaxy on google sky.. i have found some anomalies that ive been trying to get some professional opinions on, however its been a few months now and i have not heard back from anyone. \r\n\r\ni noticed that there are clusters of stars in the andromeda galaxy ( these anomalies are actually all over google sky but the screen shots i have are just of andromeda) these clusters... are repeated in the imaging. as if they took the images of certain stars and copy pasted them next together to make a bigger star cluster.\r\n\r\nso because i do not know how long it takes for us to get a small portion of andromeda photographed i am not sure if i am just seeing the same stars moving.. so the same stars are in the frame next to it... \r\n\r\n2nd theory\"  they are not stars at all...  (i do not really know how that would work because again this anomaly is all over.. so maybe its a super highway for alien traffic everywhere up there) \r\n\r\n3rd theory: they are covering stuff up that is actually out there so they are stitching the same photos together to make it look like there are just stars.\r\n im really looking for some insight on this guys thank you so much for your time. maybe im looking at this in a completely wrong way. but honestly you guys should check it out for yourselves its all over up there. there is so much dishonesty in the world but i would love to know if i have found something good here. i have researched online about this but i cannot find anything from anyone who has seen this. \r\n_ ms.

the door, originating in the hall beyond. the door opened and in walked several (i am not sure of the exact number) squat figures. they were silhouetted by a bright light in the hall. they were dark blue/grey with large, blocky heads and virtually no neck. their faces were heavily furrowed. they stood 3 to 4 feet tall, and wore something that looked like monk robes that were very dark grey. when they entered the room, i became paralyzed. they stood around the bed, even on the other side where my wife was asleep. i tried to call out to her but i couldn't make a sound due to the paralysis. i sleep with a cpap machine (mask and air hose) for sleep apnea. one of the figures removed the mask from my face. another pulled the covers back off of me. they raised their arms and i floated up out of the bed, lying flat now. i floated above their heads toward the door. as i began to float out the doorway, i lost consciousness.\r\n\r\nthe next thing i remember is floating above their heads back into the room toward the bed. i was angry, very angry, and with great effort i began to thrash about a little. for some reason they had difficulty controlling me through my anger. one of the figures on the far side of the bed next to my wife knocked something over on the dresser, but immediately righted it and put it back where it belonged. they regained control of me. they successfully floated me back into bed and pulled the covers back over me. they then retreated from the room. after they closed the door, the light went out and all was quiet.\r\n\r\ni regained my senses and found myself lying in bed without my cpap mask on. i looked at the clock and it was 5:53 am. i got up out of bed, feeling both frightened and angry at the same time. i got up out of bed and started my day. in the morning my wife said that she had been up 3 times to go to the bathroom during the night which is unusual for her. she usually only gets up once, and rarely remembers much about it.\r\n\r\ni searched the internet and was not able to find any pictures or drawings that resembled the figures. then i bought a reference book and found a drawing that is almost identical. i have attached that image to this

on sept 30 2017. as an open minded skeptic i assumed it was a weather balloon based on my unassisted view; it might have been. i grabbed my land telescope and was able to see it better. it looked like a glass jellyfish with an obvious coil (kind of like a fuse in a light bulb) running from what would be the bottom starboard side of the object, running up along the front to the top of the port side. the coil was obviously inside of the object. it was higher than a plane would cruise moving slow and towards the east; wind direction was south and light. i did observe a passenger liner fly under the object moving from the south to the north-west which provided me with some reference. the liner appeared to be lower than the object. the object's size was about a quarter the size of the passenger liner (i'm guessing a 737), yet it was noticeably a lot higher in altitude. what was odd is that every time i got my telescope to focus on the object, the object would go out of focus within a second (not operator error). i also viewed the object through  a set of bushnell binoculars (12x25)with the same results. the object disappeared behind a small, lone cloud cloud after about 15 minutes of observation.

that we had i had downloaded a solar eclipse app so that i could see it on my phone well i took five pictures and noticed something strange in the picture i disregarded it. i thought that it was a glitch from the app so i shrugged it off and disregarded it. well two days later i was looking through the photos in my phone with a friend of mine and i noticed the same object in another picture that i took on may 4th of 2017 well it gave me the chills made me cry and emotional for the next couple days. i was literally stunned by what i came across. i didn't feel right. i was in shock. in the first photo i took on may 4th i noticed that there was a small dot in the far background on the very first photo on the second photo it was closer well let me rewind for a second because i'm using text to speak on may 4th i was in yelm washington working for a real estate sign company and i'm driving and i seen the clouds how amazing they looked. it was obviously storm clouds but living in the city like i do i don't get to see the clouds like that and the way they go for miles so i thought i'd stop and pull over and take a couple pictures from my memories. so i pulled over and i wanted to take a few pictures of the clouds i took 5 pictures and one video and at the time i did not notice the object i could not even see it with my naked eye. what i captured in my pictures the object was far away just a small dot. i zoomed in and you could see a shape to it well on the second picture it was up closer and it was the same image, shape whatever it was as what i captured during the solar eclipse. in the 3rd photo i took that day it was far away again if i zoom in i could see shape to it still. so that told me right there that it was something in the sky. what my phone captured was far away at first, then it came close in photo 2 and it was far away again on my 3rd photo. it was gone in the 4th and 5th photo. it was gone in the video short video i took before i had to hop back in the truck and get back to work. but the thing is that i was using a different phone with no special apps just the regular camera so i have images of an object in the sky that was on two different days with completely different weather and there was actually something there, i couldnt see it with my eyes but my phone picked it up. actually no one could see it. it must have had a cloaking device or something.  also during the solar eclipse when i took my first photo it was the same shape of the image that i caught on may 4th the second photo i took of the solar eclipse it was actually like a triangle shape up to the top left corner of my picture the third photo it was back to the original shape of the sideways diamond or whatever it is and then on the 4th photo it was a triangle again up in the left corner so it's moving and i don't know if it's changing shape but it was pixley you could see hard edges to it and i just really want to get a professional opinion i've been wondering where to look and where to go and finally i found you guys so can you please let me know something. i know that we're not alone i've always been in tune with knowing that we're not the only thing in this universe but when i capture these images it really made me feel different i know i'm not alone and i showed the photos to other people and their bewildered. so yeah please help me... also since i've came across these images i have been taking quite a few pictures of the sky hoping to catch it again and i haven't had any luck but i'm not giving up i'm still searching and if i come up with anything else i'll be sure to get back onto the site and download my photos to you guys just please get back to me and let me know what you guys see. and also since there is only five slots to download my photos i sent two photos from the solar eclipse and i sent 3 photos from may

on the sides but as i drove down the street i could see in-between them and was never able to see the objects again on either side.  i have never seen a recreational drone move at speeds like that and i estimate whatever it was was 2000-5000 feet up in the air but i really don't know for sure.  this area has bob hope airport near by and i see planes fly by all the time.  i have never seen anything

shared it with my wife, father-in-law, and children. it has been on my mind daily since it happened, and kept me wondering for the last 25-ish years. \r\ni awoke on a clear, cold night at 3:33am (remember it on my 1980's style digital alarm clock). i had a loft bed, and when i opened my eyes, i was watching a clear brilliant bulb floating in the field next to our property. i climbed down from my loft bed, and it was now in the back of my parents back yard (8 acres). i could not tell if if landed or floated (didn't matter). at the time we owned horse's and i remember them running into our barn area (iluminated), with their ears pinned back. i thought i was dreaming until i watched my horses see the same thing i was seeing. thoughout the entire time there was a buzzing in my head, i still till this day am not sure if it was in my ears or head. the object was almost clear like the old 1970's style christmas tree ornaments. it was almost glistening like a wet jelly fish, and aluminating from within. i got the sense that it was pulsating to get my attention, my horses just watched side by side with their ears pinned back. once i got to my window, words started being placed in my head (this is the part that makes me think about what happened every day since), it was almost like someone/something was searching my head like someone would search a hard drive for the correct word to say! the words; \"this is good\" \"this is safe\" \"this is good\",\"this is happy\", \"this is love\", and as silly as it sounds, i think i remember, \"this is \"christmas\". the entire time this was happening, a buzzing was either in my head, or in my ears,,,i do not know the words to describe what i felt:(, but i am 100% possitive that whatever hovered in my back yard, wanted me to not feel threatened. it is still to this day so hard to explain how i was made to feel, i'm guessing that whatever it was that was in my back yard was at a loss at how to communicate, and simply searched my brain for words that would make me feel safe, and actually good about what i watched. i say good because my chest seemed to feel good with whatever the buzzing was. i still am not sure if the buzzing was in my head or ears.I wish i was more articulate to explain this story. there are some significant details that i have left out because i simply feel so foolish and i think people would not believe me. there is part of this story that i can't even share with my wife because i do not want her to look at me like i am crazy:( it's just too much for me to ask her to believe. i contacted your site because i can not stop thinking about why this happened. \r\nthanks\r\n\r\nscott","distance":"21-100

plane. i pointed the object out to another person on the porch, who quickly turned to see it move a distance of 2 blocks in blink of an eye. we watched as large orb grew bigger on approach from w toward our home, then it turned sw and flew over our neighbor and our homes. \r\nit was bright, consisting of yellow/orange/red colors that rolled inside the orb as it moved silently across the sky and was big enough to illuminate rooftops slightly. \r\nstrangely there was not a sound to be heard in our busy neighborhood, dogs stopped making noises, everything stopped as the orb flew over at a high rate of speed. it was eerily quiet, couldn't even hear the traffic driving by on us 40 a few blocks away!\r\nwe ran off the porch to keep it in sight, and held our thumbs up to reference size of the object. it was that big in the sky above our home. i'm not good judging heights, but it seemed to be a couple hundred feet above tree tops. it did not leave a trail in the sky while it grew smaller and ascended to the sw.\r\nwe ran down sidewalk to keep eye on it as it flew away, and lost it in the night sky within moments. tried to catch it on cell phone video camera, but it was too fast. we were both scared at first, then in a weird way excited by the incident. as we talked about what happened, my family member became worried about driving home that night. that person was fearful as they left, and i felt it too. i closed the curtains in my second story bedroom because i didn't want to see the night sky, which stayed close for a few weeks afterward.\r\nwe both still have some uncertain feelings regarding the incident.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface, Other","flightPath":"Path
