of the ordinary at the time, there was no sound, only the sounds of many people at the beach. \r\nonly when i got home, and later on uploaded the photo's to my laptop, did i notice the \"blob\", and zoomed in to see it closer, thinking it was a bird or something. it looks like an orb with a solid shape, and does have that 'saturn like' shape that's mentioned here in the questions, but it's hard to tell as it's so far away and zooming in doesn't help. it appears to be tilted?\r\nit appears to have a slight glow or \"halo\" effect, and possibly a little reflected light on one side from the sun's light? (this seen when zoomed in.)\r\ni couldn't tell you if it was moving erratically or whatever as i didn't notice it at the time, i was focused on the sunset and getting a clear shot.\r\ndoesn't appear to me to be a helicopter, or bird, as you can see it's far away and if it's a bird it'd be a big one! don't think it's a bug either, as it'd be closer than this appears���.But i'll let you be the judge!\r\none other thing to mention was i put the photo temporarily into \"neon\" in picasa, and it shows the object as a white solid looking blob, with a black pinpoint center! i tried different effects to see if it showed the \"blob\" in a way that i hoped would make it easier to identify. other than the interesting neon effect, it didn't really help.\r\ni'm enclosing the photo and a zoomed in cropped version so you may see it better, it's the blob to the right of the small cloud above and to the right of the sun.\r\n\r\ni am interested to know if anyone else saw it, videotaped it or can

from object to get binos-appx 8 sec. still in same position. turned off porch light. very little background light. no clouds. very few cars. not a reflection off something.  engaged binos.  object had outline cross between rectangular/oval. not distinct. color was bright orange-not orange-juice color,  but shiny orange like coals in a hot fire. it seemed to shimmer,  like heat from a jet engine. at arms length object was size of fingernail.  nothing to reference size/distance. while watching through bino, object \"disappeared\". no orange object in bino field where i was looking. engaged eyes to look at the area. object \"reapppeared\"(possibly turned on axis?) moving southwest at a steady rate. no green/red lights as on an airplane. no white landing lights. firmly believe not plane or

has ever had a similar experience.  i read a lot on-line... i listen to coast to coast... i have never heard anyone at anytime describe what my girlfriend and i saw/witnessed.  i would really appreciate an answer.  thank you.\r\n\r\nmy girlfriend/future wife/now ex and i were sitting on a patch of grass outside her place of employment one night while she was taking a break... it was an office complex on cole road in boise, idaho (nearest major intersection was cole and franklin).  it was, to the best of my recollection mid to late march, it may have been early april.  we were smoking cigarettes and sitting side by side.  we were facing east which in boise means we were looking toward the ridge of mountains that run roughly north and south along the east edge of the city.  the top of the ridge is approximately 3,500 feet above the city.  it was a beautiful, clear night, and fairly warm for that time of year.\r\n\r\nas we were sitting there chatting we were both looking east, not facing each other, which means we both had the same field of view.  there was an obvious airliner flying south over (parallel with) the ridge overlooking boise.  i say it was an airliner because that was what it appeared to be... the right altitude, the right speed, it wasn't zigging or zagging, it was flashing an airliners anti-collision lights... etc.  neither of us commented on it because it was just an airliner but we were both watching it because it was the only thing moving in the sky and i suppose that was what drew our attention to it.  \r\n\r\nsuddenly, a flourescent green \"diamond\" shaped opening appeared directly in front of the \"aircraft\" (i would estimate that the distance between the aircraft and the window was about the width of my thumb at arms-length).  the \"plane\" flew into this \"window\" and disappeared.  it did not fly through it... it flew into it and disappeared and as soon as the \"plane\" disappeared the \"window\" did as well.\r\n\r\nmy girlfriend and i looked at each other and at the same time said, \"did you see that!\"  it was the weirdest thing that either of us had ever seen... \r\n\r\nto this day i know what we saw... i just don't have any idea what it was or could have been.  and i would love to know if anyone, anywhere, has ever seen anything like it or reported seeing anything like it. \r\n\r\nnow... having finished my

document describing my very close ufo encounters and abduction experiences, as i firmly believe i was abducted 3 times up until now.  i believe i was abducted the third time just 7 days ago where my mother was involved as an eyewitness.  i already reported this to mufon using the report form.  also, i had a number of alien encounters totaling 14 so far up until now.  every one of my alien encounters were a different type of alien, including different species of grey.  i have no idea why i had so many encounter experiences, as they were all very real where some cannot be explained not being real.\r\n\r\nof all this all i got to show for it as proof is 7 small spots on my arm that form 5 perfect triangles, and my photos and film.  i do not know how i got the spots, as i discovered them one day in 2005 while sitting in my bed.  4 of the spots form a perfect cross.  my doctor said he never saw anything like it.  i would photograph my arm, but i have not had access to a camera over the years.\r\n\r\ni photographed and filmed ufos in my area within a half mile from my home.  i already sent you my \"real ufos\" dvd that is an hour and 3 minutes long.  i filmed mostly from a cul-de-sac that is down my street.  i have not heard from you about it.  i filmed from 2004 to 2006, but not every night.\r\n\r\nyesterday i saw a cable program describing things about space that was not ufo related, but i learned in relating my photos, film and personal experience that quantum mechanics and use of dimensions probably have something to do with ufos and how they travel.  this is probably nothing new to you being i understand that the government has loads of stuff like crashed ufos and bodies.\r\n\r\nmy abduction when i was 26 is unusual in relating it to most other abductions.  i do not know of any purpose for any of my abductions.\r\n\r\ni hope i have been help, and i hope you enjoy reading my document.\r\n\r\nthank you, and i hope to hear from you

11:40 ��� 11:55\r\nlocation of the object: southwest moving northwest moving straight over the city center of frankfurt germany.\r\nlocation of sighting frankfurt germany, in the quarter  nordend.\r\naltitude of the object: about that of an airplane (but i think it came down a little as it came toward us).\r\n\r\nsighting:\r\n\r\ni was in my office, which has a pretty nice view of the skyline (view from the south west) of frankfurt germany when i noticed something i thought was a balloon flying around about 1.5 miles away. it was moving rather strange and seems to reflect the sunlight. i asked a colleague to take a look and we agreed that it was a helium balloon sparkling in the sun and continued to work (it looked like it was rising up into the air and drifting away.\r\n\r\nabout 5 min later, whatever it was had come back down a little and was heading toward us (north east) i took another look at it, since it got a little closer. now i could see a little more detail and was sure that this was no balloon. i told another colleague to come over and take a look and we both stood there looking out the window, at this strange ���ufo���.\r\n\r\nit was moving about the speed an airplane would move when it���s up in the sky. but this object was way lower and came closer and closer. at this point i got out my iphone 5 and did a short recording of the object, but i was a little exited and decided to quit the recording so i can see this thing with my own eyes. now the thing was coming pretty close to our left side. at this point it was about one inch big (for us since it was no way i can tell how big it was). it was approximately the size of a small airplane.  now i had about 10 sec to view this thing as it flew over our left side. now i was sure this was something really strange! this thing was a perfect star shape. metallic (aluminum type) color on the inner side, while there was a white outline on the edges. i got to see this object pass over my right side. that gave me the chance to see that it was not very thick. it was almost like one of those christmas stars you can nail to the wall (almost flat). from my distance i was about 1 ��� inched high and about ��� inch thick. what is even stranger is that this object was flying not like a plane or ordinary flying saucer horizontal. the star was quite flat from the side and was flying vertical!! basically with its flat side first! how is it even possible to even fly? it was moving straight, no wobbles like a balloon, no signs of propulsion (contrail) or smoke coming from the rear like a rocket or a plane.  sadly i had to let it pass over us to our left without running to the other side of the building since i was at work and i was already making quite a fuss. i asked my colleague twice, if what we both saw was a plane or a balloon because it was just so weird and he said it was no balloon or plane, but could be a experimental drone of some sort. i asked what type of star shaped drone could fly with its wide flat side first totally straight and vertical and he replied they are here (meaning the aliens with a funny look and grin).\r\n\r\nother colleagues laughed at me for mentioning it so i kept quiet after telling them once what we have seen. unfortunately the video did not turn out that good since i recorded without zoom. but this object is visible flying in the sky. so at least i have a little proof.\r\n\r\nanyway, the weird part is that i thought i saw a real balloon go up in the area where i had first seen this object (after my lunch break). but i didn���t have time to investigate any further. me my colleague are 100% sure of what we saw. a metallic object defying logic with is way of flying. it was no balloon! it was a solid (metallic craft of some unknown type).\r\ni am not sure what the other objects where because i was still shocked from sighting of craft.\r\n\r\nduring the sighting i was overwhelmed with a feeling of total awe! i remember thinking how is it possible that such a thing can fly? i was so excited after the sighting that i called 2 friends in my lunch break right after the sighting to tell them about it. i was almost shaking.\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

observed was so far away that it may have been a pulsating star, a planet etc. the weird thing is that i again witnessed it last night making me believe it may just be a star. unfortunately i can't see it except on clear nights.  i know it can't be a jet, as in a 747 or larger because it doesn't move in a straight line. i really wish i had a telescope so i could see it better / clearer.  i also assume that if this was something out of the ordinary or strange, i would not have been the only person to see it.  if it was something worth anyone's time i am sure nasa would have had one of its may telescope's pointed at it but you never know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ni am a 43 year old male.  i live in stratford, connecticut at 255 kenyon street. my coordinates are latitude 41.21484535145122 and longitude is -73.15099865198135. on the night of july 22nd i was out in front of my house standing in my driveway having a cigar looking up at the stars.  it was a very clear night.  at some point my eye caught something moving. it definitely had a shape to it which seemed to change as if it was turning or flipping end over end.  i have never witnessed anything like this and it was so far away i thought it was just a star playing tricks with my mind. i watched it for a little while longer then dismissed it and went inside.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nabout 15 days later on aug 6th i went onto my back deck and sat down in a chair and looked up at the sky again. it was another beautiful clear night.  after about 15 - 20 minutes i saw what i thought was probably an airplane.  what made me suspicious was that again, it was so high in the atmosphere that i thought to myself \"this can't be a plane.\" it was a single point of light that slowly moved across the sky. there were no blinking lights, no colored lights.  just one solid pinpoint of light that moved across the sky. i then thought that maybe it was the i.S.S. but i did not do the research to see where the i.S.S. was at that point and time. i dismissed it as a \"shooting star\" or asteroid because it moved so slow and in a perfectly straight line. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ni am not a ufo hunter. its just that these two circumstances happening so close together seemed very \"weird\", especially the first sighting.  there was so much more of a \"form\" to it.  the second sighting was just too far away to make any distinction about it even though it was moving.  i know at night the sky can play tricks with your mind so i didn't want to make a big deal about it.  i was curious to see if anyone else in the tri state area saw anything in the sky on those nights or nights around then.  i could have kicked myself in the butt for not having a telescope those two nights.  it probably could have answered a lot of questions.  i think i am going to invest in a telescope so next time, if there is a next time, i will have a better idea as to what the objects may be.\r\n\r\nthank you,\r\n\r\npaul

decided with permission from our parents to go night fishing at the local fishing pond grey mist.Our parents  agreed as long has my dad was allowed to drive us there and come pick us up the next morning .Grey mist is a huge fishing pond in the middle of a refuge tip with plenty of clear sky unhindered by buildings or housing and on this night the above was virtually cloudless.At around two in the morning my friend noticed lights about a mile ahead or so from where we sat in the night sky getting closer,there seemed like there was actual balls of light falling from nearing crafts or l should say dripping.Different colours,red,yellow blue,purple,white we were perplexed,the colours were dripping like you would see plastic when on fire from the sky.Within seconds the crafts were above the pond and the colours stopped falling out of them,what we saw then horrified us l counted at least 10 objects a few were like planes with windows like a plane running horizontal butvoid of wings,grey triangular crafts and the most abundant were the orbs or disk shape things.The crafts l estimate around a 100 ft in the sky its difficult to say some looked higher the sky than others and scattered at a distance of around a quarter mile.Then one of the orb shaped objects started to move towards us,this did not resemble a craft it was more like a ball of light,at this point we started to panic and ran up the embankment after which the brightest of whites seem to engulf us and all went blank and l awoke sat next to my friend at around 8am .Obviously l had experienced a bad dream.We packed and waited for my dad to pick us up,while we were waiting my friend came out with a dialogue that knocked me to the ground he described absolutely every l had dreamt about virtually every detail.Lt was strange because l could finish what he was about to say before he finished his description and vice versa.How could we have dreamt exactly the same thing to every detail?After this frank my best friend in the world never came near me again he told people l was weird and could read peoples dreams and all that ,it scared him.L have since found that he hung himself at 22.My story is nearly the same since that night l have never been the same my personality changed from a happy go lucky kid to introspective moody loner its difficult to explain since that night ldont feel l belong here any more like my home is elsewhere.The damage was not just psychological but physical as well.That morning when l got home l felt a burning sensation at the back of my right earlobe when felt behind my ear there was  a scab that was not there the day before,after a few days there was a round dint l could and can still can today fit comfortably the end of my pinky finger in right above my upper cheek bone under my earlobe like someone put a cigar out behind there.L am now nearly 50 years old but what happened that night was no dream l can still feel the fear in my bones l felt that night.L have only told my present partner of this until now because of the obvious stigma attached to such subject matter as this.L pray and hope no one else go,s through what i have dealt with ,not being able to say anything or hopefully l can help by telling them there not on there own.","distance":"21-100

first year in the college. i used to live in the college hostel. it was a clear night, at around 10 o'clock me and 3 other friends went to the roof top of our hostel after having dinner. i was talking on the cellphone, suddenly something very bright caught my eye, i thought it might be a shooting star but then i again looked at it and it was still there, at that moment i knew it was not a shooting star because a shooting star would have disappeared in a flash but this object was very bright, you could see its shape, it was pointed as a missile and it had a very bright tail like a rocket and the tail was as long as the object itself. it was traveling at a very high speed and at a very high altitude.\r\n\r\ni am a pilot and i would say it was traveling approximately 20,000-25,000 feet high at around 7-8 mach. it's size was enormous, somewhere around 400-500 feet long (with the tail). it kept traveling towards south without even making any kind of noise. it started from north on the horizon and it was visible till it reached the opposite end on the horizon in the south. there was no other building anywhere near our hostel as it was in the middle of a countryside so on a clear day (or night) you had an infinite visibility. it was possible to see from horizon to horizon from a roof top. the color of the object was bright silver and the flame was the same color as well.\r\n\r\ni asked my friends to look at it and even they didn't knew what that thing was. i was talking on the cellphone when this event started happening, the battery was about to die but as soon as that object reached right on top of us, i noticed that the battery of my cell phone was full. it was really strange for a cell phone to get charged up with in a matter of seconds.\r\n\r\nit was visible for about 5 to 6 minutes and we all had a very good look at it. i can tell you from my experience as a pilot that it was not something from this world. i have a very keen interest in aviation and i keep myself updated with the latest technologies and developments in the field and i could that it was not something i ever heard of. we don't have that kind of technology to develop anything like this which can travel around 7 or 8 mach and not make any sound at all.\r\n\r\nwe were not able to capture any picture or video of that object to prove the story but the events of that night are imprinted in my memory. at that time camera phones were not very popular in india and i just had a basic model (nokia 3300) and none of us was expecting something like this so we didn't had any camera as well. \r\n\r\ni was watching tv the other day and there was a program on discovery science about the ufos, and the story they were running was about the events of january 08, 2008 in stephen ville, texas. and it occurred to me that i should too report what i witnessed in 2004. i wanted to bring this story to the light, so that you could do some research on it and might be able to provide me with some answers about that object.\r\n\r\ni know that i cannot prove the events of that night as i don't have any proof of it, but then again how many people plan on seeing something like this? all i have is the memory of that night and whether anybody believe me or not i know that what i saw that night was something that not a lot of people can witness in their lifetime, so i consider myself very lucky.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

them playing, movement in the sky caught my attention. i looked over the treetops and saw a black object flying n, but occasionally it made a jerky movement.  there was no noise, although in the last hour i'd seen three jets heading n and had clearly heard them, but they were flying at a higher altitude than the black and metallic object.  from the side and bottom the object was black, but when it turned it shone like silver metal.  unfortunately, i spent so much time watching it and trying to decide if it was a plane or not, that i didn't think to take a photo until it turned to head e. it flew for about 10 or 20 more seconds, and i had just about decided it must be a small plane, when it abruptly turned s, accelerated, and shot in a straight line heading s.  as i stood there thinking about it, it reappeared and repeated the same movements, and once again sped off after making several abrupt movements and directional changes.  i didn't see it again after that. the whole episode lasted several minutes. on its second pass, i took two photos of the sky while watching it fly, but there is nothing in the frames.  is this possible?  i know i saw a black object flying irratically.  i don 't know if anyone else noticed it or not. the other parents and kids at the park were involved in a birthday party and were playing in the water park.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

night. we both had blankets and were scanning the sky in hopes of seeing meteors, as tonight was suppose to be the peak of a meteor shower, i believe the persides meteor shower is what my dad called it. we could see a few stars, though it was difficult as we live rather close to the city, and smoke from a distant forest fire was obscuring some of the sky slightly. however, throughout the thirty minutes we were outside we saw three or four meteors. \r\n\r\nabout 10 minutes after we came out, we saw something peculiar and very out of place floating across the sky in a south/south west direction. it appeared to be maybe 6 or 7 lights hovering around each other and moving in a similar pattern to molecules. even so, it's south-ward path was steady and it was silent. i passed it off as a flock of birds, not really concerned about it. the sighting lasted about 6-7 seconds. after that my sister saw a meteor. not a big k e, but a fairly obvious one, to the north-west. \r\n\r\nlater, my step-dad, joined us on the tramp and watched for meteors with us. after a few minutes, i saw a small meteor directly overhead. it was small and not obvious, but i saw it nonetheless. after that, me and my step-dad saw an orange colored meteor to the south east. it appeared for a second, then vanished.\r\n\r\nafter this i looked up, almost toward the south west, an spotted the strange ufo again. i pointed it out to  my step-dad and sister, both spotting it immediately. again, it looked like a set of 6-7 lights bubbling about each other like molecules. they seemed to be either grey, or white with a slight orange hue. the sighting lasted about 8-9 seconds before it disappeared behind our trees.  its path was, again steady, despite the bubbly appearance of its lights, and this time it was headed north east. \r\n\r\nmy sister, step-father, and i, conversed about it a bit before we had to head inside for the night. we all agreed that it was shaped like either a boomerang, or a v. we agreed that it looked like several lights together. \r\n\r\nat this point, my mom came out to tell us to come inside. my dad told her about the ufo which we had just seen, and proceeded to tell us that his friend dan had seen something similar, many years ago about this time of year. when we told my mom, she didnt seem to believe us, she seemed skeptical, despite three confirmations of the sighting.\r\n\r\nafter that, my sister and i stayed outside for ten more minutes, waiting to see more meteors, but we didn't see anything else.\r\n\r\ni am not, by any means, claiming to have seen some \"alien craft\". it was simply, a ufo: an unidentified flying object. both times i saw it, it had the same appearance: several bubbly lights moving about like molecules, the lights were orange-ish or grey, moving in a steady path, and it was silent. the second time seeing it did invoke a bit of fear in me, but i am not too concerned about this sighting.\r\n\r\ni am fairly young, and have a very creative mind. i am also very imaginative. although my step-dad and my sister saw it too, i may have been imagining things. despite my creative attributes, i am a very logic-oriented person. it may have simply been a flock of birds, illuminated slightly by the light pollution from the nearby city, it may have been some kind of craft. i am not

extremely pure white light sitting stationary in the air. i sat at the red light watching to see if there would be any movement, but there was none. the proceeded to turn green and i drove towards the neighborhood. i slowed down after crossing the intersection to observe the object. as i drew closer, i realized that it was two white lights instead of one. the two lights sat fairly close to each other. the lights were attached to one side of a dark colored triangle with rounded corners sitting perfectly still, not even 300 feet above the driving range. there were 3-4 red blinking lights that were closer to the inside of the triangle, rather than on the points as most ufo sightings. i wondered to myself what kind of aircraft would be sitting so close to ground at 9 o'clock at night? it was so close, i could see some texture on the bottom of it (i.E. indentations and protrusions). i had a cd playing, but not loudly, so if it was as loud as an airplane, i would have heard it. i heard nothing. i tried to watch it still as i turned into the neighborhood, only to look away for literally one second to look into my rearview mirror and it was gone. for some reason, i did not think to pull out my phone and record it or take a picture. i would not have anyway because it was frightening seeing something that you do not recognize. i told myself that it was probably just an airplane and i would tell my parents about it when i got back home. i mentioned it to my friend once i reached his house and he jokingly but not jokingly said it was probably a ufo. honestly, while i looked at it, i was more or less in awe, curious and confused. but afterwards, i began to get nervous as i did not want to believe that it was anything besides an airplane as i described it to my family and they decidedly told me that it indeed was not an airplane.
