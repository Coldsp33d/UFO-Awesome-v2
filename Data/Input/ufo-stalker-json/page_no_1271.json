triangle lights and ran to get my camera. i tried to take pictures of it but a street light was in the way. i waited until the lights moved farther way from the glare of the street lights and took 3\r\npictures. unfortunately my camera wasn't set properly but when i downloaded the to the computer i could barely make out the lights. they were very faint. on one of the pictures i made out the 3 lights and there was a grayish round area between the two lights at the back of this shape. when i first saw the object my first thought was ufo get the camera. i saw the  object coming from a northern direction and the it slowly turned southwest heading toward indianapolis. after it turned in that direction the front light pulsated slowly then faded out the left rear light did the same and finally the right rear light followed. \r\n\r\ni have seen pictures on you tube of this same thing. i always believed that we are not the only ones in the universe but i never thought i'd really see

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Before i begin, let me just say that i'm completely aware of how crazy all of this is.  what drove me to submit a report is the details of the most recent, august 6th event.  i've been an experiencer (i like that word a little better than abductee) since around 5 years old -- i'm now 36.\r\n\r\nto give you a little background, my family and i lived in a small town in northern, ca - basically in the middle of nowhere, in 1982 when my mother claimed the entire family was abducted by aliens.  my mother and i shared experiences and memories of that day -- many that i remember \"like yesterday\" even to this day.  since then, every couple of years, i've had experiences that are so unbelievable, i can't believe i'm feeling compelled to submit them.  \r\n\r\nthe natural response to this is likely, \"this guy's nuts.\"  however, know in advance that i'm totally sane with no history of mental illness.  in fact, i'm a successful business man, have a great job, make great money, and has zero reason to totally embarrass myself like.  \r\n\r\n\r\nyears ago, my father recommended that i keep a log of these events - so i did.  i'm just going to copy/paste that log into this form.  it ends with the event from august 6th, which is interesting to say the least.  i started this around 4 to 5 years ago outlining the \"legacy\" info up to that point and added to it whenever something happened.  sometimes, it could be years in between events.\r\n\r\n\r\nlog (emailed to my father in many parts over the years):\r\n*beginning of log*\r\n\r\nearliest memory (5 years old, california home)\r\n\r\nan was alien hiding behind a stack of boxes in the attached garage at our home in murphys, ca.  what's strange is i knew it was an \"alien\" and not a\r\n\"monster\" and didn't feel threatened.  i recall crying for grover, the\r\nneighbor kid, because i wanted protection anyways.  i remember seeing\r\na large head poke out from behind a tall box - pretty featureless.  i\r\nremember it to be small.  being 5 at the time, it was definitely no bigger than me.  \r\n\r\nnothing happened nor was i spoken to...I tried to run away.  thinking back, running away was difficult - as if i was moving in \"slow motion,\" as if time was slowing down.  what's strange is that happened about 27 years ago and i remember that like it just happened; however, i don't remember what happened after i \"ran away.\"  maybe i didn't get away??  no memory after i tried to run.\r\n\r\ncirca 1987:\r\n\r\ni had a set of \"dreams\" about aliens.  very possible these were\r\ndreams, who knows.  i have very vivid dreams of aliens in the house -\r\nand an alien hiding behind the bush that was on the applegate-side of\r\nour house.  just a lot of imagery - nothing specific... just a lot of\r\nweird stuff.  i remember these dreams as if they happened yesterday, as clear as events.\r\n\r\nfreshman year of high school, 1991:\r\n\r\nlaying in bed, not sleeping with my eyes closed.  the first time i\r\nexperienced \"the tone.\"  the tone/warble built up within seconds and\r\ninstead of seeing black as you normally would with your eyes closed, i\r\nsaw a brilliant blue... almost a perfect blue.  i recall panicking\r\nbecause i didn't know what was happening, but i couldn't get out of\r\nbed - i was completely paralyzed except for my eyes.  i could move my\r\neyes with no problem and look around (which wasn't much because i was\r\nfacing the wall) - but my body was 100% paralyzed.  i could hardly\r\nmove my jaw, i couldn't move my head, arms, body, legs.  the tone\r\neventually hit an incredible crescendo of high and low oscillating\r\ntones (not unlike how an analog modem would make a connection) except\r\nit sounded like a electrical \"hums\" - the pattern of the oscillations\r\nwere like a modem.  once the crescendo reached the highest point, the\r\nvolume was lowered to a background-level (but still oscillating) while\r\ni heard a voice that said, \"don't move.\"  the voice sounded\r\nsynthesized and not like it came from a being speaking through vocal\r\nchords, if that makes sense.  it also had a sinister tone to it, in my\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\ni had such a panic in me that i somehow rolled off the edge of the\r\nbed.  i slowly regained movement and stumbled into dad's room to wake\r\nhim up in a panic. time: 4:45am\r\n\r\n1993:\r\n\r\nthere were numerous times in the coming weeks where the tone started\r\nto build-up and i figured out a way to block it out.  nothing\r\neventful, outside of that.\r\n\r\n1994:\r\n\r\nafter a number successful tone-blockings on my behalf (all of which while i was awake - all of which i was mighty proud of), i was sleeping when the tone came on very fast and it made me self-aware in the dream.  \r\n\r\ni immediately found myself in murphys.  if asked how i know that, i really don't know - i just knew.  there were pine needles on the ground, large pine trees, and i was at the side of a huge, huge rocky cliff (i think was big rocky).  for some reason, i wasn't wondering \"wtf am i doing here\" although i was completely aware.  i heard a little boy crying behind a rocky outcrop.\r\n\r\nwhen i walked around the pile of rocks, i was looking at myself at 5\r\nyears old....And he was looking at me.  the 5-year-old dave told me\r\nthat \"they'll hurt me if i keep running.\"\r\n\r\nthere was an old abandoned shed that was nearby (gray wood - many years old and rotted).\r\n\r\n5-year-old-dave ran into the shed.  i ran after him because being\r\ncompletely aware of what was happening, i wanted to talk to him.\r\nwouldn't anyone??  obviously i wanted to talk to a 5-year-old clone of\r\nmyself.  when i entered the shed, there was a very tall alien.  when i\r\nwas in his presence, i felt at total peace - no fear.  i couldn't look\r\nat his face - my brain wouldn't let me move my eyes in his face's\r\ndirection.  \r\n\r\ni recall feeling like i was with family, in a way -\r\nnothing strange that i was in front of an alien at all (as if it were\r\ntotally normal, an every day thing)....Almost as if it were an actual\r\nfamily member - very safe and peaceful feeling.  it said they would be\r\nleaving soon, telepathically.  i felt sadness and i don't know why i\r\ndid - i didn't want them to leave.  i asked if i could go with them.\r\ntelepathically, he responded by saying they'd be back in another 10\r\nyears.  time: 4:45am\r\n\r\n\r\n1994, 2nd event:\r\n\r\ni was self-aware in a dream after the tone hit me... in my parents\r\nbathroom.  i kept feeling a hand \"tap\" me - but nothing was there.\r\nevery time i felt a tap, it was behind me or to the side--- nothing\r\nwas ever there.  i recall waiting patiently for the tap and when it\r\ncame, i'd snap my body in a direction hoping to catch whatever it was\r\ni couldn't see.  this happened about 10 times before i took some baby\r\npowder from the bathroom cabinet and waited patiently for the next\r\ntap.  the moment the tap occurred i shook the baby power in the air\r\nand it stuck to a small figure, which was an alien.  it told me\r\ntelepathically i was the first person to \"win,\" as if it were a game\r\nof tag or something.  it then disappeared and i found myself in bed.\r\ntime: 4:45am\r\n\r\napprox. 1995\r\n\r\nwas in a car accident with my friend ron and bashed my shin in very\r\nbadly.  i was in the back seat of his car without my seat belt when he\r\nran his car off the road.  ambulance picked us up and ron's mom picked\r\nus up from memorial hospital.  i could hardly walk - i can't stress\r\nthat enough.  i thought my leg was broken.  that night, i fell asleep\r\nand became self aware in a dream (i was on the football field at my\r\nhigh school kicking field goals with my bad leg (which is horses**t,\r\nbecause i can't kick a field goal to save my life).  when the\r\ntone/warble hit me, i honestly felt like i couldn't miss--- and i was\r\ncompletely self-aware, wondering...\"wtf am i doing on a football field\r\nin the middle of the night kicking field goals?\"\r\n\r\nthe moment i thought this i opened my eyes and i was on a table,\r\ncompletely paralyzed.  i could only move my eyes and couldn't move\r\nanything else.  i was in a dark room with subtle light shined on me.\r\nthere were beings to the left and right of me - but my eyes couldn't\r\nmove enough to see.  the room was octagonal, based on the fact i could\r\nonly see forward and saw three sides to the room.  the room was a very\r\nflat olive green.... almost a grayish olive-green.  there was a\r\nfrosted window on each of the three walls in front of me with\r\nsillouettes of small figures behind them (one per window).  the rooms behind the frosted windows were brightly lit.  \r\n\r\nthe moment i realized what was happening to me i began to severely panic.  \r\n\r\nin the blink of an eye, i was in my bed again... instantly.  my leg was\r\ncompletely healed as if nothing ever happened from the accident the\r\nnight before.  i never told anyone my leg was fine because i knew i\r\ncouldn't explain what had happened.  time:  4:45am\r\n\r\napprox. 1995:\r\n\r\ni'm laying in bed, awake, when the tone hits me.  as the tone hits its\r\ncrescendo, a laser light beamed through my window and projected a\r\nmessage on the wall in front of the bed.  it said, \"the pipe is on.\r\nif you want to come, just relax.  if not, there will be another time.\"\r\n for some reason, i was scared and tried to fight the tone and light\r\nstopped and the tone stopped.  time: 4:45am\r\n\r\n\r\napprox 1997:\r\n\r\ni was having back pain so i was sleeping on the couch in the antique\r\nroom.  i immediately became self-aware as the tone hit me and then\r\nreached a crescendo.  i found myself in a long institutional hallway\r\nwith flourescent lights, tile floor, etc.  there was a woman in front\r\nof me in a military outfit (airforce uniform, blue - with the airforce\r\ncap and longer dark-dirty-blonde hair in a bun - late 40's).  she told\r\nme to follow her, so i did without saying anything.  at the end of\r\nthis long hallway, it turned 90-degrees to the right went back a few\r\nfeet and there was a door on the right wall.  \r\n\r\nshe opened the door and motioned me through it.  there was a long stairway leading down.  if i recall right, the stairs were covered in a very short reddish-brown carpet.  at the bottom of the stairs was an empty room with the walls/ceiling/floor covered in the same carpet.  when i stepped off of\r\nthe stairs and into the room, the tone intensified greatly - and i\r\nfelt the presence of aliens.  \r\n\r\nthe wall to my left raised up (as if it were a large panel), revealing a glass wall behind it.  on the other side of the glass partition was a white room.  everything was white.  white floor, white walls, white ceiling.  there was also white furniture (a couch and a chair, if i recall) with a white end-table and lamp.  the room was very well lit.  \r\n\r\nfacing the glass, standing to my right was an alien about my size wearing a white robe and it was holding a baby.  i tried to look at the aliens face and i couldn't; however i did manage to catch a quick glimpse before it prevented me from positioning my eyes on it.  i saw it had large almond-shaped eyes; however, they weren't slanted-up like on the communion book\r\ncover.  they were large and almond-shaped, but more horizontal - maybe\r\na slight tilt upwards, but not much.  large head.  the next thing i\r\nknew, i was on the couch.\r\n\r\nnew entry to record an event from 10-years prior (circa 1998):\r\n\r\nwithin the last 10-years (relatively recently), i've \"become aware\" in\r\na dream where i've walked over the hill in murphys (the one that was\r\non fire) and was led into a passage in the side of a hill which went\r\ndown a long flight of steps (underground) into a chamber that looked\r\nlike the bridge of a ship.  whenever i become aware, i have a hard\r\noscillating tone/warble originating in my head (pulsing energy / energy oscillations) -- but goes throughout the body - very euphoric and electrical at the same time (i have the sensation of flight and non-verbal communication).  there were aliens there, but i couldn't look at their faces---my eyes wouldn't physically move to allow it.  \r\n\r\nthey were trying to show me a map of some kind, but i paid no attention to it because all i cared about was to try to look at them.  there was a stalemate of some kind so i went back up the stairs.  when i did, i \"woke-up\" and was in my bed.  i had \"woke up\" in the dream when the tone hit my head.  it's as if at one moment i was physically there, and the next second i was in bed.  \r\n\r\n\r\napprox 2008:\r\n\r\nthe tone hit me and paralyzed me in bed and something was beside the\r\nbed, but i couldn't move to look.  a very bright light was coming from\r\nthe hallway just outside of the bedroom - my gf was completely asleep.\r\n \r\ni freaked out because i wasn't ready for it and panicked.  i fought\r\nout of the paralysis and rolled out of bed, landing on my face.  the\r\nmoment i hit the ground, everything stopped.  the very next night, the\r\ntone came back and once again i couldn't move in bed.  there was a\r\nvery bright light in the hallway and movement in the room - but i\r\ncouldn't move my head to look.  \r\n\r\nthis time, i felt a very strong air flow moving out of the room.  this wasn't like a ceiling fan spinning-  there was no sound and i felt a very hard flow of air getting sucked out of the room.  so hard, in fact, i felt the air rush across my face.  \r\n\r\nonce again, no sound.  again, i panicked uncontrollably and\r\neverything stopped.  nothing since.  there's zero chance i mistook the\r\nair flow from the fan during my paralysis.  i can't describe how hard\r\nit was - but a fan it wasn't.  when i could move again, there was\r\nnothing in the hallway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmiscellaneous thoughts (probably written late 90's):\r\n\r\ntone/warble:\r\n\r\nwhenever it hits me, there's usually complete paralysis.  the more i\r\nrelax, the more intense it gets.  if i completely let it go, which is\r\nrare because it feels like you're going to have an aneurism, it hits a\r\nbrilliant crescendo of tone oscillations and that's when the really\r\nweird s**t happens.\r\n\r\nwhen the tone hits me, it's extremely hard to explain.  time is no\r\nlonger normal.  actually, reality isn't normal - although i'm lucid.\r\nwhat i mean by that is my awareness hits another level.  i feel an\r\nentire new sensation of insight and thought.  i feel as though i can\r\nlevitate (and sometimes i did while self-aware in dreams).  i feel as\r\nthough my breathing is different.  i'm not even aware that i am\r\nbreathing.  when the tone hits the crescendo (highest-level), i feel\r\nextremely oxygenated - as if i'm always at the top level of inhalation\r\nwith my breath--- without consciously breathing.  the air is\r\ndifferent, slightly thick and slightly sweet - almost like the air\r\nduring a lightening storm with ozone--- it's different.\r\n\r\ntime is different with the tone as well.  there's no sensation of the\r\npassage of time at all.  i can't even explain that.  it's a sensation\r\ni never felt before experiencing the tone so it's impossible for\r\nsomeone else to understand who has never experienced this.  as a\r\nmatter of fact, i'm not even sure what's happening is happening in the\r\n\"now\" as-in \"our dimension.\"  everything is not in \"real-time\" as you\r\nsee it now.  it's in \"different\" time.  i can't explain different - i\r\ndon't know the words or phrases.\r\n\r\nfor example, one could easily read what i wrote and think, \"eh--\r\nbecoming aware in a dream - it's still a dream.\"  i completely\r\nunderstand that as i'd think the same thing.  when i say self-aware, i\r\nmean-- i'm no longer sleeping and i'm somewhere else completely lucid.\r\n\r\n\r\n(there are a few events in the late 2000's early 2010's, one involving a visit with what i believe was my daughter).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhere's a record from this morning (8/6/2013):\r\n\r\ni become completely aware within a dream and find myself in a room that's setup exactly like a classroom.  there are desks/chairs setup in rows.  the tiles on the floor are large concrete tiles, not unlike something you'd find in a traditional classroom.  to the left, i see that two floor tiles are missing and there is some kind of device on the opposite wall.  immediately, i know what's going on, so i keep totally calm and become highly observant.  i'm looking at everything i can as fast as i can because i know something is going to happen. \r\n\r\ni turn around and look towards the entrance to the classroom.  beyond the entrance way (i don't recall seeing a door), there's a hall way that extends 30-40' straight ahead.  i'm only saying 30-40' because it's a complete estimation based on a quick look-see.  the hallway is very plain and not much to look at.  i notice that the lighting is mostly reddish, leaving everything red and black so i couldn't get too much detail.  i was able to see that the hallway straight ahead came to a \"t\" intersection.  from my perspective, i'm able to tell there is a hallway immediately to the right outside of the entrance way; i'm not quite sure if anything is immediately out of the door to the left.  it could be a wall or another hallways, i really couldn't tell.\r\n\r\nas soon as i was able to get as much information as i could visually, about 12-15 people began to walk into the room - mostly single file.  the people looked very, very human.  very typical.  there was a lot of diversity within the group, some were white, some where black, and some were asian.  to the best of my knowledge, i don't recall seeing any females within the group.  the group of people looked very, very normal and nothing out of the ordinary struck me as strange except that everyone was between 4-5' tall.  everyone i walked near was at least a shoulder shorter than me.\r\n\r\ni knew immediately these were aliens.  not because they were much smaller than me, but because i \"felt\" them telepathically.  my head was \"lit-up\" in their presence, so i knew right off the bat that they were presenting themselves as \"human\" and everything was a facade.\r\n\r\nas they all entered the room, each took a seat behind a desk and everyone was paying attention to me.  it wasn't long before a male caucasian entered the room.  \r\n\r\nthis guy had a blondish-brown short beard that rose up to hair along the side of his head --- the top of his head was bald.  his beard and what little hair he had around his head was well-kept and clean-cut - very similar to ben bernanke (attached).  his eyes were blueish and the top of his head came up to my shoulder level.  the group of aliens all stood up briefly to acknowledge the captain and sat back down.  this was done in a way where i interpreted it as showing the captain respect.  now, whether or not this guy was the captain - who knows.  all i know is the others clearly felt he was in charge and i felt he was in charge as well due to the feeling / connection i had with the others.  in a way, you feel what they feel and know what everyone is thinking -- all at the same time.  very hard to describe.\r\n\r\nknowing these were aliens, i smiled at the captain just to let him know i was comfortable.\r\n\r\ni initiated the conversation by saying, \"you don't have to do this.   you can present yourselves in your natural state.  i'm not afraid anymore, i promise.\"\r\n\r\nthe captain replied, \"it's easier this way.\"\r\n\r\nvery short, very simple answer.  i recall pressing the issue a bit and i wasn't doing it to argue with the captain.  in a way, i wanted him to know that that i respect them and they don't have to hide themselves.  i pressed the fact that 1) they can be themselves around me and 2) i respected them and 3) i wasn't going to become afraid.  i already \"kind\" of knew what they looked like from years ago when i had that event with the alien holding the baby.  back then, it tried like hell to not let me see its face, but i was still able to get a quick glimpse.  i think he knew that anyways, but he repeated, \"it's easier this way.\"\r\n\r\nnone of the communication was verbal - it's all telepathic.\r\n\r\nthe captain and the group wanted to show me technology involving matter.  looking around, there wasn't anything technology-wise other than the two tiles missing on the floor and that device along the right wall.  when i took a closer look at the two missing tiles, there was nothing under the floor -- just blackness.  what was strange, was that there was perfect blackness - even though we were in a well-lit room.  perfect blackness as if -- there wasn't anything beyond the level of the tiles.  i took a piece of chalk that was sitting near the chalkboard and threw it into the hole that was closest to the entrance.  the moment the chalk hit the blackness it immediately shot-up from the other missing-tile area with the exact same trajectory and speed.  it was almost as if the one hole was a perfect portal to the other hole.  i have no idea why i did it, but i jumped up with my arms pressed against my body and jumped into the first hole and i immediately shot through the next hole - instantly.  i almost didn't make a good landing because i nearly lost my footing and i felt an overwhelming sense of panic from the group.  i don't think they expected me to actually jump in the hole, but at the same time no one suggested i couldn't so i thought it was safe.\r\n\r\nthe captain made a comment along the lines of, \"don't do that again, it's very dangerous.  if you fall back in, you will be gone forever.\"\r\n\r\none of the other crew members led me to the device along the right wall.  it explained to me that matter can be created.  when i asked how so, it said something along the lines of:  \"think of something.  concentrate hard.  the machine will show your image.\"\r\n\r\ni have no idea why, but the first thing that came to mine was a single story brick building.  just like he said, when i imagined it, an image displayed exactly as i pictured it in my mind.  the crew member then instructed me to take a light pen (almost like a laser) and shine the beam of light around a part of the object that i wanted to create.  i did what he said and highlighted a corner of the building with what appeared to be a red beam.  that part of the building turned red as it was selected.  for some reason i wanted to hold that piece of the building, so the hologram machine must have understood the scale that i desired.  out of nowhere, my entire selection manifested and presented itself in the air in front of the machine so i picked it up.  what was once literally 1/4 of the size of an actual building was reduced to a scale that fit within the palm of my hand.  even the bricks were tiny.\r\n\r\nif i recall, this event initiated an in-depth discussion of \"how?\"\r\n\r\nthe captain explained that consciousness was the master of matter and that in the beginning, consciousness created matter - matter was not the creator of consciousness.  the general feeling i got was that matter could be manipulated.  the technical discussion didn't go beyond the differentiation between matter and consciousness.  i felt like the captain was saying there are two classifications of everything within the universe (and beyond):  consciousness and everything else (matter).  consciousness can control its environment, if the consciousness is strong enough. \r\n\r\ni asked the captain if he was referring to our soul. \r\n\r\nhe replied by saying something along the lines of, \"not in the way you define the word 'soul.'\"\r\n\r\nin between what he said and what he felt, i interpreted his comment as the word \"soul\" is man-made, with its definition being incorrect - basically, it was a myth, incomplete, bad information or completely misunderstood.\r\n\r\nhe clarified that \"consciousness\" expresses itself through a body.  consciousness is there before the body and consciousness is there after the body.  i believe he attributed the word \"soul\" to only have meaning after one dies, which is incomplete.  who you are, your personality, your intelligence, your knowledge and what defines you as a person is persistent in both directions.\r\n\r\nthe understanding i had was that consciousness was everything - the most powerful.  everything else was a result of consciousness.  something along those lines\r\n\r\ni asked if i could try again, and the group obliged.\r\n\r\ni have no idea why, but i wanted to think of something random just to test the limits, so i concentrated hard on a bag of doritos.  a bad of cool-ranch doritos appeared within the hologram and \"willed\" a smaller bag because i didn't want to eat a full bag in front of these guys.  the bag manifested in the air and i pulled it down into my hands.  i broke the bag open and ate a dorito chip --- it was perfect, just like the real thing.  i was fascinated, so i ate a few chips.  obviously, never seen anything like it so i was googly-eyed over what just happened.\r\n\r\none of the crew members said, \"i'm fascinated by his primitiveness.\"\r\n\r\ni'm not sure if he said \"fascinated\" or if he said something like, \"his primitiveness is interesting.\"  whether he was fascinated or interested in my primitiveness, i kind of took a little offense to the comment.  right as he said it, i felt the group concur w/ his feeling/statement and i know they weren't trying to offend me -- to them, i was interesting and he wanted to share that. \r\n\r\ni didn't want to let that go without a retort because i knew that they knew i didn't receive that comment too well.  without missing a beat, i said, \"there's no doubt you have the intelligence and knowledge aspects of consciousness down, but you clearly lack other qualities like personality and sense of humor.\"  as i said that, i was pretty animated --- talking with my hands and speaking with an enunciated flair to make my point.\r\n\r\nthe captain, i believe, probably felt the same way i felt and somehow telepathically \"lit-up\" the nerves that ran from my arm pits down my sides to the extreme.  it's probably the same \"tickle\" nerve i remember as a kid, but he really lit it up to the point where i was laughing so hard it was literally torture.  as he lit those nerves up, he said, \"still think we have no sense of humor?  still think we have no sense of humor!?!?!\"  \r\n\r\neach time he said it the intensity went up a notch and just before i felt like i was going to die from laughter (literally), he stopped lighting me up.  it took me a moment to collect myself and as i was catching my breath, i felt the group's entertainment.  i don't think they were laughing since i'm not sure if that's part of their emotions, but i felt a very strong sense of \"entertainment,\" which i thought was the equivalent of the entire room laughing at me.\r\n\r\ni'm a sport, so i smiled and thought that was cute and let the captain know his point was well-made.\r\n\r\nthe captain then said that i remind him of himself when he was at my stage of development.  i took that as meaning, \"his consciousness's stage of development - not him physically.\"  at this time, he telepathically \"connected\" with me and created an illusion, which we both experienced.  i found myself in a two room living quarter.  it looked like a small studio apartment with a bathroom off to the side.  it was very plain and it looked very human-like as a dwelling.  in fact, it was very similar --- but it was very, very plain.  no visible knick-knacks, decorations, art, or anything like that.  there was a small window in the bathroom and a small window near the main door.  i couldn't really see the outside well at all.  the bed had linens, there was a soft flooring that reminded me of carpet - all in all, very similar.  the captain told me that this was where he lived when he was at my stage in development.  the \"gist\" i felt from him was that consciousness that exists within our \"body type\" will all live/exist in a similar fashion, regardless of their race.  i think he was trying hard to show me that he could relate to me and that he was just like me at one time.  maybe he pulled this together just to have a serious moment after the tickling incident and bring calm?  i'm not sure.\r\n\r\nthis only lasted a few moments and i was back in the classroom with the others.  in fact, i'm sure i never left -- the captain just created an illusion that we left, but we didn't.\r\n\r\nall of this was so far beyond my understanding, i was absolutely enthralled.  it all seemed like magic, but it wasn't.  they had complete control of everything.\r\n\r\nright around this time, the crew started to exit the room and down the hall to the right and i knew my time was up.  i finished my small bag of doritos while i waited for the crew to exit the room and i left the bag on a desk as i followed the last guy (the captain) out of the room.  i didn't feel guilty because i didn't see a trash can and i figured if they can make the f**ker appear, they can make it disappear.\r\n\r\nthe captain was waiting for me just outside of the door to the right.  i looked him into his blue eyes and i told him that i was appreciative of the lesson and the information.  i felt that he gave me a good insight of \"what is.\"  i then told him that i would shake his hand, except that i had doritos-seasoning all over my right hand.  the captain smiled and told me to raise my hands and put them together.  i did what i was told and made a \"praying sign\" with my hands around the level of my chest.  the captain stared intently at my hands. \r\n\r\nthe look of his face was that out outright concentration and determination.  my eyes never left his eyes and the middle of his face when he did this because i wanted to see what he was doing, but i noticed my hands started to shimmer / reflect light strangely.  as this was happening, the captain's human \"facade\" broke-down somewhat around his upper-nose and eyes - generally around the center of his face.  the illusion broke down slightly and i could clearly see there was an alien behind the facade.  i couldn't see much because it was only a few square inches that broke the illusion.  i'm guessing he couldn't pull off both tricks at the same time and let his facade slip a bit.\r\n\r\nafter just a moment, my hands were covered in that lemony-liquid that is found in wet-naps.  all of the doritos seasoning was gone.\r\n\r\ni told the captain, \"i don't understand how you just did that.\"\r\n\r\nwhen i said that, i got the impression that the captain was a little let down -- i think i asked a \"stupid question.\"\r\n\r\nhe replied by saying, \"the same way the demonstration worked in the classroom.\"\r\n\r\ni said, \"but how did you do that without the equipment?\"\r\n\r\nhe just smiled and right then... i found myself opening my eyes in my bed --- wide awake as if i had been up for hours.  the time was 4:45am.\r\n\r\nit just now occurred to me as i write this, the classroom \"matter device\" and possibly even the black portal holes in the floor were probably illusions all along as well.  based on his smile, maybe they manifested those illusions as well - maybe it was them manipulating those actions all along?\r\n\r\ni was wondering why all of those crew members were in the room.  maybe they were learning from me as much as i was learning from them, hence the \"classroom.\"  in addition, maybe they were all there to collaboratively execute the matter demonstration - maybe they needed to cooperate to pull it off?\r\n\r\n*end of log*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen you read the above log, know that when i said \"self-aware in a dream,\" it might mean that was sleeping, however, i was 100% cognizant and as lucid as any other time.  for me, 100% of self-aware events while sleeping involve aliens and they all involve \"time\" of some kind.  meaning, when i \"come to\" in my bed (usually at 4:45am), i'm not tired and it feels as though i've been up for a long time.\r\n\r\nin conclusion, i know it all sounds insane -- i'm submitting it in hopes it means something to someone else.  i'm also submitting a diagram from the august 6th event.  i recall each of these events very well - a lot more detail is available upon request.\r\n\r\n\r\nregards,\r\n[name removed/cms/tg]","distance":"20 Feet or

one the dead grass looks broken and pressed down.  both impressions share in being round with irregular edges, and the recent one also shows the same type landing gear impression(s), as the other one.  on the first one i found 2 landing gear impressions, and the recent one was not investigated by me thoroughly, as i found only one.  both showed landin gear impressions in the exact same distance near the walkway.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":49733,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.796001,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08112013-0032","longitude":-117.958618,"occurred":1370847600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1376271188000,"summary":"2
