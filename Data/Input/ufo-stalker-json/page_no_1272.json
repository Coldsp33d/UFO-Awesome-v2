meteor shower that was supposed to take place. i was already looking up to the sky in anticipation. we were sitting at the stop light at pioneer ave, waiting to turn left on w liberty ave, when i noticed a big orange flickering light rising above the treetops, it shot quickly to the left. the light reminded me of a floating lantern, but much bigger. my fiancee was driving & got a good look about the time i noticed the light shoot past 3 other red/orange pulsating lights. i then noticed the objects seemed to follow & form an obtuse scalene triangle. slowly the 4th light disappeared & the other red orange lights moved in to make a tighter triangle. it took more than a minute or so for the shape to form. it was at that time i spent approx 20-30 seconds searching the back seat for my camera. when i started recording we were still at the stop light & the mysterious lights remained relatively stationary for about 30 more seconds. as the light changed i kept shooting through the open roof of our jeep. as we moved past the buildings & street lights, it stayed in focus, all the while pulsating red & orange. we drove down the street for another minute or two, filming the objects flicker in the sky, still in triangle formation. at about the same time, 2 lights disappeared, & left one red/orange light, which seemed to get brighter before i eventually lost sight of it. the entire sighting lasted less than 5 minutes but left us feeling certain we had seen something out of the ordinary. i have no clue of the origin of the lights or if they actually created a bigger object, but it seemed as so, did not look like anything i had ever seen before in the sky. it left us feeling certain we had just witnessed a

shooting star and a few seconds later a ufo and then another shooting star. what we saw was set of 6-8 chevron shaped lights that made up shape up an arrow. the chevron shaped lights were slotted much like the lights shining through a partially opened blind. the color of the light was a dull bluish white light except at the ends of the chevron's where it appeared more of a greenish glow. the lights looked more reflective than glowing in the other areas almost as if it had a searchlight shining up at it and a reflective tape shining back. there were no searchlights or anything else shining at it though. the intensity of the lights were just slightly more than the stars. now take that description and add a slight grayish fog to it in the unlit areas. it blocked out stars behind its shape at it glided over and you could kinda tell it was one complete object.  we first spotted it almost straight overhead moving quickly from east to west. we only saw it for a few seconds and it disappeared well before it should have been out of sight since we were still looking up at it. it made no noise whatsoever. it was an incredible experience for the both of us who saw it. it left us stunned for a while. we really wanted to see it again.

observed two redish-orange brightly glowing objects following one another.  the two objects were to the east of us very slowly, barely moving, one behind the other heading in a northeast direction.  the objects were so brightly glowing that they almost looked as though they were a type of firework in the sky that did not dissipate.  there was absolutely no blinking of lights, or changing in the intensity of their glow.  i motioned with my arm and hand to other drivers directly behind me and oncoming to look up.  i within a minute after first spotting the objects, pulled off of the road to the right upon entering a rural village in rural central pa.  approximately 1 to 1 1/2 minutes after pulling off to observe these objects, the trailing object moved what appeared to be very slightly and slowly in an easterly direction and appeared to begin to grow dimmer until it appeared to vanish.  within 30 seconds afterwards, the lead object repeated the same action as the trailing object. these two objects did not seem to be emitting any audible sound at all during the entire event. during the time objects were observed from the roadside, a jet was observed to be flying between and above the objects at an altitude much higher than they. i went to utilize my cell phone to obtain photos but realized that while shopping earlier, my wife had placed my cell phone in her purse, which was in turn placed in one of the saddlebags on our motorcycle.  i unfortunately was unable to obtain photos.  this sighting of these two objects has very much sparked our curiosity and at the same time has given us a very uneasy and unsettling feeling as we know that these two objects cannot come from any origin that we at this time have present knowledge of.  if they are man-made, ie. from any branch of our armed forces etc., i am not aware of them and the capabilities they presented in this sighting.

outside and there was a large burnt mark on my grass in my back yard. since that day i haven't experienced anything else but i do have pains on my right abdomen area. i took a photo like 1 week later

(perhaps i'm mistaken?)\r\n\r\nthe objects themselves were dual colors. they looked like two square lights of some sort attached to one another, which you cant tell from the video due to the low quality. if i remember correctly the colors were a solid blue and green, but dont quote me on that... i cant recall for sure. in the video each object appears a different color versus each being a dual color.\r\n\r\nbefore i started to record, the second object had been hovering back and forth. it's the object you see hover up from the lower left in the video.\r\n\r\nmy feelings and reactions: curiosity more than anything. like i said, i think it was probably something of terrestrial origin and someone either testing out some kind of say.. drone, or something, or putting on a show of some sort with rc craft. they kind of reminded me of those small automated drones from some of the universities you see videos of doing synchronized flying. that or perhaps small rc craft (but silent).  at first i thought there might be some sort of propeller sound, but it was just downtown noise.. as i made my way downtown no one else seemed to have noticed anything. (it was busy downtown)\r\n\r\nhow did i lose sight of the objects? see the video. they did their thing and then flew off. the second one looked like it had been landing or taking off before i started recording. its hard to tell for sure though without a better idea of distance though.
