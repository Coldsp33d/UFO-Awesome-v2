four white lights in formation coming down the river, in formation. i rolled down my window and told my friend to look at these helicopters. within a minute they came directly at my truck. they went up in the air as a vehicle approached from behind us. i looked over at the man and woman in that vehicle who did not so much as acknowledge me. i almost knew that they wouldn't see it... the vehicle passed, and the lights came down around us, two on our left, one directly above us, and one on the right. i had my head out of the driver's window looking up at this now white rectangle of light (as an observation or instrument utility mode?) i could see what seemed like light trailing up the sides of the rectangle, outlining the shape of a dark sphere, though i am not sure, i really strained to see some ship and can not be certain. this rectangular light was perhaps ten feet above us. the two white spheres remained on our left, one on the right. the rectangle then moved to the lights on the left and (simultaneously?) became a sphere like the other three. it revolved around the two lights on the left one at a time. i believe three clockwise revolutions. the three objects crossed the road in front of us, and the fourth object was then circled. the lights then moved down the street as i approached a red light (top of brittania hill now). i stopped, and the four lights stopped close to a heritage building in the middle of carling avenue where it splits into robertson road. i told my friend i would \"floor it\", and catch up the the objects when the light changed. instead, as i left the stop-line at high speed, and accelerated, they matched my motion perfectly. they stayed this distance adhead of us until i approached lincoln fields. the objects then picked up speed and elevation. i saw three of these objects spin off into space, this time, clockwise, and in three revolutions disappeared high in the atmosphere. my friend saw all four do this, i missed one since i was driving. the last one to leave was so high that he was more to the south, almost beside us and perhaps 85 degrees to the horizon. the others seemed lower and more to the east as they left. there were perhaps ten seconds between each light doing this, the entire high altitude depart spiral of the four lights taking perhaps fourty seconds. i found out that there was a third person who saw the lights doing something \"strange\" in the area of lincoln fields. my friend and i heard this the next day at our school. i found out many years later that it was in the news perhaps a few minutes before our event, several hundred miles away, across the great lakes.\r\n\r\ni saw white lights in that general area on another occasion floating over the river -- they seemed to be in no rush to leave, and a group of three orange lights in 1992 with my girlfriend. we saw these three orange lights (one sphere, and two triangle with rounded bases (pointing outwards from the sphere). we saw these objects very high in the sky, and it only lasted a second or two.\r\n\r\nthree sightings within 1.5 km, and all within five years, and never again, though i've moved away. i'm reporting this almost thirty years later. i've reported it to mufon previously, to nufor, to the nrc in canada -- directly to dr. mcnamara. i've also written stanton friedman about it, when i discovered there was a newspaper report online that same day, with a very similar description. he pointed out that nobody is correlating sightings. i think this sight does a great job of that. i'm not reporting the other two events since they are rather insignificant in comparison to what i would call my close encounter of the fourth kind, though i did not see an alien, they were definitely taking a close look at us. i can supply the full names of all witnesses.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

i have seen many things that i regret not having the camera with me. you will see i am a nature fun and taking pictures is my hobby.\r\ni went upstairs to the 7th floor to have a better view, and it was an amazing sunset, i took the first picture and it was just what i saw, then i took a second one and immediately i saw the object i could not believe it, i was shocked,the first thought that came to my mind was an ufo and instinctively i took another picture, nothing came up. i saw the picture again and could not believe what is on the picture, i have been trying to find out but there is no logical explanation to what is on the picture. i took another picture yesterday of a clear light that was not moving and what is very very odd is that the object i took the picture was quite visible and could have been an airplane or something bigger, what is wierd is that comparing the object of the picture taken the 8th of august, the light on the picture seems smaller than the object which means it might be a very big object. my cam is just a common one, not a funcy one, so i can not take special pictures. \r\nthe object is completely round and on the picture appears like a golf ball, with white and sort of grey texture whith like three holes or i don't know how to describe, may be lights, i can not tell. i cannot say aif it was moving or how it was as when i took the picture it was not a visible object.\r\ndescribing the feelings i had is quite difficult, i was shocked by what i saw on the picture and still am, i know deep within myself that is not an illusion is something that to our eyes we do not see, yet exists.\r\ni believe there is a reason for things to happen and i just wanted to contact an organization or group that could help to find out what is on the picture. i will send you the sequence of the 3 pictures taken, the cam time is one hour behind because i do not know how to fix it. the first one was taken at 20:46 although it shows 19:46, the second one with the object was taken a minute later, and the last one was taken immediately after i saw the object on the 2nd pic. if you see deeply into the first pic there is a light but it could be a simple light.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown,N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":49665,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.909144958777546,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08102013-0004","longitude":-82.74019563229243,"occurred":1376020020000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1376121803000,"summary":"Sunset

of the street lights were shut off or lacking in that particular area.\r\n\r\nfacing north i noticed what i first thought was an airplane. a second later i realized there were no regulation lights of any kind, only 3 dull white lights in triangle formation. to be precise, one light was closely followed by two lights. they were equally spaced. there must have been a solid object holding them in place, but it was only a sillhouette if anything, leaving the only the lights visible.\r\n\r\npointing at the object i asked my wife, \"what is that?\"\r\n\r\nshe replied, \"i'm not sure. maybe birds?\"\r\n\r\nthe object continued it's flight path north and vanished from site. (my wife believes it vanished quicker than it should have as it couldn't have traveled out of our field of vision in that time.)\r\n\r\n\"there is no way those are birds\" i said. \"have you ever known a bird formation to have only 3 birds?\" \r\n\r\nwe both agreed that if it had been birds, they would have been low enough that we would have seen some semblance of flapping or some waivering motion to indicate biological flight. this object was perfectly geometric and traveled a mechanically precise straight line. there is no doubt whatsoever that this was mechanical in nature.\r\n\r\nthe lights were dull and rather unspectacular compared to what one might believe a ufo to look like. although, i believe this to be the point.\r\n\r\nthe only error the object made to garner notice was that it was flying very low. so low in fact, that we should have been able to hear it or feel the vibration. also, the lights were not even as bright as the dullest stars above them, but each light was at least 3 times as big as the largest star in the sky.\r\n\r\nalthough many folks' eyes were fixed to the projection screen at this outdoor movie, there were over 100 people in attendance at this event. there are potentially many more witnesses. i sincerely hope others witnessed this and report as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

see aircraft all the time and am familiar with the flight paths. there is a small aircraft airfield (don scott field) well south of me, but this object appeared from the north and turned northeast. i lost it when it got behind some trees and was gone by the time i was able to get to a clearing. i attached two pictures...The original from my phone and one where i added some text to describe it. i

house. it was about 4am not many cars were on the road and it was me and my best friend coming from another friends house. i was in the passenger seat while my friend was driving and i was barely staying up because i was really tired ready to get home. what first made me notice the object was the speed and the brightness of it. at first i dint mention it to my friend while she was driving but i kept my eye  on it and it was follwing us down the road , it was right beside us in the sky but it was moving fast too fast , not a airplanes speed thats what caught my attention. i thought it might be a plane or a shooting star all because of the brightness and its speed. i finally sat up and told my friend because i dint want to be the only one looking at so we were both amazed how it was keeping up with us as we went down the road. it was flcikering like a light bulb and getting bigger and smaller. we finally stopped the car on the road i live on and jumped out the car and it stopped directly on top of us, we were obsessed by the lights and the fact that it stopped when we did. we literally starred at the lights for 30 mintues. it started to get bright and then dim and get small then it would change its shape and it look transparent with many bright beautiful colors almost like it had wings , more like a butterfly. we thought we were seeing stuff so we decided to get back in the car to see if it would follow us so we drive downtown about 2 mins down the road and it folowed us all the way downtown. we stopped at the stoplight and made a u turn and it literally follwed us and then switched sides thats how i knew it was something odd. the speed was crazy it cant even explain it but i know it was no plane.The entire time we were so anxious to see what it was we dint even realize how how late it was, we were so interested in seeing what it was , something was drawing us to because it gave us a peaceful, relaxed , curious feeling. we reach my street again and then it slowed down, we played pick- a- boo with it, driving the car up slow a lil bit past the house to the right once u reach my street, and we seen the light at the peak of the house and then we moved pushed on the gas all the way down the road and it just shot off at the same time with us . we parked in front of my house and it just sat there for 3 hours and we watched it and took pictures. i dint want to go in the house i wanted to watch it all night, it was so beautiful, the lights and the way it would jump around.! apparently there were two lights in the sky that night, i kept a eye on it once my friend pulled off and went home and she called seconds later that the light was following her but i told her i was looking right at, once she got home she clamied her radio in her car never has static but when she reached home her radio completley started to make that noise and the light just disappeared. i was so obsessed with the light i could not get it off my mind. after that night i started to see it often outside my house around 2am in the night, i was always alone when i seen it and many nights i seenn it change its colors , jump around dim its light, move up and down, it almost looked as if it had wings comming out the side but you could see the colors flashing. sitting in my car one night i happen to see it again and me and my friend the same girl was just sitting in the car with the car off and we seen the light, we decided to record but u could not see the light on the camera off the cellphone so i choose not to record. but on picture mode u could see it clearly and it was jumping around on the camera like crazy we dint understand. we freaked out when my radio turned on without my keys in the ignition and we both cried from fear of not knowing what caused that to happen but it did it right after our phones died. i continued to see it contstantly after that just me im not sure of my friend.The picture i have is from the night i seen it change colors and change its shape it was breath taken nothing like i have ever seen in my life. it made me feel so concerned to know what it could be or how could i help. for several weeks i became obsessed with researching staying up late hours online about what i was seeing, and having weird dreams. i have not seen this since year ago. but i have seen things like these for several years just never spoke about it.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s),  Wings","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then
