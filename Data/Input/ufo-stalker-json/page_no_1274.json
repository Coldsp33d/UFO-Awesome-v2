seconds and when i finally locked in on it , it stopped dead in mid air just above the tree line and hovered for about five seconds then descended at a much slower speed , it looked like you punched a hole in the sky , like a fluorescent bright light no glare , it went from light to black  on the edge of it , about the size of a dime at arms length , i knew this was something different now because i've seen aircraft the shuttle fly over shooting stars meteors and comets  and this was way faster , i could not tell depth on the object very well but it was a good ways off from what i could tell , i was about 13 at the time and before seeing star wars , im really glad i did this and finally told you, thank you for your time. william hanson
