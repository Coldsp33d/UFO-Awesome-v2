turning dusk about 8:45 pm and the sun had already set below the tree line. the sky was very clear with only a thin clouds to the west. i looked up and saw a large bright object in the distance. i didn't think much of it at first since we live near shaw afb and see planes all the time. i looked again a few seconds later and noticed it was moving fairly slowly and slowly dimmed and brightened again. then behind the object appeared two or three small objects - like glitter - blinking faster than the main object but much smaller and dimmer. they appeared red and orange and trailed the main object for two or three minutes. \r\n   by that point we'd all stopped and were watching trying to figure out what it was. then we noticed what looked like a cloud started forming around it and a cone-shaped trail appeared. i started thinking maybe it's a meteor and it was just hitting the atmosphere but it never got brighter or turned into a fireball. then the tail faded (it was only there for maybe 5 seconds) and it continued as it had been. that's when i really thought something was odd because meteors don't just stop falling. we were near a line of trees and the object moved behind them so we hurried over to a nearby baseball field where we could get a better look.\r\n   it was still visible for a couple of minutes when we got to the field and took a sudden turn away from us (to it's right) and basically continued out of sight. the whole event was at least 15 minutes. when we got home i looked for any footage or pictures of anything similar but didn't find anything. i went to a site that list the dates and times of various launches and did find one in cape canaveral, fl for the same time and date so i'm not sure if that's what we saw. as far as i know those launches don't move horizontally and change directions. if anyone can give me an explanation, i would appreciate it very much.

degrees on the horizon looked like the sun but much smaller kind of like the flame of a rocket seen from below.  once i stopped what i was doing and further looked saw four additional lights appear to the north directly behind the orange orb and they moved in unison...  thought i was seeing things and that it was possibly some kind of reflection so i called the wife to come out and when we both returned to the same approximate viewing area to look all of the lights seen were at a greater height approx 70 degrees on the horizon moving to the east and through the cloud cover.  when i first noticed the object, i thought perhaps it was a satellite or the international space station and just the setting sun causing a reflection, but the other four lights that then appeared and seemed to trail the first made me suspect of that explanation.  on the north to south trajectory they did not appear to move fast - just steady, but when going to the east and gaining altitude the speed appeared to at least double.  no real reaction except that it seemed weird to observe something like this ��� like some kind of weird sci-fi flick.  i would think there has to be some kind of rationale explanation, if it had just been the orange orb/globe than i suppose it was the sun reflecting on something���  the four white lights in a diamond pattern, which stayed in unison with it, are what threw my wife and i a curve.  we lost sight of the objects in the movement to the east and the increase in elevation when finally blocked by cloud formation.

just as i thought we were going to die, it came to an abrupt stop very close to us. it wasn't very high now that it reached us. it stopped in mid air about 20ft away. it was hovering low. i thought i was going to have cardiac arrest until it had stopped. i said to mother, \"that's not an airplane\" then together we said, \"it's a ufo!\" mother began walking towards it ahead of me. we were astonished! this huge illuminating light pulsated directly in front of us as it hover there. though the light was huge in the sky it didn't light the ground. as it descended towards the ground mother and i tried to run to it but we had to be careful of the brush on the raw prairie land. i was no longer frightened and we wanted to get close to it, to see what it was, what it looked like, but just as we got close it began to slowly ascend forming a cloud in front of it. it continued to slowly ascent upward but we could still see the light through the cloud only it wasn't as bright,it had dulled through the cloudy cigar shaped vapor. right before our eyes we watched this glowing light through the cloud as it ascended. as it slowly ascended the light got smaller and the cloud got smaller and it kept getting smaller and smaller until poof....It was gone. we were so disappointed that it had ascended upwards before we could get close enough to get a real good look at it. mother and i were amazed that we had a close encounter and we still are amazed. one thing troubles us though, we remember the light coming and then leaving but we don't remember what we did after it left. i don't know why we didn't call the sheriff to report such an incredible experience. before this ufo sighting, i didn't believe in ufo's, but i'm a true  believer now!
