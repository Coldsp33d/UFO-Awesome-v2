light/gentle breeze, no clouds\r\n\r\ni was hanging out with my friends 1, 2, and 3. we were really bored and trying to find something to do. we decided to take a hike up miwok hill, my favorite place in novato, but it was cloudy and raining there. we then made a quick decision to hangout at my friends house in ignacio, which wasn't too far away.\r\n\r\n[9:08 pm]\r\nas we reached the other side of town i noticed that there were no clouds anymore��� no rain, nothing. just as we were coming down the hill by san jose middle school i noticed a strange white orb in the sky that appeared to be moving. in the near distance was a plane that i could compare it to. they were completely different.\r\n\r\nas we got further down the hill my friend #1 shouts to everyone in the car. \r\n\r\n\"what is that!\"\r\n\r\nhe pointed right at the orb i was looking at. we decided to pull over at the school parking lot and watch. the orb was slowly moving in a straight line from the indian valley preserve, almost directly above us, towards the redwood highway. my friend #2 tells me to grab my camera. i rush to the trunk of the car and set it up. he parks his car and everyone gets out to watch.\r\n\r\ni begin recording around [9:10 pm]. i mention almost immediately that this could be the same thing, referring to the other sightings from july 14, 21, & 22. i then tell everyone to be quite and just listen. at 00:23 in the video you can hear the plane i was speaking of earlier. at 00:30 you can hear friend #3 say that right there is a plane and #1 saying that he could hear the plane over there. the orb itself was making no noise.\r\n\r\nfriend #3 then mentions that he say the light in a triangle just before, i replied, \"really?\" but i watched the light longer than him and saw no triangles or triangle formations.\r\n\r\nat 01:01 friend #1 says that it looks like one solid light and at 01:06 i reply that it is indeed one solid light.\r\n\r\nat around 01:10 in the video i begin to get really excited as i realize this is indeed another ufo. i ask everyone if they hear anything and then tell them to be quiet in the excitement. at 01:17 friend #2 mentions that there are no flashing lights and that he doesn't hear anything. there is no noise, he repeats.\r\n\r\ni then say that i too hear nothing. no noise. and its almost directly above us!\r\n\r\ni mention soon after (around 01:48 in the video) that i feel like i can reach out and touch it because it was so close to us and low to the ground.\r\n\r\nfrom 02:01 to 02:17 it appears to emit a blue aura which i saw with my own eyes and not just the camera. during the filming of this sighting, i periodically looked up with my own eyes then went back to filming. this is why the footage is a bit shaky at moments. but the blue aura was quite strange!\r\n\r\nat 02:39 it passes through a tree. \r\n\r\nat 3:04 i pass the camera to friend #3 so that i can spend the rest of the sighting watching the object with my own eyes.\r\n\r\nat 03:25 i ask if anyone saw a shape. i mentioned that i saw more of the ship but only the one light was showing, i was referring to the blue aura. friend #3 mentioned it looked like a jet at 03:28 and then that it looked like a jellyfish at 03:37. i don't think that friend #3 saw anything though. he has bad eyesight and has now mentioned the object to take on 3 different shapes.\r\n\r\nat 03:38 i ask \"how can this happen this often?\" referring to the fact that this is my 4th sighting since july 14 of the previous month in the same town.\r\n\r\ni ask for a timestamp at 03:43 and friend #2 mentions that it is [09:13 pm]\r\n\r\nat 04:31 in the video it reaches the horizon. we try to run back to see the ufo for a short while longer. i take back the camera and try to film it more. \r\n\r\nat 04:55 i stop recording. the next part of the video is us in the car trying to follow the object that is now out of sight.\r\n\r\n\r\nattached is the original footage, the enhanced footage, and a map of the flight path.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:06:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

observed what i at first thought was a seagull flying through the skies in front of me until it caught my attention by stopping and going backwards and hovering then going forward then stopping and going backwards again before taking off behind the trees out of sight. nothing else unusual was seen until approximately 10:45 p.M. that night when my son, justin, and i went for our nighttime jog at the bremerton highschool track nearby. we walked a lap before jogging and during the second lap we noticed a very bright, star-like object appear out of nowhere in the sky directly ahead of us, moving slowly east and changing directions coming right towards where we were at almost as though it knew we were there. it slowly approached and hovered right above us, glowing intensely for approximately 3 minutes before slowly moving northwesterly. justin videotaped the object as it approached us and hovered above us, until it could no longer be seen. about a couple minutes soon afterwards, a helicopter came from the direction the object appeared initially and a second helicopter approached from the direction where the object was last seen. two more helicopters were seen in the distance nearby. about 5 minutes later as we continued with our jog around the lap, we saw what i can only describe as an electrical arc \"smudge\" flashed in the sky to the right of us a short distance away. then an object appeared from where the flash was seen from the \"smudge\" and it slowly moved northeasterly and disappeared. sporadic flashes were seen and we observed 2 jets approaching quickly towards the area where the helicopters were at, which there were now at least 6-8 of them. as we were leaving, we observed another object moving in the skies while we were sitting in the car, so we decided to drive to an area without lights so we can pull over and watch the activity going on. we stood near the warren ave. bridge in a residential area by the waterside where we had a great view of the whole city. i am not exaggerating when i say that the scene now was like as though we were under attack. it looked like something huge was happening and the helicopters were the news crew filming. it was crazy. we then noticed a formation of 5 objects in a sloping pattern, equally distanced apart from each other. the slope was like the curve if you were to connect the dots to 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock, all the way up to 7 o.Clock on a clock face. it spanned about maybe 3-4 miles in length up in the sky. it was hard to tell exactly how long it was. and flashes of light were coming from the space between each object in the formation. it was not a huge craft. it appeared to just be a formation. flashes and sporadic fireballs in reds and blues appeared randomly and 1 stationary pulsating greenish white object hovering to the north very low, maybe treetops height, maybe only 2 miles away. the helicopters were hovering, seemingly observing these objects. there were about 4 jets in total that came to the area. objects appeared out of nowhere, disappeared and reappeared and some glowed intensely before rapidly ascending into the sky. we counted more than 20 objects in the area  not including the formation. we left after observing the action for a good hour. unfortunately our cell phones died. not sure if it had anything to do with phenomena. my phone had power but was not turning on. i was going to listen to music while jogging. i also have to mention a weird occurrence when we first got to the track, prior to our experiences. not sure if it is anything but it was kind of scary. when we stepped down into the field track from the entrance stairs, we saw a husky-build male walking slowly with his head down, looking at the ground. with the lights overhead we can only see his silhouette. we stood there as he approached near us, still walking in the lap looking down. i said, \"hello,\" to the man. he looked up but didn't say anything and he had an angry, almost menacing look on his face. he scowled at us and looked away, i told justin that maybe he had headphones on or something and just didn't hear us, though i could see that he didn't. my son asked me if we should just come back another night because he was somewhat nervous about being around that creepy man. i said we'd be fine. and when the guy was a short distance in front of us, we proceeded to walk around the lap to warm up. we spotted another hefty-looking silouhette of another possible male, sitting in the dark just ahead on the grass next to the track. we never saw this guy in detail. what was strange was the fact that as the first man neared where that guy sat, they seemed to have both just vanish. we were not too far behind them and i don't recall seeing the two men together at all. there was enough lighting to see but it is still dim there at night. nevertheless, we still would have been able to see them. we were keeping an eye on them just to be safe. we were hesitant to even be there after that creepy encounter when we first got there. i asked justin if he saw where they went to and he didn't. we don't know how they disappeared or where they went. it was unnerving. i'm thinking we're going to get jumped, attacked, or whatever. that first guy seemed like a mean person. not friendly at all. he wore regular jeans and a t-shirt. he didn't look like the typical person one would encounter doing laps around a track. and now we were thinking he's got an accomplice and they're both somewhere in the dark, watching us. but i'm telling you! i never took my eyes off of them. but they just seemed to have just vanished into thin air. i am a woman, in a dark place at night. i wasn't alone, but still, i was being very aware of my surroundings. my son and i were really tripping the whole time we were there. we were constantly looking all around us, expecting them to pop out at us at any given moment. and the other weird thing that night, was the fact that i was in the middle of telling justin a story about 2 ufos that swooped down fast and came right to me, and i was pointing to where they were at the time in the sky, and coincidentally, it was the same exact spot where the star-like object appeared and hovered over me and justin that night! the night's activity remained active even after my son dropped me off at my apartment. from the front patio, an object appeared and ascended slowly right behind the trees down the street, along with another helicopter. my neighbor came out to smoke a cigarette, and asked how my jog went with my son. i told her the crazy story and even pointed out the object just in front of us. she went to get her boyfriend, and they both witnessed the flashes, and objects appearing and disappearing, and moving in the skies and even the pulsating object that appeared from behind the trees. i told them about the 5 object formation and took them to the street to see if we can see it, and sure enough, there it was. they witnessed a few flashes and several objects, in the way i had described them happening. we observed the hovering object through my binoculars. it was pulsating green and white. and only through the binoculars, we also was able to see objects moving through the skies that we couldn't see with our naked eyes. as i write this report which is the 7th on the following day in the afternoon, there is a helicopter hovering above the highschool which is where justin and i went jogging. also observed a strange drone-like plane with a green nose, white body, flying directly overhead.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with

was sitting outside on the cordless phone. the night skies were clear and all that can be seen were stars, an occasional airplane and a satellite far off in the distance. \r\n\r\ni had first viewed this very bright and bold orange light that was just above the sea grass that borders the marsh. this grass is about 12ft tall and from my sitting position i would guess it was maybe 35 degrees or more from the horizon. just a guess not exactly sure the exact position. at first i thought i could have been a plane but the color was too bright and big to be that of a plane. the object moved from east to west and at times sped up and also stopped and hovered. then it would move again and eventually the light would dim and vanish. after the first light came several others. one at a time and some in groups of three or four. all totaling about maybe a dozen. some of these lights seemed to chase after one another. always moved in same direction from east to west. some of these lights again would move at a great rate of speed....Then stop and be motionless and then move again. one point was two of these lights hovering one above the other after the trailing light has chased and caught up to the one in front of it. \r\n\r\nthis all occurred for approx. 20-30 minutes and came in intervals. they all were in the same flight path or trajectory of their movement in the sky. all were not at the same altitude. i had no idea of what i was looking at and amazed at what i had seen. i remember seeing such a bright orange light such as this when i was just a small child perhaps 6-8 years old. all of these objects had either left at such a rate of speed that the lights dimmed and vanished or the bright light just disappeared completely like a light switch.","distance":"Over One

triangle in shape and the size of an aspirin with the binoculars  they appeared to look stationary in the sky.  so,  what i saw was 3 objects that were round balls of bright white light that would dim and blink off, but not at the same time and it appeared to have a rhythm.  the other 7 were separate and away from the rest which did the same but were not grouped together in any way.  \r\n\r\nat first i thought the 3 were stationary, but they were not they were moving north and east ultra slowly.  i live near camp gruber which is the training center for the national guard and wondered if perhaps they had something to do with this?\r\n\r\nthis did not bother me at all, after watching for around 1 hour i went to bed.  my digital camera's battery was needing a recharge so i did not get any pictures of this.  i decided to report this anyway.   during the night i got up and went to get a drink and there was nothing in the sky but stars at 3 am. \r\n\r\ni do believe i will watch the

as we were waiting at the light my wife spotted what she thought was a small black helicopter above and to the right of her/southeast and heading northeast.  she originally assumed it was trying to land, but then the object continued in the same direction apparently not wanting to land.  she thought i also had seen it, but i hadn't. she then alerted me to the fact that she had seen it and i looked directly ahead east and at a 30 degree angle above horizon it was only 2/10 a mile away.  it continued to glide in a northeast direction and about 200' above ground. i then went through the light straight instead of turning to get a better view.  this was on impulse as it would have been better to turn north towards highway 1-76.  this was do to the fact that the object continued northeast and out of view when i pulled into a dead end parking lot.  i then went north to pursue this object.  just two blocks north we spotted the object again heading in the same direction. we were on pecos street bridge this object continued towards a local gardening store paulinos  as it reached this area it stopped and returned slowly in our direction and at the same time appeared to change shape and became a flat upward thin line then reformed and continued toward our direction northwest.  it then slowly changed direction back to the northeast heading it originally had.  it was then gliding directly next to 1-76.  it looked as if it had attempted to land at one point not far from 1-76 and 1-25 confluence coming no more than 40' feet from ground.  granted we were now watching it at probably close to a mile from us.  so distance from ground would be hard to guess.  it then slowly glided back in northeast direction were we continued to observe it gliding along 1-76 a couple more miles.  this object seemed to be under control.  we assumed it was either a small manmade craft or balloons possibly but the object was not making a sound and it had a definite path unlike a bunch of balloons.  it never accelerated rapidly but did turn/dive and rotate.  when rotating it seemed to morph into a thin black line.  most of the time it looked like a snowman with no head and solid black.  this object was very intriguing, so much so that i instantly had to pursue it.  going in the wrong direction from what i should have just to try seeing it better.","distance":"21-100

knox. i kept noticing what appeared to be stars darting around the sky. i focused on a particularly bright one and it began to move. i couldn't tell exactly how far from earth it was, whether it was in our atmosphere or just above it, but i could make out the object very clearly regardless. the object would come to a complete stop in the sky before darting either forwards, backwards, or sideways, and then returning to a complete stop. it seemed to be pulsating, with every color in the spectrum being emitted from the craft. i don't know exactly how large the craft was, but it appeared to be roughly the size of a small plane. after it would move, a faint trail could be seen behind it briefly before it dissipated. i have been waiting to see a ufo for about a decade now, and i was freaking out. i ran inside and told my mom, \"hurry, come outside right now, i have to show you something.\" i came back outside with her and the object was still near the same spot where i had seen it before. i told my mom to look at the light and follow it closely. she observed the same thing that i did. she said it looked like, \"minnows in a stream\". i noticed several other objects in the surrounding sky imitating the same behavior. my mother also saw them. i am 27 years old with excellent eyesight, and she is 59 with pretty bad eyesight, and she could still clearly see this craft moving in the sky. it was most certainly not a plane or jet or helicopter or any craft known to the people of this world. after observing the craft for several minutes, we went inside. i came back outside about a half hour later, and the original craft i had been watching was gone, but i noticed several others. i was overwhelmed with excitement and did not sleep at all that night.

why did it not seem to mind that we were watching it even when i made it very obvious that we did see it? and why was it moving so slow and seem to be sticking to the south side of the highway the entire time?
