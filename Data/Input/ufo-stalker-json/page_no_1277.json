looking north west towards the foothills of the olympic mountains, a starlike object traveling east directly above me. it was completely silent. it traveled in a straight line. it appeared to get quite a bit brighter at about 3 minutes into my observation. my husband, son, and myself all said, \"wow, whoah, weird!\" when the star-like object brightened. it traveled east towards edmonds and we watched it for as long as we could see it. aprox 5-6 minutes. as i watched, i thought for sure it would start to flicker or waiver, and tell me it was a chinese lantern or similar object. it did not. it was not a lantern. it was not a plane. it was not a helicopter. it was not a home-made ufo either, made from straws, garbage bags and birthday candles either. it was an unexplainable event with a ufo, plain and simple. i saw an object very similar to this one 2 blocks up the street from me a few weeks ago. i was not alone during that event either and had witnessed the same star-like object, silently moving from the north to the east. it was way below the cloud line when first observed as was this one tonight. i think i am pretty sure that what i saw was a rarity.","distance":"501 Feet -

because we have beautiful skies here in co and i love to look at the stars. a plane flew overhead and we both noticed the object at the same time. it was almost directly overhead, and heading north. it was extremely bright and no flashing lights. my friend said \"is that a satellite??\" i said maybe, but after only a second it was clear to both of us it was not a satellite. it was moving slower than an airplane, but was way too bright to be a satellite and seemed to be pulsating and zigzagging very slightly. as we watched it we both distinctly noticed it change direction from north to northeast, making a wide but very noticeable curve. it occurred to me to pull out my phone and record it. in the video you can see that it is much brighter than the stars, but that there are no flashing lights like a plane. i zoomed in on it and it is then that we saw it was a round sphere or orb that was pulsating in different metallic colors. you can here my friend faintly point out in the background that it is zigzagging, though in the video it is hard to tell the craft's movement from my own hands shaking the camera. near the end of the video i get the nearby building's roof and light, and though dimmed by the light on the building, you can see then how big and bright the object is. i didn't realize the camera stopped recording as we ran around the side of the building to continue watching it. it moved into a patch of clouds that was in the northeast sky, and was clearly above them, though i still couldn't guess the altitude. we watched it until it was too far away to see and too much clouds in that area of sky.\r\nmy friend and i are convinced we saw something really strange
