military aircraft don't reflect light like that, and there were no navigation lights. also, i have lived here all my life and we do have 17 wing air force base here, but i have never seen a line of helicopters travelling together.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":49478,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":49.9037541,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-08052013-0006","longitude":-97.1298837,"occurred":1375588980000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Manitoba","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Bullet,   Missile,   Disc,   Oval,   Saturn-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1375691190000,"summary":"Driving home from cottage saw four lights in the sky moving slowly in a line and sometimes vertically stacked","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/49478_submitter_file1__20130803212457.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/49478_submitter_file2__20130803212424.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/49478_submitter_file3__20130803210529.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/49478_submitter_file4__20130803210456.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/49478_submitter_file5__20130803210524.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/49478_submitter_file6__20130803210455.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Winnipeg, Manitoba","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:276137"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Emmaus","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"August 4, 2013 approx 9:30 pm est. my self and a friend saw two orange glowing orbs in the south east sky moving more south and upward the two orbs stayed on the same plane and moved in lateral line maintain same distance  appeared to be approx half mile distance between the two the one on the left dispersed first and approx 30 seconds later the one to the right dispersed.  about 5 min later another orange glowing orb took the same exact path moving from the south east to the  upward to the south and appearing to disperser in the same location as the other two. each event lasted approx 3 mins. \r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":49477,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.5466621,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08052013-0005","longitude":-75.4948102,"occurred":1375677000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1375689547000,"summary":"8/4/13 ~ 9:30 pm est 3 orange glowing orb lights in south east sky lehigh valley pa","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"18049","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Emmaus, Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:276138"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Kids were in the backyard looking at stars. came in told me to come look. it is very dark in our backyard at night. if you look at venus right now it is huge and in the west. this light was four times as big as venus. it seemed to be as close as an airplane in its path. the object moved in quick movements and then slowed. made small movements in different directions. it almost looked like a someone learning to drive because of the sudden changes. the object went from the south over denair to the east a  bit and then north to about hickman and then off eastward. i have seen my share of strange here in the valley of california. this may just have been something new from area 51. who knows. if it was, whatever it is, has some skills.

are by tunnelton which is in lawrence county. he said there were some tunnels close by that you drive through and that is was kinda spooky. so i said ok lets do it. we started driving looking for these tunnels. i remember it was around 2 a.M. because i looked at the radio clock and said something like its getting late. are we going to stay out all night? my friend said we will start back home when we find a tunnel. i don't remember exactly how i saw the two objects that i saw, but i do remember the sky being clear and rounding a corner. i am not sure how far away the two objects were, but they appeared to be as big as a softball or basketball from my angle. one of the objects was blue. i am not sure if the whole thing was blue, but it was glowing blue. the other object was red and it was growing red. they were disc shaped and appeared to hovering. they eventually started moving and it seemed like they were circling each other. both objects started flashing lights. i do not think they were in a pattern, but i honestly do not know. i was in shock. i knew these objects were not normal. the red object eventually spun like a top and disappeared. the blue object soon followed. it looked like they spun and flew off, but they flew off so fast that i couldn't tell if they really did or just disappeared. i looked at my friend after all of this because we were in complete silence while we watched. he said he tried talking to me during the ordeal, but it was like he couldn't talk. i don't remember feeling this way, but he said he did. i do remember feeling like a numb feeling and feeling like my thought process had slowed down. i have only told my wife and my parents about this night. of course, no one believes me, but i know that i saw something special this night. this

like clockwork i see a white light streaking across skys very high. satellites??\r\nhave never posted any sightings before & doing so to see if others see  same & white lights  streaking across sky's in early am. is there a satellite path  over the cape going from approx west to east at 3-4 am due to air base? \r\nlike other sighting i know helicopters as they fly right over my house. the orange ball was not one,  or local air field. never seen anything like it in my 15 years  area. by time i raced to get ipad to record, 30 secs ,  it had disappeared in east. ironically 2  white lights 15 min apart similar to early am ones had never seen  before & i stargaze a lot with ipad app.\r\n","distance":"Over One

i've been aboard since childhood. familiar: waking hours.\r\n\r\nwritten report available & drawings. original report went to researcher to share. since then, memory of other parts of encounter have returned & i continue to add those into report.  condensed:\r\n* winter of '92. time: 5:30 pm. duration: 2 1/2 hours. 2nd floor of home. n bedrm. w window. awake. alone in home. finished chores/practice downstairs. taking up laundry. held in a triangular force field. room electric feel. compelled to window. held at feet. looked sw. 1st thought of as star. a tel/comm asked (male): \"would you like us to come closer?\"  said, \"no\" but it came anyway. bright light. familiar, round, silver, gray saucer in front of me through the window. open section in dome. could see: 5 entities. 1 tall in center and 4 small - 2 on either side of tall.(description in report)was not scared because this was a familiar craft and i figured that this encounter would be o.K. but i did not like being held in place in my room.\r\n* inside of craft: noticed small e's had robes. appeared mechanical.(description/ht. bld. \" in report)\r\nuncertain how to describe this even now: center of craft had some kind of hardened gel substance. believe military male was in center and that was the 'voice' of tel/comm at first communication. tall e was a 'see through' and believe it was designed to pilot the craft. 4 digits. 3 of which were on a round, black ball with a type of gel on a 'flight panel.'\r\n* back in room: conversation of a 'faith' nature.(in report)\r\nchronological order of next events are unsure to me. \r\n1. aboard the craft. handled by mechanicals. taken to the gel center wall.(measures & # in report)\r\n2. conversation with military but no recall. conversation with pilot 'see through' entity. after approx. 10 min. it began to sweat and i could no longer be near. noticed importance of that protocol/distance...As well as remarking on it's physical make up which opened up the door for conversation.\r\n3. listened to a conversation between tall e and military but no recall.\r\n4. encounter with 'see through' e & some kind of circular energy beam which was stopped due to a voice spoken to the entity.\r\n5. walking perimeter of craft after being taken to the 'engine room. seeing a smaller, square version of the larger energy room/propulsion. reminded me of how we run our electrical units throughout a house. outside perimeter was a beautiful hallway. soft light emanated from sections. cool. rounded center section. different from other crafts. walking above the floor was similar. electric/mag force of some kind, but again familiar since childhood...That is how you walk...As if on a 4-6\" carpet. pushed back from surgical room by tall golden. observed a conversation between military & e in a separate room. (believe now that the military male was not to have sent comm to me. was allowed on craft and knew the species, tall e's. however, i believe they were there to pick up a young child who now works in a major area of work as do the other children. and, the us military male was in training)  \r\n6. viewing of the underbelly. 3 rings. blue. 2 rings close & clockwise outer rim. inner counter. pulse: tempo of qtr. at 52. largo. pitch:g below mid. c. freq. of 196.00. lights mix/pulse together & random. calm.\r\n* asked if i was interested in a ride or to see how it worked. \"yes.\"\r\nplaced in 'engine room' or propulsion area. in front of large, glass wall. energy components. intelligence. comm came in to area the the craft had to leave due to tracking. energy components reacted with intelligence within the gel. (drawing & distinction between energy components in report)\r\n* a gel used later in '97 encounter for prep. which i was placed in for travel. believe now: gel aboard this craft used in conjunction with the 'control panel' as seen with the 'see trough' entity as it placed digits on the black ball on the panel on other level. in direct conjunction with telepathic ability between pilot & energy components.\r\n* craft took off in silence after placing me back in room.  remained held in place in triangular force field at the window area as if weights were on the feet until the craft was gone. \r\n* checked the time. it was now 8:00. 2 1/2 hours had passed. \r\n* went outside. no craft. silence. no sound whatever. not even crickets or cars. returned to house. \r\n*several years later, i began to write and research looking for similar encounters of waking hour contact since childhood from other people.  contact still remains to this day. finally taking the time to send in a report, even though i have been writing them and sharing and speaking when asked. i am a member of mufon and working towards becoming a field investigator. it was important to sit down and review the cms report, finally fill one out, and become acquainted with this form.\r\n* your question of #5 - describe your feelings, etc. they vary. emotions, reactions vary even though i've had contact and been aboard these crafts since childhood. i don't understand it all and certainly don't know all the answers. what changed my life and moved me forward after '92 was the call and encouragement that came from the researcher i contacted and sent this origianl report into. education/protocols of contact/propulsion observations/amazement/wonder/joy/excitement of travel...Those are my feelings, reactions, and actions and will remain so with every encounter.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Window(s)","flightPath":"Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":49463,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.00498447850443,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08042013-0037","longitude":-81.97667980052097,"occurred":721987200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1375673277000,"summary":"5:00-8:30. held in triangle force. aboard. entities: see trough (pilot ),mechanicals or robotics,tall goldens, us military. believe they were there for a pick up & train for military. conversations. shown 'engine room.'tracked.Tone & lights of underbelly.","tags":["triangle","lights"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"33803","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":7565,"locationName":"Lakeland, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:276151"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Vancouver","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was rollerblading in a tennis/basketball court in granville island vancouver bc around 10:00 pm, the lights went out and it was time for me to take off my roller blades. so i sat down on a bench and proceeded to take them off in the dark.  a low flying plane caught my attention and i looked up also noticing an interesting looking star just above it, so i watched the star for between 5 and 10 minutes.   as i was looking at the star a bright orange light attracted my eyes off to the side and that's when i saw 3 illuminating objects intermingling together and around each other.  within a couple of seconds two ufo's disappeared leaving one on its own hovering what seemed to be as high as the low flying plane above me.  it sat for a few seconds and then glided in a descending arch downward and over the building behind me with no sound.  as the object was descending i perceived it to be larger than a plane (longer, wider, and thicker). it looked higher up than the plane to start with but descended to what i perceived to be closer than the plane and possibly just above the short building behind me. my perception of height and size may or may not be accurate due to my basic understanding of size and distance, but it looked close to me and large.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":49462,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":49.270622,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-08042013-0036","longitude":-123.134741,"occurred":1374815400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"British Columbia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Egg,   Oval,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1375671247000,"summary":" 3 glowing peachy orange oval shaped ufo's decended quickley from the sky above my head and flew togehter in a intermingling formation, two disappeared and one hovered above my head and decended slowley down in an arch and above the building behind me.","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/49462_submitter_file1__UFOSightingdrawndiagram1.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/49462_submitter_file2__UFOSightingdrawndiagram2.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"V6H 3R8","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":9,"locationName":"Vancouver, British Columbia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:276152"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Gillette","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"There were four of us standing on my back porch when a large, increasingly bright orange/white sphere appeared in the western sky. fly right at us about 3 seconds then veered off north and then just vanished. then again alter that night we saw another similar light in the exact same spot that flew right over us, that had a smaller green light around it that flew right over us then disappeared with a plane in the sky headed to the airport.

beam was cast upon all of us from above.  the beam was so white and so bright that everyone seemed as if they were glowing.  the light was so radiant that nothing could be seen beyond the beam.  \r\n\r\nthe craft was apparently directly above us.  i remember trying to look up, but the light was so bright that i could not see anything but the light.  we were all terrified of the craft and no one knew what was going on.  no one heard any type of noise that would indicate a helicopter engine and it was much too low to be a blimp.  i would estimate the height of the craft to be perhaps twice as high as the tree tops.  i remember us running to our grandmother's home and trying to hide on her covered porch.  after a short duration, the craft extinguished the beam and headed off in a northeasterly direction.  i remember the craft seemed to move at an incredible speed after the beam was disengaged.  \r\n\r\neven though this craft was incredibly close, i did not get a clear look at

have no idea why this craft shinned a light upon us.  were they looking for something or were they just curious?  we were all just children at the time, but i have a vivid memory of what it was like to be in that beam.  it was scary.  we haven't talked about that event much since then, but maybe it's time for others to know what happened to us.  for me, it's not a question whether or not to

there was a large field on the edge of town.  people began gathering on the edge of the filed and watched a ufo.  the authorities were notified, apparently by those in the surrounding communities as well.  we were told it was a weather balloon.  may have been covered by the ithaca journal newspaper.\r\n\r\ni had a second experience in the fall of 1976.  it was approx. 10:00 pm and i was driving in a vw beetle with my baby toward ithaca from candor, ny.  i was just coming into danby, ny and noticed a truck broken down on the opposite side of the road.  a moment later i saw a white, glowing orb that seemed to be skimming the tops of the trees on the hill before me.  from a distance it looked like car headlights, but it was just above the trees, and there are no roads up there.  the next thing i knew it was next to my car, traveling right next to me on the passenger side, going the same speed as the car, and had not changed in size even though it was very close.  it was maybe 10-15 feet from the car.  then it just disappeared.\r\n\r\nboth of these thing happened in close proximilty to ithaca, ny where cornell university is located.  although permission has been denied to build nuclear power plants there, there is a nuclear reactor at cornell most people don't know about.  i don't know if this may be the attraction for ufos.\r\n\r\nif you have any questions at all, please contact me.  i've wanted to tell someone about these events for a long time.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

this may be traceable in that it occurred in what should be a traceable address. please note, the witness described this with limited english, but he did seem genuinely unnerved and was hoping that i would tell him that what had happened was common in america.\r\n\r\nwitness (name eduardo) and i both belong to the 24 hour fitness health club and mainly use the hot tub in order to treat long standing injuries to leg and back. recently, the hot tub at the santa barbara location was closed due to renovations. eduardo initially began telling me, as we both soaked, that he needed the tub badly enough that he had gone to several other locations for 24hr fitness in order to use their hot tubs. however, while in san francisco, which is where his parents live, he had a very strange experience. \r\n\r\napparently he looked up and went to what he thought was the location of a 24hr fitness in san francisco. when he got there, without noticing anything out of the ordinary he simply opened the door of the location and walked inside. however, after entering he was struck by the fact that building seemed completely empty and only a few lights were on. believing he'd made a mistake he turned around and attempted to open the door he had just come through only to find it locked. a bit disconcerted he walked towards a light that was on across the room and called out several times. suddenly out of nowhere there were two beings standing near him. he described them as tall, extremely thin, bone white and with inhumanly large eyes. he even held up circled thumb and forefinger to indicate how much larger than normal eyes they were. he described them as looking like dead people. they both wore institutional green coveralls with a breast patch that read \"engineering\". he remarked that the coveralls seemed extremely old. they were not terribly polite and told him he was not supposed to be in the building. they led him to another door in the building, not the one he had entered through, and unceremoniously saw him through it. he emerged into an alley that seemed to have an unusually high number of homeless people in it. he described himself as quite frightened by the whole experience, and to this observer seemed sincerely upset by the experience.\r\n\r\nthis strikes me as worthy of a follow up as the address for 24 hour fitness in san francisco should be readily found and a visit to the facility seems warranted. this person has no desire for publicity and neither do i.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":49450,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.786921,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08042013-0024","longitude":-119.4108124,"occurred":1375167600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1375658801000,"summary":"Man
