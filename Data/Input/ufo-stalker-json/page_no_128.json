washington state taking photos of the views around the mt olympus area. it wasn't until the next day when reviewing pictures that i saw something i can not identify. i did not see this orb shaped object when originally shooting the mountains, it was discovered the next day to my surprise. \r\n\r\ni was shooting with a nikon d-610 (24 mp camera) and a nikon 70-300 mm zoom lens with a nikon lens hood on the lens. i was shooting at a very fast speed (1/1600 sec @ f-8  iso @ 317 ) and my zoom lens was at the 140 mm range when shot taken. as you can see, the orb shaped object shadows are in the same position as the shadows on the mountain (on right side), so the light source was coming from same direction. if you tilt your monitor up and down slightly you can see the orb has depth due to the shadowing around the edges. it appears to me that the orb is further away than the mountain peak, so shows distance. \r\n\r\ni've shot photography for many years and have shot over 500,000 images in my time. this image of an orb shaped object is the first time i have seen this type of image in one of my photos. it was not a blotch or spot on my lens as my other pictures do not have this orb shape in them and i took a lot of photos that day. it's not a sun flare, nor the moon, a bird, bug, plane or bear throwing a snowball in the air. not saying this is a definitely a ufo, but seems very odd to me and would like feedback/input.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":87170,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":47.9331457,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10062017-0017","longitude":-123.4096268,"occurred":1506608100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1507322121000,"summary":"Orb

which was about a quarter mile away. as we interred the area if the cliffs i noticed a flash of white light that came from my left,  i instinctly loomed to my left.  i saw 2 creatures setting about a foot apart inside of a craft.  they we're with in 30 ft if us and got closer as i passed by.  there seemed to  be no windshield as we would call it.  they we're dressed in a light green matching

me,  and in a flash,  they disappeared.  i saw thr small control panel  his eyes in detail,  his left hand, their slim body. i saw inside the vessel and was amazed with how beautiful it was. i could

being stationary and had no wings were the fact a white water like exhaust sprayed out the rear , which seemed to be like like water but thinner and gassier.???\r\ni watched it for a few seconds my wife and my neighbors back was to it. i said loudly \"what the ??!! is that\" as soon as i said those words the light went from the front window to a second one then third then off. leading from front to back in a quick succession. my wife turned around as i pointed , the object was still about 25' off the ground but it had excelled so fast spraying out the white , water like spray and  moving at an extreme rate of speed!!\r\ni said again what was that my wife making fun of me went o my are you going to say that was a ufo . the whole time it sat stationary it was pointed at the house fire. \r\ni have no idea what else this could have been??  it was about a week before thanksgiving an exact date probably could be attainable due to the house fire. it made absolutely no sound and put off no wind when it left!! i've thought about this for years i just thought i would let someone know. thanks","distance":"21-100

wife, daughter, and i had just returned from a trip to florida. the car was parked in the airport’s long term parking and the sky was clear. it was probably around 5-7pm so still light out. we had just left the winding highway roads around the airport and were driving east on i-90 towards chicago. directly in front of us, in the distance, i could see a low, bright light over the highway. i remember thinking, “interesting that that plane is flying directly in parallel with the highway and so low.” i assumed it was just an airplane lined up to land at the airport and that it would quickly turn off from the seemingly straight path it was taking above the highway. however, as i continued to drive, it seemed to continue it’s straight path directly towards us. i mentioned something about it to my wife but she didn’t seem interested (i think she was distracted on her phone, maybe texting her parents that we were on the ground heading home). as we got closer to it it remained in place, and i remember thinking, “wow, that is low!” as we got closer, i noticed it was not moving but stationary above the highway, with cars zipping along under it in both directions, as if nothing were there. as we drove under it, i looked up, leaning up a bit to look through the windshield in front of me. as we passed under, it was approximately 20 feet above the highway and it looked as if it were man-made. by that i mean it had large pipes, or ducts, and other mechanical-ish type looking parts. it must have been huge as i only was able to see a small part or section as we went under. after this, the strangest feeling happened. all of a sudden, i had this feeling of elation and felt as if i was the best and cleverest driver in the world, with the ability to quickly, and without effort, maneuver the car in and out of traffic like a pro (almost felt like flying). i think i looked back in the rear view mirror a couple times as the light diminished as we drove further away from it. afterwards, and over the last many years, i still go over it in my mind and am still mystified by it.","distance":"20 Feet or

vivid sunset. i took several pictures over several minutes because it was fading fast and then went inside to look them over. upon analyzing them, i noticed that in the first photo there appeared to be two lights in the sky and i did not remember seeing them when i snapped it. furthermore i was using my cell phone and i would never attempt to take, or want to take, a picture of a plane in the sky, it simply would not turn out. also odd was the fact that the lights did not appear in subsequent picture taken from near the same vantage point, photos more west and in the direction the lights appeared to be moving. fact, we do have an airport west of us and planes come from that direction and make a 180 near our house and head back west to the airport to land. these lights were to the east of our house and maybe moving westward and i have never seen low planes taking that path. commercial jet planes do come from that direction, but all you see is their trail. we do see helicopters from time to time but they usually move north to south or vise versa. but if these two lights would have been helicopters, i would definitely have remembered the noise. and i've never seen two so close together. also had the lights been visible to me i would have centered them in the frame. so in conclusion, i was and still am perplexed by, one, the fact that these two low in the sky, bright lights were not visible to me when i took the picture. two, that i do  not remember any engine noises and three, that the lights did not appear in any other shots.  \r\n    it was difficult to answer many of the questions above because i didn't view the lights personally but saw them in the photo. i didn't see how they moved or how fast, if they hovered or see them disappear other than the fact the lights did not appear in any other photos. probably something easily explained like two planes, but the fact they were so close together seemed odd and i would have remembered the noise of their engines too. so i thought it merited another opinion.\r\n\r\ndescription of photos included:\r\n\r\npicture 1: first shot taken and original format.\r\npicture 2: same shot as above but cropped.\r\npicture 3:

to be traveling from the south-east toward north west. just as she made reference to the tremendous speed of the object, it just disappeared. we continued to look to see if it reappeared but it did not. the sky was completely clear with no clouds visible at all. there area where the light was observed was not obstructed by  trees, structures or other obstacles that might block the view of the object. we live within 50-60 miles of atlanta's hartsfield international airport and are very familiar with   the normal air traffic, aircraft marker lights, strobes, etc. this object was a goldfish yellow light, constant brightness with no blinking lights on or adjacent to it. we are certain that it was not a meteor or \"shooting star\". there was no trail or \"tail\" behind the object. it appeared to be traveling about twice as fast as a normal aircraft during the time it was visible.
