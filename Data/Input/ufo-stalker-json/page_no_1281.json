shoot straight up then back down then left and right realizing this was not a plane nor a satellite. this lasted over a half hour. then about 20 minutes into watching a second light which flashed quickly like an airplane dropped in our of nowhere right above the trendline much closer than the first one moving rapidly up and down the tree line to the top n bottom of the trees but never appearing to touch ground. last night august 2nd again we were having a cigarette by my truck when another flash came first the trees the first flash was red and caught my attention. but then it flashed black-and-white like the last time and i thought to myself oh it's a plane . my boyfriend saw one flash n heard me say it's just a plane n looked away however when it flashed again white but all the way to the end of the tree line i realized it was too fast for a plane and in that moment it now flashed back to the middle of the trees it had changed directions super fast so i knew it was the same thing from last week.I got back in my truck and my bc came to my window as we discussed what i saw. all of a sudden i heard a loud knocking on my passenger window and it was completely black out . i was completely freaked out n did not turn to see what it was but my be could not see it anyways. i asked him should i lock it but i think he was freaked out to. just lasted about 30 seconds then stopped. it did have a hum noise as if my window lock was being pushed. we finally looked n saw nothing. we decided it was a good idea to go in for the night.","distance":"101-500

the ground and into the sky at an astounding speed. it went in a diagonal line, with no change in direction. as it shot to the sky, we watched it as it went farther and farther and eventually faded from view. we were astonished at the time but we quickly dismissed it as a satellite or some sort of man made thing. the next morning i looked for any satellite launches that occurred and could find

minute period.  we had just returned home from walking our dog.  all were traveling in a straight line east, taking 20-30 seconds to go from overhead to the horizon.\r\n\r\nthey were vaguely round amber lights. all identical.  no shape was discernible.  i had a good pair of binoculars and followed #5 for nearly 30 seconds without being able to make out a source of this light or any recognizable shape of the light.  the lights did not flash or blink, and we heard nothing but the crickets.  they sometimes flickered near the horizon as they went through cloud cover.\r\n\r\nthe first two flew very close to each other.  in fact, our impression was that they were the leading and tailing light of an airplane, since the second flowed closely behind the first (though as i said the color was wrong, and they were not blinking).  we were left perplexed, because while the speed and brightness suggested a low-flying aircraft, we should have heard it at that height.  \r\n\r\nthe other three lights were distinctly singular.  they did not apparently follow the same exact flight path as the first two, but did fly west to east.  the third came less than a minute later.  the last 2 came separately  2 or 3 minutes later.  all flew at a fairly uniform, constant speed.\r\n\r\nit was night, but no stars were visible because of clouds.  the source of the light was not very diffuse, so it

i would of heard a helicopter even with headphones on. but after i got out from under route 83 now in the clarendon hills swimming pool parking lot i looked up and saw this thing hovering not far away. since i didn't have my iphone to record it i just kept moving along on my bike never getting off while glancing up at it at the same time. i totally was not afraid at all. it could of been 8 or 10 stories high the size of one of those recycle bins. it was a darkish greyish color but as i was studying it i could see a hint of red. i think the light was at the bottom of the thing but now i don't remember the light as bright or obvious like when i first saw it and looked up. i think it was a red light i saw for sure when i first looked up before going under the route 83 street. it was hovering and bouncing around but totally staying in the same spot and i think it could sometimes move a little to the left or right or wiggle around. but what i totally remember for sure is that it was really moving around a lot bouncing around. it would do a bounce. it looked too low to be a chineese lantern and too high to be a remote control toy. and who in the world would put something almost directly above route 83. it was basically by route 83 close to the clarendon hills swimming pool and bsnf railroad tracks and again i was riding my bike through the parking lot as i kept glancing up at it. i dont know why i didn't get off my bike maybe cause i was upset i didn't have my iphone. when i got over a block away from it i glanced back and could see it bouncing around in the same spot. i wasn't afraid at all. i felt normal like it was just the oddest thing. actually i felt excited too because i thought about ufo write away. i really think though that if i would of stopped and watched it i would of felt more afraid. but if i would of had my iphone on me i would of recorded it. if i was to see it again i know i would be able to rule in or rule out chineese sky lantern.

p.M. on august 1, 2013.  i was facing the western sky and usually stargaze because of the excellent view from that vantage point.  while walking west i observed about 8 star-like, yellowish-white objects with blinking or flashing orange auras on top.  these objects were in a semi-circular formation, high in the sky, with two or three of them hanging lower, right above the tree line.  the objects seemed to be hanging in the sky for a short time, and then slowly started traveling east toward our home.  i called out to my boyfriend through the screen door; he also observed the objects, although by that time, did not see as many because the unusual, lighted objects started to drift farther apart as they came closer to us.  we were mystified as to what the flying objects were, and became excited and curious.  we reasoned together and then ruled out all known aircraft.  the objects were flying at about the same altitude as a helicopter would travel, with flashing orange auras on top.  there were absolutely no discernible sounds coming from the mysterious aircraft.  my boyfriend managed to snap a few pictures of them with his cellphone as they flew over our house, but for some reason the images appear blurry and do not do much justice to what we were witnessing.  the strange objects continued traveling east and began to disappear, one by one, getting smaller while going straight up at a high rate of speed.  the objects would appear smaller and smaller and emit a small red flash right before disappearing into the night sky.  a few objects traveled into the eastern sky and became small before vanishing with a tiny red flash.  the whole incident was over in less than five minutes.  i went indoors and called my daughter, and asked her to comb the internet to see if anyone else saw anything.  i was searching the internet today (8/2/2013) and found your site, so i decided to note my observations.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

the sudden, i woke slightly, only remembering being pulled out of my window, and down the pacific-electric trail. i felt something holding me my under my arms, but nothing was there. i was immobilized. i was positioned upright. \r\ni kept falling in and out of consciousness. i was being pulled down the trail slowly, then gained incredible speed. no one was on the path, but apparently someone was coming towards us because i then was swept up quickly. i don't remember anything after that until i woke on a metal table.\r\nmy arms, feet and head were all held against the table with some type of nerve device.\r\nit's hard to describe, but my outer wrists were pressed against a small plate which would not allow me to move. it was something that tapped into my nerves and sent signals to my brain, which wouldn't allow me to move. i remember squirming a lot, with my head and my temples were getting sore.\r\ni kept waking and falling back asleep.\r\nthey tried to keep me out, but i'm stubborn. i kept waking up. \r\ni saw a couple of your typical looking aliens off to the side of me, about 15 feet away. they were looking at each other, then back at me.\r\ni couldn't tell if they were doctors or nurses. they were short, around 5', with large, dark eyes.\r\ni fell asleep again.\r\nnext thing, i'm sitting in a chair and there's an alien sitting across from me. \r\nshe was talking to me, but not verbally.\r\nshe was tapped into my thoughts, and therefore i was tapped into hers.\r\nshe kept thinking, \"you're ok. we're not going to hurt you. we're all done now. your'e fine.\" i felt like she was very compassionate and kind.\r\nas she was thinking this, i could see into her mind and i knew they could hear her thoughts in the mother ship, above us so she had to be careful what she said to me. she seemed intimidated.\r\ni got the feeling i had been in one of their ships before...That this was like a \"follow-up\".\r\ni felt as though something was put in or taken out of my stomach.\r\ni could see the mother ship (above us) and the medical ship (we were in, but much smaller) in her head. we were hovering, all lights out on the outside, slightly above the tree line.\r\nshe was considered a peon worker, even though she was a nurse.\r\nshe had bug-like features, with fillers to the right and left of her head. her skin was the texture of a snake, but all grey. she didn't have abnormally large eyes, just medium, but larger than mine.\r\nshe was part human, from what i could see in her mind.\r\ni got a great look at the exterior of the ships and they were shaped like scarab beatles (oval, with a oval section on the top of each). so, maybe the egyptians didn't love the actual scarab beatle. maybe they had seen ships shaped like the ones i saw.\r\nnext, i passed out and woke up and was instructed, in my head-no one was there to go inside this large, bright room. there were other humans in there, all between 45-55, which i thought was odd. \r\ni was told to go to an area that had two liquids (one blue and the other orange), which i was to mix together and drink. i had scarring from struggling on the table...It was really bad on both sides of my temples.\r\ni drank the liquid and could not stop. i was craving it. the liquid was to wipe out our memory and heal our wounds. the combination worked quickly.\r\ni said to the people around me, \"i was abducted. were you also?\" they looked at me like i was crazy and said, \"no, they hadn't been.\"\r\ni could tell they had already forgotten.\r\nnext thing, i woke up in my bed. my arms were crossed over my chest, like a mummy, and i had pillows on either side my head.\r\ni never sleep like that.\r\ni woke up and it was all so real.\r\nthe next day, i searched the computer to see if there had been any ufo sightings in my area and there had been.\r\ni told my kids about it, but was embarrassed to talk to anyone else.\r\nit felt so real, but maybe it wasn't. \r\ni must sound nuts.\r\ni wanted to see if i can be hypnotized and find out if it really happened to me.\r\ni'm not a crazy person.\r\ni'm pretty boring and normal.\r\ni could have someone sketch what she looked like, but if you hypnotize me it may have more detail than what i can recall at this time.\r\n","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":49395,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.1117989,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08022013-0022","longitude":-117.5864784,"occurred":1346828400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1375493428000,"summary":"Larger

my blu-ray player, a tiny red dot on my tv (indicating they were off), and off in the kitchen, our microwave was displaying the time. i was facing away from the window when i saw a bright green light fill the room. i looked out the window behind me, but there was no source of the light. behind my house about 100 feet away is our town hall, and there was one white street light on, and nothing else. i proceeded to look around the room for any source of the light, and as i turned back to the window, the light disappeared. although the incident only 60-90 seconds (i estimate about 75), when i looked back at the time, it was a good 15 minutes later than when i had just looked around the room. i suddenly felt very tired, and proceeded to fall asleep. i haven't experienced such a thing since.","distance":"101-500

was quite bright and it exhibited only a singe rotation.  while i have no way of verifying the height of the object, my impression was that it was very, very high in the sky.  it appeared to be a very bright, powerful beacon of light (brighter than the visible stars around it) but there was no ambient light observed around me that would have been given off by the

optic's gen 3 auto-gated night vision goggles. that evening , i received a 5x magnification lens ( viewing distance is 1.5 to 3 miles ), in which i adapted to my nv goggles. i also have a greem (532nm) laser pointer with a beam distance of over 30 miles. also a night optics k-2 infared adapter with adjustable beam. from 11:00 p.M. on tuesday july 30th to $;00 a.M. july 31st; i observed 2 craft descend west of east northport in the town of greenvale, to the ground. one hovered, while the second landed. the 2 were in those positions for about an hour. i think someone got a visit or was abducted. using my laser , i was signalling the hovering disc-shaped craft. it would rise up above the tree line , flash a few lights at me ; signaling they knew, i'm there and they acknowledge my observation. then descend again. during the interim , i scanned the night sky ; 360 degree's. then i observed at various distances other type craft. i was astonished at the enormity and the size of the submarine shaped craft. it looked like they had conning towers attached; like one would see on an aircraft carrier ! in a 270 degree view, i lost count after 152 vehicles... i was signaling various moving craft with 1st my infared and when they suddenly stopped , i shined my laser on them. they returned with various flashes of bright white and yellow lights. each craft flashed in different sequences. to finish my statement ; at 4:00a.M. i was observing a large submarine shaped ship which was very bright. white almost opaque in color; directing a red beam at 2 -3 shaped disc's; that seamed to be exiting a similar sub. parallel to the one with the red beam. the location was east. at this point i was tired . i concentrated my thoughts: stating i'm going in the house and i'll be out here tomorrow night. i was projecting my thought pattern to the lead craft in the sky. i said ; flash your lights once or twice if you understand. at this point, out of the dark night sky came 2 bright white flashes. i waved to all above and went inside the house. the next night, there was less of them but they were there !","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
