 our group of friends had a game that we would play occasionally.  we would pair up and steal road signs.  that particular night ben and i chose to go to an area that was less populated and would be less affected by the loss of their road signs.  :)  when we got to what was then called old farm road, we turned and thought the speed limit sign would be perfect.  we had a ladder and a grand prix.  we had sockets, wrenches and everything.  when we worked on the speed limit sign, we both noticed a very bright light that went from the western horizon to the eastern horizon.  it was definitely not a satellite and was probably not a comet (no tail).  it was too slow to be a plane (unless it was a high altitude sr 71 with all lights on), it was too bright and fast to be a satellite.  we stood and watched it cross the sky and thought nothing of it.\r\n\r\nwe decided that we couldn't steal that sign.  it was too rusted on.  we drove on down the rural dirt road.  the road was unlit, but we were familiar with the area.  we had been given permission by a camp that owned a lake off of the road to canoe and fish.  ben and i had never been past this point day or night.  the story gets good for a campfire when i tell you what happened before, but that isn't the point here.  we traveled to the end of the road.  it goes up a hill as a driveway to someone's extremely wealthy homestead.  on our way back...We decided that the best sign to steal would be a no hunting sign near the camp we had a deal with.  \r\n\r\nas we approached the sign (on a wooded hill to our left/north halfway through the road)..........We were overcome by green light.  the way the light appeared was different for ben and i.  we both have different experiences and memories about the light.  what is important, is that it was there.  it permeated the car.  it was almost a solid.  all i could see was green.  ben doesn't believe in anything.  he cannot refuse to admit this story.  we were looking for the no hunting sign and had just past it.  i put the car in reverse to go get to it.  my foot was just leaving the break when everything was a liquified green.  it was in the car!  \r\n\r\ni remember pushing the break and the light stopped for half a second.  then it was back.  it was like going from black to white.  after the light came back, i turned my head to the right and looked at ben.  he nodded at me.  nothing was said.  i put the car into drive and drove off at a normal pace.\r\n\r\nthat story seems all swell and dandy.  you would have to have been there to really experience what we did.  ben refuses to make a big deal about it.  i don't shy away from it.  the main reason i don't shy away from it is i have a very distinct green mark on my forehead.  my parents say i wasn't born with it.  i have no clue where it came from. i don't know if it has anything to do with the green lights.  i do use it as an effect in parties when talking about the green lights.  either way, i want to know if this has happened to others and they have marks.\r\n\r\ni also saw a lighted feather drop very slowly when i lived in inver grove heights, mn around 1983.  i will never forget the sight.  i was looking south east.  the lights were almost due south.  i thought a plane was crashing at 5 years old.  i understood feathers, but had never seen a blue and red lighted feather sift down to the ground.

out of my 35 years.  this light was unusual at the instant i saw it.  i was laying on my couch watching the animal planet channel on tv.  i have a townhome.  all of my windows are covered except for a couple that are up high.  when i noticed the light, i jumped up and went on the deck, which is also on the south side.\r\n\r\ni did not see where this light originated from.  i thought it might be a plane on fire and crashing at first.  the light did not get brighter or dimmer for probably 3 minutes.  it just went from 60* to nearly 90* or directly overhead.  the light was much different than an airplane.  it was orange.  it also looked to be flashing.  it was obvious to me that it was either really small or very far away.  it looked like the light was coming out of 270* of the circumference of the object.  there was a quarter of the object that didn't seem to be emitting light.\r\n\r\nafter it got near 90*, it went very dim.  i stood staring up where it went dim for a couple of minutes before i saw a very dim orange light moving in almost the opposite tragectory.  it was moving slowly.  it was not a plane, was too dim, and was the wrong color.  i thought what i was watching might have been a satellite.  as it went from near 90* to the horizon almost due south, it seemed to get larger.  it was much less illuminated than it was when it was traveling in the opposite direction.  when it got to about a 45* angle, it abruptly changed directions.  it went straight west and started descending.  it did not look like it was a physical object as it descended. it looked as if it was 3 translucent globes of faint light that were moving together.\r\n\r\ni have experienced other things that i cannot explain.  to me, looking for a plausible explanation, this might have been a home made rocket.  there was no trail, but the rocket might have been launched in iowa.  the intertwining globes that i saw could have been parachutes.  what was weird is that it was orange on the way down as well as the way up.  even the parachutes were illuminated in an orange color.\r\n\r\ni have two other experiences that i will report

statement to be entered into the public domain of every sentient being that may perceive my communications. this is a record of my personal experience that may not be refuted by any word; spoken or otherwise, for any purpose. \r\n i am the observer whom reported three amber lights in longmont, co on 6/28/13. it is my experience that these \"monitors\" are not only intelligently guided, but are demonstrating some type of (rather coy and aloof) interplay again.\r\n on 7/30/13 i settled into bed at @ 10:40 pm. i turned on my tablet device to see what's been posting on youtube. my bed is against a west wall, with a tall, old school window intersecting the central part of the bed. i had the blinds up and my attention was on the reddish heavenly body due west, about 40 degrees up. there had been some rain earlier, but it was partly cloudy with big billowy clouds, especially a dark one to my left, south. \r\n i glanced over the youtube homepage disappointingly and settled on their suggestion for a video of a woman who was assaulted in court by a cop. i was thinking: \"oh man, how far are things gonna go before we really change?\" or something like that, when the newslady on the clip announced that a woman was /sexually/ assaulted in court - i thought \"aw c'mon that's frickin' bull$#!T\" and right then - i saw up above, at about the 10 - 11 o clock position in the s/w was a big, uh, searchlight? -without a beam, though. i was like: \"dude, it's you guys!\" i fumbled around, crossed the room to shut the overhead light, returned to stifle the tablet computer, grab my phone camera & get back to the window. the smaller reddish heavenly body was still due east above the neighbor's roof. slightly to the n/w was a constellation that had kind of a 'kite' formation which seemed to change as it set n/w behind some tall trees and more spotty clouds. i was saying: \"are those stars setting fast and turning into a \"w\" shape\"? the \"searchlight\" or \"monitor\" remained only briefly, it hung in the one spot, to the left of the heavenly body (s/w) and did not fly away, fade, fizzle, or anything other than switch off! nothing remained of it, the impression it left on my eye, the \"trail\" so to speak, was sort of a can shape, but i could just as easily say that effect was an artifact of light like any other blur and not attributable to the orb having a cylindrical form. what i can say is, it had a whiter mid-area and an orange edge/ corona/ aura or whatever. it did not appear to have the halo that really set some past sightings apart from mere \"huh\" to \"wow\"! i mean this was still very \"wow\", but the almost 'rosy' hue to the 'extended outer edge' of ones i've seen in the past make this seem 'flatter' in a way. the previous ones had a 'lens flare' quality around them and demonstrated definite command of the airspace.\r\n this one appeared to register my emotional flash, as if to tell me: \"yes, this is what we have been trying to tell you\", but when i wanted to capture some images, they/it were like: \"nope, sorry\"! -the way it simply blinked out was ridiculous. i seriously felt like i was in \"the truman show\" or like some kind of little lab rat or something. \r\n *earlier in that day, 7/30/13, while playing guitar, i saw a tiny orb in very near proximity to me, it was basically black in the center, had a bright ring of color and more black to the edge. most of my experiences have by far been with these tiny \"doo-dads\", although it's usually the red \"sparkle\" types and the pale blue, round, flat looking, i dunno: \"fuzzballs\" the dark ones with color bands within their outer edge feel like they really have their game down.\r\n i have no idea if the little doo-dads and the big drone/probe/monitors are even aware of each other in any way, or if i am particularly sensitive to paranormal activity, or what?... but you all should know that: as i am writing this, i am presently hearing what may be considered \"the hum\" that used to seem like a silly story to me... i can hear the crickets, i can hear the home appliances, i hear a plane and road noise and even a little tinnitis perhaps, which sounds like a high tinsely sound. these are all separate and distinct from the deeper recurring tones that almost go: \"vvooo vvvooo vvooooo v voooo...\". i've been hearing it alot these past few years, but what's truly freaky is when it draws to a complete halt all of a sudden, like: \"ok, that's a wrap!... one long boring-ass tone brrrooooo-brrroooo-brrroooo- forever, and... cut!\" it's bizarre, but it's my truth. \r\n *as a side note, it may interest some readers that on 6/29/13, the next night after \"three amber orbs\", i was about to sleep when i heard a sound outside this same window, i saw a fuzzy white cat sitting still on a flat stone right by where my head would lay, with just the wall of the house between us... she would not let me touch her so i just let her flop down and lay, and went to bed, reminded of some movie out there with characters haunted by the specter of owl-like alien apparitions... it must be those big almond-shaped-eyes! \r\n& the next day, 6/30/13, some ravens showed me they can tug wires from the device mounted atop the edge of a 'big box' store, so i only expect things to get even more interesting from here on out. \r\n oh, and a big brown bear crossed my path on 7/27/13 (i was driving in s/w co), i took it as a good omen. \r\n ~there is so much more to tell, i wish you all the very best in life; please please please be kind, you won't regret it.

clarity showing complete view of all stars and planets. after a lifetime of following astronomy, probably best viewing conditions i've seen.\r\nmy house is several kilometres from the hawke's bay coast, eastern seaboard of north island, new zealand. was looking at orion's belt through field glasses when i saw a light to my right, clearly visible over the roof of my house, glowing red-orange. much larger than a star, larger than a planet, but was clearly much closer to earth - i suspect it was easily within our atmosphere.\r\nit was stationary and in a rough oval shape, slightly rounded at each end, although i could see no structure, simply glowing light which was very slightly fuzzy at the edges. within a few seconds the object increased in size by perhaps 30 per cent and turned a light green, almost peppermint green. a few seconds later it reverted to its original colour and size, and then several seconds later reverted to the larger size and green colour.\r\nat this point the object shot off at an unbelievable speed, heading north and slightly upwards. it disappeared within two seconds. i looked back to the position it was in when i first saw it, and observed three (perhaps four) 'dashes'- dark, burnished gold colour - which disappeared very quickly.\r\nthe light/object left no other traces of its existence. there was no sound at any stage during this brief sighting. the distance it travelled from its original stationary position to the point in the sky that it disappeared was approximately 3.5 hand spans (adult male hand).\r\n\r\ni have been a journalist and technology writer all my working life and am now in my late 50s. my profession has trained me to spot anything unusual and to simply observe without rushing to judgement.\r\ni stood for at least 15 seconds going over what i had seen. i have no explanation for it in terms of any technology that i have seen or read about.\r\nit was not a trick of the light; the object was under control of some kind. my eyesight is excellent and as i mentioned earlier, i have been watching stars and planets since i was around 6 years old. i have seen a lightning bolt at a shockingly close distance, i've seen coloured ball-lightning, forked and sheet-lightning and i can readily identify most of our planets, stars, constellations etc. i've tracked the space station and many satellites, i've also seen meteors, one of which tracked an astonishing red and orange trail through the night sky. i have never seen anything like this object before.\r\n\r\none last thing in relation to the trail of 'dashes' (or hyphens as i originally called them) which remained in the sky for about three or four seconds after the object disappeared. about three weeks after this event a documentary was screened on our local cable tv company, sky tv which dealt in general with ufos. i hope you don't stop reading at this point, but they had bob lazar detailing the broad varieties of ufo sightings made around the world and his words, to the best of my memory were: 'and there are coloured objects which hover in the sky and then fly off at incredible speeds, leaving dashes in their wake.\"\r\ni nearly fell off my settee. this description exactly replicated what i saw, and it is the reason why i am filling in this report. i hope all this is of some value. \r\nbest wishes.\r\ngraham\r\n\r\n

noticed the multi colored flashing lights in the sky. t first glance, i thought it was a helicopter off in the distance. as i observed it for a minute, i knew it wasn't a helicopter or a plane for a couple reasons. lights don't flash in the random way these were flashing or use the multi colors i saw. it was also silent and maneuvered in a way no plane or helicopter could. i ran in the house to grab some of my family members to come look at this. as we went back outside it was closer to us than before and it looked like the lights were dancing around each other then they would flatten out and come back together again, randomly flashing and randomly changing colors. during this display we lost sight of the object for the first time after about 5 minutes when it dropped below the trees. after about 2 minutes it rose back up in the sky and appeared to hover until it randomly danced around the sky and dipped below the tree line and didn't come back. the 4 of us were very puzzled as to what we just saw and are searching the web for any other sightings in this area that may have been reported ","distance":"Over One

2130 hours in the northern by north eastern sky just above treetop level on the way to dixie mart. he drove towards the star-like lights that were assembled in a straight line. he arrived at dixie mart and went in. he came out with another patron and showed that person the lights. both observed the lights for a few moments until they began to move. he drove back home, about 1.25 miles and got my daughter out of the house and several neighbors to see what he was seeing. i received a phone call to come see the objects at about 2145 hours and to pull into the yard with my lights off. i did not know what i was being called to their house for.\r\n\r\ni quickly drove to their house 100 yards away and got out with my wife. my daughter and her fiance both pointed to the south by south-eastern sky. they were with several neighbors all looking at the lights. i personally saw two or three extremely fast pulsating lights that were too far away to judge the distance. one of the objects went under the clouds the other two disappeared into the night sky.\r\n\r\nthe witness that related his information to me is a credible person. i have known him many years and have never known him to make up stories about things like this. in fact, i commented to him the same. he was astounded by what he saw as was my daughter. my wife didn't see anything but the neighbors next to his house did. they were observing the objects at the time i pulled into the yard.

would not have been flying over us).  when it started changing color, kind of a swirling like what you might see if you were looking at a soap bubble when the sun hits it... and it started making a kind of sound that is hard to describe maybe a whirling but not exactly and it pulsated in size a little larger and then smaller (not greatly but enough that it was noticeable) and all of a sudden it moved like so fast that it was shocking in a angle that i had never seen any thing else do , stopped on a dime as if it had brakes. then went back to the original glowing that was just intense white, sat there for a while in the sky and then again with the color shift etc... and moved another kind of weird angle move and stop dead again.  it did this several times and then when it finally left out of sight it shot off did a couple zig zags and gone out of sight.  i watched it the following night and similar activity, but during that day the military had come in and they had mistakenly driven up our drive way probably not knowing that there was a house there, and did not stop to talk or anything but tried to go on the drive or rural road thinking it went some where but it did not so just turned around and went back down our hill onto the main logging road.  which we thought was really odd.  this went on for about a week seeing it at night time, and the military being in the area, to the point of me being outside when one of those helicopters that has the big doors on both sides dropped down to about roof level of my house and hovered over my yard area with men in it, binoculars, etc...  i could hear them talking etc. but they did not really talk to me and gave no kind of excuse as to why they were there or apology for being so rude either...  the following day a man showed up at our home and had like a forestry uniform on and offered us a job, we had to go to a place a few miles down the logging road where they had burned off some slag piles and they needed someone to do firewatch during the night, so we needed the cash and did that (they specified they wanted both of us to do it, which meant we left our home without occupants) when the man came in the morning where we were doing the fire watch, he sent us home.  i noticed that some of the things in my home were out of their places, like someone had been in there looking around.  now you have to understand we had no electricity or phone, so calling anyone to report a possible break in was not an option.  we just kept our eyes open for intruders and it made me nervous when during that couple weeks we had to drive into town, which was 45 minutes to an hour drive.  we had a goat that was like a house pet, but when we left we tethered him up so he could eat the undergrowth around out house.  when we came home we could not find him and started searching because we knew he could not have un-chained himself.  we had a wood shed with vertical boards in it, and spaces between about 2 inches apart where we found his chain pulled (as if it had been tauntly pulled) through into the wood storage area and tried to get around back of the shed to find him, but the under growth was dense so we had to chop it away to get to where our goat was... he was in a small clear area, strangely clear, no vegetation at all, as if there had never been any growth there and was dry dirt, just enough size around him to stand by him ... he had been cut with what had to be a very sharp knife or ? from under his chin to his groin, and laid there open but no blood anywhere, not on the ground, on his fur or in him, it was creepy, like something had just cut him open and sucked out all the fluids.  i was so upset that i did not check to see if all his innards were there, and had my husband bury him.  that was when we took into conscious realization that on our way into town and back we had noticed all the fence postings about lost or missing animals, ranging from dogs to cattle... and then later on when we went to town we started hearing the talk from others about their missing animals, but no one mentioned finding any of them.  during this time i think i had a dream, i am not sure what it was... but just in case it applies to the incident i will add it.  i was in the loft when i heard something try to come into our front door and then i just saw three beings standing there.  now i can see them clear as a bell in my head, but the moment i try to describe them in writing or verbally, the image is gone and i can not tell what they looked like no matter how hard i try, it is as if i see it in my head, but when i try to share what i saw, it is blank... all i know is there were three, and i do know that they were not people, nor were they the common alien image of the big head, with those big black eyes.  i slept with a 45 under my pillow because i was alone alot, with my son...  i tried as i had done all along every time i saw the orb to wake my husband who would not wake up for me, it was like he was knocked out and i never could get him to wake up to watch the orb with me... so i tried the night i think i was dreaming to wake him, because someone was in our home and i was afraid of what may be going to happen...  for some reason i had this more than average intense fear of them taking my son who was about 2 years old.  i remember taking the gun out from under my pillow, aiming and firing a shot.. hitting one of the three standing there looking up at me, and then being hit with this kind of slam to my brain, like a thought but not aloud, only it was like a slam nearly knocking me off balance and it was the word archaic.  the only other part of the dream then was them grabbing at the one i hit and not really walking out of my house through the door but just kind of being there and then not being there.  the following day i had my husband drive me to town and i called family to come move me, i was not going to stay there any longer. i have no idea how long the military stayed in the woods and were there with helicopters, vehicles and soldiers tramping around.  we saw them a couple times near our cabin but they never interacted with us and when we would try to go speak to them, they would high tail it out of there.  but i had the feeling by the way they acted that we were under some sort of surveillance.  i did not tell anyone about this for several years because i thought they would think i was just making a big deal out of a bunch of unrelated things or that the orb i saw was nothing more than an aircraft light or ?? but with a easy explanation that would make me sound like a lunatic for thinking it was something peculiar.  when i did tell the story to someone, just telling it would make me draw my legs up under me and kind of take on this kind of fetal type sitting position, because it was still and is still frightening to me, but i can not really tell you why it frightens me yet it is more than just seeing a glowing orb and being curious about what it could have been..  and oddly too, after my husband saw the stuff on the roof, and he went up to touch it... that was all he witnessed because i could not wake him up to watch it with me or witness it or give his input on it, it was like he was medicated and could not wake up, no matter how i shook him to get him to wake up.  he never saw the orb, he only saw the florescent green shifting stuff on our roof, was aware of the military in force, that our house had been gone through while we were fire watching and was aware of the goat, as he found him, looked at him with me, buried him and he knew that i was so upset by all that i had seen that i was leaving the cabin with our son as fast as i could from the fear i had of all that i had seen.  this incident was a large part of why we split up and divorced.  the only other thing i can add is that it was not a one time viewing of the orb, it went on for more than a week.  it has been so long ago i can not give a date as to month, but i believe it was fall to very early winter based on my memory of weather conditions on the pass when i moved away and from the age of my son at the time, i estimate it to be about 1976.  but it could have been 1977.  nor can i tell you what times i saw it, we had no electricity and clocks were not really part of our lives, the times i saw it were near night fall to late night, it did not come at the same times and i would watch it for a long time, i would say anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour of activity, it did not have a pattern like showing up same time, lasting the same length of time.  i remember watching it one time where it seemed like hours, but, i have no way of saying that is a fact because i did not have a clock to check.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":49353,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":47.7504918,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07312013-0026","longitude":-121.9804781,"occurred":214290000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1375315810000,"summary":"Orb, shifting colors, shape change then instant change of postions","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":13437,"locationName":"Duvall, Washington","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:278551"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Ionia","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was spring or fall in 1964-1965. i was approximately 11-12 years old. my family was visiting a small farm surrounded by a large(30-40ft) pine forest in a very desolate, rural area of michigan. a friend and i decided to go for a walk down the straight road which led to the house. it was late at night, pitch dark with a clear sky. we took small flashlights with us in order to see the road. the road was next to a small (500ft across) corn field. the pine tree forest was next to the corn field. we walked about 300 ft from the house and then turned around to head back to it. being from a large city, i could not stop myself from starring at the billions of stars in the sky. it was like the \"star\" shows at the observatory.\r\n\r\nsuddenly, i looked across the corn field, above the pine trees, and saw that a large oval shaped, dark black or deep purple, \"patch\" blocked out all the stars. it was huge (football field in length, width half a football field), especially since we were so close to it. it hovered a few feet above the treeline absolutely silent. then, it started to move across the top of the treeline silently and very slowly (5-10mph). what was really strange was that there was no movement to the leaves as the object moved through the top of the forest. it seemed like the object did not create any air movement around itself as it moved. we watched the object for only a few minutes as it continued silently and slowly move across the treetops.\r\n\r\nwe then ran back to the house scared and screaming, trying to get the adults to see the object. they, unfortunately, laughed at us and refused to see what was going on outside.
