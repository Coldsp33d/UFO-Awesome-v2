up and saw it as well. we stood there watching this object. it flew in a direct path then stopped, blinked, and changed direction. when it changed its path it also changed its shape. it was no longer red and orange, but now it was a glowing off white color. it also was projecting a beam from it as well. the beam is what caught my friend and i so off guard. the reason i say this is because: if you are driving in a vehicle of any sort, the beginning of the beam is typically the narrowest while the farthest edge of the beam tends to be wider and less powerful. that was not the case with the object in the sky. eminating from the object the beam was widest with more distortion in it. the farther the beam was from the object the more of a fine point that it came to. this last for about 20 minutes. the object began to move behind some trees that were approx. 300-400ft away from us. we began to run to see if we could see it from the other side of the trees. the object simply vanished. we felt in awe as we were watching this. after we felt dumbfounded. as we made our way back up to the venue, we went inside and told everyone what we had seen. some listened with interest others thought

it maybe she went to the bathroom. i roll over and see out my large window in my bedroom and see a glowing light outside. i thought it was just my dads dusk/dawn light on his garage so i get up to close the blinds. when i look out the window i see a large glowing craft hovering by his garage it emitted a very bright white light. it was so bright that the trees it was behind didnt have a shadows. the trees were probably 15-20ft tall. this is when i notice it got brighter underneath it and a person (something)standing under it, then the craft started to pulsate. the being started to move closer to my window but when it moved it wasnt like it walked it was more like it teleported. it would disappear and reappear in another spot closer to me. for a spilt second it just disappeared i thought it had left. thats when it raised up from outside my window face to face with me. it was a grey, almond shaped head and big black eyes. i thought to myself this has to be a dream, i need to wake up now but i couldnt. so i told myself i need to try to scream to wake myself up, i managed to let out a scream. this is when i \"wake up\" i was laying in my bed i jolted myself out of bed when i woke and let out a gasp. i see my girlfriend laying next to me in bed asleep, i roll over to put my arm around her thinking it was all just a dream. thats when i see a shadowy figure of a grey stand in the corner but it was very tall. taller then the door frame it was standing next to and it was kind of hunched over. i was scared to death almost paralyzed in fear. i just put my head down next to my girlfriend and try to go back to sleep.  \r\n\r\nive always thought this was a dream but it doesnt really feel like a dream. the experience of it feels like an actual life event.  my girlfriend has

something with lights hovering above the church on 38th. i did a u-turn on 40th and turned on 38th then stopped. i recorded it on my sisters cell phone. while recording i noticed that the object was not showing up on the screen even though i was looking right at it. i then stopped a guy that was walking and asked him if he saw it. he said \"ya you mean that square thing with the lights, it looks like a kite\" it was not a kite. it was 2:30am. i then left and drove the short distance to my sisters. i told her about it. when i told her it was still there when i left she wanted to go see if it was still there. we drove back to that area and it was there hovering above the church. we stopped on 38th and sat there bewildered as to what this object was. my sister told me to drive under it. 02apprehensively i decided to drive down the alley just after the parking lot of the church. as we maneuvered south down the alley the object hovered above but even with the car as it moved. when we reached 37th i turned left and stopped. the object was hovering over 37th. as we were stopped a truck passed us and pulled over to see what we were looking at. they saw the object and thought it was peculiar. they went about their business. my sister was trying to photograph the object (which we both concluded looked like a red transparent bubble with bluish white lights that seemed to be eyes.)  when the flash went off the object hovered/floated behind some trees as if it were trying to hide. i backed up down the street so we could see it. i then decided to see if it would \"follow\" us and drove back up the street and it did indeed stay in close proximity to the car. we parked in the church parking lot and got out. it was not threatening in anyway, just odd. the two guys in the truck drove back by, saw us still looking and pulled into the parking lot. the four of us could not determine what it was. it did somewhat resemble a balloon so one of the guys tried to locate where a string was that would be tethering the object and was unsuccessful. meanwhile my sister called her boyfriend and he showed up. he too was baffled as to what this floating/hovering object could be. the two guys in the truck left and my sister, her boyfriend and i just watched. it seemed to be looking at us with the lights. the lights moved as if it were thinking or computing. i'm not sure of the correct word... it had intelligence. by the time we left it was 4:00am and the object never went out of sight. we left it, it didn't disappear. during this time we also saw 2 what seemed to be stars go from standstill to across the sky. it was like they took it out of park and moved quickly across the entire sky.\r\n\r\nthe pictures i provided aside from the original ( the black background with

tilt of the fuselage of the helicopter was slightly more than he had seen before and also stated the speed of the helicopter was most likely near its maximum. there was still close to 900' between the

at huntington beach, california.  the time was approximately noon and we were located on the left side of the pier.  i took several photographs and did not notice anything in the sky or in the camera lens that seemed out of sorts.  approximately two hours later, we had moved to the north side of the pier (right side) and i again took several photographs.  again, nothing appeared out of the normal.\r\n\r\nonce home, i began the task of reviewing our photographs and noticed that on two (out of dozens) there appears to be a oval, round shaped black object hovering in the sky.  it appears closer in one shot and farther out in the second.  \r\n\r\ni cannot explain these objects.  some plausible explanations have been kite surfers, but no surfers appear in the shots and we did not notice any kite surfers at the time.  there are reflections on the object that match the direction of the light.  i took several shots in sequence at this area, and these are the only two that they appear in.  which, by my estimates, would somehow put the object in view for less than an eighth of a second.","distance":"101-500

abnormally bright circular light broke out from the heavey storm clouds\r\n it travelled quite quickly in a straightline at a speed i am not familiuar with.. its was way faster than the jets i have seen but slower than a meteor. no noise no trail well defined bright it was moving in a straight sw direction and quickly disappeared into the blackness .\r\n i stood there wondering what i had just seen, i at that point attributed it to some kind of a slow freak lighting event, like ball lightning or something. so i sat back and continued to watch the storm. about two to three minutes later the light returned from the s.W. as best as i could tell along what looked to be the exact same line it had left on. this time it seemed to be travelling faster and disappeared back into the storm clouds. i dont think that lighting goes that way so it kinda squashed my rational explaination. i watched the storm come in and leave but never saw the mystery light again. i not being a 100% believer in ufo am lost for a rational explaination  the next day i explained to my wife and buddy what i had seen and while they were quick with \"answers\" i just agreed and moved on knowing full well none of thier answers were even remotley close to what i saw.\r\n  i am at this point still looking for answers it feels lke a

the witness stated that he thought these objects were traveling at 200-300 mph or more when they both stopped for several seconds, then continued on. these two formations of lights appeared to be part of two single crafts because the lights never changed position, even as one tilted upwards the lights remained in position. it was dark and he could not see the outline of a craft, however. more individual lights, moving at different rates of speed in a straight line followed.  the witness counted 30 lights total.  then some of the individual lights moved faster and overtook those in front.  all of the objects then moved very quickly up and through a single opening in the clouds and disappeared from view behind the clouds. the witness called the police, who referred him to the faa, who said they do not take reports such as this.  the witness has seen sky lanterns and said that these did not behave in the same manner.  the witness is an aircraft engineer and wishes to remain
