lightning. i did not witness the object at the time as it was almost 10:00pm, it was dark, and the lightning was blinding. it wasn't until over a week later when going through my pictures that i noticed the object in the middle of the picture, either with the lightning bolt hitting the object or passing behind it. because of the darkness, i did not see any sight of the object after the lightning, but that night i heard no sound of engines or anything other than a few rumbles of thunder and the falling rain. i considered it could be multiple things; a plane but there was no sound of an engine which should have been heard from that distance and wouldn't likely be out flying that low in the middle of a thunderstorm that late in this area; a bird or bat, which is also unlikely given the weather and the shape (as few birds have such a straight wingspan and few have body parts that hang so far below their wingspan); or an insect which would not likely have appeared so clear and

it moved to my right about 50 feet and stopped to hover in the new positon. the object then went in a straight line horizontally to the left about to the original hover position. it stayed for about 10 seconds and slowly started to descend. the lighting was very bright, steady and close together. there was no noise coming from it at all. i estimated the distance from me to be about 400 to 500 ft. the maximum height it ascended was about 350 ft. as the object went behind the building again, i was a little stunned at what i was seeing. i had called my wife and daughter to come look but it had gone behind the building before they got downstairs to the balcony. within about a minute of it going behind the building across the courtyard, we all saw it rise again about 50 feet to the left of it's original positon. it did not rise as high but it did again hover. after about a 20-30 sec hover, it slowly descended again behind the building. my daughter (9) was frightened by it and we all were a little spooked by what we had just seen. i stayed out on the balcony for about another half hour watching to see if it came again, but did not. i have worked in avaition for over 30 years and

camera because i never know when i'll see something interesting. also my dog is getting older so i am trying to get videos of her to remember her by. i go out to this area a lot and there has been two other occasions i saw something unusual but didn't have my camera. anyway that morning i decided to take pics of the area to send to my family in michigan. show them where i moved to and how wide open the space is so close to my house. so i stood in place and took about 9 pictures as i was turning in a circle. it wasn't until a couple days later when i downloaded the pics to my computer to print that i noticed the two objects in the pictures.  right now i'm attaching the photos i took the other day, i only have a digital camera and don't have the software on my computer to be able to zoom it in and get a clearer view of what it or they could be. you'll see in the pictures a hill, to the left of that hill there's a cloud formation a dark one below the white ones, it looks sort of like a frog. in one pic there is nothing but i turned all the way around in a few seconds and took another pic of the same area, that's when the round object appears in the pic. plus to the right of the same mountain, between it and a smaller hill, just above to the right of a small white structure appears another blurry object that also doesn't appear in the other pics. i don't know the sequence, if the object was in the first pic i took or the second as i was turning. but they were all taken in less than a minute, you can tell that because the clouds don't change between pics. also i didn't see or hear any planes or helicopters that morning. in fact i rarely see those out there except the high altitude commercial types. the mountain that is behind the object is approx. 4 miles away from where i was standing. maybe a little farther.\r\ni hope you can analyze the picture better and be able to maybe give me a clue to what appeared in those pics. strange thing on my back from that walk i also saw and took pictures of some huge paw prints. look like a big cat. there was a mans foot print next to one and the paw was almost as big, at least 5\" across and 6\" long.\r\n \r\ni have seen a definite ufo when i was 17 (in the fall of 1971). i was with my dad, aunt and cousin, it was in the mountains between lake tahoe and sacramento. we all saw it, around 1 a.M. coming down the mountain toward sacramento.  at first we were surrounded by the mountains and forest when we started coming out of the mountains we could see something bright between the trees. then the highway comes to a plateau and both sides of the hiway drop below and you're above the forest. that's when we saw the huge bright round object. it was about 20 - 30 miles away as the crow flys.  it was huge, there was a full moon that night and the difference between the moon and the object was like a 50 cent piece and a dime held out at arms length. it was extremely bright and had a beam of light like coming from it as though it was searching for something. there were no helicopter cops in those days plus there isn't even any populated places in that area, some cabins here and there that are usually closed up at summers end. we pulled over and got out of the van. we watched it for about 5 minutes when suddenly the beam shut off and the object streaked away and disappeared in a split second. my aunt was saying not to let my cousin (he was about 9yrs old then)know that we just saw a ufo, that it would scare him. my father had been in the navy assigned to a aircraft carrier in the early 50's, he said he had never heard of or seen anything like that before. it didn't make a sound & again i have never before or since seen anything that bright white.\r\n it was in the fall and it was cloudy out, but where the object had been was devoid of clouds, like the heat of the thing dissipated them and you could see thru to clear sky. the weird thing is on the road coming from tahoe before we saw it we noticed all kinds of animals. all of us had traveled that road dozens & dozens of times & never saw that many animals during one trip. my dad was saying there must be a bear or cougar lurking about scaring the smaller animals. also i remember the trip up until the point when the object disappeared, don't remember getting back in the van or the rest of the trip. and we didn't talk about it for at least the next 15 years or more. don't know why, but when we did with each other at separate times we all remember it exactly like i just described. even my cousin said \"yeah i remember the time we saw a ufo but mom thought i'd be scared so you guys pretended it was nothing\" then he described his memory of it and it was exactly like mine.\r\nso the since then i have been looking at the sky hoping to see that again. and i have seen a lot of unusual objects, especially in the last couple years. more so in the last couple months at night with astronomical binoculars. \r\ni'll file a report about a couple very interesting things i saw a few weeks ago.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

3am that i wanted to step outside and remember that i needed to take the garbage up. as i took the garabage out i had remember the meteor shower so as i walked back towards my house i began to look up. nothing out the normal, buy very quiet and very clear. as i walked back toward the door, i noticed the stars twinkling a lot more than normal. so, i figured i would stand for a few minutes and watch the stars thinking i would see a shooting star. i looked back inside to see my husband coming outside and i looked back up. he had asked me while i was staring at the clear sky what i was doing and like normal i told him i was looking for shooting stars. as i had said this, i noticed two faint looking lights out of nowhere appear over my head a little higher than i was originally staring, like dim stars, moving in sequence. it was out of the corner of my eyes almost and i thought my eyes where playing tricks as the two hovered for a moment. like a crooked semi colon but farther apart ( : ). there was a bigger gap, of course, between the stars but they were moving together. and, logically, i thought they were satelittes moving together, in the same course. but, as i looked even harder and thought about it more... satellites don't just come out of nowhere. i pointed out to my husband that there was a third very faint \"star\" or light off to the right of these two dim ones. flickering as it followed the other two to the left. it formed a triangle in the sky and no structure, just three dim looking stars... moving across the sky in the shape of a triangle.. i thought maybe a possibility of shooting stars but, they were just moving way too slow... so, looking at the sky and where they were, i ran to my front yard making sure to check a second each step to not lose them out of sight. clearly i could see them moving across the sky to the north. at this time i looked at my phone to see what time it was 3:15am. just as i said they have to be satellites... it changed course. it was traveling nw and then just stopped for a brief second, the lights flickered and continued n toward verona. i was and still am in awe. right after i had witnessed this my husband said it was a ufo. i looked back up to witness two shooting stars to the left of where the object started to appear. afterwards when i came back outside i felt very \"weird\" as if something was outside watching me. i can't even step back outside tonight. i know for a fact what i saw was an object but, i don't know what of... unfortunately, the lights where too dim in the sky for my to capture. but, what i saw can be verified by my husband and i. i normally try to think of a logical explaination. but, this one had me stumped.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then
