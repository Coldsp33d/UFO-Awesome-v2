approx. 10:47 pm pst - novato, ca\r\n\r\ni was so excited about my recent sightings on the 14th and 21st that i told my friends while we were hanging out at vintage oaks shopping center. they couldn't believe it, so i showed them the videos. they then were excited and wanted to go hunting for ufo's later that night. i mentioned that seeing a ufo once in your life is rare, and that twice in a week is beyond normal. but i wasn't opposed, so i just assured them not to get their hopes up and that it would be fun to see one.\r\n\r\nlater that night i grabbed my camera and we hiked up miwok hill in novato. it is my favorite place to hangout. it has a bench at the top of the hill and you can see almost all of novato from this one spot. \r\n\r\nwe sat down on the bench and watched the skies for quite a while. at one point my friend said that he heard something coming towards us. i was recording some test shots right before, so i redirected my attention to directly in front of us. then we saw a flashlight. it was just people. i stopped recording and realized that it was my old friends from middle school. i hadn't seen them since i was about 13. i am 21 now. as we were talking i realized that there was a bright orange light hovering nearby. i started to record it, my friend asked what i was doing so i told him i was filming for a movie so i wouldn't be embarrassed about what i was really doing. i really didn't want them to know i was investigating ufo's so i tried to play it off as i recorded the object. at this moment i thought it was the same craft from the 14th and mentioned it to my friends who were watching intently. then i sparked up a conversation about a friend of mine from middle school that i saw earlier that day when we were hanging out at the shopping center. as we were talking, one of my friends mentioned that \"it was happening\". i replied that i too thought it was happening. we laughed in excitement. he told me to try to focus to see if it was dropping anything. i was trying my best at this point to not shake the camera and get a clear image. i couldn't believe it was actually happening again! what are the chances!!! it soon after flew behind some clouds.\r\n\r\nafter the sighting, a helicopter flew through the area.\r\n\r\nthe area of the sky where we observed the craft was very clear. there was no wind at the time of the sighting. very calm weather. \r\n\r\nthere were 5 witnesses. 2 of them didnt know exactly what tey were witnessing. the other 2 were my friends who came to hunt for the ufo. and then myself makes 5.\r\n\r\nupon analyzing the footage, the craft can be seen dropping objects multiple times throughout the video! the most notable are at 01:30 and 01:40 in the clip.\r\n\r\nattached is the original video, the enhanced version of the video, and a map of the flight path.","distance":"501 Feet -

just east of ohare, so air traffic is common.  as i looked up, i noticed a bright orange light, moving slowly but smoothly in a south to north direction.  it seemed to stall (hover) and then dipped vertically and seemed to make almost a figure 8 path, then appearing to come westward (toward my position) slightly until it started drifting smoothly north again.  my initial impression was that it was a flare or firework...But its light neither diminished nor became a firework.  i watched it for approximately 2 minutes.  the dogs had no noticeable reaction.  there was no sound from it. it was moving slowly enough that i thought i could get inside to get a camera.\r\n\r\nwhen i returned within about 20 seconds, i came back outside and could see the light through a tree in my back yard, still elevated (but under the clouds) and moving slowly (south to north).  from my position, i would estimate it was a couple miles east of me.  it's a cloudy night, but it was lower than the clouds.  as i tried to fix my camera on it (using an ipad), it took a smooth, ascending trajectory at a slight northeast direction.  its path, at this point, looked like how a jet flies, but there was still no sound and it was still the bright (non pulsing) orange light.  it disappeared into the clouds.  i could not get an image on the ipad.\r\n\r\nmy own reaction to it was immediately, \"what the hell is that?\" thinking it may be a flare, but then when it dipped, i thought...Could that be a helicopter (too abrupt in its movement and way too bright of an orange, non-aviation light).  then i quickly wondered if it could be a remote control plane...But it's 10pm, too bright and if it were a rc plane, with a light that bright, it would have been on the next street, and i would have been able to hear it.  because its movement was initially south to north, i did not believe it was a jet from ohare (their flight paths are almost always east/west, west/east over our house) and with its slowed rate and vertical movement, lack of sound, constant light, i thought there was minimal chance of it being commercial aircraft.\r\n\r\nadmittedly, i'm interested in ufos.  however, living near ohare, i've never had an experience in which i thought it was anything other than an aircraft.  i've never made a report like this before.  by profession, i'm a clinical psychologist, so i'd like to think i'm able to be relatively objective.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

different dates.)  was witnessed only by myself (as far as i know,) and it occurred while i was driving down a road adjacent to our own.  at the end of the road (it is a dead end,) i saw a slightly blurred-out looking white being, maybe 4-5 feet in height.  it darted into the woods surrounding the road, the sighting probably not lasting for more than 1-2 seconds.  no one else in the vehicle seemed to have witnessed it, but friends who live on the same road the white entity was sighted on seemed to have also witnessed (on separate occasions,) a mysterious white figure.  similar in stature to \"the moth man.\"  \r\n\r\nthe second time i saw a white being, i was walking in the opposite direction up the very same road.  (both of these incidents were before the ufo sighting i witnessed on july 27th, but i can not recall the exact date.  no more then 2 weeks apart.)  i was looking down at my feet as i walked.  there was a sulfurous smell in the air, similar to what i could smell at the time of the ufo sighting.  in any event, i looked up, and just before a bend in the road stood a similar (or the same, who knows?)  white being, still seemingly blurred.  it quickly darted around the bend, and i lost sight of it.  no visible features, other than a white human-like shape.  for one reason or another, i thought nothing of it.  i simply went on walking in the same direction, but did not come across it again.\r\n\r\nnow, on the the ufo sighting.  i was taking a walk only meters away from the bottom of my driveway when i noticed a strange sulfurous smell in the air.  i witnessed a strange plane fly overhead, which is strange in our area.  it looked almost like a nasa space shuttle in plane-form.  silly as it sounds, i'll try to describe it.  it had an orange stripe on the back and nose, and the rest was white.  the orange almost seemed like a separate piece-- it actually looked a bit like a missile.  but it was moving at a relatively normal speed.  it was obviously earthly in origin.  moving on, though, i walked further down our road only to see/hear more planes-- about 4 in total, i believe.  i was watching one plane when i heard another behind me, and turned around.  maybe a 1/2 second to 1 second later, a match-head size (from my perspective, it must have been high in the air,)  metallic spherical object came into view.  i don't recall how, it just kind of appeared in my visual range.  it \"flew\" in a straight trajectory for about 1-3 seconds, until it went over the tree-line and i lost sight of it.  i turned back around to find a bullet-shaped craft moving about the same speed as an airplane.  it looked high up as well, maybe as thin as two needles put together, and as long as a match-head.  it made no sound and had no exhaust, like the other craft.  it was completely off-white, a little blurry.  with a grey-ish black line in the center.  it also had a slight tilt upwards to the left.  i only saw it for about 2-4 seconds, afterwords i ran like mad back to my house.  (which wasn't far, but because of the adrenaline i wasn't as winded as usual.)  for a little while afterwords, our dogs would look up at the sky when let out.  and the television as well as my laptop were doing odd things, such as the mouse/cursor spazzing-- and whatever you use to select things on the xbox 360 was also flickering, even though there was seemingly no cause.  even hours afterwords, i still feel a little on-edge.  i have tried to draw the sphere and the entity.","distance":"101-500 Feet, Unknown","duration":"00:00:08","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":49236,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.27035964251135,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07272013-0023","longitude":-68.31780832223242,"occurred":1374971400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maine","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Bullet,   Missile,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1374987391000,"summary":"1 metalic sphere, 1 bullet-shaped white craft, 2 possibly 1 being(s)","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/49236_submitter_file1__being.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/49236_submitter_file2__object.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"04679","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Southwest Harbor, Maine","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:282465"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Upper Chichester","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I walked out of my house and looked up to see a plane flying across my path and observed a strange object in between us. it was round at first and seemed to be moving fast. i initially though it was something falling from the sky because of its speed and shape. it was not consistently round enough to be a balloon and it was moving parallel to the ground swiftly. it seemed to either change shapes as it moved away or was spinning or turning.

11 pm on 7/26/13. we were traveling to our home in southeast erie pa., and we were traveling southeast on our bayfront highway.\r\n we became engrossed in viewing a really huge, crystal clear, moon that was just emerging from the horizon. as we entered the street we live on, we no longer could see the moon. we continued driving south on our street as it ascended to higher elevations. we found a spot that gave us a view of the moon again.\r\n i stopped our car along the street so we all could look at the moon, and i spotted a small bright red light off to my left side (north). i thought that i also saw a hint of white light. i joked with everyone to take a look at the ufo, even though i thought it was just a helicopter. we have many life flights that come into our hamot hospital located about five miles away.\r\n we pulled away and circled around this block we were sitting in, and headed home. as i was backing our vehicle into our driveway, we all saw this large bright red object through our windshield. i placed the vehicle into park, and told everyone to get out, and look at this thing. everybody was talking loudly, and asking me what this thing is. we were all very excited about the object that we now were viewing.\r\n the object appeared to me to be shaped like a cone shaped top. it was a deep red colored object, and very bright. it was hovering at this point in time, and did not make any noise. it was much larger than any helicopter that i had seen in the marine corps. it just stayed in this location as we all walked around our car looking up at different angles of it.\r\n it began to sway (wobble) back and forth a little. i also thought it appeared to pulsate a little, but the others have said they did not see that. i asked our granddaughter to grab her i-pad, and take a photo. the picture immediately appeared on her i-pad screen as a white object, not red like what we were viewing. all agreed that they were viewing a red object.\r\n the object then appeared to slowly (minimally) move away (east) from us. it then looked as if it completely stopped moving, and began shrinking. it then just faded away, and was completely gone.\r\n we have no idea of how large it actually was. it appeared to be rather large. because we do not know how large it was, we do not know how close it was to us. we do know that it was not in this location when we first arrived home, or we would have seen it clearly while we looked for the moon. it seamed to be at a good distance away, when i first spotted it from further up our hill. we were shocked to see it directly in front of us, just a few minutes later when we arrived home. it was slightly northeast of our home, at about a 45 degree angle, or less, to the horizon.\r\n my wife and i have seen some pretty amazing things along our section of lake erie over the years, but never anything this close before.\r\n if i had not seen this with my own eyes, i would not have believed this object was that close to the ground, and over a populated area no less. \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My husband is a trucker who regularly passes through a remote area of colorado on hwy 285 near the town of saguache. he had to stop for his required rest break to take a nap. when he went to lay down in the bunk he heard a strange and unfamiliar noise, a pulsating sound - one that he can't duplicate and has never heard before. he got up and looked in the rearview mirrors to see if the sound might be another truck parking behind him in the small pull off area. he observed nothing there, and decided to go lay down to nap. when he laid down and closed his eyes, not yet asleep, he again heard the noise, and felt that it was now coming from inside his head, which very much puzzled him, yet he fell asleep for approximately 15 minutes. he then had a very unusual and uncharacteristic dream: suddenly, he was in a very large white empty room, possibly like a warehouse. \r\n\r\nhe observed his truck sitting in the room next to him. he then was levitated off the ground, turned his head to look and then his truck was no longer in the room with him. then the room became filled with colors and his truck was again there next to him in the room. he then awoke from the dream feeling strange, but not fearful. he stated that the impression he had afterwards, was that he was just another trucker passing through as thousands of other truckers do in this area, and that he was not a person of interest to whatever it was that was occurring. he also stated that he doesn't understand why he didn't get out of the truck to look around when he heard the unfamiliar pulsating sound. his reaction did not seem to me, to be the normally curious, fearless and high adventure seeking type of reaction that i know him to possess.\r\n\r\nmy husband is the type of person who has no fear of the supernatural, and made little notice of this event, other than to report it to me. he rarely has ever remembered his dreams other than occasional nightmares, which are usually of an apocalyptic nature. he is not afraid or concerned much with this event, all though he has stated that he won't be stopping on that stretch of highway again. \r\n\r\ni, however am concerned and have had 3 sightings of my own in my lifetime independent from him. i also have had childhood repeated dreams of similar origin to other abductees, of an examination origin. memories of being in an open mall-type setting with many observers where i was told to lay on a gurney by my mother (or possibly a mother-like figure), and that it will be \"all right\", and that i needed to lay on the gurney for the bb that was inside me to be removed. these dreams trouble me as i have no recollection of having any procedures done in childhood that might trigger this type of fear-filled dream. \r\n\r\ni also had a repeated and vivid childhood (aged 3-4 years) memory of a dream where a mechanical vehicle of some sort, making a scary booming noise came to my window. the next memory in the dream is of me looking out the window (or porthole-type shape) of a craft down on to the earth. i recall thinking in my child's mind that the earth viewed from above looked much like a patchwork quilt. this dream occurred when i was age 3-4 years old, and i had never flown on a plane until i was much older. around the same time of these dreams, i also had a sighting that i remember vividly. i was outdoors playing in my yard around dinner time, and i looked up into the sky.  high above were 4 diamond shaped shiny craft of some sort, not moving but hanging in the sky. i recalled being terrified that \"they\" were coming to get me and ran inside hysterical. \r\n\r\ni also had a sighting around the age of 14, walking home at night around 9pm. i saw out in my peripheral vision, a white light like a falling star, traveling horizontally through the sky, but at an impossibly fast rate of speed; faster than a plane and not the same trajectory as a falling star. i observed it for less than a minute, until it was obscured by the surrounding landscape.\r\n\r\nlater in life, in my late 20's i had another sighting, this time with a witness. vacationing in durango, co, myself and my then partner, sat on the deck late at night of a mountain resort. we then saw 5-6 white lights hovering stationary above a cliff peak that was across the highway from the resort. it seemed very close but we heard no sound whatsoever. the lights sat there for a minute or less, then all of them suddenly darted in different directions in a split second, and were gone. we sat there incredulous, wondering what we'd just witnessed. my ex partner was a pilot, and he knew the types of lights used on aircraft, and stated that these were not typical aircraft lights. he reported to me that he had an airborn encounter years earlier while flying his plane near the town of seabring, fl, where he spotted a cigar-shaped flying object within his path in front of him. it was lit with a green glow and darted around in his path with abnormally jerky and seemingly impossible movements, then darted out of his vision in a split second. \r\n\r\ndue to these experiences i've encountered in my life, i have had a lifelong fear and obsession with aliens, ufo's and the unknown. i have also had pretty extreme gynecological problems throughout my life. i have had one soccerball-sized ovarian cyst removed in my 30's along with one ovary and a fallopian tube taken during this surgery. 15 years later i developed another ovarian tumor, this one the size of a cantalope or larger, which was diagnosed as a borderline ovarian cancer and lead to a complete and full hysterectomy. \r\n\r\ni truly wish to understand what all of this means and conquer the fear i have. this is what i work on now, is to combat the fear. if there is something going on that is inexplicable, i feel that having this fear will only leave me more vulnerable to negative psychological influences of some sort; or vulnerable to further unwanted experiences.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":49233,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.0875,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07272013-0020","longitude":-106.1419671,"occurred":1374395400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1374976743000,"summary":"Trucker

bothering me for a year now,\r\non the 28th/29th of july 2012 at abpprox 1am - me, freinds & family members witnessed a ufo.\r\ncoming home on the motorway, driving with 2 mates towards home on the a41 past kings langley we noticed 3 cars stopped on the motorway looking towards the cornfields, 4 people winessed lights moving high from the london directions was what they described as strobing balls of light almost translucent heading nw wards, i thought both cars were likely drunk or drugged up from olyimpic fever, a 4thd car stopped but the clouds were rolling so they all went after 10minutes.\r\n\r\nlooking over the cornfields me & ben noticed faint strobe like effects high up, we esitmate they were below lowish cloud level in the bovingdon direction from the a41, we counted maybe 6 or 7 lights, we cn only descibe them as when you have a strobe light & shine it upwards almost like the batman sign. we thought maybe an party or rave or maybe a landing for a helicopter could be the answer but no light source seemed to coming from the ground. the air felt different - static - a heightened feel, ben puts this down to the humid night but i'm not that sure.\r\n\r\nmy mates was getting a lift home to hatfield with thier girlfriends so i dropped them off in apsely & i drove home, ben called me & said he couldn't see them anymore goig home to hatfield, i got home at about 2.30am & noticed they visible from home, i woke my parents who witnessed these lights for till 3am approx at which time the clouds came in low & the sun started to brighter the horizons. i reported it to the police but had no follow up, ben also did but felt he wasn't taken seriously.On a side note my parents tried to film it, it never came out, even on nightshot, the lights were faint but visible to notice.\r\n\r\nthe reason why i have'nt reported it here is because i did report it on another site which was no help, i also contacted several news sites, newspapers & local groups but didn't have 1 response back until last week when a guy phoned up asking about it for a article on ufos over herts, my mum didn't like the sound of him so i ended the call, when i asked why it took him a year almost to answer my reports he was evasive.\r\nits bothered us since, ben posted a message on facebook asking for witness even asking for the drivers who stopped to come forward but to no avail,\r\nwe met last week & decided to post it on mufon for hope of a better response.My other mate sam hasn't really talked about it since, i think he puts it down to a having a long hot day & evening & just atmospherics playing up in the sky.\r\n\r\nlastly we was not drinking or taking anything, i was driving & he had 1 drink 3 hours before, we caught a movie & played some fottball, yes at

saw this event! \r\n\r\nthe difference from the footage and her sighting is the footage shows the craft over 500 feet up! where my sister saw the craft just over the tree tops!! having said that it looked like glass as she could clearly see a craft which the lights where merely lights on this huge triangle craft but the craft itself was translucent she could see the craft and she could see the outline of it..","distance":"21-100
