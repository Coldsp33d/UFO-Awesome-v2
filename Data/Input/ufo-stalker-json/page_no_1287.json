night sky. i live in a rural area with few light sources providing a good view of stars on clear nights. i also routinely have commercial aircraft pass my viewing area (in my back yard) which has made picking out the other objects easier as their characteristics share little in common. my initial purpose for viewing the night sky was just star gazing because i used to live in ft. lauderdale where stars are barely visible, but in just looking up i began noticing what i thought to be a star begin to move. at first i dismissed the moving lights as shooting stars but quickly noticed they did not move as such. at times the lights seem to be on a steady path and then will change direction by approximately 3 to 10 degrees in an apparent short distance. additionally their movement is best described as watching a frog swim. most always moving forward but slowing momentarily (like rotating your arms back for the next swimming stroke) then continuing at its normal pace. as well the lights will vary greatly in their intensity, from some barely visible and hard to track to some going very bright then back to a steady glow as they travel.  i lose sight of them sometimes instantly,then others just fade away and then others pass out of sight due to my tree line. my feelings are just one of wonder during and after these sightings, basic curiosity i guess. on occasion i have pointed them out to my wife and/or visiting friends and they don't really have an explanation either. not looking for any news crew to visit me or anything but some intern or someone with a decent telescope so we can get a closer look to try and determine what these lights may be. either way they make looking up at the night sky that much more interesting. would love to video or photograph these lights

north with the clouds, never loosing shape. i stopped looking when it passed behind some trees and houses. i can only guess at how large it was, the distance and altitude. \r\n\r\ni would guess it was more than two miles away. i would guess it was larger than an aircraft carrier and at least 10to15 thousand feet in altitude. there were no planes in the area. this is along a commercial flight path for smaller jets like 737 and 767's. the larger jets move higher at 35 thousand feet  toward the east. at this time of night ,planes go from east to west or east to north depending on what airport they are going to. this concludes my report. \r\n\r\n

with a nerbous stare,time passes i ask for a ride home..Time about 11pm,the night sky is perfectly a dark clear,the road being a dead end and a small river there as well and as i look up i see a bell shaped object floating extremely low to the ground,with green,blue and red lights along the bottom flashing in non sequence i point it out to my other,i become nervous and we get in the vechile,me driving home which is about 3blocks away..As im driving the object is following at the same speed as the vechile..I come to a stop sign at the end of my street then continue home,when im inside the tress and power lines are swooshing back and forth back and forth yet there is no wind,the windows did not rattle as usual,yet tops of tree were bending like hurricane winds would..As i sat on the bed..Trying to contemplate what was happening no sooner did i feel at the base of my spine thousands of little needles as when your foot falls asleep,this feeling continued uo my intire back until reaching my neck..At this time i layed in bed,lights off,and i close my eyes and i can still see the room as if they were open,i re-open my eyes and close them again and there they were,standing over me,2 to the left and one on my right,the one on the right had a female aura and the other 2 on the left seemed of male origin,as i looked to the right i gazed into those deep eyes and herd \"do not worry u are safe\"then i look to the left and 1 of them puts is hands into my stomch,i felt nothing,and then it removed what looked like a small glowing blue and orange orb..Almost like a small universe.....I passed out,waking up the next morning feeling drugged and sluggish..Not remembering the night before i go about my normal rutine,i go outside and its a perfect sunny day no clouds,i open my garage pill my car out and i notice in the sky in all its greatness..A saucer pure reflective metal..Ill never forget how the sun shone of it,it emitted a hps(high preasure sodium)like glow,orange yellow,it hovered there,i froze in awe,then it hovered to the right about 100ft then to the left like 25ft then back to the right a little more where it stopped and stayed..As i stared at it i had a though enter my head saying\"we see you\",i paniced and drove off to work never to forget the experience.\r\ni also have a scoop mark with a symbol.\r\nthis is 100%true story with little

i don't see anyone\". obviously, this thai man was believed to be a spirit.\r\n\r\nplease understand that while i gave you a usa phone number, that is a voice-mail only, as i am in thailand.  please contact me by email if you want and we can arrange a skype call in necessary. geoff","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":49188,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":7.9810496,"location":null,"logNumber":"TH-07252013-0019","longitude":98.3638824,"occurred":1369940520000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Phuket","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1374814988000,"summary":"Appeared on photos and video after both were taken to capture a halow around the sun.","tags":["photo","video"],"timeZone":"Asia/Bangkok","timeZoneName":"Asia/Bangkok","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/49188_submitter_file1__UFOVideo.htm","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/49188_submitter_file2__UFO1.htm","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/49188_submitter_file3__UFO2.htm","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/49188_submitter_file4__UFO3.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":56,"locationName":"Phuket, Phuket","triangle":false,"type":"Alien Encounter","$$hashKey":"object:283279"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Broomfield","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Was at work which puts me outside, around 1:50 pm july 24 2013 object headed north northeast at 500 ft. for 1/4 mile then accends to 700 to 800 ft. hovering for 10 min. then heads straight east accending and desennding.Friend spotted it then i was asking whats in the sky. seemed to me a mickey mouse ballon then turned and realized it wasnt a baloon. had a friend get his binoculours and looked through them and saw three diamonds with two forming the top and black due to the alttitude.Thought it was a rc airplane but too fast and to big for that i thought. went straight into the wind northwest then accends, plz tell me ballons do this. was telling everyone at work getting them into trouble trying to get as many witnesses as posissble.Had my girlfriend follow it for 20 min. then lost it due to going out of site due east accending and desending the whole time.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"01:50:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":49187,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.926947,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07252013-0018","longitude":-105.095226,"occurred":1374699000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond,   Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1374810895000,"summary":"Hexagonal, three diamonds with two for top, floats by low altttude then accends to 500ft. + then heads east","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/49187_submitter_file1__004.MOV","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/49187_submitter_file2__005.MOV"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"80020","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Broomfield, Colorado","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:283280"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82751,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1287}
