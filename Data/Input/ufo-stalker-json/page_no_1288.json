was.  it stayed hovering right off the side of the street, but i didn't notice anyone else slowing down to look.  it felt like i was the only one seeing this thing. i was excited to see the object, but i felt it was only trying to make an appearance to me.  i cant believe no one else has reported this event it was right off the freaking freeway. i lost sight of the object after i turned crossed

the object then decided to move again. it traveled in front of the house, began moving up a little higher and to the west then outta nowhere, it disappeared right in front of my eyes. i did notice that when it disappeared, it was almost as if it shrunk and at that exact moment,for a split second, i saw a small white/silver light as it disappeared. again, i was completely baffled. i ran in the house and ran to the back deck to see if maybe my neighbors were burning things but they were not. i came back in and tried to show my sister the video and it was gone..Poof...Like i never recorded anything!! my sister then said the cable had just gone out too and the tv had to be reset. so weird. i also ruled out my initial thought that maybe it was a chinese lantern because one, it did not look like a lantern at all nor was it shaped as such and two, it traveled in a distinct like directional pattern, horizontially, stopped and hovered above me, and did not even travel up higher into the sky until it disappeared. 30 minutes or so later my sister was on back deck and screamed out because she saw a very very large bright white light streak through a clearing in our backyard trees. she said it was not actually in the woods but behind them and very very big and fast. it shot from southwest to southeast. the next day my neice before even hearing of the white light my sister saw, she said at that same exact time, while she was on her way to her boyfriends in robertsville, mo a huge white light seemed to shoot towards her vehicle and then up. she said it happened so fast and she had no idea what it was but it was not above the horizon. almost as if it was right on front of her but maybe it was just tht large and bright. so, i found it very odd all of this happened within a 30 to 40 minute span. i have since searched the area where the fireball object disappeared and was unable to find any trace of it. nothing. i also went as far as to check how much wind we had at that exact time and our winds were at 0. was a very  very calm night. nothing since then though. i am very upset the video was not found on my phone not to mention confused as to what happened to it. i have never seen anything like i saw that night. for some reason though, as close as it was to me, and even stopping right in front of me, i did not feel any fear.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":49164,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.47169924185001,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07242013-0022","longitude":-90.90629113414076,"occurred":1367986500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1374728960000,"summary":"Bright red/orange/black fireball ","tags":["fireball"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"63089","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":78,"locationName":"Villa Ridge, Missouri","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:284074"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"El Paso","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I had crossing texas by nightfall on my mind and traffic was easy. the weather was cooler than usual and i was confident i would make my way to atlanta georgia on time. i watched this craft which i thought i was dreaming or maybe after viewing several in my youth, i might be getting used to seeing them. anyway i opened my eyes as wide as i could to see what i belived to be a space craft traveling pretty fast maybe 150-200 mph then speed up to 500 mph in a couple seconds. it was coming right at me then passed right in front of me and i thought it was going to attack me or something. then i saw a us military aircraft, guessing f-16 attempting to follow it. 30 seconds later another f-16 followed but on a slightly northwest path meaning the craft traveling south to north followed by thefirst f-16 south to nortth must have changed direction to have the second f-16 head nw. there were no other vehicles on that stretch of interstate 10 for a 15-20 minutes, which might or might not be normal.I had thought i missed some kind of public announcement about alien craft being chased park it until further notice.I looked back on the incident when i stopped in midland texas for a soda and ask if any government announcements and the cashier looked at me kind of irritated.As i left the store i remember thinking if you saw what i just saw an hour or soago you would ...Et was being chased.... anyway atlanta here i come.

director debbie ziegelmeyer.  no ufo was seen, however, there is a possible landing mark and since ufos have been seen in connection with animal mutilations cases in the past it may be useful to have this on record.  this is the third known mutilation on the same ranch.  please see the attached reports for more detail.  the case is ongoing, i am setting up camera traps on the site and have submitted samples for lab analysis through chuck z. \r\n\r\ndate of discovery: july 19, 2013  time: 9:30 a.M. \r\nnw corner of henry county, 84 miles se of kansas city \r\n\r\n______________________________\r\n7/19/2013\r\nthe rancher called me at 10:00 a.M. this morning to report that she had another dead cow that she just found on her property.  she called the sheriff and a veterinarian and they were already on their way to the site.  \r\nthe witness had been at the site on wednesday and left at 6 pm.  she took thursday off and returned on friday morning to find the dead cow.  it had been 39 1/2 hours since her last site visit. \r\ni arrived at 1:00 p.M. with another investigator. the site is approximately 75 yards from the second gate to the property, and it was another 100+ yards to the gate at the road.  the vet just left the scene and he examined the cow.  the cow was found with a cut in the front of the body between the front two legs, and the heart outside the body.  all of the teats had been cut off of the udder, the tongue was cut out, and one eye was missing (the eye may have been missing due to vultures or maggots, which were already on the cow).  the vet had the rancher roll the cow over with a tractor so he could examine the other side so when we arrived the animal had been moved slightly but was in the same location. \r\nthe men opened up the wound in the front of the cow between the front legs in order to view the interior better.  this included moving the ribs.   the vet said that there was no blood on the ground, the cuts were precise, and that the heart and chest cavity had little blood in them, which was very unusual and unexplainable.  he vet also said that he knew animals did not cause the wounds.  he looked for bullet holes or other injuries to the cow but could find none, and he does not know the cause of death. \r\nthe rancher is going to obtain a copy of the report from the veterinarian and the police report in the next couple of days. the rancher  \r\nsaid that this was another of her best cows, and that she produced a calf every year.  the cow was 7 years old and valued at approximately $2,000.\r\nwhat we found on site: a strange darkened outline around where the cow was lying on on the ground, which looks like it has been burned.  also found an imprint in a cow pie that does not match up to any known animal or human boot print.  no people should have been on the property besides the ranchers.  it was not a tire print. could this have been a landing site? \r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n7/11/2013\r\nreceived an e-mail from chuck zukowski about a cow mutilation case in henry county.  i spoke to the witness today and she stated following: \r\nthe rancher found the cow yesterday, july 10 in the north side of her property.  it was lying dead on her left side, with her rear end, tongue, and udder removed.  the witness did not raise the head of the cow to look at the second eye. the witness had driven by the night before, but did not see anything, however, it was dark and the cow is black so it may have been there.   the cow had maggots on it, so it had been there at least a couple of days.   it has been very hot, up to 100 degrees and very dry.  the witness saw vultures on her on july 10.  the witness said that normally birds will fly around when something dies, but they were not there before july 10.  it was 100 degrees at the time she found the cow so it is decomposing rapidly.  she has registered black angus cows and this one was her best, a 7 ���year old in her prime that would have produced more calves in the future.  the cow was worth $2,000.  she wonders if it was random or if whoever/whatever did this was looking for the best of the herd.  the witness has not seen any other cows going near this one. \r\n\r\nnote: the witness says that as of today - july 24 - no coyotes have eaten on the carcasses.  this is not normal. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------\r\ndec 2011\r\na mutilated heifer calf was found on the site with its tongue and female genitalia removed and part of the jaw tissue and muscle removed to the bone. the rancher buried the calf at that time. \r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\ni made two youtube videos with interviews with the witness\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":49159,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.5558482,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07242013-0017","longitude":-93.960774,"occurred":1374251400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1374720670000,"summary":"Cow

she saw a red light in the northeast sky. she watched it for 1 minute, then wnt in to get me from the bedroom, exclaiming that there is a ufo outside. i got up from reading in bed and went out to the front yard. red/orange star-like object observed traveling at a slow rate of speed traversing the cloudy dark night sky moving toward the southwest. we observe it for about 1 minute as it moved across the sky. then it stopped moving. i watched intensely for a half minute or so and observed that it was erraticcly moving about in one place, that is to say, it was not perfectly stopped or idle, just no longer moving across the sky. rather, a difficult to detect movement, but certain that it was erratic. to check that it wasn't my eyes creating an illusion i looked to the north where i observed a jet airliner moving east to west in the northeast quandrant of the sky. i observed the jet (jet lights) clearly, thus concluding my eyesight was fine. i continued to observe the stalled object and asked my wife to run to the bedroom to get my binoculars. she did, though reluctantly. as i began to handle the binoculars outside preparing to use them and removing my eyeglasses, i looked back up, and to our dissapointment, it had vanished from sight. we did not see the moment of disappearance. i noticed the sky in the south and verified that the sky was completely cloudy. i then reasoned that the light was able to be seen even though it was travelling through a cloudy/overcast sky. we briefly discussed the matter then went inside to further our discussion. it is the 24th of july as i am reporting this, and we have not witnessed it again, although we are not really spending any time outside looking for another sighting. we have never experienced a ufo in our lives until that day.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

had moved there in october 1996, and i had been told the river near garbrville was a good destination to start. i was driving 50 mph taking in the scenery and as i rounded a curve i noticed a disc shaped craft near the ridge line across the river.Possibly a half mile away, i watched it move north slowly and then it headed slightly towards me. it was not noticeable because i was traveling straight south and then into another s-curve. then as i came out of that curve i looked and it was directly east of me and much closer.I was concerned because there wasn't alot of traffic.When a car passed going north i tried to make eye contact and the man and women but they did not look in my direction.  i watched the craft another 10 -15 seconds and then it vanished from sight. i arrived into garberville  5-7 minutes later and had a cup of tea. i wasn't sure what to do and hoped nothing happened to anyone,the news paper did not have any reports until a few days later when a small group reported a similar sighting.The first and second views were at an excellent angles. the first at a 45 degrees, the sunlight was just over the ridge and the lighting was picture perfect. the second was equally good, because the craft was just slightly north and east so the reflection off of the craft showed a main body as having a shiny surface rotating clockwise. the dome shape on top was reflective and white silver a touch lighter in color than the main body and not rotating.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1
