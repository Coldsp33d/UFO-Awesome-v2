noticed some triangle lights in one of the pictures.\r\ni immediately looked at the other two pictures i had of that set and i spotted the lights again, but they had moved...\r\n\r\ni called my family

actually watched it for over 20 minutes shapeshift, change color, hover still, go up, down. it looked like it was bobing in the air. i kept watching and saw it shooting out little orbs and sometimes the one orb would turn into two, then back to one. it seemed at times to be rotating very very fast or at least the very bottom of it was. when i focused, the orb of light seemed to have little lights within it, spinning around its venter. i focused on the area around the orb to see what else i could manage to see, it seemed like the orb had a force field that i could see when the object would move because it would make the space around it ripple and warp the area around it, like droping a rock into water but in a closed ball around this object.. then points of light began to appear, hover, then instantly vanish and appear somewhere else.. i was standing watching all this happen with my mother and she saw the exact same thing. a couple times i could have swore i saw little beams of light shoot off the object like solor flares off the sun, it would just shoot of it almost like a jet of gas would look. im not sure if this was a craft with being inside it, or if it itself was the being, hovering as an orb or light, then shifting, changing shape, becomming two, then merging together again, random bulges and twisting motions and rolling made it look like it couldnt decide what it

(not sure if i explained myself very well there). i don't believe the object was a comet, meteor, plane, or left over fireworks from the 4th of july. the object did not change brightness, nor did it sparkle, flash, leave a trail, tail, or anything of the sort. it was a solid aqua glow as it rapidly descended. maybe someone else just happened to be looking at the same direction at the same moment as myself and can back me up, or at least give a clue as to what it may have been. it was like as falling gem in the sky.","distance":"501 Feet -

approching the ship about 45 degrees over the horizon,it approced very quickly simply stopped and hovered for a minute or two and  lowered itself into the bay glowing as it dissapeared under the surface of the water.In disbelief of what i had just witnessed i asked the ensign i was on duty with what did we just see ? and should it be entered into the ships log? his reply was we did not see what we had seen and to enter it would cause detrement to both our careers.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path then

a couple of friends having a good time outside in the winter's snow .\r\nsuddenly the lights in the city went off , our cellphones stop working , and then in the middle of the sky there were 4 to 6 green flashes that expanded the whole sky , keep pulsing at aprox. 1 second from each other , the flashes were so intense that when it was produced it was obscuring your view for the 1 sec. period . after the flashes went of , the electricity and the mobile network came to normal . what is odd , the electricity company that investigated the \"fall\" couldn't find anything wrong at the electricity power plant , and when the lights on the street start coming back , they came on stages , one by one . i felt an odd sensation while during the flashes , me and my friends were mesmerized by the event , after that we went to speak with other people in the park , and they also saw it . the origin of the flashes was a small dot , from where it was pulsating with force , the shape is unknown because the flashes were too strong . there was no recorded landings or after-sights of any ufo-objects after that , but it draw some attention from the government since i saw some black helicopters the next several days in the area .","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

window from my home in coral springs, fl facing west towards the everglades.. i then spotted an object in the sky pulsating with the typical colors and hovering in the air like a boat floats on water.. i have the ability to really get a better view of the movements once the crafts circular (magnetic field?) comes into view which takes some focus on my part.. that's how i can get pin point accuracy on the vertical and horizontal movements within the circle.. i then noticed as is always! the case what seems to be a scout plane that always flys just close enough in the direction of the ufo as if to acknowledge that it can be seen.. this plane is not that big and always has a distinct red light that blinks on and off.. upon looking at the plane i noticed that there were about 3 more ufo's both west and south west above and below 30 thousand feet around midnight then gradually hovering down to what appears to be a destination before 3 am all at simultaneous times.. they were all at one point above tree top level then one by one just centered in on an unknown location and were now out of viewing range.. i was very excited and upset at the same time because my iphone couldn't record the activity.. i would love to know what is the best affordable camera i can buy to record such activity? i viewed the ufo's with a decent pair of binoculars but that was not satisfactory for me.. i have been interviewed by both brian vike and jeff rense live on air back in 2005 in regards to other sightings both here and in new york city.. this is nothing new to me but i do see an increase in activity as of late and would like to discuss my findings with mufon in the very near future.. i am more then certain that i can film future activity.. i just need to know what camera to purchase..
