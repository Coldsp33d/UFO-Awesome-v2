the head.  i just kept looking at it.  it started to descend toward me and i heard a helicopter.  instead it rose up above the barn and i grabbed my 7 x 50 nikon binoculars and zoomed right in on it as it arched up.  is was just a big ball of light.  and then it turned over my open land toward jordan lake and the helicopter came into view and went right for the orb and they both disappeared. over the tree line.  the helicopter had a red and green light and was otherwise dark, but not silent. on sunday morning oct 1, i received a call from my neighbor behind the treeline- 2 acres away who reported to me by phone that a \"drone\" was operating over my property, right over the farm house, on saturday night between 10 and midnight.  i was not there.  the trail cam was tripped at 11:11 pm

dark dart where by helicopters try to find drones.  the roof of the farmhouse was recently painted and is reflective aluminum and it was my impression it was hiding from infrared.  also i perceived the orb itself to have a very specific type of glow, it was not alien to me, and seemed chemical in nature.  it was very close to me and i had the binoculars and was able to zoom right in and observe

arrived home to my apartment complex at about 9 pm. as i exited my car, i heard a loud airplane droning noise. i was immediately curious, because that summer there were incidents where you would hear loud airplane noises during the day that would go on for a long time, but you would look in the sky and see nothing. on this occasion it was night time. i looked up in the sky and a large military seeming plane flew directly overhead flying due west. i watched the plane fly to the west, then turn south, then turn and head back east in my direction. the more interesting thing was now there was a ufo flying in front of it. i would say the ufo consisted of about 5 or 6 red lights which had a laser pen like quality. these lights were connected by lines of the same quality. but the odd thing was that these lights constantly moved in and out, changing and morphing their shape. it was like watching a laser light show flying through the air. this randomly changing light configuration flew by on my left not farther than a city block in distance from me. when it got to about parallel with my location, it changed direction and flew off to the northeast. i've search the internet and haven't found a report of a ufo of this type. i'd love to know if anyone has seem something similar.","distance":"101-500

in front of me, low in the sky what i thought must be a plane or star low in the sky. it was bright white with pronounced white lines surrounding it. much like a child would draw a christmas star. i looked around at the other stars to compare and none had this same look. there was also airline traffic far to the east so i could compare the red/blue/white colors to them as well. it then changed to three circles, orbs if you will, of blue then red but very close together. then it dramatically changed again into a bright white very defined triangle and back to the original star like shape. i cannot tell you how long this process took but not long. i was amazed at how crisp and defined the triangle was. when it was back to the \"star\" shape i noticed it dropping red lights, not orbs, looked like red lines for lack of better description. i was trying to comprehend what i was seeing and i really can't find the right words to describe the things it dropped. i have seen flares dropped from military helicopters and this wasn't even close. i grabbed my cell phone and recorded the object for a short time. i was mesmerized and honestly more interested in seeing it with my eyes and not through a phone. this allowed me to get more detail. it was stationary except when in the three colored circle phase then it seemed to move around. i guess it was in this phase when i recorded it because in the video (crummy, on iphone) it moves quite a bit. it very slowly moved while in star form towards me a bit and i noticed an arc of white light behind it. then it was stationary for some time repeating above process.\r\ni grabbed my friend but she was getting ready for work so she only could see it for a moment. i watched it for probably 20 minutes until it moved west out of view because of trees. \r\ni had no explanation for what i was seeing. i wasn't afraid at all which surprised me. i can't explain it and it may sound odd but i had the feeling they were surveying. this is nothing but a strange, gut type feeling.\r\nwhen i looked at the video which is hard to see unless you zoom in, i was surprised it looked a little different than what i saw in person. it looks like one blue orb with a white light inside and it dances around quite a bit. at the end when it appears to speed upward, that is just me lowering my phone. it was stationary.

extravaganza at longwood gardens in the town of kennett square, pennsylvania which begins at 9:30 pm.\r\n\r\nwe were all lying on blankets on our backs waiting for the show to begin when i saw out of the corner of my eye what looked like a meteorite. i announced it to the other 3 people who were there and then started looking for more possible meteorites. what i saw immediately ended up looking very strange. there were about 8 moving lights in the sky, all darting or zig-zagging back and forth. they would move across the heavens, fade out, and then some would re-appear in a few minutes in ones and twos, each time shooting across the sky in different directions and speeds, some red, some white. they looked like meteorites except they definitely weren't because they lingered for 10-15 seconds, traveled at varying speeds and went in all different directions. they could be distinguished from planes which were just bright lights moving steadily across the sky and stars which were fixed points of light. it was a cloudless night and these were evidently very high up. all four of us saw the same lights at the same time. this kept happening for about a half hour or until the fountain show began.\r\n\r\ni called longwood gardens and asked them whether they utilized any laser lights for their show. they said no. i went online to see whether there were any reports of ufo sightings in the same vicinity. again, nothing.\r\n\r\nwe are mystified by this occurrence and have no plausible explanation for what we all saw.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional
