4 smaller lights on the top blinking and \"dancing\"\r\n(a total of about 5 - 6 lights)\r\n\r\nit was cold outside. very quiet. there was barely even a breeze. during the sighting i heard no noise. nothing.\r\n\r\nin the enhanced video, you can see the indian tree preserve mountains horizon. below it, in the valley, is where the ufo was hovering.\r\n\r\nin the enhanced video, you can see two faint lights on the right floating towards each other. as i properly set up my cameras options and tilt it towards the sky, and back down again, you will notice that the lights have converged together. they are now acting as one unit! some are dancing with each other, some are just floating with the rest.\r\n\r\nnote. i repeat. if you watch the video closely, especially the enhanced version, two dim lights are seen in the beginning of the video on the right. they move closer to each other. then i moved the camera up and back down. by this time the lights were in a cluster and there were more than 2.\r\n\r\nthe enhanced footage starts with the object cropped and zoomed, then replays the video un-cropped/zoomed. it is easier to see this event happening in the un-cropped/un-zoomed portion of the video.\r\n\r\nin conclusion, the objects appeared and converged, then hovered in place, then proceeded to slowly move south.\r\n\r\nthere is also a blinking light in the sky in the beginning of the video above the horizon. i didn't watch this object. it probably was just a plane anyway. i listed that there was a plane in the vicinity of the sighting, though the blinking light that i saw was much further away from the craft i witnessed and i do not think it had anything to do with what i saw. minutes later, a government airplane flew by the area.\r\n\r\nthe footage was shot handheld on a panasonic ag-dvx100b\r\n\r\nattached is the flight path, original untouched video, and the enhanced video.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:01:50","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":49120,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.12125686939748,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07222013-0012","longitude":-122.63386272309532,"occurred":1374469440000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond,   Oval,   Sphere,   Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1374539661000,"summary":"Strange hovering lights dancing with each other low to the ground","tags":["lights","hovering"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/49120_submitter_file1__ufo10pmjuly21original.mov.mov","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/49120_submitter_file2__ufo10pmjuly21enhanced.mov","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/49120_submitter_file3__ufoflightpathJuly21withoutmylocation.png"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"94947","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Novato, California","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:285660"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Valongo","country":"Portugal","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Many ufos here in portugal. for the last weeks i've seen almost everyday maybe 4 times a week, from 9 pm to 6 am, many balls or orbs of light going in many directions, flying in a staright line and while flying they disappear and then appear or turn the light on and they are much farther away but in the same direction and path, then they are heading in a directions, suddenly they turn off or disappear from nothing they appear again flying in the opposite direction. when we see them they are heading in a normal speed then they like progressively turn the light off the light loses its brightness and they keep flying till they disapear completely, when they get very bright, it seems like they are going to explode they seem to get bigger as the light gets more strong and it is very beatiful looks like a flash in the sky. pretty weird, the fact that they appear to get bigger and seem they are going to explode qhen they get brighter. \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":49119,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.1887594,"location":null,"logNumber":"PT-07222013-0011","longitude":-8.498352,"occurred":1373439600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Porto District","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1374538231000,"summary":"Balls of light, like orbs going in many directions, changing path rapidly. they would appear, turn light off whlie flying and then appear in the same path much farther away.

witnesses of same sighting.\r\n\r\nmy sighting details: nine starlike objects ascending one after the other, in quick succession, one behind the other, from a lower altitude, into a higher altitude,yet, still below the clouds, in plain view. speed unknown. after this projection was complete, they hoovered around together in the sky, for about a minute. then, they gradually, began to form a loose, not tightly clustered, vertical line formation, in the sky. after this vertical line formation, they slowly began to separate, and began to form a horizontal line, and travel toward me, and went over my house,at about the speed of an airplane. also, i remember, at this same time, i heard some people in the distance, shouting in surprise. i assumed that they were witnessing this sighting also. when they passed over my house, in a horizontal formation, i counted the nine starlike objects again, and saw them heading toward downtown gary, indiana. i watched the nine,until i could'nt see them, because of the distance. after the sighting,i called 911, and i rode my bike to the aquatorium to find other people who would be witnesses. the security guard was there guarding the gate, but told me he saw the same sighting i saw, in similar detail, but he thought they were stars. i wish someone in your organization would get to the bottom of this, and interview some folks who were at that wedding, and see if this sighting of nine objects, showed up on local radar screens. thank-you\r\n  \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

i don't even feel like telling this next part, but the whole time both these incidents were happening it all felt so connected like deja vu almost, i know it sounds crazy let me explain! in 1986 not far from here in a town called hudson, my mother, brother and i were going home around 930 pm the whole ride home it looked like a star was following us, i kept telling my mom and she kept blowing it off, my brother ann i saw it getting bigger the closer we got home. i remember us making a left down gulf way dr. and then we couldn't see it no more. all of a sudden there is this bright  dull red light it just engulfed the car my mom slammed on the brakes i cant remember how long the light was in the car but it seemed like forever then i remember seeing this red fireball go into the woods on  that road and i remember the light going thru the trees, it wasn't like light. then i remember running in the house with my brother and hiding by the couch and  the all the electricity in the neighborhood started like draining and dimming but not going completely out. my mom acknowledges that whole incident she just don't like talking about it. just when i witnessed those two incidents in just like resonated in my soul and brought me back to that moment as a child! i have witnesses! thank you for listening!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":49111,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.536847949215765,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07222013-0004","longitude":-82.60743467266333,"occurred":1354867200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1374496836000,"summary":"4 other people n i witnessed 5 orbs taking formation in back yard then friends came over we left n were going over to their house it was 9 witnesses n myself who saw 10 of them takiing formation n pulsating on n off ","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"34607","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":227,"locationName":"Weeki Wachee, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:285668"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Pittsburg","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was around 3:30 in the morning i went out into my backyard to smoke, i glanced to the west and noticed what appeared to be an usually bright \"star\" in the sky to the west. i found it to be strange, i own a telescope and keep track on when planets will be visible so i can go out for a viewing, so i knew that there shouldn't be any planets, especially as bright as what i saw, in the position that it was in.\r\n\r\ni'm not sure how long it was visible prior to me going outside and noticing it, but it remained visible for roughly 20-30 seconds as i was observing it. during that time it was completely motionless staying in the exact same spot when suddenly it made this upward movement and within 2 seconds the object/light just faded away.\r\n\r\nduring when it was visible there were no sounds at all that could be heard and the light wasn't blinking, it was just a solid steady whitish light. when i got back in, i pulled up ir satellite to see if there were clouds in the sky and maybe the light faded due to going behind clouds but there were no clouds in the area. perfectly clear night.\r\n\r\ni am left with no explanation as to what i saw, or why it was there in the sky. in my 32 years of being alive, i have never witnessed anything unusual in the sky.

falls. standing along southside drive just west of the chapel looking roughly north towards upper yosemite falls. \r\n\r\nat about 9pm (9:04 on the camera time stamp), myself and another person who was out for the same reason noticed a very bright spot of white light coming over the ridge just left (west) of yosemite falls. it was considerably larger than the stars as well as the airplanes that are frequently visible in the area. we got the impression that it was moving very fast, relative to what we assumed were commercial airliners in the distance.\r\n\r\nwe could not make out a shape other than the round spot of light. it did not blink, pulse or change intensity, it remained constant except as it passed through or above the clouds. it was not below the clouds, other than that, we had no idea how high it might be.\r\n\r\nit seemed to change course very slightly a couple of times before we lost sight of it crossing over the ridge to the south of us. total viewing time was probably about 1 minute. it did not appear to be making any sound or leaving any kind of a trail. \r\n\r\ni have seen many meteors, a comet, satellites in the night sky, lots of airplanes and some missile launches during the day and night. this object did not resemble any of those things in any lighting conditions i have observed.\r\n\r\ni was planing on taking photos of the night landscape using a wide lens and long exposure. there was no time to switch lenses and settings so i just used what was already set and got a single 20 second exposure just before losing sight of the object. although the shutter was open for 20 seconds, the object went out of view about 5 seconds before the shutter closed. \r\n\r\nthe ridge top and trees are at the bottom of the photo, looking roughly south. i did not take time to let the vibrations settle before opening the shutter, resulting in some blur and the squiggly stars. the object seems to suddenly appear at about center of the original photo, this is the point where the shutter opened.\r\n\r\ni also attached a cropped photo for a closer look at the objects path and a photo of yosemite falls showing the clouds and stars present just a minute later, looking towards the north. the object first came into view over the ridge near the left edge of this

(this is why i did not realize i was already viewing the craft initially!) my dad is retired military, so i am familiar with various military aircraft, and this object that i was viewing was nothing like i had ever seen before!!!! unless the military is now having aerial vehicles manufactured that replicate the classic description of a disc-shaped spacecraft, i would state that this was an extraterrestrial aerial vehicle!!!! i also viewed this disc through an 9 mm eyepiece, and a x 2 barlow lens giving a 4.5 mm magnification. the object was hovering for the majority of the time i viewed it, only moving slightly to the right, slightly down, then slightly to the left-i had to reposition my telescope due to this slight movement. i also tried to video tape the bright object with my cell as do not have a standard video camera, but could not successfully obtain an image. i got in my car to see the bright light at a closer proximity (going w-sw), but at a point some buildings obstructed my view and by the time i got to a clearing, the object was gone. this was about an hour of total viewing time. it is truly the most incredible thing i have ever seen in the physical world!!!!","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":49101,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.556507,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07212013-0021","longitude":-116.123872,"occurred":1374383400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Idaho","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1374453670000,"summary":"Very bright light when viewed in telescope revealed dull metallic disc craft!!!!","tags":["disc","light"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"83716","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Boise, Idaho","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:285678"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Helendale","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"1: helendale ca\r\n2: streak in the sky\r\n3: fighter aircraft\r\n4: moved through the sky with contrails and then would dissolve, then would reappear higher in the sky and would then dissolve again.\r\n5: being familiar with all matter of aircraft it was unusual.\r\n6: it dissolved and was lost.
