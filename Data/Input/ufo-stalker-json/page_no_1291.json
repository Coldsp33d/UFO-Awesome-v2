happened before 2003 , but really cant remember the date. \r\nwe usually have power cuts in kerala,india . one day during the power-cut (around 7.30pm) i went and climbed on to the border wall of our compound, near the car shed, so that i could chat with my neighbor buddy,who came out due to the power-cut. we were having a casual talk for a long time, mosquito were biting us & suddenly both of us saw a bright light on the skies a bit towards the north, it was not as big as a moon but seemed as if it was very near than that of the moon, and was the size bigger than that of the stars,it hovered for a while and disappeared leaving trails of light giving us an idea that it moved to the east direction ,while we were watching the skies it immediately reappeared in the skies towards the east direction but not too far away,\r\n\r\nin between my friend asked , what is this & i didn't gave any reply.Suddenly we saw it moved  towards the west direction, leaving trail for a while , and hovered for the final time & disappeared. \r\n\r\nboth of us were stunned and were speech less, we didn't had the courage to speak it to others because of the feeling that no one would believe us. i told it my father . he seemed to be normal and didn't question much.. the chapter was closed , until i came up with some close friends who were really interested in ufos..I spoke out to them and no one els.\r\n\r\n\r\nafter 2004 for my surprise i again saw the same type of light flashing hovering & then moving ,this time direction pattern changed and my dad was also with me, it was during the summer season , we used to sleep in the top of our house for a while... as we were talking both of saw this and i told him that this was what exactly i saw years before along with my friend, and he too was confused , because we have seen meteorites ,shooting stars etc, but never such an event and the direction by which it moves the trails, its closeness to the earth etc, we could clearly say that it was not a natural event .....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ni will try to draw how they  appeared to me in photoshop and upload \r\n\r\n ","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

i was looking at the lake and said to my daughter that it was pretty and close. she said, what was that? i said what? she said that light over there. i said \"i dunno, its probably lightning'. so i looked to the right (west) and saw a flash of light also. i thought maybe it was lightning. it was on the west side of m25, not on the lakeside. then we cleared some trees. there was a corn field about 100 acres. the light was in the middle and you could see that it was flashing also on the trees. we said, maybe its a lighthouse. but then the lights got faster, and we realized it was the wrong side of the road and in the middle of a field. seconds later the lights sped up, changed color and looked like a spinning top upside down. to me, the lights looked blurry and colorful. then the next thing we know we are at port huron. my daughter says, \"that can't be port huron, its 30 minutes still, look at my map\". and i did and it said we were 30 minutes away. also we got home at 12.30 ish

see almost every night. it was shaped as a small triangle with a fourth of to the lower right, the one on the lower right for no apparent reason split into two separate, stars/orbs the second star ascended upwards at a gradual pace. i have notice this happen on different occasion but this time it was connect to the lower one and kind of looked like a string or stick. it appeared to get brighter as it ascended vertically. my wife at the time was getting ready for work so i ran to get her when we returned it was just a single star, i maid a comment jokingly about great its going to make me look like a fool. so i began to describe it to her, as i was doing so it started to do it again, it was by far the brightest thing in the sky at the time, it keeped doing this at a constant pace ascended into a straight line of light then descended back into a single point, it repeated this behavior for at least 30 minutes. it could of went on much longer not sure i ended up going to bed, im not sure but there were defanently two orbs it was hard to tell because it was very bright when it would begin to ascend, im not sure if it was a straight line of light or several orbs emerging from each other in a straight line, it was very high and from were i was it appeared to be a dote that would change into a line roughly or several dotes in close proximaty about 2 to 4 inches in length also as it ascended it got brighter and appear to get wider. i am extremely fascinated by this and would love to hear some feed back if you have any.\r\n\r\nthanks

willing recipient, se of harrisburg route 72. great perfect session had dinner and headed back on rt322/22 to converg with i80. nearly at i80 when dr. pete calls with big hardware problems so we needed to divert and find a meeting spot which ended up at exit 48 on 76 in pittsburgh. turning into a long trip and nearly 2am when finally met up at the exit 48 macdonalds.\r\nwe had a perfect but long session, caring some cyrstals for advanced research and our electronics. first strangeness was at the 322 and route 15 i was hit with this blankness on the left and extrem need to turn to the right once going north but easterly toward i80 frank points out the gps map and we turn around back to the 322 westarly but just before 2 strange men with black glasses and short hair maybe older types in a completely restored 62 dodge van very slowly passed us and looking constantly at us like we were an attraction. a 62 dodge painted blue and white stands out. then we are on i80 and i open my mouth by saying all we needed was to have a cloud ship reveel itself to us! well dr. pete insists on meeting and we divert through dubois south rt 119. while in town the blankness makes me suddenly turn right into a blacked out part of town but we noticed the gps wrong area and went around the block to return to the correct intersection and south 119. a very dark and curvy rout with 55mph signs right next to 35mph signs with curves that were much slower with hills and dale wow.. out in the middle of the country with no lights other than that guy who was following much of the time with brights on so i flipped the mirror but the on comming traffic kept their brights on so it was a difficult stress full to see section. the third blankness turn to the right was at maybe 536 / 36 136? east west with no forward road orther than blackness... it was impearitive that i stear right. the intersection was litup with rolled berms that were painted with the florescent white in a stripped pattern so i went right but this time stopped on the right ramps right berm and remember putting the car in park. it seemed only a couple of minutes frank the other inventor checking the gps and dr. pete is on the phone wondering where are we? strange how the lights were still behind us and they did not pass.... then.... we think the memory wipe reset / video made and the lights dissappeared happened here. we just seemed to anwser the phone check the gps and went around the intersection to the south and onward. i worry about the video because the audio sounds like a train which there were 3 trains at the macdonalds  at x48... although to have been taken there you would have seen myself , dr pete, the 2cars, 5 lanes of traffic and the area was well lit up.At 2am many people came to the drive through  passed by us and looked directly at us toward the the trains?? acouple was making out under the lights next to their car but on the side away from us as well as a person had acar hauling truck come by to service there car. the blankness is like what you see after a camera flash in the face.... nothing! always above and to the left and impossible not to react to. hope you can anaylze the video, trying to send it to john. ... ok i will need to do a follow up on this page as soon as i can find the video again, gees","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

guard shack and pointed them frantically to me saying look at those lights over there.\r\ni looked and to my astonishment there were prolly 15+ glowing redish-orange orbs in the sky northwest over the wooded area of parkville it seemed. i would guess to say they were a few miles away from the english landing park that direction. i sat there and watched the lights come up from the horizon at nighttime. at first i assumed it was flares but as the lights all came up 1 after another in sequence order it seemed strange. then when they were up in the sky they started moving and making a triangle formation. the triangle stayed that way for a good 45 minutes just sitting there and then just ended. 10 minutes later it happened again as i stated above and lasted until about 9pm cst. \r\ndirectly after the lights stopped around 9 pm 4 black helicopters came over parkville/riverside where i work at a very very low altitude. i would say they were prolly 150 ft in the air, enought to where i could see the latchs on the side of the doors on the helicopters at night time. no lights wre on, on any of the helicopters and they were all moving at a amazingly fast pace.\r\n\r\ni did not see anything more after the helicopters and i can only think of what happened.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then
