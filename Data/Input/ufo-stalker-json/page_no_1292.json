am.  when i got outside, i began to see orbs flying rather slowly across sky.  they came from different directions and traveled in different directions.  i got out a high powered flashlight and started flashing the light at them with two pulses at a time.  they did not pulse back the two times that  i did just one long pulse or what i would call bloom for about two seconds.  after continuing to communicate in this way with various orbs for a while, all of a sudden, there were small and large jets all over the area.  they seemed to be searching for the orbs.  i watched the jets, maybe 6 total and figured the orbs were finished for the night.  then another showed up.  it was moving very fast though.  after a while, the jets left the area and i saw another orb.  this one seemed to react to where i was guessing it would go.  it also bloomed more than the rest just at my wishing it would without signal.  very interesting behavior.  i decided to wake up my girlfriend.  she came out and spotted two rather quickly.  they were flying a little higher when she was present.  after she went to bed, the sun began to come up.  i asked aloud if i could get one more spectacular display.  i felt silly, but i really felt as though the lights were reacting to my actions and thoughts.  i even had a witness to prove to myself that these orbs were really flying overhead.  it was bright enough that i could not see a single star.  suddenly, the largest brightest orb yet flew closer to me than any other.   as i got excited and felt an almost electric charge in the air, the orb bloomed from white into a huge spectacular green glow over about two seconds.  it definitely reacted to my emotions.  after words, it made a 90 degree turn and flew away at high speed.  one of the strangest events of my life.  i have seen many unexplained things in the sky and see orbs quite often.  i had no apprehension that night and the lights responded to that by coming closer and responding to me.  i would never believe it if someone told me the same story and i expect no one to believe me.  take it for what it is worth.  next time you see an orb, as i know some of you see them as frequently as i do, try to communicate with it and do not fear it.  you may be surprised at the response you get.  this is by far the craziest thing i have ever written, but it happened sure as the sunrise that morning.  i think they responded to me and the military responded to them.  amazing.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

west end (former nepean, near bayshore shopping center). i got up from bed about 10 mins. later and looked out window. i noticed a glowing orange light behind neighbour's house across street, facing se. it was in the distance, perhaps 1-2 kms. away. it was moving across the sky in a slow, smooth arc. while it is not unusual to see planes in they sky at night as the airport is south of here (about 17 kms.), several things were unusual to me:\r\n1) the light was a bright, glowing orange with the center a slightly more intense colour than the edges. \r\n2) the object glided sooo smoothly.\r\n3) the object was moving at quite a high speed.\r\n4) the object was not moving in a path normal to what i have witnessed from airport landings and take-offs in the area. this object was ascending from an area that was to the west of the airport. \r\ni knew when saw the object it was not a plane. i have sometimes heard helicopter flights in this area at night, so i wondered if it could be a helicopter, however it was gliding too smoothly and moving too fast to be a helicopter, also, while i have seen infrared light on board a helicopter at night this was a completely different (the entire object was lit). i wondered if it could be a satellite. the object moved from across the sky in an arc pattern, extremely smoothly. there was no contrail. i tried to measure the speed by observing the space between 2 trees and it took 20 seconds to cross this space which was, from my bedroom window, about 300 feet. the object was about the size of an aspirin. at the time i first noticed the object there were clouds moving low on the horizon in the same direction as the object. i very much wanted to wake my husband but felt it more important that i continue observation of the object as it was moving and i knew there was not time to get binoculars either. i lost sight of the object when it moved behind a tree in my sightline, it did not emerge or emerged too low to be seen by me.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

1;30-2pm in south carlsbad, ca just near la costa canyon high school. a large white helicopter was circling a nearby shopping center (life flight helicopter?) which got my attention and i noticed that above it and towards the east there was a white or brightly reflective metallic cigar/cylindrical/saucer shaped object 45+ degree's and hovering completely motionless and at a slight angle. the helicopter made a lot of noise so not sure about any noises from the object but it def. was not a plane, helicopter, balloon, bird, etc. it was very defined in shape, highly reflective, not sure on exact height but higher than the circling helicopter. i was driving and looking, pulled over quickly to just stare at it to see if it was actually stationary, and it was motionless. i made the mistake of not taking a cell phone camera picture and was hoping to see it at my house just a few blocks away where i could yell for relatives to come see, get binoculars, take pics but i could not see it from my house or it had vanished(?) very disappointed that i did not take a picture when i had the chance. it was against a perfectly blue sky with bright sunlight just behind/above me and it would have had the helicopter in the forefront of the picture as well for scale and comparison. i have always believed in ufo's strictly based on mathematics/probabilities but had never seen one until yesterday. i have looked at thousands of pictures and videos and would not have reported this unless i thought it to be genuine. it looked similar to the one reported a few months ago 30 miles south in santee, ca.\r\nbecause of the helicopter circling so low and loudly in this crowded residential area there must have been other people who saw this as it was perfectly sunny/blue sky and obvious/easy to see. i have not checked with carlsbad police or news to see if anyone else reported anything but cannot imagine that i would be the only one to see it especially with all of the activity of the white helicopter.  would like to know if anyone else saw this event! contact mufon!","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

see this \"orb\" fly in, but it stopped a mile or so short of passing over our house (my wife and i were both witnesses). as my wife went to get out of the tub, i said, \"look at that strange red object glowing in the sky. it is much brighter than a star or an airplane, and it stopped on approach and just stayed stationary, after drifting a few degrees over to the west.\" she replyed, \"looks like mars is on fire, i need to get out!\" (she was too warm, not afraid or anything like that.) i remained in the tub observing the object which did not move. during that time, i was able to observe several commercial planes in the sky and could clearly hear them overhead at 30,000 feet, or so. i would guess these orbs, judging on how they drifted or flew into san luis airspace, were ca. 5000 to 7500 feet high. hard to judge, but i have flown planes in the past and often watch them fly in and out of the slo airport, the control tower light of which is visible from my back yard and

for better observation. it was hard to focus on the objects so i laid on the back deck to better brace myself and steady the view. from that vantage i could see through the binoculars that there was no \"structure\" to observe, and what looked like a glowing orb(s) was actually a red-orange light that was moving or rotating very rapidly and in a random fashion. they all looked like that. as my wife and i were watching, talking, and trying to figure out what they might be, they just kinda faded-out. first the four that stayed together, then the one that drifted over to the first, and then

the north-west- but both nights each object was seen & either  on the   17th-immediately suddenly being followed by almost silent helicopters & jets, & the 18th- as the object had juust past over head, to my right/northish- suddenly jets came from the south west & a helicopter from south & the object went from light blue-white almost a light blueish-lavenderish to invisible-\r\n\r\n i have watched the skies for years at night, & seen a lot of crazy unexplainable things- and i live north of burbank airport, & a helicopter pad is on the mountain north east of me by the 210 freeway- so i see a lot of planes & helicopters all the time & know the difference between a known object & unknown one-- & i dont report everything i see, even the really crazy flashes of light, or fireball looking like things that look like they disintegrate, or the flash paths like someone streaked a glow stick thru the air that left a trail for a few seconds, or the very high up blue-ish white lit up/glowing lil lines, they look like flying hyphens, and they move thru the sky very high up at high sppeds & change direction, speed, & dissapear or dim down randomly & will blink at u- there are a lot of flying \"lights\" n diff colors ive seen- red, white, blueish, orangish, redish , greenish- its odd- or a white star like obeject moving fast fly up to a \"star\" & stop in the place of the star as the \"star\" that had been sitting there for hours suddenly takes off north-- or a very big flash of yellow/blueish light & a big yellow shape that is hard to explain that disappears suddenly- or the very quickly odd blinking lights that seem to blink at stars that blink the same way back as if i dunno, communicating or something- i know that sounds crazy but ive seen it hundreds of times the last 4 years- \r\nbut when i see something that is being tracked, or followed by a few other known objects like jets & black (almost silent) helicopters, then its something being seen or acknowledged by people other than just me & my boyfriend-\r\n***\r\non the 17th- around 9pm- i was outside in my back yard playing with my dog- and w have big power lines over the horse pasture behind our house-& im always checking the skies when im outside- and notice stars seem to act or shine differently when something is going to happen or is happening-& i noticed the stars to the south east of me out of the corner of my eye then looked at them seeming odd- & then- it caught my eye-to the east, i saw a white bright star- moving from south to north-west- it slowed down, randomly, n would dim a bit, usually as it approached a star area, & then would brighten back up & speed up- & as soon as it got to the north more a bit east of me/my position, it curved its path to north west- and over the mountain line below it flew out a helicopter going fast and followed below it- it was semi high up- where planes usually fly-and i could hear a helicopter coming from the west- as the star like object flew northwest it went out of my view, but then a jet flew out from south west in the direction it had flown- the helicopter below the object that had been following it, stayed with it as far as i could see- some other odd things happened that night- but this was the most acknowledged by helicopters & jets that i saw that night-\r\n\r\non the 18th- around 9-930ish- i was sitting outside his house facing west, watching the sky- & a similar sight occurred- at my boyfriends house- he lives at the bottom of the suburban housing area in sunland- & his property is next to the lake view terrace/hansen dam area- & close to the golf course there thats kinda off the 210 freeway- & next to mountains & protected forest area- & we have seen a lot of random odd things in the sky there before- some things that i had never even seen before at my own house- but last night a small hyphen/dash like object high up in the sky, that was blueish-white- almost a light lavender-ish was moving from south east, up to right above me high up- & when it got close to stars they would either dim down a bit, or they would blink as it got close or they would jump around in place- i know it sounds crazy but it is hard to not see & ignore- & the object was moving from south east to north west then to straight north- it would slow down when it got near sum stars, then speed up- and as it got to my right- north almost to the mountain top edge high above it- it suddenly just dimmed down & was not visible anymore- but when it had reached right directly above me- a fast moving plane came from south west- & suddenly a helicopter was coming from the south east- and as they got closer to me from the south both heading directly where the dash-obejct was- it when it started dimming- slowly & after it passed over he big dipper handle middle star- it dimmed out completely & i couldn't see it- for a lil while i could barely see a difference in the sky around it that it had gotten as it began to dim & could follow it kinda with my eyes seeing only this odd surrounding change in the sky & a slight trail- then it was gone- i just couldn't see it anymore- but the plane/jet flew straight where it had been & then over the mountain- as did the helicopter-\r\ni also go online & check the satellite projection sights & times to make sure it wasn't just a satellite you can see float across the sky- but last i checked, satellites do not slow down & speed up, or dim & brighten randomly or change direction- & im pretty sure helicopters & jets wouldn't be flying out to follow a satellite- but i found online that both nights, there were no visible satellites at those times in those locations or traveling in the same direction path that the two objects i've reported were seen- \r\n\r\nthere is a picture attached from the night of the 17th- on my way home- this odd bright light floating through the sky that i saw from the freeway & when i got off at the exit to the stop light- had moved north west from where id seen it originally- & it looks a lot like the starlike object i saw moving later that night on the 17th- i cropped it to be able to see it better- taken from my iphone out my window- at the exit up the main blvd from my house-\r\n***\r\nthere have been many times i have seen something fly in the sky or go across it, & then have seen helicopters & jets fly out to where it was & follow the direction it took- but usually always right after it dims out or has flown out of sight- but seeing two nights in a row- things following something odd so close to it- i thought id at least report it- i have tried to video tape these events with my iphone before & always can barely even see any stars show up in the footage-i don't know how to get a zoom that can pick up & record the flying lights- but over the years i have had friends see things with me- & over the past few months have been happy to have my boyfriend finally watch with me & witness these kind of strange events & sights- & that always helps to confirm ur not seeing things that aren't there- even tho i've had numerous friends & my brother & mother see things with me, flying or streaking thru the sky- or just stars moving around a lot that defy what u think we all know- so ive had confirmation i'm not just seeing a weird optical illusion or anything- \r\ni am working on finding a recording device that can capture these strange flying \"lights/stars/dashes\" to provide visual evidence","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

the floor.  i looked out the windows toward the west and saw an object hovering.  i could not tell how far away or how large due to tree -leaf  interference but it appeared to be quite close and large.  no sounds were heard.  the top surface appeared flat with the section below having what appeared to be compartments, or partitions rather than \"windows\". there was a dark, dense level beneath these, with another level of compartments, or partitions beneath the dark dense level. then below the second level of compartments was what appeared to be a flat surface. so it was not round.  it had depth, width, and height.  the compartments were large and black. what lit up and blinked randomly was the surface around the compartments.  the colors were consistently white, yellow, blue, red, and green.  i could see the reflection of the light emanating from it reflected on the trees and leaves around it.  some light from it reflected even into the sunroom.  i could determine no pattern to the blinking changing colors.  it remained stationary - not wavering or wobbling or shifting at all.  there were times when i studied it with a monocular and could see quite clearly.  i saw no movement within the craft.  there were times i wondered if i might be witnessing a hologram.  while observing this object, i noticed brightening light reflecting in a different area of the floor of the sunroom.  i had to bend forward from my chair to see the source.  when i looked through the treetops i thought it was the moon, although i wasn't sure. ( i'm not sure what phase the moon is currently in in this area.)  i returned my attention to the other object.  after a short time, i noticed the light on the floor getting brighter from the \"moon\", so i turned to look and didn't even have to bend forward in the chair before i saw what was obviously not the moon!  this object was a bright, gold orb.  it grew larger and brighter.  as i watched it, it either became smaller or moved very quickly far away.  then it became one gold light with a smaller gold light to the right with a gold \"bar\"  shape forming beneath it.  i had been witnessing these two objects for, i suppose, about half an hour or more.  nothing about the first object changed.  it just hovered and blinked.  i felt compelled to simply accept that they were there and that was that.  i went to bed.  they were still hovering when i retired.  these are not the only or first ufos i have witnessed here.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":49044,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.468582,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07192013-0007","longitude":-84.954178,"occurred":1374039600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Tennessee","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1374257289000,"summary":"Two distinctly different ufos.  they both hovered and changed brightness. they both exhibited purposeful behavior/maneuvers.  partitions/windows noted in one with upper/lower levels. no other activity noted - no occupants noted.","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"38556","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2,"locationName":"Jamestown, Tennessee","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:287280"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Holyoke","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was talking to my husband on the telephone when i noticed the object approaching my house - traveling over the tree line and coming across the connecticut river to the holyoke side.  the lights were really bright.  i could tell it was not a plane or helicopter as the shape was different and it made no sound.  it traveled very slowly and appeared to hover at times.  i ran out on our deck as it disappeared when crossing over my house. it was really strange. the phone and electrical service in my house were not affected.  the next morning i went out into my back yard and noticed lots of dark spots on a new stone patio that we just had put in.  the spots do not come up when scrubbing them.  it just looks like something dark splattered all over the patio.  the spots do not appear to be oily, they almost look like burn marks.  there are also some spots on an area of shingles on the roof of my house.\r\ni did not hear anything about this on the news, however i decided to google and see if anyone had reported seeing anything.  sure enough someone in the belchertown and amherst ma, area reported a sighting on the same date and just a little earlier than when i sighted the object. \r\nthis makes the fifth sighting for me in the past 40 years.

of the time my father saw lights that he could not identify.  he was in the army, ultimately becoming a green \r\nberet.  that was all that was ever said while my father was alive.  after his death in 2002, my mother began telling more of the story.  the light flew right over the car.  my father was suddenly driving on a different highway.  it was two hours later than he thought.  my mother knows nothing about ufos, much less abductions. at the time, my mother was 5 months pregnant with my younger brother. i was watching a program that mentioned the lonnie zamora case and looked up socorro on a map.  when i spoke to my mom next, i asked her about the drive from memphis to mesa. \"did we take 40 into flagstaff?\" \"no, we went south on 25 and took 60 to phoenix\".  that put us in socorro, four months before the lonnie zamora incident.\r\ni remember as a child, odd memories that seemed like vivid imagination.  i remember at the age of five, living in a haunted house.  my sister and i shared a room and my 3 year old brother slept in my mom's room.  this happened while my father was in viet nam.  i would see a bright flash and then the ghosts would come.  they would walk past my bedroom, down the hall to my mother's room.  there were always two small ghosts and one tall ghost.  in another house, i remember being so scared at night. my \"other\" family would come and take my brother.  i used to be so afraid that they would leave me behind and i used to hold my brother's hand very tight so when they came to take him, they would wake me.  i remember being upset with them that my brother got to fly and i didn't.  one night, they let me hover across a field next to our house.  \r\nthere were some other odd dreams i had as an adult regarding the abduction.  one dream over two different nights.  my brother lived for years in dallas working the night shift for about 7 years and living a very isolated life.  he currently lives with my mother to care for her.","distance":"20 Feet or

ascended from the horizon tree line in the field in front of my house (approximately .5-.75 of a mile away). it stopped about half way between the moon and the ground. it hovered for a little a bit ( a red, glowing ball at this point). it then sped up, heading southeast (now it looks white and cylindrical and somewhat out of focus) i describe its movements as gliding or floating. we continued to watch it go and then it was gone like it just disappeared.  i was the first to witness called my youngest son and nephew to look first they saw it.  then ran in the door to get my other two sons and husband to see it.  husband had no interest. oldest son said it looks like a firework but i don't have my glasses on and they both went inside. so i, my 2 sons and nephew stayed to watch it. the two youngest boys started taking pictures with cell phones.  so we do have some pictures. although the pictures do not quite show what we were witnessing. the iphone showed white bright streaks and the lg showed bright red and yellow lights in a saucer shape. i was not scared maybe excited but really just trying to grasp what i was looking at.  we are used to seeing medivacs and airplanes in our dark skies but this was nothing like those.  that is why i was so excited to have the others witnessing it with me.  i also was realizing that when we see helicopters there is usually some kind of noise.  there was no noise coming from this object. we estimate the whole scenario took no more than 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nnote: the pictures seemed to have removed the red glow. what is left seems to be

rain becuase weather changed suddenly, with low dark clouds moving in, but no thunder or lightning observed.\r\n\r\ni had just emptied the kiddie-pool so i could move it to another spot on the grass.

would see what i have been seeing on and off for about 10 months;that being ufos around my home normally in the late night early morning hours. the first time i saw one of these objects i thought it was a star but as i watched it a little longer i noticed it seemed to be moving towards me and the twinkling got very bright at times sort of like a camera flash but much bigger and brighter. the closer it got to me the more confident i was that it wasn't a plane or helicopter or any other aircraft i have ever seen.  at the same time i could start distinguishing different colors the closer it got but at a distance it just seemed like white light. it's hard to describe how these lights looked at different distances. the object would at times \"twinkle\" like it was a star giving off just clear white light at varying intensties but i was getting the impression that when this happened it was actually trying to disguise itself because that's what it would do until the other ufo would show itself. evidently the other ufo was already there not far from this one but not showing itself or it just got there and appeared. i think the other ufo was already there but was just hiding and waiting for the one i was observing to appear. the reason i say this is because i don't remember seeing any of the other colors on the first one until the second one appeared. then they both were multi-colored and it's like they were flashing different color patterns at each other. like i said the first one was moving toward me to begin with so i'm assuming the other one was just moving along with it. i estimate the first one i saw to be about 2500 to 3000ft and when the second one appeared it was about 500-1000ft lower. the first got to within approximately 1 mile to me and the second one appeared within a 1/2 a mile or maybe a little closer. i'm pretty close because i am judging from landmarks in the area where i've been living for about 40 years. when the second craft appeared it was moving at really close to the same speed as the one i had been observing. at this point when the second one appeared they were both at least 2 to 2 1/2 miles from me. the closest being the second one was about 2 miles from me and both moving very slowly because it took about 30 minutes to move to within 1 mile from me. that's really slow. i started getting eaten alive by the mosquitos but as much as i was getting eaten i wanted to stay and watch. i had to go inside even though i didn't want to. my wife was sleeping and i wanted to get her new camera but i didn't know where she had it and the battery was dead anyway. i got my phone because it has a little camera on it and i grabbed my old 35mm canon. i also grabbed an old pair of binoculars and slung them around my neck. when i got back outside they were both pretty much in the same place but both had started moving exactly opposite away from me but at the same speed. i could not take a picture with anything i had and i couldn't use the binoculars either because everything immediatley fogged up, even my phone. it's summer in louisiana still pretty warm around 80 degrees at night but it's around 68 in the house. all i could do was watch as they slowly moved away from me. now both ufos started gaining a little speed moving east and soon i would say within 4-5 minutes they were in the glow of the lights of the next town which was about 6 miles from me when one of them turned to the north or rather just changed direction like due north then just vanished. the other ufo kept its heading but also started gaining speed and altitude and it had started going what looked to me like straight up. it was still flashing every color of the rainbow except i never recalled any greens of light from it. at this time as it climbed it is like it just shot out of sight and at the same instant a streak of white came shooting to the ground right exactly where it had been. what come from the night sky didn't look like it was just falling it looked like it had been projected from the sky at a tremendous rate of speed. it looked like a white hot burning projectile that left a huge streak of white light behind it as high as i could see. so high you couldn't tell how high it actually started. it just ended. it didn't make any noise, i couldn't see any smoke along with the light trail it extended from or anything almost like lightning but it wasn't lightning it was a straight line. this was the strangest thing i have ever seen. it was just a white streak of burning hot light. and even stranger still the light ended right exactly where the last departing ufo's flight path was. i did not see this streak of light hit anything. i didn't hit the ground either it stopped right where the last ufo i watched started going up. this all happened about 2 weeks ago. only reason i'm reporting it is because i am still seeing them pretty frequently. i am trying to be prepared to get some kind of video documentation now. when i get it i'll submit it. also, i don't think that if i'm seeing them this oftenj i can't believe that i am the only one seeing this stuff. if anyone saw this same thing please just say you saw it too. just so i'll know i'm not the only one. i finally got my wife to see two just flying down the middle of our little country road the other night. now she believes me but she's scared too.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional

could see them through the trees. i was mesmerized, i noticed a star over the tree tops that was flashing red, blue, yellow, white, i assumed it was a satellite, but the flashing lights on the horizon
