road every day it seemed a little odd. when i looked up i was just in peer shock!!! there was a very large craft above me, it blocked out all stars and a majority of the night sky. the object looked as though it was hovering at first, however, as i continued on east burlington in a west direction i came to a red stop light at linn street, that's when i got a superb look at it. being on my scooter i had a non obstructed view of the craft, the craft wasn't hovering, it was moving very, very slowly se at no more than 1-5 knots. there was no sound what so ever! the lights on the craft where interesting, there where 2 lights, one was a pink to red to white light, the other was a blue to green to white light. the lights where slowly changing like christmas tree lights. the craft was a triangle shape in dark color, i cant say it was black necessarily but it was very dark (it was night). i unfortunately was already late to work and could not take a photo. how ever i did observe the craft as i continued to work until buildings obstructed my view, this sighting from start to end was roughly 5-10 minutes. i grew up next moffitt air field in mountain view, ca, where i have seen everything from the space shuttle (nasa is on moffitt) to stealth bombers (prior to being announced to the public) landing at moffitt before i was even 12 years old. my step-dad also worked at aimes

was standing in my drive talking to my son when this ball dropped out of the clouds. the brightness of it is what caught us. we watched it droop and then come to a stop. as it drooped though i noticed it had a light blue flamed tail coming off the top. then when it came to a stop the tail came down into it. it hovered for a few seconds then moved quickly to the left again with a tail coming out from the right and then when it stopped the tail moved back into it. the tail would appear each time it moved. then it moved extremely fast to the right and stopped once again just hovering. then slowly moved back to center and stopped. this is when i started to take mental notes. the center of it was bright sun orange and moved. the only way i can describe it is it moved like lava. out side the sphere around the edge line was a light blue glow i guess like a radiant heat coming from it. the size was huge. if you were standing beside a commercial airliner that's the size it was but at two to two and a half miles out. so i'm sure if it was right over me it would of been much larger. the sound... none. nothing came from this thing. at all. it is very quit in our nieghborhood and there was nothing else in the sky around it. i made a note to look around for anything else in the sky. once it came back to center it stayed for a few more seconds then dropped down making a u shape in the sky. then in tenths of a second shot off due west and was gone. i know what it wasn't, i just don't know what it was.

wait for each other,as they got closer together they lined up in sets of three verticly with 20 or 30 feet between them, once each group had three lights they started gaining altitude and once they got around 3500 ft they started disappearing from the top light down. three groups of three did the exact same thing and when the third group started disappearing 2 more lights appeared on side of mtn and they headed in same direction as others but moving a lot faster and dissappeared at about same altitude.  this whole process happened in less than 5 min. i live on adjacent mtn  and they appeared halfway up mtn at about same elevation as my home and the mtn is less than a half mile away. my family also witnessed this as well as two other people. there wasn't any sound. i witnessed the same kind of lights about 6 or 7 years ago but  they formed two triangles instead of vertical lines and seemed to have smaller objects going back and forth between the orange lights. cant explain but i

moving in a straight horizontal line in hops that had to be at least 2 to 3 miles in distance. it looked as though it were traveling on a road at first but then as it traveled from south around to the

see if dog was bothered by something. looked around and saw strobing lights approximately 3 miles ne of property. got binoculars and looked, retrieved, child, dog and keys to vehicle and drove into town to the nearest location or approximate location for a closer look. found above a water tower just out of town near the back side of the high school ... looked again in binoculars to large to determine size had a smaller attachment to it and we became scared and tried to hurry out off the bluff but the road had been rutted out by water washing off the bluff. once off the bluff drove back out of town to residence, let the dog out and it ran away, never saw the dog again. arrival time was approximated 330am to 4am loss track of time. next morning friend arrived at the home and told us there had been a ufo siting and i told her we saw it, we had a contact with it. didnt report it because it seemed like it was normal and not important to anyone but us. later i attempted to find out if there had been other instances of other 1997 sightings. emailed roswell and it was unimportant to them. saw a show on larry king cnn and got the mans name who stated there was a sighting in arizona and contacted him by email and the return email seemed unimpoartant to them.... i let it go untill i began to experience harassing events approximately 2009, began with a property purchase and my dogs

evening sun. as i returned home i took my wife upto the top floor of our home and looked out of the window at the phenomenon and proceeded to take photos on my mobile phone (samsung galaxy s2). it wasn't until we were looking at the photos that i noticed in one of the pictures there appears to be two objects one looked to be metalic and spherical and the other looked to be more like a disk shape also a solid metalic object. we did not see or hear anything at the time and there is nothing on any of the other pictures taken. \r\n\r\nplease look at the attached photo. the objects can be seen on the left hand side of the picture close to the light phenomenon around the sun.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":49002,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":53.78108794772565,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-07172013-0005","longitude":-1.5357642844340336,"occurred":1373942100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":null,"reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,
