object traveling very fast towards the venue from the northwest. there had been several airplanes flying overhead occasionally, however, this did not look or move like a plane or a helicopter. right after i noticed it, the craft slowed down and hovered for a few seconds, then it circled around back and forth on the west side of fiddler's green. i immediately thought it was something odd and turned my husbands attention to it so he could tell me what he thought. he also thought it was something odd, and not just a plane or helicopter. we had never seen anything identifiable move in all directions like that. when it was at it's closest point to us we could both clearly see it's green, blue, red and white lights pulsating and definitely saw it spinning. you can hear me say it in the video. i started recording after viewing it for about a minute and a half. the object seemed curious, as if it were scouting the area, particularly the venue we were at. after circling a couple of times it headed back northwest out of our sight. i couldn't decide if it was something military or something \"not of this world\". i have been very interested in unexplained phenomenon for many years, so i have been excited and curious to find out what it is we actually witnessed, and if anyone else witnessed it. i was completely sober, unlike many of the people there at the concert, so my vision and perception of what i saw was definitely clear.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:03:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then

want people to think i was crazy and have held this inside for many years and only now feel like i can tell. i was 26, married, had 4 children.  it was about 7pm, dark, winter time, i was driving home and felt like someone was watching me.  i couldn't shake the feeling.  i had to calm myself down.  and then, i was at home. that confused me.  i went on to bed that night, not remembering the fear i had earlier of someone following me. suddenly, i was awake and staring into the big black eyes of a creature, standing on my right side. his arms were long and he was just skinny and a grey appearance.  i tried to scream, but couldn't. nor could i move.  i could see my husband sleeping in my peripheral view.  as i said, the creature was at my right side, and three others, much smaller standing at the foot of the bed.  i felt like the one at my right, was some kind of instructor and the three were learning from him.  they seemed a little afraid of me and huddled close.  then the one close to me spoke to my mind and i understood his thoughts.  he said, \"i won't hurt you, and you won't ever remember this.\"  then, he took an instrument like a pen with a light and touched my upper groin area. it was then, i remember being naked. and as he ran this pen object down from my groin, and down my upper thigh, i started screaming from the pain, only no sounds were coming out.  i screamed for my husband to wake up and help me.  it felt like the object was pulling all of my tissue out of my leg, extracting everything away.  he took  the object to my right above my knee and pulled it away.  he was right, the next morning, i remembered nothing.  but i started having nightmares.  they were all the same; a huge black spider coming down his web from the ceiling to hurt me.  i would jump out of bed, screaming, and take whatever object that was near me and start swinging, screaming, \"get away from me!\"  my husband, of course, would wake up and try to to calm me down.  he was clearly shaken by this strange behavior of mine.  it frightened him.  after the third nightmare, and reaction to it being the same; i then remembered.  i was terrified, and worried that if i told my husband he would think i went insane.  so i said nothing.  after remembering, the nightmares ended.  the second one was when i lived in east texas.  i was 48.  i was at home alone asleep.  my husband a truck driver was gone. i woke up and saw flashing red, yellow, blue, green lights in a circled pattern in my front yard. i was watching them from my bed.  the pattern seemed to be going around a dark disk shape. suddenly, i wasn't in my bed anymore but on a steel oblong table.  the same grey (instructor i'll call him) spoke to me telepathically, \"i won't hurt you.\"  i spoke back telepathically, \"that's what you said to me the last time. you lied.\"  there were other greys around the table 4-5 watching.  he took out an instrument and ran it slowly over my brain like doing a massage. it was shaped like a pen also with a light.  as he moved the pen to different areas of my brain, the sensation was so euphoric, i really didn't want him to stop. i never experienced such sensation. then when he was done, he spoke again, \"see, i told you so.\"  and as odd as it seemed, it looked like he was pleased in my response.  and strangely, as well, i wasn't afraid any more of him.  my first two husbands passed away without me telling about this.  my third husband i told, but he just can't believe it.  there is a friend who found out about my story, and he was ecstatic.  he also is a believer and had several visitations.  it felt so good to be around other people who have experienced an encounter with aliens.  i have no proof except i have osteoporosis, had 3 hip replacements. the right hip had to have another one only three years later.  the doctor said, i just didn't have enough bone.  i wonder if it wasn't from the first abduction on my right leg.  i wish i had more evidence.  if i get to meet this instructor again, i feel in my inner being, he would let me ask questions. but thanks for being out there for all of us who have had the experience.  it is such a relief, to know we are not crazy.  ps my occupation: retired register nurse.","distance":"20 Feet or

parts, it happened around midnight, i spotted a large white sphere orbiting the 3/4 moon, after a minute the sphere blinked out and appeared probably 1000 miles from its original lunar orbit, a minute passed again and the sphere blinked out and reappear in its original lunar orbit,it did this several times, it was enough time to get corroborating witness, then it vanished, i work odd hours so im used to being out in the middle of the night, i like to stargaze, approximately an hour later i stepped outside again for a smoke and this is when the 2nd sighting happened,(no corroborating witness this time), only reason i looked up was i heard a small propjob plane go by with its classic light pattern, after the plane passed thats when i noticed a sphere flashing  all colours of the spectrum above the tree line but right below the clouds so probably a few miles up from my south westerly line of sight, it was very odd, it was bright like a star but multicolored and definitely in earths lower atmosphere, weird thing about was as i was watching i noticed i could not keep my eyes focused on it even though it was stationary,by this time i was very intrigued about what this thing in the sky could be, i happened to have my 350 lumen led work light with me, i proceeded to shine my light at this hanging anomaly in different strobe patterns, as i did this the wavelength of colors started to change and the object started list left and right and up and down but still staying in its general original sighting area, when i could focus my eyes on it the the colors were amazing, this all took place within a 1 to 2 hour time frame, then at which the object slowly moved northwest gaining altitude till it disappeared behind the tree line from my line of sight. im pretty familiar with

bright or burning descending towards us.  at first glance i thought it was an ember from fireworks falling because it was so bright but it wasn't falling, rather it was hovering slowly from east to west.  it seemed to descend closer to us and move even more slowly to the west.  we were debating what it could be.  the only thing i'm familiar w that could fly like that is a helicopter.  it had been cloudy/rainy off/on all day so we were wondering aloud if it was a helicopter with its searchlight turned on but obscured by clouds.  even while speculating we knew it was unlike any helo or aircraft we've seen before.  it was completely silent.  in simplest terms it was like a ball of fire in the sky that randomly varied in brightness and color.  it didn't have defined edges rather it was hazy or diffuse.  i kept thinking that as it seemed to descend lower (and glow brighter orange) it would be more discernible but the closer it got it seemed more blurry.  it seemed to follow an east to west course.  at its closest though (maybe 100 feet? hard to judge distance and size) it looked like the fire/glow seemed to emit upwards from a flat bottom (saucer shaped?); the fireball looked more dome shaped closer.  i couldn't discern a flat bottom but only briefly it did appear the light wasn't emitting downwards due to some straight line boundary. when it was further away it seemed round/oval and the light appeared to emit/radiate evenly in all directions)  it moved so slowly and at first stayed as low or lower than a helo would fly.  we observed it for a few minutes feeling mostly in awe and a little frightened.  i went in to get my teenage daughter and her friend and a camera or phone (bf stayed outside).  even though this took maybe one minute by the time i got back outside it had travelled a good distance away (a mile or more maybe) & while the girls saw the bright, flickering light that moved oddly (directional maneuvers like a helicopter but faster than a jet when it left) it was too far away when they came out to be as stunned as my boyfriend and i were.  as it left it appeared to be heading from east to west then arced to the northwest and ascended at an amazing rate of speed.  we were sober btw.  i am so glad my bf saw it too, because he is very practical and would never believe it had he not seen it himself.  i have no idea the size of this thing but if i had to guess i'd say it was probably smaller than a helo.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

the moon going in counterclockwise cirlces for about 2-3 minutes and i was able to snap a couple of pictures with my phone. after about 4 minutes though it began its departure. it shot south and up and then north and up in a zig zag pattern and then it was gone. it did not accelarate at an unbelievable rate but it was faster than anything i have ever seen. and i live in the air capitol! once i saw it start leaving i ran inside to grab my good camera (my wife is a professional photographer) that would have been much better than my phone. i watched the skies for about another hour afterwards but saw nothing else except a few airplanes pass by. again, i live in an area with a lot of airplane traffic, these were nothing out of the ordianry. i have the pictures i took on my phone and i have the negatives to prove they werent photoshopped. i have played with some editing software a bit to try and clear the pictures up but the phone's camera severely limited me. i made some crops so the entity could be seen better. i also have the originals.","distance":"Over One

around 9 pm after the heat of the day wanes, but last night we got a late start.  i left my house at 10:10 pm.  i'm sure of this time because, i was using my pedometer on my phone and it records the time.  i had paused just after beginning the pedometer to text my friend because i had seen flashes of lightening and wanted to make certain he still wanted to go.  since we didn't know whether the lightening was heat lightening or the precursor to a storm, we decided to go ahead with the walk.  \r\n\r\nbased upon the information on my pedometer, i probably met my friend about 10:20 pm.  since it was so late, we decided to cut the walk short.  we were going to take the alley on the west side of the bartholomew county public library, which intersects with 7th street.  just after we entered the alley (at approximately 6th street), my friend pointed towards the sky and said, \"look at that.\"  we have often talked about the fact that he typically is not very observant, so it was surprising that he had noticed the object in the sky. i glanced to where he was pointing, a bit eastward of the alley that we were standing in. once again, based upon my calculations from my pedometer, this would have been approximately 10:30 pm eastern time on sunday, july 14, 2013.\r\n\r\nmy first thought upon seeing the object was that it was a hot air balloon.  however, i was surprised that a hot air balloon was flying at night.  my friend and i, both, had the impression that this object was a balloon.  however, whereas i thought it was a hot air balloon, he thought it was a helium balloon.  the object, orb like, glowed a reddish-orange against the night sky.  the reason i thought it was a not air balloon was because it appeared to have a flame beneath it, that glowed a yellowy gold color.  both of us thought that it was the flame that was reflecting up into the object, giving it the reddish-orange color.  as the object passed directly overhead, i could see that it did not have the standard gondola that hot air balloons have.  it also appeared that it wasn't as big as a hot air balloon in diameter.  years ago when i lived in florida, i lived in a flight path for hot air balloons.  i watched several pass over my house almost on a regular basis.  although i couldn't determine just how high up this object was, what i was aware of, was that from the distinction that we could see, that it would have been close enough that i could have heard the flame of the fire going into the balloon, if it had been a hot air balloon.  besides, having watched so many hot air balloons pass over, i knew that they don't have the fire burning all the time, but that the flame is shot up in spurts as needed.  this object was traveling across the sky at a very level pattern.  as, i said, i don't know how high the object was, but it was below the cloud bank.  \r\n\r\nthe other thing that i noticed was that although we watched this object for 5 - 10 minutes, that it was traveling at a much quicker speed than what a hot air balloon travels, typically.  but it was certainly not as fast as what an airplane would travel, nor did this object in any way resemble an airplane.  my friend's initial impression was that it was a large helium balloon with a flame beneath it.  so, individually, we both had the impression that this object was balloon shaped and we both had the impression that it had a flame beneath it.  however, the flame was directly beneath it, like a hot air balloon, and this object was traveling across the sky from east to west-northwest.  we watched it until for some time, until we lost it on the horizon in the distance.\r\n\r\ni knew that we had seen something out of the ordinary, as in not an airplane or any other typical object we would see traveling in the night sky.  upon arriving home at 10:45, i immediately began searching the internet to see if anyone else had seen the object.  i \"googled\" various websites, and checked all of the local news outlets, to no avail.  at this point, i am unable to find any other mention of a sighting of this object.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
