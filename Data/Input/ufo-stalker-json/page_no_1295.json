then while laying there i felt strange so i quickly got up and went into the house with the dogs. they were still flickering in those spots when i went into the house. total time watching them was about 5 to 8 min i think. i don't know if they are still there but i wasn't going to look! i googled to see if any reports of unusual things or satelites in the sky but haven't found anything.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":48961,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.4160793,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07152013-0008","longitude":-121.3624478,"occurred":1373863500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like,   Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1373881923000,"summary":"Saw two bright star-like objects about 1/2 mile apart move towards ea other, passed closely and slowed then changed spots and hovered at opposite spots","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"95758","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Elk Grove, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:289687"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover), Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Xenia","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This evening around dusk i was walking my dogs and looked up and saw an object over a building coming from the southeast just under the cloud cover that was broken coverage. then there were more coming over at various levels most under the clouds but some above. they were in a loose group about a mile long from first to last going only about 50 miles an hour. there was no sound at all. i was mesmerized by this as they were headed directly toward wright patterson afb about ten miles from my house. i observed craft with multiple glowing areas as i would not say lights because they were diffused. there were about 8 or so of these under each of the craft. they were too far away for me to get any more than able to say i saw these were real solid craft and not just lights in the sky. i watched them for several minutes until the cloud cover and haze obscured them from view as they were probably about five miles away from me again headed in a direct line towards wright-patt. i have seen a couple of events in the seven years i have lived in the xenia ohio area. none were this close and this many as i just had to report this sighting. i was an avionics tech in the navy and have an extensive knowledge of aircraft and also of flight observation. meaning that these craft were clearly seen by me. they were close enough to say they were solid objects and not reflections on the bottoms of clouds. they arent swamp gas and i dont b. s. about something this serious. im concerned very much by this sighting because of where they were headed the low altitude and speed they were going. i could only say with being in such close proxcimity to several civilian and military bases i conclude they were in an approach pattern to wright patt. your guess is as good as mine as to who they are or what they are doing here. sincerly submitted today.

south on interstate 75, returning home after a university of kentucky basketball game. south of richmond, but north of berea. all four of us saw an object overhead, directly in front of us, with an apparant altitude of a few hundred feet. the size cannot be estimated because the actual altitude could not be determined, as there were no clouds or hills, mountains, etc., behind the object.. the object was round, and glowing with a white color, giving an appearance similar to that of a floresent light, but round, i.E. a circle shape. at that time, so far as i was aware, flouresent lights were only tube shaped, whether straight, or sometimes bent into a circle. i am referring only to the type of light produced by the object. the object had an apparant size larger than a full moon, and the brightness was similar to that of a full moon on a clear night. it was definitely not, however, the moon. the object was hovering, moving very slowly from east to west. as we watched, the object suddenly accelerated to a speed far faster than it would seem would be possible within the laws of physics, and moved beyond the western horizon so quickly that it was virtually instantaneous. at the point of the sighting, we were going down a long slope on the interstate, and the terrain was such that there was a very wide, unobstructed view toward the western horizon, of several miles.\r\n\r\n\"accelerted\" is actually not the correct word, because \"acceleration\" implies that the speed increased from a slow speed to a faster speed through a process of going faster and faster. to the contrary, the object appeared to have no transition from the slow east to west hover to a speed which covered miles from our location to the western horizon in, perhaps, a hundreth of a second.\r\n\r\nthe four of us agreed that we would not report the incident because of the ridicule that we would probably suffer.\r\n\r\nabout six years after the sighting, i saw a newspaper story in the louisville courier-journal newspaper about a professor at eastern kentucky university, which is located in richmond, who was gathering information about a large number of unexplained ufo sightings in the richmond area over the previous several years. the article pointed out that the us army bluegrass depot, a storage area for nerve and other weapons grade gases, and perhaps other weapons, is located just south of richmond. i wrote to the professor, telling him about the sighting in 1969, and offering to meet with him if he wished he returned my correspondence, saying to contact him if i was in richmond in the future, but did not seem anxious to hear the details of the sighting. i never met with him.\r\n\r\nall three of the observers who were students at the time are now professionals: an accountant, a pharmacist, and an attorney.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

approximately 11:30 pm edst (23.30) on the east side of lexington, kentucky, on march 29, 2013: my small dog was agitated at the back door, barking excitedly, which is uncharacteristic for her. when i went to see what the matter was, she was excitedly indicating that she wanted to go outside. normally she will just sit at the door patiently waiting if she wants to go outside.\r\n\r\ni let her out, and followed onto the back deck as she descended the steps into the back yard. it was at that point that i noticed a red orb hovering stationary slightly to the north of me, high in the sky. it was too large to be the red wing light of an airplane. it did not move as i observed it for perhaps 30 to 60 seconds. i went inside to get my iphone in order to take a picture, and it was still visible when i returned, but had started moving very slowly in a northerly direction. i took pictures and a short video (or thought i did; this morning those pictures and video do not appear on my phone, but two others, taken later from the upstairs deck are on my phone.) my wife had already gone to bed, so i went upstairs to our bedroom, woke her up and told her what i was seeing. there is a second floor deck off our bedroom, and we went there, where the object was still clearly visible, continuing to slowly move in a northerly direction. i then saw a second identical object which was much closer to us, but about the same apparent altitude, moving south to north. this second object was slightly to the west of us, but nearly overhead. it was moving slowly toward the location of the first object. when we looked back to the last location of the first object, it was no longer visible.\r\n\r\nwe watched the second object move very slowly���much too slowly for a fixed wing aircraft���in the same south to north trajectory. eventually the second object disappeared as we watched. it did not go off into the distance, it just disappeared.\r\n\r\nthe apparent size of the objects was the same. my recollection is that at the first sighting of the second object it was about the size of a dime held at arm���s length. my wife���s recollection is that it was larger, i.E. about the size of a quarter held at arm���s length. we agree that the apparent size was smaller than a full moon. the moon, at the time, was far east of these objects, which were high in the sky as opposed to near the horizon. unquestionably these objects were not stars, both because of size and the fact that they moved.\r\n\r\nas to color, i saw both objects as being red. my wife saw them as being orange, although she also saw what appeared to be a small red ���dot��� in the center of both objects. i did not observe this ���dot���.\r\n\r\nregarding photographs: this morning i looked at the photos on my camera. to my great surprise, there was no video whatsoever, and only one still shot of one of the objects. it appears to be the second one, due to it���s apparent size in the photo. the photo was taken at full zoom on an iphone 5. when the photo itself is enlarged, the object does not appear to be an orb at all, but rather appears to have a crescent shape, with curve on the bottom, but with the top tilted slightly to the west. upon closer inspection, we thought it appeared to have a ���saucer��� shape, with the bright crescent being at the bottom. it is also possible the impression appears because of something which may be the ���red dot��� appears above the crescent. i have not magnified the photo beyond what i can do by zooming into the photo with the iphone.\r\n\r\nthe color of the crescent in the photo is much more white than the appearance of the color to our naked eyes. as i said, i would call it red, although tending toward an orange-ish red as opposed to bright red, while my wife says the color was orange with a ���red dot���.\r\n\r\nthe other photo is completely black, as if only a picture of the night sky.\r\n\r\ni am baffled as to why there are only two still photos on my phone from last night, and no video whatsoever. i am certain i shot both, downstairs as well as upstairs. my wife thinks that i may have failed to properly take the shots due to my excitement, but i disagree. i clearly recall both the action the phone does after taking a still shot, as well as seeing the video icon active.\r\n\r\nat no time was there any sound heard from these objects, at least by we humans. it may be that the dog heard something which caused her agitation.\r\n","distance":"101-500

it was a chinese lantern, but it moved very fast along a specific path.  only a single light was observed on the craft and it was somewhat hazy in appearance.  for a brief moment i thought i glimpsed a reflection from the light on an unlit, rear surface, but i couldn't be positive.  no noise was noted and the object maintained a constant rate of speed along its path.  it continued its flight until it passed out of sight in the sw and its appearance lasted about 2-3 minutes.  about 2-3 minutes after it passed out of sight, another identical object appeared from the same direction traveling along the same course.  once again, no noise.   we live under the flight paths of commercial airlines from cincinnati and lexington and nothing that we have ever seen comes close to these objects in appearance.   helicopters from ky nat. guard commonly pass over, but it is clear from their racket and movement that they are choppers.  in addition, most of our air traffic moves n-s and the only planes we see on an e-w course are usually seen at very high altitudes.  these objects looked to be at an altitude of about 1000 feet and moved relatively fast.   faster than choppers, but slightly slower than a fighter jet.   needless to say, one object was unusual, but two was unbelievable!

waiting, i noticed a shiny faint object in the sky... did not think much of it...Got bus at roughly 10:15 am... went west on bus for 30 min. got off bus and walked west... as walking looked at same space i saw object and it did not not move... i was curious as to why i moved and it didn't ... 15 min.  later i arrived at my destination and still noticed it did not move. i was around 4-6 others and asked them if they see what i see... all agreed that what i was seeing for now one hour in the same place, they also said i see it, how did you see that ? i stated that it had been there a hour before i even got to show you. we all watched all watched a sporting event on television until half time ( 1 hr 30 min) later we all went to the deck and looked at the same area and saw object exactly where it was hours before... we all looked at each other and new something is off... not a star, or planet or star we agreed because it still did not move...All others began to say ok i saw nothing but it is right there still. we all (i) included kinda forgot about it except me...That day as far as i can recall was special in town, the president of the usa was in town and also pope john paul meeting at regis university... to me it all makes sense now... i believe what i saw was some sort of protection for having the two most important and influential people on this planet being near.. i felt amazed at what i saw, completely right since others aknowledged the same thing i saw then say never saw it... i just need to tell my story to someone that believes what they saw as i did, the others won't have anything to do with me.. i've seen a couple who where there that day in the past and they will not even aknowledge that i even watched the game with them or was there or that they saw anything ... this is not about them, this is about what i saw, what i know i saw and what i can't explain to myself or others what i saw... a friend in a different kind of support group recommended that i contact u... that was in 2007... i've got to make this report for my own good... maybe, well i don't know..  i've finally reached out, out of fear i've held back in my own belief of what i know i saw for multiple hours... i would like luke to know more info about that day if possible... hence my reporting finally...Thank
