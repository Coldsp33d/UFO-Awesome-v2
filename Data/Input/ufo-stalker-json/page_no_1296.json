about twice the size of the brightest star.\r\n\t i went out into my back yard and saw that there were two of them. i got my phone in video mode and filmed them until they went behind my neighbors trees. i saw that there were three more coming into view and i filmed them as well until they also went behind the trees. i switched my phone into hd mode and got another, much better video of one of the objects. when i zoomed into the last one you can see its colors changing rapidly. \r\n\tthey were all traveling at the same speed and in the same direction but not in a straight line. one was a little lover than the rest. i don���t know how fast they were moving but they came into view from around a tree to my due south and went out of my view behind my neighbors tree to the southwest of my house, in about a minuet to a minuet and a half.\r\n\tafter the six objects all were out of view i stayed outside for another half hour to see if there were any more. there were not. \r\n

south on kipling st and we caught sight of a bright blue/purple flashing in the sky to the left of us (west). i continued paying attention to the road and asked her to keep an eye on the lights. i pulled off into a parking lot on a hill and parked the car facing west. the cross made of lights on mount lindo was directly in front of us. we observed the light hovering just above the mountain ridge to the left of, and above the cross. the lights seemed to be coming from one object that flashed rapidly and in a color sequence. two small red lights on top and a blue light on the bottom, then the red lights would blink off, and the blue light would change to a blue-green almost teal color, then back to solid blue, and then the red lights would reappear. this pattern continued in a rapid flashing. my wife thought perhaps it was a police car on the mountain, however being familiar with the mountain i knew that the lights were too high to even be on it. we observed the flashing for several minutes. i was somewhat excited to be witnessing a second event in the same night. suddenly the bandimere speedway fireworks began at 10:30 and since the lights were still flashing and unmoving, we decided to stay and watch the show. mid-show i glanced up the mountaintop and noticed that the lights were gone. i was bummed that i had missed it. we finished the firework show and  i put the car in gear and pulled forward to u-turn, but hit my breaks mid-turn with my jaw on the floor. my wife gasped as she took noticed of what i observed. the lights were back, flashing in sequence in the exact same spot. i wanted to stay and observe more but my wife was tired and we agreed that after our sighting in arvada and now lakewood,we had filled our quota of unexplained events. we

friday. as i started to run i noticed a strange \"star\" in the sky. it was hovering to low for a star or satellite , and it was glittering in blue and red. i ignored it and kept on running. i had a strange feeling like something is watching me from that \"star\". i thought that maybe it's a military baloon , but  i know how these baloons looks like at night , and it wasn't anything i knew. i run for a hour or so and as i turned back and saw again that \"star\" it moved something like 60 feet from it's original location , so i knew it wasn't a star. when i got back home i took my sony nex6 camera and ascented to my porch. i saw that \"star\" hovering in the sky. i took some stills photos of the object and one video shot. i had a very strange feeling that night because the moon was full and it shined very brightly almost 90 degrees above me. after 15 minutes i went back home and the object was still in the same place.  \r\ni didn't think about it again since last thursday 11 july 2013. i copied all the pictures in the sd card to my computer. and when i watched the \"star\" pictures i was very excited because they were very weird. first , in the video i could see another little \"star\" glittering near the big \"star\".\r\nthen , i saw in the stills photos that the object changed it's shape from round to some kind of lightning like line. and the little \"star\" also changed it's shape as well. the object changed again and again to a triangle and other stranged shapes. i first assumed that it was a problem with my camera , so i made shots at night from the same point and i didn't get that kind of strange changes in the shapes. when i continued analysing the photos i have noticed that the moon looks like a big odd flashlight with some green orb beside it. and most strange from all - in one of the photos, when i enlarged the \"little star\" it was in a shape of an alien as we know it from the movies. my wife saw it also and she became very frightened. it looked as if it is floating in the sky. i'm very confused about this sighting , and i don't really know what it was. i would like to share it with the world , and would like experts to see the photos to determine if it's earthly or some kind of an alien being. thank you for your support.

ufos, aliens, and life on other planets.  all of the sudden i look over to see a yellowish/reddish orange orb!  i first noticed the object because of it's unusual size, glow, and the way it moved across the sky.  when i first saw the object i had no idea what it was.  i quickly busted out my droid razr phone, and took a video of the orb as it moved from a nw direction to the nw... low and slow...  the object slowly seemed to hover/move silently.  after about 30-40 seconds of viewing, the orb began to radiate a specific blue color.  it wasn't like anything i'd ever seen from common aircraft like planes, helicopters, or whatever else is up there. the closest analogy is like a deep sea jellyfish that radiates it's bio-luminescence colors, except it was wavering mostly blue throughout the orb.  randomly.  my feelings were that this was something of an extraterrestrial nature, but obviously we had just been discussing ufos and aliens so this seemed too coincidental to be true. i'm an avid ufo junky, and i am a firm believer that there are technologies and entities that exist and operate without the public's common knowledge. i walked away from this experience believing i had witnessed, and video recorded a possible ufo or a real ufo of an extraterrestrial nature.  like always, my friends were mostly laughing at me before this experience happened while i ranted on about previous ufos i had witnessed, and several other reasons why i believe a lot of the cases and report to be 100% true. then literally after laughing hysterically at some of my claims we turn our heads to see this beautiful orb moving across the sky.  then it changes colors from the orange/red glow to radiating blue. our minds were officially blown, and i felt relieved that maybe it happened for a reason!  i lost sight of the object as it moved to the nw, and i fiddled around with my camera phone making sure i had gotten a video of the experience.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

approaching glow from just over the trees to the north east of my location caught my eye.  it seemed to come out of nowhere due to the low altitude and treeline in that direction.  i looked up and over the trees from the north & slightly east appeared a red-orange bell shaped object approximately one quarter mile up. it passed me at approximately 300 yards to the east there were no audible sounds from craft. as it passed it was moving at a steady speed with no discernable variation of altitude or speed. naturally i freaked out, (i've seen numerous unidentified objects before but never this close). i ran inside to grab my camera. when i returned outside (about 10 seconds later) i could not locate it. i ran to the east edge of the house, it had travelled further south clearing the field to the south of the house reaching a wooded area.  i watched it slow down and hover momentarily. it looked to be hovering at the top of the trees across the field. i watched it change from its red orange color to a dark goldish yellow color as it descended. it disappeared from my line of sight behind the trees approximately 1/2 mile away. i attempted to take pictures of the hover & descent but it was too dark and i didn't have the camera settings ready for night pics and video. there were no usable pictures or video. it did appear however that the area the object should of occupied was \"washed out\" while the rest of the exposure appeared normal. i believe this was caused by the object. after i lost sight of the object i returned inside quite shaken up.  i opened up the blinds in the windows facing south. i did some dishes so i could look out the window and to take my mind off what i had seen and occupy some time while waiting to hopefully see this again. i had the windows open so i could listen for anything out of the ordinary. i heard some unusual noises from outside, i was already on edge so i then closed all the windows & blinds in the house. a few more minutes passed and i had a feeling that i should look out the window just then. i pulled back the blind, (there are railroad tracks about 25 feet from the backside of the house that are elevated blocking visibility) i looked in the previous direction & saw nothing,  i opened the blind fully, just then a huge!  crescent/cross shaped craft with a greenish aura around it & 4 or 5 red lights on the underside ascended from behind the railroad tracks. it flew directly over the top of the house, i ran out the front door to see it ascend at 45deg quickly and entirely silent. there were no obvious signs of propulsion. i attempted to take pics with my iphone of the ascent those did not come out either. have not seen bell shaped object again.
