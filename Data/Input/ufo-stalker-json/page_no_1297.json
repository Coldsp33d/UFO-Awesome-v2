planted when i looked up at the west ward sky. it was lightning in the distance back twords lawndale and fallston nc, but it was far enough away that there was no sound. \r\n\r\nit hadn't rained or anything so i thought \"well there is a storm on the way.\" as the clouds parted i saw a bright object. my first thought was that \"that is cool looking.. it has to be the moon shining through the clouds.\"\r\n\r\nthis is where i realized it was something different because the moon never rises west where we live. i watched it for a moment and noticed the lightning or electricity. \r\n\r\nit was white and blue and it was bouncing around inside the circle. i watched it for approximately 1 min 30 seconds trying to figure out exactly what i was seeing, then the object suddenly grew very bright and in an instant, flew off quickly north by northwest almost blinding me for a second. as my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness again i saw a perfect triangle of clouds or smoke glowing in the sky where the object had been. this wasn't a trail like an airplane would leave and it was only in one spot. the triangle was perfect and looked like some kind of wierd smoke ring. it was bigger than the circle that had made it, almost like the circle would have fit directly into the middle of the triangle.\r\n\r\nscared, i turned and ran into the house shouting for my wife and son and daughter in law to come and see. wife was washing dishes and son and daughter in law had just come in so they were in his bedroom.  i ran to the sink and pulled my wife's arm and turned and ran back out the door. by the time we got outside, the triangle was fading, but still visible. it persisted and vanished before our eyes in approx 2 mins or less.  me my wife and my son all saw the triangle of smoke. my daughter in law did not see the triangle because she was reluctant to come outside in the dark because of the insects.\r\n\r\nshaken, i came in and wrote down what i saw, the time and direction that it went and a small sketch of what it looked like. i called my dad and was on the phone with him as i walked back outside. the time is now 10:35 pm. \r\n\r\ni abruptly hung up the phone with my dad when i saw the object come into view again in what appeared to be the same position as before. running back into the house i yelled frantically once again \"its back!!.. dad called me crazy .. but its back again!!\" for my family. i ran into the computer room and grabbed the camera from my desk to try and get a picture. \r\n\r\nwhile i was grabbing the camera, my son ran outside and to the end of the cement and saw the object. my daughter in law didn't see it because she was busy chaining the dog on the porch this time. the dog wasn't barking or anything. whatever it was, was far enough away that it didn't spook the dog.\r\n\r\nmy son said that it was triangle shaped object with blue and white lights that faded out within a 10-15 seconds.\r\n\r\nby the time i got out the door past my daughter in law and to the ground in the front yard far enough north to see past the tree limb to get a picture, it was gone. no bright flash, no smoke triangle this time. nothing.. just darkness. i took a few shots of the sky where the object had been, but there was nothing there.\r\n\r\nmy son drew a small sketch on the back of the paper when we came back into the house about 20 mins later, that i had drawn mine on. it showed the position in the sky that he saw it and the shape. his description matched mine.\r\n\r\nunderstand this was a circle at first, that i saw, that appeared huge. i thought it was the moon. it appeared that large in the sky. then it filled with electricty and suddenly took off northward at great speed with no sound. \r\n\r\nthe cloud that it left behind was a perfect triangle shape and thick. i couldnt have drawn a perfect triangle like this. it almost pulsated, but i think that may have been my eyes adjusting back to the darkness after the flash. i thought at first i was crazy, but my wife and son saw the triangle in the sky and then later it returned and my son saw the craft.\r\n\r\ni have been trying to understand what i saw and all i can think is that maybe the reason i didn't see the triangle craft the first time was because it was powering up or something for the burst of speed and maybe the pull of the air around it created the triangle cloud. i wish i could give you more detail but thats what i saw.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then

as the other sighting had ended at 12:11 am it was another craft of some sort moving at a high rate of speed from east to west again at a much lower altitude than the first sighting.It was a saturn

that my mind was saying a flock of birds due to the size. even as i looked directly at it for an instance my mind finally realized it was a triangle shape vessel. the bottom had 5 slightly glowing domes in the triangle shape and the light glow was in the flight pattern of geese flying as seasons change. anyway it was silent made no sound. it moved at an angle from my right to in front of me or i turn more in the direction it was flying. when it came to my front it turned slightly and the shape changed due to the rear was now in vision. and accelerated and in less than a second speed away. the rectangle shape , or rear of vessel just grew smaller until it disappeared.\r\nthe vessel moved like some low altitude jets do in flight manuvers here in alabama where i live. the 5 domes were surrounded by black color that i could see against the star lit sky. the sides had lower half black and upper half lighter grey color. the  top was the same grey.\r\nthe vessel was hard to determine

members including grandmother..Reported to mufon around year 2000ish of a huge and low one in our backyard (of which i was not around to see) followed by black helicopters soon after. my grandmother's health is currently extremely declining and she is nearing the end, so i'm determined to keep up on this subject and get as many answers as i can. she's been very interested in these photographs and urges me to send them to you all at mufon. i will continue to take photographs and report them as/when i feel compelled to; as it seems i may have quite the luck to capture some skyward anomalies. whether or not they are crafts or even what kind, i'm not quite sure..But i really would like to get one that is undeniable eventually.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":48871,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.0660638,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07112013-0011","longitude":-74.4030712,"occurred":1373439600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

like a a can of soup. then i realized it was night time and the craft was headed to three large cell towers and a lot of guide wires. as i got closer the bottom was luminated yellow-orange about 15% up and the craft had angled facets that started at the bottom and was lost in the dark but, you could see the outline of the the craft.  \r\n      it moved over the hill i followed it to the other side it would move and stop dim a little get brighter move and stop. then it moved around the towers and i lost sight again. i drove down brick church pk. and it started to slow over a pasture near i-24 the light got dark and i could see the outline of the craft and it was not there after a short time.\r\n      if it had been a ballon it would have never made it across the hills ,terrian and the towers and wires and where did the thing go...\r\ni know it has been nine years but i remember it like yesterday and it just does not add up. call me if you need anything 615-357-7705","distance":"501
