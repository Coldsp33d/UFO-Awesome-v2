the university of cincinnati, gettler stadium, at 3:54am when due west, the direction i was walking at the time, a light appeared in the sky at 40 degrees up.  the object was moving quickly at the size of star-like and quickly brightened to extremely bright, 10 to 100 times brighter than anything in the sky and to the size of an aspirin in the shape of a teardrop.  so bright i felt like i was having a beam of light pointed at me.  then it dimmed all the way back down to star-like.  at first, it looked like it was moving east, south east, towards me and across my view toward the south.  however, after it dimmed, it appeared to just be moving south, south west.  a loud boom or bang bounced off the ground near the campus toward the direction of the object.  it is possible the noise was unrelated to the object, possibly a trash truck dumping a dumpster.  after dimming, i followed the object across the sky with my unaided eye for about 20 seconds until i could no longer see the object due to distance and clouds.  8 minutes later, at 4:03am, in the same area of the sky and moving in the same direction i saw what appeared to be the same object moving the near exact path across the sky.  i didn't see any brightening of the object this time.  it too, about 10-15 seconds later disappeared due to distance and clouds.  i was at the stadium from 3am til almost 5am and saw no other objects like it, nor heard any other loud booms.  i thought it was a meteor skipping off the atmosphere, but once i saw it again, it seemed too much of a coincidence.  the object appeared to be extremely far away.  possibly flying over between west side of cincinnati and indiana border.","distance":"Over One

was circular or not but it looked black against the sky that was a kind of purple at the time. what i do remember is that there were lots of lights under the craft. we slowed down and drove underneath it very slowly. i told my friend to turn around just about a fourth of a mile and when we went back to the place it was gone. i haven't told anyone but friends and family about my experience because

there is a silver craft by the tree. in my dream i feel like i should hide. i used to hate going to my grandmothers house when i was little. i would spend one night and then scream and cry for my

both watched it traveling slowly westbound and, as it was going over my house and out of sight i ran and turned off the house alarm so i could open the front door and watch it. i opened the south door and went outside. both of us saw it. it was very bright orange, round, and looked as if it had flames trickling around it. it also had a perfectly round white center. it was not too far away and was about the size of a dime or penny held at arms length. it was slowly changing  direction from sw to nw and suddenly shot straight up and out of site in the clouds. the cloud layer was very low that evening so it probably was not too high up.\r\n    i can tell you it was not an airplane, meteor, flare, balloon or anything that we had ever seen before. we're not too crazy, i'm retired army, now a high school teacher and i work part-time as a deputy sheriff and my wife is a nurse, so we're not too prone to fantasy. we can just say that this was something extremely unique and something we had never seen before. the most interesting aspect of the sighting was the fact that this thing had the appearance of flames trickling around it. there was no trail behind it of any kind, just the round, bright orange ball. when it ascended it went straight up at a very high speed into the clouds before it went out of site. when it was over our barn when we first observed it it was much larger and brighter,about the size of a quarter which made it so alarming as a fire. this makes  me believe it was gaining altitude as it was moving from east to west. i should have grabbed my phone to video it,
