looked, i saw an object hovering above the nearby mountains (approximately 4 miles away). it appeared approximately 200 meters above the ground. the length of the object to the naked eye was slightly smaller than ������. it had a very distinct shape, sigmoidal or s-shaped and reminded me of a pinwheel. it was spinning clockwise around the center mass, and it was the sun reflecting off of the appendages that had caught my eye. the speed at which the object was spinning would change from very fast (appearing to look circular) to almost a complete stop. as the object spun, it was also moving erratically up, down, side to side, and diagonally, all very quickly. it was able to change directions instantaneously, even going in the exact opposite direction instantly. \r\nwhile it was moving through the sky, the object tilted about 90 degrees so that it then appeared like a typical disc or saucer shape. in this position, i could make out that the shape was elliptical. when i zoomed in to take a picture of it at this angle, i could see that the upper body seemed to extend over the bottom portion on the left side and was just the opposite on the right side. i believe the object was not spinning at the time so i was seeing it from the side in a stationary position. in this picture it is possible to see the sun reflecting off of the top dome, so the material was obviously reflective. also, if you zoom in on the second photo you can see what appears to be a concave area on the right side ���wing��� which would indicate the curvature that is seen in the first photo and what gives the object the s-shape.\r\nafter about 10-15 seconds, the object dropped behind the mountain and then reappeared a few seconds later, hovered for about 5 seconds, and then dropped in front of the mountain. it was harder to see at this point since it wasn't reflecting as much light and the background color of the mountain was darkish green. i lost sight of it when a parade float stopped in front of me. the entire viewing lasted about 2 minutes. \r\nunfortunately, i was at the parade by myself, and was surrounded by other people���s children (whom i didn't want to panic); and i was just too stunned to think about pointing it out. i was much more focused on trying to get a couple of good photos. i did try to get some video but the settings were too bright and i was having a hard time finding it through the view-finder, since a bunch of floats where hindering my view.\r\ngiven the size, shape, and movement of this object, there is no doubt in my mind that this is something solid, metallic, and not man-made. i have never seen an object fly so quickly, change direction so fast, or be able to appear absolutely stationary. the fact that it appeared during the day against a clear, blue sky just made me feel as if this craft was not hiding itself at all. either that or someone turned off the cloaking device and is going to get grounded. ; ) \r\n","distance":"Over One

our first time, even though it's a yearly event, and we both figured it would be a good place to shake off the dust from our cameras.  on the 17th, we drove out to howard co.  it was fairly cloudy at first, but the weather seemed to cooperate the later it got, and the moon decided to peek out.\r\n     i didn't realize the time until after i took my photographs; mom had the watch on, but it was dark.  overall, without looking at my raw files, it was 9-10pm.  i was working on my last set:  a hot-air balloon floating up into the night sky, trying to work in the moon, when i saw a rotating, flashing light.  it reminded me of one of those light up toys you can buy at the circus where lights flash off and on, spinning quickly in a circle--or like a police light bar--hovering high over an apartment complex.  i had no idea what it was, but for the sake of curiosity i fired a few photographs off.  the balloon sailed down, obscured my vision, and by the time it landed, the lit object in the sky was gone.  honestly i thought i hadn't taken any photographs of it at all.\r\n     in the next few days, i set up adobe photoshop elements and began fixing up a few photographs, adding exposure and reducing noise (adding exposure brightens a photograph, and since it was dark, the higher the iso or sensitivity to light setting on a camera, the more noise--the gritty bits in a photograph--there is).  eventually i got into the images that i took near the end of the night, and when i brightened the one in question, a shape became visible.  it couldn't have been a lens flare; i'd debunked some of my other photographs earlier.  a small, remote-controlled helicopter was flying around the field while the balloons were being taken down, but i hadn't seen it in the time i was taking pictures of this particular balloon.  the object has a definite shape, the classical ufo look.  i brought mom over to check the files and she seemed as stunned as i am.  we didn't want to make any assumptions, but seeing the image for the first time certainly made it hard not

pictures around the condo. stepped outside to take a short rest and enjoy some of the clear, night air.\r\n\r\na rapidly ascending light caught my eye over the treetops. it appeared to be in an almost straight ascent at a pretty high speed and i thought it was a laser or something at first. then i noticed that as it passed in front of clouds it didn't refract light at all, but rather just blocked them from view as would an object.\r\n\r\nit made several slight, directional changes and speed changes as it ascended. i called my girlfriend to see it and she observed it as well. i described it as a 'very motivated balloon with thrusters'... as it did appear to have an almost 'floating' quality about its flight - but ascended much too rapidly and changed directions to be a balloon (unless there are new, high-performance types that i have not seen).\r\n\r\nas it got higher up it dimmed and became obscured behind clouds, and reappeared from time to time as it ascended. i lost sight, but my girlfriend caught a last glimpse of it what would have to be several miles up at this point. then it was gone.\r\n\r\ni've never seen anything like it -- and would not have thought of myself as a 'ufo reporting type person' -- but i'm pretty up on modern aviation and this didn't seem to have any flight characteristics i'd seen before -- nor did it seem like a random light or laser.\r\n\r\ni scanned the news the next day, but didn't see any other sightings -- though would be interested in hearing from anyone else who might have seen it.\r\n\r\ni tried to catch it on my iphone, but couldn't find it on the small view-screen - and so opted to observe instead of fumbling with my camera.\r\n\r\nit appeared to be coming from somewhere just east of lake washington -- a bit south of the 520 bridge - but could have been up to a couple miles farther east for all i know.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

controller involved, witness (b).  witness (a) was an air traffic controller at miami international at the time this event occurred.   he came on duty at 10:00am on this day, the whole facility was buzzing, so he asked ���what was going on���. the person he asked said that the midnighters had seen a ufo at the airport earlier.  witness (a) did not get the full details for several weeks. the controller, witness (b), was obviously upset over what he had witnessed and refused to talk about it.  witness (a) waited a few weeks for the right time and when it was quiet he asked this controller to tell him the whole story.  \r\nwitness (b) said that he was working the midnight shift and his relief had arrived up in the tower cab as well as a flight data assistant (three total, witnesses (b), (c), (d)). they were chatting and one them looked up at the tower radar display.  something was quickly moving across the scope from the north and toward the airport. the observer called out, they all started looking out the windows (it was dark but getting light in the east).  to the north something low was covering up the lights on the ground. at this point the ufo is almost over airport. they all saw it as it came to a hover over the commuter ramp, (low, 100 feet or less) which is in the middle of the airport, without any illumination lighting visible.  at this point i stopped the story to ask a question; how big was it? witness (b) said it was about the size of a b-727, which is quite large.  he also said that it was dark in color, maybe dark olive. \r\nthe object hovered over a vehicle and turned on a bright light.  there was a ramp person in the vehicle asleep, witness (e).  the ramp vehicles all have radios tuned to the ground control frequency.  witness (e) started screaming on frequency for the tower to quit playing pranks.  the light stayed on for several minutes. remember it���s getting lighter outside every minute. the light turned off and it continued to hover. now it���s light enough to see detail.  \r\nthe object then rises vertically and passes very close to an arriving eastern airlines a-300.  the aircraft was coming in from the south and was on downwind and preparing to land.  the pilot, witness (f), asked ���what the hell was that?��� the controllers said that they did not know. the object continued up to many thousands of feet, but still visible from the ground.\r\nat this point a controller supervisor, witness (g), was driving into work, saw the object ascend and watched it until it stopped ascending, when the object stopped it stayed motionless for several minutes and then it started to gyrate wildly, turned on white, red, green lights, while still gyrating and had many multi-colored lights flashing.  the object performed like this for several more minutes.  when it stopped it stayed motionless for several minutes and then suddenly went vertically out of sight.  \r\nin the tower things were hectic trying to see if the radar room could see anything and getting the airliner on the ground.  while taxiing in, the pilot, witness (f), asked if the controllers knew anything more, then stated ���well i guess i���ve seen one now���.  over the next hour or so ���answers��� started coming from various agencies, none of which was accepted by the controller witnesses.  in the end the faa told them to say nothing of the event.  one final thing, witness (b) mentioned that for the next couple of hours (no wind) a yellow-green/violet haze was seen to stay in the area where the object had been hovering. this event was a catalyst, of sorts, to open a host of stories from other controllers.  \r\nthis case was a secondary sighting provided by witness (a) for michigan case #47976, provided herewith by daniel j snow, mi cfi 16776.  quick background check, witness also had a fl address, sighting also posted to nuforc 27apr04 by same author.  \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

to watch a hitchcock movie with him and my nephew. my brother & i decided to step out and have a cigarette on his front porch. as we stood there sharing a smoke together & were small talking i noticed a \"bright star\" type light that seemed stationary in the sky. i pointed it out to my brother (who is a 30 + police veteran) and he acknowledged it seemed pretty bright, too. as we hung out together talking, we kept looking at the light and noticed that was very slowly moving across the sky but at a speed so slow that if your didn't really watch it, you would probably wouldn't notice the movement. our interest was peaked and we started wondering what the heck it could be. the object began to strobe different colors & continued to do so throughout the entire event. my brother called for his son to come outside & look at it as well. we noticed it slowly went from left to right across the sky and a slow declined angle toward the distant tree line. my brother told his son to go get his high definition binoculars that he uses for police work. upon his son returning, we began taking turns looking at the lights with the binoculars and could see that there was some type of object with exterior strobing lights in the sky. we got pretty excited & also dumbfounded and kept debating what it could be. at about that time my nephew pointed out a 2nd light in the sky... very very similar, if not exact to the 1st 1 we had been observing. this 2nd object was first observed at a further left end of the sky.. and under a long horizontal cloud that was more misty than thick. the 2nd object hovered in the bottom area of this thin cloud and began moving in the same manner as the 1st object, i.E., slow but strobing. its direction was heading from around the bottom of the cloud cover and more toward the center of the sky. we probably stayed outside observing it for 45 min- 1 hr and when we went back inside to finish the hitchcock movie (about 10 mins of the movie left) the objects (both of them) were still there in the sky strobing and very slowly moving. the 2nd 1 seemed to be moving further away because it got smaller. the 1st 1 seemed just as bright but lower in the sky. when i left to go to his camper to get some rest objects were still there but i went on to bed. my brother related to me later that after i went to bed he and his son stepped out to see if they were still there and they were. the next morning of course it seemed like all we could talk about and the objects were not there anymore. i'll never forget it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then

barked a few short barks.  the noise was sort of like music, maybe 3 or 4 notes played over and over. same sound. almost like the movie close encounters, but the music was different. it sounded mechanical, like a giant machine. my two dogs stopped barking and my 3rd started to howl. he never howls.  i live in a rural area and no neighbors close by.  i went onto the deck without the dogs, i didn't want them to run after something.  as soon as i opened the door my dog stopped howling.  i stood on my deck and looked up, it was a cloudy morning and i couldn't see anything but i could hear it really loud.  i said out loud 'what the hell is that?' i couldn't see anything.  now, i do believe in ufo's and always joke of the mother-ship coming to get me, but for a brief instant i did think this was it.  that is how odd it was.  i went back in my house and locked the door behind me and got back in bed.  the sound eventually got fainter and was gone.  it was coming from above and it was

low due to clouds.  after the sound left, about a half hour later, i went outside with one of my dogs, the dog that was howling.  he is able to track planes in the sky that fly at about 30,000 feet, so he has some sense of things beyond most dogs.  there was a strange mist or fog around.  not usual and i thought it was weird.  i looked back at my dog who was starring into the sky.  and looking around like i was.  i know whatever it was, he felt it too.  i am not crazy (well, not more than most) and i have no explanations.  i did call my closest neighbor and he said normally he is up at that
