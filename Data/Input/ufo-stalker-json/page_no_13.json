to visualize a plane towing silver streamers but the object was not a plane.\n  i only observed for 40 seconds before my turn east toward home. the object seemed stationary and i seen no attachments between the flashes and grey object and no wires attached to the object. i have tried since then to explain in my mind what happened with logic but cannot. i have looked for other reports but none there. i did not expect to see something like this in my area and during the day.\n  possible balloon with streamers but the flashes were not solid in nature and i did not see any writing on the

white light like a beam , i could also make out blue like flares comming off what i took to be the front of the object. soon the object was over the horzion and gone. the report was given to be an

white walls windows and it seemed to curve all occupants were wearing white and just as startled as i was amazed. then everything went dark and i remember being on the ground when i woke up and in a

of their agenda all this happening within my mind. out of the 2 little greys one seemed not to agree but was harshly regarded by the tall one i could feel a connection to this little grey i could sense compassion as well as a family bond as if this little grey was a distant relative and the second little grey seemed disconnected from thought as if there was only obedience to the tall grey. i

light about 500' up in the sky about the size of a golf ball. below and slightly behind that diagonally 100' lower towards me was another red light the same as the top. below that another 100' toward me and behind was what looked like what a tr-3b has been described as. a triangular craft of some type with bright white, yellow/gold, blue, and red lights on the bottom of various sizes and on the side of the craft. i would estimate the side was approx. 12' tall... and each side of the triangle maybe 30' long. that bottom triangle craft was just 300' above and in front of me. \r\n now what seemed weird is it was like the single red lights were pulling the tr-3b. the top one appeared to be connected somehow to the lower red light but by what i could not tell but i did see a very faint outline near the red light of something that seemed to be maybe 10' wide and black that led to the red light below that. the red lights seemed to be small though like the size of a basketball about 500' up. i'd guess the size of one of those tiny cars (le-car)...Maybe actual size 15' in diameter for each red light. \r\n the whole thing was completely silent which considering how close it was amazed me in-and-of-itself. now it was heading towards the myrtle beach int. airport at approx. 45 mph.. very slowly but steady. now being as my close proximity to the airport i am quite used to seeing and hearing all types of aircraft go by from commercial craft to private planes and jets of all sizes along with all types of military helicopters and jets. i have never seen anything like this. there was no sound either upon approach, as it was dead in front of me diagonally or as it departed on its way. once it got closer to where i estimated the airport to be the red lights sped up and circled in a weird way but then was out of my sightline due to trees and distance. \r\n if you take a pencil and put it in the air to your upper right hand and extend your arm out.. and have the eraser end facing your direction (but not facing you)and the lead end facing away from you and downward from the eraser and then slowly move the pencil from your right to your left not changing the direction of it then you can get an idea how i seen it. kind of like the following:\r\n\r\n                                             **\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n <-------

and 100' below that again another red single light and then the triangle craft below that which was lit up like uncle mack on saint paddys day. \r\n my wife was also witness to the same thing. those two red lights were in no way, shape, or form big enough to tow that craft by any standard by what \"we the people\" are aware of. especially when they were close enough that i could see they had no wings and were silent yet that is exactly what it appeared they were doing... towing the tr-3b (or whatever the name is of the triangular craft that we have supposedly had for decades now in the shadow government. \r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

times the distance of airplanes. it made a slight circular directional movement. i knew it was a ufo since it was not behaving like an airplane or other common aircraft. this went on about 1.5 minutes. both myself & employee saw it. it was like an orb or a star. my employee mentioned airplanes to compare. i diverted my eye lock on the object to compare to the current aircraft in the vicinity. when i looked back out was gone. i searched the sky for several minutes & didn't see it again. we discussed that it was not a star or planet becoming visable because if it was we'd all be able to see it. i am confident it was not a satellite or space station as i've witnessed those before & it did not traverse the sky line.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
