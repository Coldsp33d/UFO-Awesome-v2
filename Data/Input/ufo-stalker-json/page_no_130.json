in the backyard to get a better looked at the sky. again we could see the objects. the brightness from one of the objects is what caught our attention. we don't know what they are but we know they are not airplanes or helicopters. o were very curious about the incident. i had a similar incident happen a few nights ago also in the northern sky except that incident they stayed lite up for long periods of time and only dimmed out when airplanes approached. they moved quickly in all directions; something i know an airplane can not do. the lights were continus until dimmed but never blinking.

house to find a shining object flying overhead. we live in akron & have witnessed the goodyear blimp, a couple of military drones, commercial\"toy\" drones, planes on takeoff/landing, etc. this is nothing like anything we've seen - ever. \r\n\r\noriginally we tried rationalizing it to be a plane or a drone - but it had no wings, rudder, stabilizer, or lifter. it wasn't a blimp because it moved too fast & was flying too high. in fact, it seemed to move far faster than a blimp or plane (commercial or military). \r\n\r\nit looked almost cigar shaped then we noticed in various still photos that it was also sort of \"saucer\" shaped. it made no sound & left no trail. we didn't observe lights, persay, but there are moments when the entire thing seemed to be really shiny & metallic then black then white. it was either reflecting light or was silver/made of shiny metal. when it would change to black or white, it appeared to change shape but we have no clear image or view to confirm that. we lost sight of it when it went over the trees headed west.\r\n\r\nit was unnerving & left us completely baffled. during the event we were all excited but nervous. afterwards we were a bit unsettled because the gravity of the situation sank in slowly.\r\n\r\ni made a joke that since i've recently begun really watching ufo shows & documentaries maybe they're checking me out. oddly, i woke up 3

window sill shaking and rocking back and forth on its own. i got up to investigate this and found no reasonable cause why this would occur. i proceeded to open my bedroom window to lean out and smoke my routine cigarette and looked at the dark early morning sky. i thought i was looking at the little dipper at first glance, it was even where it normally would be in relation to it's position in the sky and the direction my view was coming from. but quickly i noticed that every star in the sky was not a star, nor a plane, nor a satellite. the \"little dipper\" started changing formation and every \"star\" was blinking at different times (appeared to be a random pattern) and also not all \"stars were white\". as i examined the remainder of the \"starry sky\" i also quickly determined that ever other star was indeed not a star and noticed many different triangle formations scattered in every direction. the lights from some of the formations pulsated rhythmically while other triangles were random flashing. the flashing from each \"star\" varied in color and brightness, and the ones i deemed \"important\" were stand-alone units. there was a solid orange \"star\" pacing left to right in extremely short passes in between each triangle formation. there was a stand-alone unit way off to the side sitting very low at about treetop height from the ground that blinked extremely bright white and red flashes. the brightness would vary from more dim to extreme brightness as this unit slowly ascended vertically while emmiting or receiving very bright orange balls the whole time. the other main stand-alone unit flashed extremely bright white and blue light and seemed to coordinate the triangle formations which appeared to have camoflague type abilities depending upon their backgrounds (clouds, sky, trees, etc). then i noticed the big boy directly overhead of me. it was diamond shaped and seemed to have a tail (kite shaped) and the tail consisted of green, yellow, and purple flashing units. the huge kite shape object had one star or unit on each corner (rhythmically pulsing white) while hovering stationary. over the course of 3 hours, i witnesses the kite object (probably hundreds of feet square) slowly slowly pivot, turn, barrel roll, stand vertically as well as lay flat. generally the kite didn't  move location very much. the regular triangles also behaved similarily but were varying height and light pulses every 5 minutes or so probably . however, all of the triangles kept repositioning different views and vary heights while shooting white beans of light off each other, several of which went right past me. the kite disappeared with the clouds for about 30 minutes and reappeared at a 45 degree angle from me. the bushes were making \"tongue-clicking\" noises as is you were calling for a cat, and were also moving. as the sky started getting lighter with sunrise, one by one the ufos propelled completely vertical until out of sight or behind clouds and the large kite camoflagued as a cloud and \"disappeared\". i felt lucky to witness this for 3 straight hours, as well as being left speechless and very confused and felt as though i was still being watched. i eventually cried random tears of joy and unrecognizable emotion, i can not explain why. it was the most amazing coordination and most spectacular event i think i will ever see. i'm a 100% believer in ufos after today, where as before i was open to the idea but skeptical.","distance":"N/A","duration":"03:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional

unlistenable.  back in the day, we put blankets and pillows on the hood of our car to watch.  we noticed a slow moving object (fairly big), slightly smaller than a hot air balloon but in a shape of an oval slowly approaching the drive in.  it traveled slowly from the northwest to the southeast.  it was a dark object and was spoked.  it was a moonlit sky so you could see all these spokes coming out in all directions.  it was fairly quiet, but there was a low level hum.  the craft passed directly over the huge outdoor movie screen.  and, the movie projection became distorted.   the craft

getting very close with them was no problem. i then started to feed them the grains as well. but they really didn't have an interest in the food. there eyes where wide open. like if they were terrified and scared. the more i noticed them pacing back and forth, and the more i noticed them all cramming to one side of the building, i kinda started to feel scared myself. i saw they were all avoiding the other side of the building. i took a few steps forward, to see if maybe there was a dead cow in the there. no dead cow. them a wird feeling of being watched came upon me. i stopped looking in the beds of the cows and looked at the end of the hall. at first glance i thought i was seeing a tree. then i realized there were no trees at the end of the hall. i had seen only half of a 4' gray, greenish, black alien. the head definitely was bigger then the body. the eye almond shaped slanted. it had been looking or analysing me. my feet said run but i couldn't run. i felt like i was moving in slow motion. i couldn't yell, nor talk. in a very slow way, that thing was hiding away from me behind the wall. finally i was a blessing to run and i ran home very scared. but as soon as i opened the door. i knew i had to be very quiet. or else my parents were gunna get the belt out. they were very strict. i tippytoed back inside my room with my siblings. i had never told anyone about that knight untill now. i'm 26 years old now. i get constant thoughts about that night more and more now.","distance":"101-500

night sky. my first thought was that it was an aircraft, possibly a life flight helicopter (common in our area, a regional hospital is only blocks away). noticed a green light mixed with blue, red and white, which is not uncommon for aircraft, but the tints seemed off for marker lights. pulled out my flightradar app to see what aircraft it might be, but found no commercial radar contacts within 50 miles of my position. light was moving slowly what appeared towards me at first, but later began moving away. night sky was clear, and this was by far the brightest object in the sky. it was not a satellite or the iss, as i am a regular sky watcher and know the difference. i remained stationary through most of the observation period (almost 10 minutes) until the very end when the light moved behind trees, so i adjusted my position to observe. i did witness at least one satellite cross the night sky during the event, and towards the end of the event a helicopter appeared on the flight path heading towards the hospital from the west/southwest of my position. the object remained a near constant radiance until the very end of the encounter when it faded and went out completely. i cannot be certain, but the object may have been ascending and moving away  towards the east. a random red, green, blue and white pattern of lights was observed throughout until the very end when it became a dull blue and then disappeared completely. it first appeared in the night sky at roughly 30 degrees, moved higher and then back towards the horizon, some of the last observed changes in apogee may have been partially due to my changing of position. no sound was heard, but i may have been too far away to hear. sounds from the interstate, approximately 1.5 miles from my position could be distinguished, and a barge engine was audible in the distance from the ohio river, approximately .75 mile from my position. i've been a sky watcher for most of my life and have witnessed some strange things, but never anything i couldn't explain fully. this i could not, especially after i realized it was not a registered aircraft or satellite.","distance":"N/A","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

(i checked stellarium afterwards and nothing was there that would be that bright). within a couple of minutes i had to move again because it was slowly moving north into a tree line. my husband joined me who is a skeptic of ufo's.  i pointed out what i was doing and he said \"that's definitely not a planet. that's definitely strange.\" he went back inside.  i moved south and steadied my camera taking a few pictures until it went out of view again and i could go no further south due to woods.  the entire viewing lasted 20 minutes from first sight.  i got one good picture where i had the camera zoomed in and the camera was steady and it was on the sport setting so it didn't create the streaks.  i'm no photographer but i do love my camera and i take a lot of pictures of planes, landscapes and animals.  it takes time to find a small object with digital zoom and hold it in frame so i couldn't get many pictures before the object was out of sight.  the object would stop and make short moves in all directions as it moved south to north in the western sky.  i'm including the zoomed in picture as well as a full view shot for perspective.  this was no sighting for the history books but it may help validate another sighting.  something was up there today moving strategically like it was searching for something or scanning.\r\n9463 captures the colors seen.  i realize it's \"streaky\" but the camera was set to landscape mode which is slower to capture.\r\n9473 is zoomed in and i felt was the best picture that captured what we could actually see.\r\n9477 is full view, zoomed in to the sky so the camera wouldn't focus on the trees.\r\n9467 is full view as well.\r\ni have a few more pictures but they're blurry or streaky.  the camera just doesn't capture what the eye can.
