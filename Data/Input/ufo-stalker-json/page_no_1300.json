because he was bent down picking up tools or still working. i was so focused on trying to figure out what it was and every detail on it, that i did not even tell my husband till i could no longer see the object anymore. it was a jaw dropping experience but i remained totally calm, no fear at all and feel this helped me to remember it vividly. \r\n\r\nat first, i thought what an odd firecracker flying way to low down, it was literally only as high up as my  eavestrough on my 2nd story house, but i quickly realized this object was not fireworks of any type. \r\nthis bright white-yellowish-orange flying sphere of light with what appeared to be a tail or trail coming out the back of the object (the tail through me off because in all the times i ever heard or read about these things no mention of a tail), the tail or trail coming from behind this object was not as uniform in shape as the sphere but appeared to be part of it (one continuous unit). there also appeared to be a swirling/marbling effect continuously changing within the object which appeared to be swirling in a light orange, yellow and white, as though it was chemicals or gasses not properly mixing.\r\nit was completely silent and unusually slowly moving (coasting/floating) appearing to remain at the eavestrough height level, but remained below the height of the tallest evergreen tree it floated by (which my husband estimates is about 20ft up while standing on our deck or 25ft from the ground level), it proceeded through our backyard moving in a straight line heading in a se direction, then proceeding between the 2 houses behind our house towards the street directly behind our property .\r\nsize comparison to a known object for comparison purposes only, this object appeared to be the same size as a large pilates exercise ball, a moving ball of light, the object definitely illuminated the space which surrounded this object. \r\n\r\none of my sons friends local to my area, also witnessed either the same or similar object right around the same time. she saw it stop flash and pulse several times then leave her sight. \r\n\r\nthe picture i uploaded is not one i took, it is for comparison purposes only, it is one from the internet that is the only picture i could see that looked just like it as it floated away, although the colours are off.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

however was seen by me and 2 witnesses and it was airborne.Approximately 10 pm last nite myself and 2 others saw a hovering orange light which was visible to me for about 3 minutes.When i first saw this i thought it was a star,but upon closer observation i noticed it was moving,it was not an airplane or helicopter and it emitted no sound.I was standing in the street and saw it was over the water behind ocracoke island,the oyster creek neighborhood.2 friends saw me and stopped to ask what i was doing and i found out they too had seen it earlier and saw it while they were talking to me.They said it was really fast and had seen it earlier.I have not seen them since the sighting because i didnt ask them enough questions at the time,it was saturday nite.Anyhow the objest seemed to hover and move back and forth for a ways in a random pattern but on one of the turns i saw it was triangle shaped becuse the lighting on the bottom i guess was in that pattern,i dont think it changed shape or anything because you know its hard to make out details in the sky at nite but it was there right off my neighborhood anyhow i strongly suspect this may be the military because we have had sightings before especially about 10 years ago before the v22 osprey was operational and deployed overseas  i knew what i saw then was coming from cherry point but there were usually a half dozen or so of those and we were permantly kicked off while scanning using a hand held scanner but heard a distinctly human male voice before being bumped.That was then we know what that was this was seen by us and made us excited i guess and after about 3 minutes it dissapeared below the trees and we did not see it again.Our observation was about a hundred yards or so form the neighborhood and there were trees in the way as that allowed the object to retire from site,nothing fast just meandered away really.I would say this was about the size of a small car as i said i was walking from my neighborhood along the main road and saw what i thought was a star,i have mistakenly thought stars might be something upon sighting them,but if they dont move its your eyes playing tricks on you.However this seemed to move so i stopped in the middle of the road and looked closer and it did move,back and forth like it was looking for something.It had orange lights so it wasnt a star and while i was looking at it my friends stopped and saw it again  all i can say is it seemed triangular after i saw that pattern of lighting,the size of a small car maybe a little bigger its hard to judge hovering and meandering giving out no sound on a quiet nite but like im said the military has lots of bases around here so i thought i should let you know  i did not see any entities so i put robotic since this was a machine,you should work on that","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

driving, my mother was in the front passenger side, and i was behind my mother in the back seat. the day���s weather conditions were 90 degrees and clear blue california skys. we were driving down sierra college blvd. at 1:50 pm. we crossed brace road and were approching taylor road intersection when my brother asked openly ���what is that in the sky���. i looked left and right and seen nothing, then i moved quickly to the center of the seats so i could get a better view out of the front windows. as we crossed over the taylor road intersection i noticed the direction my brother was looking and so i stared in that same direction (west���ish), but there was a batch of trees in the way. a couple seconds later the trees cleared the view and i was able to see what my brother was talking about out of the rear side window. at first glance it looked like a large white airplane with out a tail wing. it was also flying lower than a normal commercial plane should be (approx. 3k-5k above the earth and 20-25 degrees from horizon). i switched my view from the back rear driver window to the front window (approx. 1 second of broken view from the object). the object started to glow like a standard tube shaped fluorescent bulb. the time for the object to change from what looked like standard white auto paint to a glowing fluorescent tube was about 3 seconds. after the object started to glow a transparent undefined semi-circle cloud/mist formed around the object vertically (approx. 1-2 miles wide). it seemed like the cloud formed instantly out of no where. within the center of the cloud was the object. directly around the cigar shaped object was what looked like heat waves shimmering above and blow the object. as soon as the cloud formed you could see the object within/behind the cloud starting to glow even brighter. the object quickly started to glow very bright. so bright that i had to stop looking at it directly and looked about 5 degrees up to the right of it (the edge of the newly formed cloud). about a second after i looked to the edge of the cloud it vanished. i immediately looked back to the spot in the sky where the object had been stationary at. nothing! not even the cloudy formation was present. just open blue skys as far as the eye could see. i quickly panned all around the sky where it was. there was nothing in the sky, nothing. the closes air force base is beale a.F.B. at about 15 miles from where we viewed it at. we all have seen many different military air craft living so close to a a.F.B. this was unlike anything i���ve ever

when i spotted an orange-red circular light in the eastern sky.  at first i assumed the light was part of the fireworks that had been taking place off and on throughout our ride, but just a minute or so later, we rounded a curve to find the light was directly in front of us just below a low cloud cover.  the strangeness of what we saw stopped us both in our tracks, literally.  the color and circular pattern of the lights were obviously different than any air craft we typically see.\r\n\r\nat first the object appeared to be stationary and at an altitude of about 3000 ��� 5000 feet.  there was absolutely no sound coming from the object whatsoever throughout our observation.  as we continued to observe, the craft made it���s way toward us in a westward direction at what appeared to be a steady altitude.  the speed appeared to be about that of single engine plane.  \r\n\r\nas it passed directly overhead it was obvious that the object was illuminated unlike any airplane we���ve ever observed.  the lights appeared to be arranged in a circular pattern, were pulsating rather than blinking, and were predominantly red and either yellow or orange.  what we observed definitely was not typical of airplane running lights.  we were unable to make out a shape other than the circular appearance of the lights, and there was no unusual motion ��� just a steady westward track.  we were able to observe the object for about five minutes before it slowly went out of sight.  we estimate that the craft would have flown just south of the bowling green airport as it headed westward.\r\n\r\nmy husband and i both are reasonably intelligent, college-educated persons with what i would consider an average curiosity in possibility of extra-terrestrial life.  i am 52 and my husband is 60, neither of us were drinking or under the influence of any substances.  we have a pool at our current residence and have spent many evenings observing the night sky, including the typical air traffic and the occasional satellite.  \r\n\r\nin summary, what we saw was unusual enough that we both felt it important to report our observations.  the complete lack of sound at such a low altitude and the color and circular arrangement of the lights were unlike anything either of us had ever seen before.  my husband was particularly intrigued with the complete lack of sound.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

and frantically told me to come outside. i did, and we both witnessed first 1 red/orange orb slowly ascending from west to north west.  it wasn't burning just a solid glowing light.  i thought at first it could have been some type of firework.  however, the object was moving too slow, it was not burning, there was no smoke or trail of any type, and no sound.  then a few minutes later from the same direction another one appeared, same description.  i was really starting to wonder what was going on then.  i'd never seen anything quite like it.  also take into mind that i watch the sky very often and have seen lots of things( some strange) but never like this.  then a couple of minutes later i saw another one, same path as the others.  shortly after that another appeared.  i waited to see if i could see any more of them, but nothing else appeared, except an airplane in a completely different spot when the orbs were not visible anymore.\r\n    i have seen other strange things in the sky before, but nothing quite like this.  i do believe there are some strange things out there unexplained.  any information on this would be much appreciated.  we do live around a well populated area so i'm sure we weren't the only ones to witness this.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:17:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

park down a street. seemed normal till we saw him observing a bunch of glowing red orbs in the sky. at first we thought it could have been a flyover for the last day of fireworks but as time went on this scenario seemed less likely to be. they were all traveling in close proximety to one another. there must have been over 15 of them. the red lights were flashing sequentially bright then dull bright then dull. the objects didnt flutter or change direction suddenly. they didnt dissappear either. they were over 500 above in the sky and moving fast for the distance they appeared away. at the time there were helicopters in the air, not close to them or viewing them, but you can tell the difference. if your from the area you know its wide open fields and theres always at least 3 helicopters in the sky. there were also planes flying above to. im curious as to what the cop saw or why there were over 5 other cars pulled to the side of the road but i cant seem to find answers or other peoples sightings.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional
