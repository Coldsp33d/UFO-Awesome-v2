looking down and clearly remembers seeing the angle of the shadows being cast from the blades of grass by the blue flashes. because of this he knew the object wasn't directly above us but slightly off to the side some. \r\n\r\nwe both instantly looked up out of instinct and above us was a large solid white orb completely stationary. it seemed close but due to being in the sky at night it was hard to judge actual distance. i always thought it was just under 100 feet off the ground but my friend thought more like 300 feet. i would give a visual estimate of size as around 9 full moons in the sky if that makes sense. \r\n\r\nthe object was close enough that i could see almost like small red bands of electricity sparking around the skin of the object, almost as if it was shedding some form of excess static electricity. \r\n\r\nafter a few seconds of not moving it shot off in an instant to one side. the speed of the movement left a large white tail behind, the width of the object itself, so it was rather wide in the sky. a second later the tail disappeared after the object, this was an incredible sight. it was like seeing the old enterprise enter warp speed the way the stars would streak past.\r\n\r\nthe orb itself was solid in color like looking at a white light bulb. it never fluctuated or dimmed this was definitely a solid object not ball lightning. i am a very logical person and i have searched and searched for other explanations since but there is nothing capable of the movements we witnessed. \r\n\r\nto me i have always felt like there were some key aspects to our sighting that may hold important clues. i feel the blue flashes have something to do with how the object got where it was sitting when we saw it. i know meteors and such cause those bright flashes  when entering a certain layer of our atmosphere. blue flashes from meteors are rarer but are caused from certain types of material make up being burned up on entry if i remember correctly. \r\n\r\nknowing that, and that what was in the sky above was not anything like a meteor since it was stationary, i believe the blue flashes were simply the effect of it entering our atmosphere. most likely any object entering our atmosphere at high speeds would cause some type of flash so i feel this fits. \r\n\r\nsecondly the electrical sparking that snaked around the object at first seems important. there was only a little amount of this and it seemed to quickly dissipate. to me the object got to where it sat from wherever. which was like step one for it. then as it discharged excess energy it was also prepping for its next move, ie reached earth now prepping to move to next location.\r\n\r\nanyways after it shot off we ran across town to another friends house who's dad was a local policeman. we new he was very interested in ufos so we wanted to let him know. he was pretty interested in what we had to say. the next day we ran into him again and he told us that there were many reports that night of people seeing the object around the general area. one couple even reported it following them as they drove down placer hills road that night and that they were very scared trying to get away from it.\r\n\r\ni have seen my fair share of questionable things in the sky but i'm very skeptical even though i do believe in ufos and aliens. i have a few really special and unique experiences but even those don't hold a candle to the scope and clarity of this event. that's why i decided to share this. \r\n\r\nalso i think it bears mentioning that the friend i was with seemed to be a magnet for ufo activity growing up. he is the most trustworthy person i know and he is almost always with people when he sees things so i hold his experiences as very credible. and unfortunately for him ufos and aliens terrify him, me i just want answers and as much real knowledge on the subject as i can find. this event for me made there no question about aliens. i know it's all on my word but this event did happen as i told, so if the event is looked at with an open mind i believe there may be some valuable info gained from what we witnessed. even now 15 or so years later i still think about that event daily, the details have been burned into my mind, and i wouldn't want it any other way, although i really really want to know who occupied the object.","distance":"101-500

a slight haze, so not many stars were visible at the time. i had been looking at two particularly bright lights, wondering which stars they were. they were north about 25 degrees off the horizon. i started looking forward, but they were still in my peripheral vision. as a light post passed between the lights and myself, one seemed to move behind the pole quicker than the other. i figured it was because i was walking, so i stopped to observe. this is when one of the lights started accelerating. i was confused at first because i didn't understand how i could have mistaken a satellite for a star. the initial speed was that of a satellite, but it only went a short distance before it doubled and then tripled, at least, the normal speed of a satellite. after it had traveled about 20 degrees along the horizon, it came to a complete and immediate stop. it then began to move higher in the sky and then stopped again. all this happened in less than 3 seconds. i started to wonder if the star that i thought stopped, was there all along and the original object just happened to disappear from sight around it. however, the second bright light i was originally observing, began moving in the same direction. it came to a stop just passed the first star and under it. just then a third light came into view forming a triangle with the other two. within a couple of minutes, two shooting stars sequentially took the same trajectory, and started at the same position the lights traveled. i assumed they were shooting stars because they appeared out of nowhere. i kept walking my dog looking up the whole time. about 15 minutes later, a third shooting star, same trajectory, same path. after i got home, i went out back to stargaze and about 30 minutes after the third shooting star, a fourth one did the same thing. the 3 lights remained in the same position until about 4, which is when i was finally able to fall asleep. for all i know, they are still

notice the orb. normally, the sky is dark and there are no signs of stars because it is either too misty or too cloudy. nearby, there is a 7-11 where i get a cup of coffee. before i leave to get coffee, i do a bit of cleaning and head back to the car to retrieve the cup. when i went to get it, i noticed a faint display of colors, rotating in the sky. from the distance, it appeared to be a helicopter or an airplane, but there are no airports in the area. i brushed it off and opened the door to the car and grabbed the cup. when i looked back up, the lights had changed from orange to blue to white and so on. then i could make out a dark shape that seemed to be changing in shape. i didn't understand, so i went and told mom about it. she came out with me, thinking i was crazy. when she looked into the sky, all she said was \"wow! what is that?\" i didn't know what to tell her, but she took out her phone to take pictures. as dawn approached twilight, the shape was beginning to show more and more. shapeshifting, it was hard to make out what it was doing. below it, maybe some 20ft away, we saw a green light, blinking as if following it. through mom's phone, all we saw was the green light, but not the orb with the colors. we wondered for minutes what it meant. i took out my own phone, but the camera is old and it made out nothing. several times, we went back and forth, going in then coming back out to check up on it. not once did it move, even drift, so it couldn't be a balloon. an hour later, when twilight arrived, we made out a pure spherical object. it shone blue/black and there was a blinking white light under it, no longer in colors. it also appeared to be rotating, with little bumps on the sides. finally, sunrise, and i was able to take video with my camera but all you can see is a dot in the sky. today, july 6th, we went to work again but we saw no sign whatsoever of the orb.","distance":"Over One

van and looked out and saw a bright lite that appeared to be following us. i explained to them that it just appeared that way because we were doing about 60 miles an hour. we continued to watch for several minutes and by this time it was completely daylight. no stars in the sky except this bright light. that's when i started watching real close. it appeared to be stationary but still looked like it was following us if that makes sense. this had gone on for about 30 minutes. without warning the light as i will call it, dropped down about tree level and accelerated very fast ahead of us. at this point i knew it wasn't just a star in the sky. it appeared to move very fast effortlessly and at some times dropped below tree level. we could only see it through the trees. all this time that went by, about 50 minutes, we never saw another vehicle or person other than ourselves. just as fast as it appeared, it disappeared. just seconds after it disappeared, we started seeing cars and other vehicles. we were all pretty freaked out, so we pulled over and talked about what we had seen. i only told a few people in my life about this for fear of them thinking i was crazy. i was so thankful i had several other people with me or i wouldn't have believed it myself. over the years i lost contact with most of those guys, except one. we have remained good friends over all these years, and still to this day we talk about that mourning on the back roads of southern alabama. he says he doesn't discuss it with anyone but me because he knows i saw the same thing he saw. one thing i forgot to mention, its been 30 years. about 15 or 20 minutes after we first noticed this object, we pulled over on the side of the road, got out of the van and just looked at the object. it looked like a bright star, but only a few hundred yards in the sky. at that time, it never moved. just sat there. what was strange to us at the time was, no clouds, no stars in the sky, and it was completely daylight by this time. not until we saw it accelerate past us through the trees that we knew something wasn't normal. i never have been able to explain to myself what i saw.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet -

tn to work in chattanooga, tn.. i usually left at around 7am every morning to get to work by 8 am.  i was driving on hwy 27, the main road to chattanooga from dayton and at about 7:30am (sun was starting to rise- dawn), i noticed a light hovering over the tree line just south east of my position, about a few miles north of soddy daisy. there were some cars on the road but not a lot. \r\n\r\nat first i thought it might be a helicopter. but as i got closer the lights seemed a bit... off.  i was traveling about 55 miles an hour and the object still was not moving.. as a matter of fact, it was so still, it was almost like it was sitting on a table or something. didn't adjust to wind or anything. so i kept my eyes on it and as i got closer i notice that the lights seemed to be triangular in shape.. probably about 6 or so on the underbelly and the object itself was shaped like a triangle.. the color of object looked dark, maybe black, probably due to sun not being up yet.. i didn't seen any blades like a helicopter would have, nor any kind of engine or exhaust. it just sat there. when i passed it up, i looked back in my rear view mirror and it was still there. didn't move at all. and it stayed there until i passed the point where i couldn't see it or the trees anymore. \r\n\r\ni mentioned it to my family and we really tried to explain it away.. again, helicopter was the only thing it could be, but it wasn't. i am 85% sure. i am a very analytical person. i tried to take in as much detail as i could and really couldn't explain what it was. if it were today, i might say it kind of looked like a stealth f-117 fighter but without fins or any protruding parts, and those don't hover.\r\n\r\ni remember it like it was yesterday. it was strange and interesting at same time. if it was a ufo, then i feel honored to have seen one.","distance":"101-500
