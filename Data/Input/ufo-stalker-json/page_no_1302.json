ways.I sat there for about a half hour untill i realized i should take some pictures.I reached in the camper and grabed my camera and sat back down in my chair and started to take pictures.I took maybe 20 pictures and then got up and walked to the edge of the river and took more pictures.I have zoom on my camera and many pictures are of when i zoomed.At one point one of then raised up a little and came in my direction.I got the feeling it was looking me over.I heard no noise and saw no fumes or emissions.I was not scared at all just curious.They were not threating in any manner.In all i took about 38 pictures.I will post 6 pictures here.If you want to see all of them i would glady send them to you.At one point i did not believe they were real.I thought maybe they were cobwebs and the

one do the same exact thing. it also disappeared in the same place. then another one came. followed by two more. the last one was bright red. they were all pulsating. and one by one they disappeared. since it was 4th of july everybody was outside. i think my neighbors saw it to cause they were all watching in that direction. it wasnt a fire work or a plane. it could have been a chinese lantern. but like i said i keep seeing these. the first time i reported it. but i didnt the second time. but now that i saw this i thought it needed to be reported. i know other people in my area saw it to so i hope my report will be followed by theirs.

lighting up sparklers when i noticed what i believed to be a really bright star or a planet, but then realized that in mere minutes it had a trajectory and was moving away from us. \r\n\r\ni first witnessed it facing west and it continued heading in that direction until we lost sight of the bright object. immediately at first seeing it, i called my wife to come out with my cheap sony digital camera and i began snapping away. it was sort of light out when i began but it soon darkened outside. i should point out that with the naked eye, the bright object appeared to be emitting its own light source and it kept flickering and flashing. again, thinking \"okay maybe just a star or planet\". there was no sound that i heard. it didn't fly away like plane nor did it move like a helicopter. it was just... well, just stationary.\r\n\r\n... but looking closely at the photos, i was shocked. this thing appears to have a classic serpent shape of some kind with sentience to it. it is very much alive and flying through the sky and unlike anything i have ever witnessed. it is not a firecracker or the result of fireworks being fired in the sky either... \r\n\r\nmy buddy who was with me has never believed in this sort of stuff. after last night, and seeing the photos he now no longer questions whether we are not alone. \r\n\r\n*update, i witnessed the same bright object appear near same sky area and moving towards west. this time i photographed it from my kitchen window.","distance":"Over One
