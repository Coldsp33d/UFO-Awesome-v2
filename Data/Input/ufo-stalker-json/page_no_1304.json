could make out the shape of the craft.  it resembled a turtle shell and from the distance i would say that the craft was very large.  i was able to make out two craft as such, and was also able to see the shape of a craft as it passed over my home without lights.  the lights turned off, and i was able to make out the same shape of a large craft that physically blocked out the night sky.  i have seen things like this in my life, but never in this detail.  i also believe that i also saw one of these craft on the date of july 3, 2013.  the craft that day was exactly the same as on july 4th in description but only with the fire like appearance.  as i have mentioned, i do have video of the craft(s) with and without lights.  it was an amazing event and i plan to monitor the sky above my home for further evidence.  if someone would like to contact me to view these videos or to interview myself,  i am more than happy.  the second witness to most of this sighting was my 6 year old son, he

very faint pinpoint of light passing overhead at an extremely high altitude at around 9:45pm est.  we noticed the light because every 15 - 20 seconds, it pulsated an extremely bright white light that lasted for 3 or 4 seconds which was almost too bright to look at.  the sighting lasted about 60 - 90 seconds as it passed over the house from the southeast, traveling at a moderate rate of speed in a straight line moving northwest until it disappeared.  i quickly grabbed my binoculars from right inside the door and observed a perfectly roundish oval shaped object that seemed internally lit with a faint white light that then flashed very bright white, so bright that i could not observe with the binoculars when it lit up.  there were no green or red navigation lights on the object as i normally observe on planes that frequently travel through the area.  additionally, the altitude of this object seemed extraordinarily high, and could almost barely be seen against the black sky when the light was not pulsing.  extremely unusual looking light as when the light pulsated it seemed very close to the ground, but when the light dimmed it looked to be thousands of feet in altitude.  we followed the object as it passed until it pulsated one last time and disappeared completely.  myself and my guests were all very amazed by what we observed as other planes in the sky at the time were clearly identifiable by navigation lights, sound and normal flight pattern/path.  this object we witnessed made no observable noise, was extremely high and pulsated an incredibly bright light that we were able to observe so far from the object.

looking out to the north, saw a bright red-orange/yellow-orange object moving slowly in my general direction. as my daughter and i watch the skies frequently and she was inside, i called her out to see what i was looking at. she was outside within 30 seconds by which time a second object was also in the sky, following the same basic line of flight. just as the first object was about to go out of our view - behind a tree to the ne - a third object appeared in the northern spot from which the first two had originated. so there were three objects viewable in the sky at the same time. this was from 12:33 to 12:36. we viewed the objects both with the naked eye and with binoculars. the best way to describe the objects is to say they were egg like (without the shell). the \"whites\" of the eggs were approximately one and a half times larger than the \"yolks\" and the yolks were the light source of the objects and rotated in a similar fashion to police lights in that they seemed to spin in the bottom of the \"egg\" and illuminated brighter and dimmer as they spun. almost immediately after the third object went behind the tree in the ne which was the last point we could see them, a fourth one appeared in the northern sky from where the original three had originated. a second one followed suit before the fourth one was no longer viewable; there were two in our field of vision at this instance. about 2-3 minutes after the fifth one had gone behind the tree there was another, and approximately 4-5 minutes after the sixth there was a seventh. we had also seen a similar object west of our position at 10:45 pm (on the 4th of july) and (though we didn't really think so) concluded that, logically, it must have been a chinese lantern. it was moving way too fast for us to really believe that, but we didn't want to let our imaginations run away from us and we had not observed it intently with the binoculars. seeing the 7 others after midnight convinced us that the first/earlier object was one of the same types. the objects that we observed were moving very smoothly and relatively slowly through the sky, taking about 2 to 2.5 minutes apiece to move across our field of view; probably about 8 miles of travel total with the nearest point being a bit less than a mile away. the last object we saw was at 12:44 in the early morning of july the 5th.

(it appeared in childhood.)  in the early 1990's, i began having flashbacks to something, i still don't know what, but whatever it was was frightening.  **the only reason i tell you this is, that's one of the things that was very odd about this \"ufo\" (if i can use that term) which i'm reporting now.  looking at it, i felt calm, and even thought it was quite beautiful.  with my history, you'd think that if i believed i was looking at a \"ufo\", i'd be under the bed wetting myself and crying for mommie two minutes later.  but that was not the case.  \r\n\r\ni'm reporting only one witness, me, because i didn't talk to the neighbors; they were pretty intent on blowing things up and cheering about it at the time.  besides, i was in my pajamas & wanted to get back inside--and make sure my cats weren't in there popping valiums or anything.
