se\r\n\r\nplease only use my first name if this is reported to anyone or in media.\r\n\r\ni have been inspecting helicopters as a plane captain sh-60h,f,s mh-60r for over 2 years at nas north island about 1-2 miles from the pacific. have been working from 10:30pm-7:00am for the past 9 months. this is not the first time i have seen something interesting, however this was the most obvious to anyone focused on the sky. i had just finished inspecting a bird when, i saw a very distant light that seemed to be changing from blue to red to white, and i thought it was a star. it was very far away directly w, as we have a true north line 200 yds from my flightline and verifies it was directly w.. i watched it for about 5 minutes, then started looking around the sky to see if i could spot anything else. i saw another similar looking light emitting object in the sw. they were the same distance, it appeared, and i started looking around the entire sky to try to spot anything else. i then saw an object closer, but still very high flying directly over the base heading se with 3 flashing white lights. i could not take any photo or film because it is fod and not allowed for me to have while performing my duties. even if i did i do not believe i would have been able to catch much because it was so high, but the lights appeared to flash in sequence and i believe i saw the outline of a triangle when the lights would flash and illuminate. i have seen information on the tr-3b craft before, and i am not certain but i believe that is what i saw. however, it was flying slow, like a plane and not like a super fast ufo zooming off with hypersonic speed. it made no noise, which troubled me as i hear all kinds of military aircraft, as i work on a flight line next with multiple airstrips and i recognize all kinds of aircraft.\r\ni pointed it out to a friend of mine who was also inspecting the helicopter and he saw what i pointed out but did not offer any opinion. i have been looking at the sky every night since october, as i work 10:30pm-7am and this is the interesting thing i have seen. i have friends that have seen other things, and i have as well but this is the one that caught my attention most as i am very skeptical considering how many types of aircraft fly from and over our base. i have seen many shooting stars and interesting things, but i usually just pass them off as it is something from the base. after i saw the objects, the sky got cloudy and was then cloud covered. i drove away from my job to a darker area to try to see the objects better and it was completely cloudy when i got closer to the ocean and further from the city and base lights. i was not able to see any of the 3 again. \r\n","distance":"Over One

first, i assumed it was a plane, but then every 10 seconds or so i'd glance at it again and it was not moving at all. the not moving was what really caught my attention. i'd like to believe it was just a commercial jetliner, only problem was (a) it had no wings (b) it wasn't moving at all over the course of several minutes (c) it occasionally glowed a little even in broad daylight -- just a slight halo of pale light.  i'd like to believe it was a single solitary lenticular cloud except that it was too uniform in shape and too solid-looking. there were absolutely no clouds anywhere in the

cancer.  he relied on oxygen machine, the kind that's plugged into the wall.  a few weeks earlier we had a storm and electricity went out.  we scrambled to get his portable oxygen.  scary situation.  \r\n\r\nweather reports said we would be having storms coming in so i decided i would go to my house, (staying with my father providing care) and get my generator, get it ready just in case.  i hooked up my father's utility trailer and traveling east on highway 154, just after passing fm 852, a few cars backed up in some light traffic so i was barely moving and something caught my eye in the upper left of my windshield.  i lean forward and see it's four or five black birds.  then i see just to the right of where the birds were, directly up and very, very low, 5-7 large white circles/spheres.  they were so white it reminded me of a white balloon, the kind that is a little fluorescent looking.  these spheres were very low and maybe the size of a volkswagon or a little bigger.  they were somewhat stationary but then started slightly moving/intermingling then just to the right of the spheres started appearing numerous white triangles.  each triangle joined together perfectly and made three rows.  the outer triangles, the way they looked joined together, appeared they made a complete circle of triangles from my angle.  the triangles were fully suspended, not moving at all.  no sound/noise.  i noticed as the triangles were forming and joining there was only maybe two spheres left; like they were changing into these triangles and multiplying like times 10.\r\n\r\nsince i was driving slowly at the time i viewed this maybe 15-20 seconds.  i couldn't believe what i was seeing.  i pulled over at what use to be the speedy pantry and turned around, driving back and looking up didn't see it, so turned around on fm 852 and drove slowly looking up where i had seen it and it was no longer there.  to this day when i pass through there i still look up.  \r\n\r\n\"describe your feelings, reactions and actions during and after sighting the object?\"  \r\n\r\nwell, i wasn't afraid.  i was just dumbfounded and in disbelief.  i remember reaching for my phone then remembering my phone hadn't been working since the end of november.  i could answer an incoming call by flipping the phone open but couldn't dial out, couldn't text, couldn't retrieve contacts, none of the buttons worked.  my sister and i were so busy taking care of our father it wasn't a priority to get it replaced at that time.  i only told a few people about it since it happened.  didn't want to be labeled a \"nut\".  even thought about calling the sheriff's office and talking to some deputies i know to see if anyone else reported anything. checked the paper(s) to see if any other sitings. did a lot of online searches to see if anyone else saw what i saw.  i made a hand drawing of what i saw.  i also remember when driving thinking, i am now under this thing and then trying to look back to see if i could still see it.  did a google earth search to see just per chance was there anything there at one time.  there is something that looks like a sun flare but that is it.\r\n\r\ni guess there is a number of reasons i didn't report it at the time.  not sure really who to report it to or if i should.  not wanting to be labeled, still dealing with the loss of my father since feb., and having no photo or video of what i saw, people might not believe me.  \r\n\r\nokay, i've reported it and hope this is never used against me in the future.

learned about physics, it seems improbable that beings from another planet are visiting ours. the vast majority of physicists agree. on the other hand, credible witnesses have experienced events science can't explain. assuming both are true,what's left? \r\n  it was the fall of 1980, late saturday afternoon. the sky was a sharp bright blue without a cloud in sight. my girlfriend  and i were driving southbound along leslie st.Toward york mills rd. in suburban toronto,a busy section of town at any time. \r\n  she was at the wheel, which was not the norm. the passenger side window was down. i glanced up and noted the crispness of the blue overhead. as i turned my head back to watch the road, i realized my eye had caught something up above. i remember immediately saying to myself \"what the heck is that little cloud doing in a perfectly clear sky?\" i looked up again and saw that it wasn't a cloud at all. it appeared solid, white and it was way up there. i knew it was something odd and quickly asked my girlfriend to pull off the road.\r\n    we turned into the parking lot of a restaurant called \"teddy kennedy's ribs,\" on the easst side of leslie just before york mills. a group of about a dozen restaurant patrons were already gathered outside looking up at this thing. it was incredibly exciting, surreal. people were squealing and shrieking at the sight of the object. we looked at each other and asked \"can you believe it?!\"\r\n   the object was rectangular in shape, reflective and white like any airplane high up there and it was huge. the first thought that popped into my head was \"giant aircraft carrier.\" it seemed to be at least that big if not bigger. it appeared to have substance. it was bulky and long. it was too high to make out any other details. without any reference points, i judged it to be at an altitude of maybe 40,000 ft, where passenger jets fly their highest. it loped along in a striaght line north to south much slower than any jet i'd
