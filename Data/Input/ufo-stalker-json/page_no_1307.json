again until that april 19, 2013 on my way to work at 6am.  i pulled out of my garage and turned onto johnnycake rd.  when i made the turn onto fairbrooks, i saw this bright starlike light.  it was really low, and i thought, oh maybe it was a drone.  it was still a little misty out and it was still a little dark, but not real dark. i made the turn onto fairbrooks and then turned onto greengage to security blvd.  that only takes about 2 minutes.  when i got to the stop light at security...The first light..I looked up above the stop light and that light was there.  i did not see it move to this position and i did not see it move in december.  however, this time it moved right over my car.  i looked up through the sun roof and all i saw was the most beautiful blue light i had ever seen.  i cannot describe the color.  only one blue light over the closest side to the passenger seat.  it made no sound, i could see no shape, nothing.  it passes my car going in a steady line heading toward the centers for medicade and medicare services (cms). the light turned green and i went forward trying to look in my rear view mirror. i looked and it was no where in sight. i have not seen it since. did anyone else see this?  there were other cars at the light, but i did not look at them.\r\nthat night i told my family.  i was shaken and they knew i was serious.  then a few day later my daughter called me and said that she saw it.  she said it looked just as i described and did not move.  she did not see underneath it.  her friend was with her and neither one of them had an explaination for

went out to brisbane airport to take photo's of aircraft. i spent several hours out there, say 10am till 6pm. i would usually take my camera (canon eos 350d at the time) which would have a spare battery, six 1gb cf cards. by 6pm those cards would be full.\r\non this day i took three lenses. canon 100-400mm, canon 70-200mm (which was used for the attached shot) and a sigma 18-200mm.\r\n\r\nduring the morning the was a bit of mist, but cleared to a nice sunny day. somewhere around 4pm a qantas 767 aircraft departed for melbourne. at this point the jet was around 400-500ft and climbing.\r\nthe object in question seems like its much further away than the aircraft.\r\nlooking at the image, the plane is climbing out over the runway (rwy 19) towards the south, i was standing at the north end of the international terminal.Looking east, towards fisherman island (an artificial island where the oil & cargo shipping terminal is).\r\nseveral people i've shown this photo to are unsure as to what it really is.\r\npersonally, i was firing a whole series of photo's, usually if its a bird. the image before and after would also show this. though in this case both only show the plane.\r\n\r\ni wasn't aware of this till i went home and reviewed all my photo's and saw that spot.\r\ni emailed a few friends of the days photo's and included this amongst them. next morning at work all of them question what it really is...\r\n\r\ni'm still thinking it maybe a bird out of focus, really hope its not... i just thought i'll share with you and see what your opinion maybe.\r\n\r\nalso the attached image is a full size unedited.\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\nnorbert vari\r\n\r\n ","distance":"Over One

have at least two white external lights and i could see it clearly enough to see different colors of grays on the various surfaces of the box like shapes making it look very much three dimensional. i saw at least three boxlike shapes.  all of this made me believe it was the space station.\r\n\r\ni didn't think much about this until i was describing this to my cousin, an electrical engineer who is working on the reentry vehicle for nasa.  he is also a star watcher.  he said it would be impossible to see the kind of detail i described if i were actually looking at the space station due to its high altitude.  this convinced me to report this.\r\n\r\ni would conclude that either this is a true ufo or it was actually the space station that somehow was enlarged due to some optical modification

shooting baskets.  off in the distance, about 1/2 mile i saw a light coming at me. i was thinking after i looked again , \"wow that's a low flying plane or helicopter,\" i heard no noise. that's when i felt it wasn't a plane or chopper. i kept looking as it slowly came over the treetops. most of the trees were maple trees, and i would say approx 75-120 ft tall around . as it got within 1,000 ft of me, it was now more or less in the open as it  glided over the backyards. i started to feel helpless and stared at it , wondering what it was. our garage had the basketball hoop on it and i was facing it as i stated earlier, shooting baskets. i then turned and to my front now faced the cherry tree we had on our property line. the cherry tree stood approximately 12-15 ft. high. the object was now clearly not man-made at all, even at eleven i realized it right away. i saw a sphere like object sort of flat on the bottom. it was a yellowish color, not glowing or anything like that, not round as it kind of flattened out on the bottom, like it was the \"cockpit\" and it was approximately 25-30 ft. across. i say \"cockpit\" as it was then about 250 ft. above and about 50 degrees i saw them. i now clearly saw 2 occupants and they were silhouetted by the \"cockpit\" light. the one to my right was apparently standing up, arms spread apart standing upon  the \"control panel?\". the other occupant was sitting down, as i could only see \"it's\" shoulders and head. both figures were silhouetted, but they had round looking heads, slim  bodies. the craft may of been gliding slow for this took like 10-15 minutes to observe. as it passed overhead, i remember no shape to it, i stuttered out to my sister **** come here look!. i looked back and the craft now slowly had already climbed into the sky and within the few seconds it took for me to cry out and her to come out of the garage it was gone. she said she didn't see it, but due to my excitement, knew i had just seen something. i jumped on her bicycle and rode to the school parking lot, about 1500 ft. away. i didn't see anything but stars.\r\n\r\ni have reported this before 2x in my life, once to some online site that claimed they were reputable, the name i don't remember as it was like 30 some years ago i did that. i also had reported it to mufon about 6 years ago, never  heard nothing. i also asked for the disclosure project aka dr. greer to contact me, all i got was an auto response.\r\n\r\ni was in the military and carried a tsci of top secret umbra with gamma access. i also had a second sighting, which was seen by myself, my sister, and my uncle and aunt. it was noted on a radio station too that night. i will submit that report as well, if anything becomes of this one.\r\n\r\nthe proverbial ball is in your

night, my wife, son and myself were visiting our newly bought land near quartier dix30 in brossard, qc.\r\n\r\nwe spent a good 20 minutes walking around on our land and i took a number of pictures with my canon powershot a620 camera.\r\n\r\nat the time we were there, there were no sounds, no stars or planes in the sky. you could only see a blue sky with high altitude cloud levels.\r\n\r\nat 8:45pm est i took a picture of my wife and son overlooking the land where you can see the houses being built nearby. the view also provided a clear view of the sky. at the time i took the picture there was nothing in the sky.\r\n\r\nafter our visit, we left the area and headed home. it is only a number of years later that i noticed, while re-examining the pictures, that the picture i took of my wife and son was also showing 2 glowing objects in the sky that seem to be traveling together (approx 1/2 mile apart). one of these glowing objects seemed to show a small but visible trail. the object with the trail seemed to show a disc-like shape.\r\n\r\nas i explained initially, when i took this picture there was nothing in the sky. these 2 objects only appeared on camera. when i took the picture the flash was on as well as the ir (infra-red) light to help minimize rabbit eyes. i'm not sure if this somehow contributed to the appearance of these objects but when i took the picture there was nothing in the sky that was visible to the naked eye.\r\n\r\ntoday i am quite certain that these are actual ufo objects which were not meant to be seen by the naked eye.\r\n\r\nthe image submitted

odd in the sky.  it was black and when i first saw it i thought it was just a bunch of 3 very large black balloons floating to the south of us.  it was such an odd shape that i ran to the middle of the yard to get a better look and while i couldn't discern what it was because the shape was so odd, i was going to dismiss it as a bunch of balloons based on it's movement.  but, as i stared at it i saw toward the top red and blue flashing lights - and that's when my heart stopped because it hit me i had no idea what it was i was looking at.  it was low, and nearby.  too low to be a plane, chopper, kite, etc.  there was a sound that sounded like an engine, sort of a low hum but for some reason i didn't associate it with the craft.  it didn't seem to \"fit\".  so as i was watching it i was trying hard to see the shape.  it was still very bright out and i could see that it was jet black with a sort of \"t\" shape.  the top of the \"t\" being some sort of wings or blades, and the \"leg\" of the \"t' being dragged below it.  the top of the \"t\" looked sort of bulbus and the lights were at the top.  i really don't know how to describe it because i couldn't really make it out it was moving pretty fast, it seemed to almost float.  as it was heading south it was decending until it went out of view, not far from my home.  my husand and i were both convinced it may not have been big enough to be piloted by anything, but not small enough to be some fancy remote controlled toy.  maybe it was a drone?  it moved like a floating black icecream cone with circular wings and lights at the top with the \"cone\" dragging below it.  it was strange at how black it was.  i wish i knew what it was.","distance":"101-500

grad reception ended we all headed out into the parking lot where we could take some pictures. about 10-15 minutes being in the parking lot people began to leave and we were getting ready to go as well. then looking up at the evening sky i noticed an object. the object was round and looked like a ball. the color of the object was grey or silver ( looked as though there was a light before it was not see able anymore) there was no sound visible to hear. i snapped 3 pictures 2 of them did not turn out properly but one did. there where about 8 witnesses to the object. the object flew straight and over head a bit fast and disappeared behind some trees. we then lost the object. take a look at the picture i snapped (has not been tampered with only cropped and zoomed for a better see). i believe this was no airplane, drone, weather balloon, or helicopter.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

started, and there were very few (if any) other campers/loggers around at the time. being a photographer, who was just starting to learn how to shoot low-light/night photography, i chose this area specifically because of it's remoteness and zero light pollution. just as the sun was starting to set, we set up two chairs facing the lake itself, and began taking in the gorgeous night sky, as star after star became visible. the stars were out for around 30 minutes, and we began to see and take note of the man-made satellites, which were way up high in the sky, and looked like little 'moving stars' almost, which all followed the same directional paths, not changing at all in brightness or speed. we knew what they were. after viewing maybe 10-12 of these satellites, over a period of roughly an hour, we both noticed what we thought was another satellite, but this one was a bit different. it was way lower than any of the previous satellites we had observed. it was actually as low or lower than planes were flying. we were watching it move in the same fashion as the satellites, in a straight path, with a constant speed. it was a solid, sphere/orb shape, with a white/blue tone to it, exactly like a star. just as i had said \"man, that thing looks way lower than the other satellites we saw..\" it was as if someone had a dimmer switch, and for a brief second, the object got brighter. really bright. it out-shined every single star in the sky, by a long shot. the moon was out of our view, but i would estimate that it shined brighter than even our lunar counterpart. just as quickly as it brightened, it faded back to it's original brightness, which was comparable to the stars in the sky. during the whole 'encounter' the object never stopped, slowed down, nothing... it continued on it's flight trajectory in a single line. (it was not a helicopter with a spotlight, for there was absolutely no sound at all. it also wasn't a shooting star- of which i have seen hundreds throughout my lifetime. it was moving much too slow to be a shooting star....) so, i turned to my sister, and reluctantly said, \"ummm, did you just see that?\" she says \"yeah, i did...\" then i replied, \"good, cause for a moment i thought i was hallucinating!\" but we weren't. now, here's the kicker... i have always wanted to see an \"ufo\"... as far back as i can remember, i've been fascinated by the thought my entire life. but- after having actually seen one with my own eyes... to my surprise, i didn't have the desire to 'tell everyone' and/or share my experience with others. i've told maybe 2-3 close friends, and posted it on this page, and that's as far as i have gone with any 'disclosure' about the incident. what's interesting to note, is that we were only 10 miles from where the famous \"allagash abduction\" took place, on eagle lake.  i'm still trying to find a logical explanation for what we saw, and so far, i have nothing.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":48548,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.9506342,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07012013-0012","longitude":-69.8267139,"occurred":1367991900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maine","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Sphere,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1372719483000,"summary":"Moving 'star' on straight path- breif illumination outshined everything in sky","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"T6 R11","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":54,"locationName":"Bath, Maine","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:558"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82751,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1307}
