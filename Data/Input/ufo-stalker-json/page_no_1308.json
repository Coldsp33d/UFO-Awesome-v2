(a town just northeast of erie, pa) at around 10:00pm near our home when we saw an orange orb traveling over lake erie, less than a quarter-mile from the beach which is located down the lake bank  that runs parallel to the street (the bank drops about 30 feet to the beach below).  the orb traveled west to east across the lake and it was flying low at around 200 feet. it was a solid orange glow, similar to a flare but not pulsating and there was no trail or sparks behind it. there was a single blinking white light at the rear of the object but no visible wings or any other lights that one would see on a plane. it traveled in a slow arc across the lake and we moved to the edge of the lake bank to get a closer look. the sky was growing dark but was not pitch black in the area we were looking because the sun sets direct over the lake, in the horizon in the direction of canada.\r\n\t30 seconds later we saw another orange orb of the exact same appearance (orange orb with a blinking white light in the rear) move in the same flight pattern behind the previous object. when it moved across our field of vision, we lost sight of the first object behind some trees along the lake bank. the second object also soon disappeared behind these same trees from our field of vision. \r\n30 seconds after this second object disappeared, two orange orbs appeared, one following the other in the same direction, travelling west to east. both objects stopped and hovered over the water. the one in front suddenly lost its orange glow but a solid object remained silhouetted against the sky and changed directions northward in the direction of canada. during this time, the object in the rear slowly descended to the water below. it landed on the water and stayed there for 10 seconds before the orange glow suddenly darkened and there object sank into the water, leaving ripples behind that were visible by the faint bit of moonlight across the lake. \r\ntwo men in a truck pulled up near our road after the objects were out of our sight and told us they were looking for a way to view a lightweight air craft that they were told was being launched over the lake. i believed at the time that they must have heard something on a police scanner about some sort of demonstration over the lake but i have yet to hear anything in the erie times or on the news. after about 10 minutes we saw fire trucks  and police cars heading in the direction of orchard beach park, in the direction from where the objects originated in our field of vision. we also saw a coast guard vessel and two police boats searching the water where the last orb sank. after using search lights they eventually stopped and focused on one area, the same area where we saw the object sink. so far no one else has reported this sighting to my knowledge.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then

right back in and called for me (mg) to come look at something in the sky. it was a ufo. then there was a second one, and then a third one.\r\n\r\nafter i saw the first one, i ran back in the house and got my mobile phone and came back outside and took one short video and one photo. i knew the resolution would be nothing like seeing it in person and it was also after the ufos had already become much smaller, too. hm got his camera which is much higher resolution than my phone camera and took three videos. but again, this was already after the ufos were smaller than they first appeared.\r\n\r\nthe ufos looked like hot air balloons might look with bright, flame-like, flickering, intensely red lights in the center, but they did not move like hot air balloons would move. the clouds were moving slowly toward the ocean (south/southeast), but these ufos were not moving that direction. the first one moved quickly inland and became blurry and larger and dimmer as it went, and moved faster and faster. before the first one disappeared, the second one appeared and it was very bright and red and flickering like fire in the center. it was up really high, like they all were, and it also moved inland and became smaller and smaller and disappeared. the third one appeared, all bright and red and flickering and distinct, but it soon started moving up higher and moving away and it also became smaller and disappeared upwards and to the south/southwest.\r\n\r\nafter all this we were still looking at the sky to see if there would be any more of them when there was a \"shooting star,\" meteorite, or whatever. (also, we moved to this location only a month ago so we don't know how rare this is, but 9 hours before this happened, the power went out here for 30 minutes. the next door neighbor, who has lived here a long time, told me that never happens here, but other neighbors doubt her memory, so i don't know which is it, but the power company reported the outage affected from 100 to 300 houses. additionally, about a week previous, a fighter jet strafed this location. it was extremely low and extremely fast and extremely loud, so much so that the locals came out to see what was going on. it was very unusual. aircraft are lot allowed to fly that fast and that low in populated areas. it was very strange.)\r\n\r\nthe ufos looked the way hot air balloons would look, but they also looked like flares attached to balloons or parachutes would look, except for the fact that they moved contrary to the wind direction.\r\n\r\nthe next morning i called the local air national guard and coast guard. i asked them if they might know what these ufos were and if there were any military aircraft exercises the previous night. all i got from them was an instant, \"no, no, no sir, we don't know what that is, we haven't had any reports of that, there weren't any military exercises last night.\" neither of them wanted to talk about it or suggest any possibilities for what the ufos might have been.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then

11pm with my boyfriend. we first noticed one right away coming from south east basically flying over the visible scorpio constellation, with the milky way ribbon just left of where the first seemed to originate.\r\n\r\nthis particular orb was relatively starlike in shape and size, speed was variable as it seemed to speed up and slow down at various intervals. the path curved from the south east to the north west. \r\n\r\nshortly after the first one we noticed there was a second one that flew in nearly the same flight path just a few degrees beneath the first ones path, but same movement, same direction, and same origin.\r\n\r\nwe were both in awe at those two when we got the idea that we should grab our laser pointer to see if there could be any communication contact made.\r\n\r\nonce that was retrieved we noticed another starlike orb clipping along the night sky in the same general area but instead moving east to west (almost exactly). my boyfriend then flashed the laser pointer at it in quick but steady flashes. instead of that orb responding one to the west about 40 degrees from the western horizon did.\r\n\r\nthe responding orb was unnoticed  until it flashed and grew in apparent size that i could only relate to the size of a normal full moon, and at least doubled it's brightness. i personally saw more of the flash then my boyfriend but it would have lasted at least a couple of seconds from beginning to end. once the brightness was over you could see the orb move away and disappear.\r\n\r\nat once, i had an intense feeling of excitement mixed with a feeling that we shouldn't be flashing them. i felt like we had done something unacceptable and was for a moment scared. not sure if i felt that way because we got a response or because i fear government retaliation.\r\n\r\nafter seeing that orb,another one appeared to be heading the opposite direction to the one we laser pointed, but roughly the same location in the sky. this one followed/crossed paths with a airplane that was coming from the south to north east at nearly the same time.\r\n\r\nwe have been diligent in checking for satellites, iridium flares, iss, meteor showers and even fireworks (canada day celebrations) and couldn't come up with our own answers to what happened.\r\n\r\nas always we have an intense sense of awe, wonder, confusion, and sometimes a little fear. we have accepted that at least half of what we see aren't anything we personally know of. but would love to know if anyone else saw anything last night.

saw a glinting light below and to the far right (east) of the sun, against the south facing sky. it was a thin pencil shape with its ends tapered, set at a 45 degree angle with a reddish trace. it sat still in the sky and appeared to be rather high. after looking at it for about 10 or so seconds i continued playing with my toys, thinking little of it.\r\n\r\na few days later while riding my bike up and down the garden, the sky was clear and i could once again see the same strange shape in the sky, however this time it was in a different position in the sky, to the west with a greenish trace. it glinted every so often and again i took my attention away after a short period of time. in the second week after school, i was playing in my room and as i moved to the window to place toy cars, i glanced out the window. the room was south facing, at the back of the house with the garden below. as i looked, high in the sky above the jutting chimney tops of the opposite row of houses; i saw an oval shape with a reddish glow, which appeared to tumble in slow motion, but stay in position. the most memorable aspect of the third sighting was that it was much closer and larger than the previous two and naturally as i became curious about the strange shapes and colours, i told my mother about the object in the sky.\r\n\r\nmy mother said humorously that it was a plane as many planes fly over the town. the area is known for its many flight corridors for commercial airlines. that was the only time i saw the shape with colours which was then the second week of sightings. the last and most frightening sighting happened the week after and interestingly, it didn���t occur during the day. on the night of the last sighting i was told to go to bed as it was late and so i made my way upstairs to my bedroom. as i did so, i remembered that i had needed to close the curtains as i had left them open for two nights in contrast to closing them every night. i passed the landing, switched the light on and entered my bedroom, not closing the door behind me immediately; i turned left to proceed to the window.\r\n\r\ni made not three steps into the room until i froze out of fear. in the sky outside my window, above the house opposite our home, about 100 feet away, was a large object; which i later understood might have been a vehicle of some type. the craft was oval-shaped about the diameter of the two semi-detached houses together, with a bright red set of revolving chevrons which travelled in a clockwise direction from right to left. the chevrons disappeared for about a second and returned as what i can only assume; it made its way around its perimeter. the craft itself appeared dark, while being surrounded in a bright orange glow with a fiery yellow top. the yellow oval top had a shadowy figure, but no detail could be seen. the craft was motionless with only its chevrons revolving; it made no sound and i felt no heat. i was frozen still in fear and observed the craft for about five seconds; until my fear turned to hysteria, running out of the room and down stairs to tell my parents.\r\n\r\ni told my parents about what i had seen and they laughed thinking that it was a joke of sorts. as they demanded i now go to bed, i refused, adamant not to venture back upstairs. my mother and step-father stunned at my out of character refusal and clearly moved by my distress, they ventured up stairs to find out what it was that i had seen. after a while, my father called me back up to my room and so anxiously i climbed the stairs. my mother waiting at my bedroom door said that there was nothing to worry about and as i entered my room my step-father said, ���look, (gesturing at the window) there is nothing there���.\r\n\r\nit had been quickly decided by my parents, that i had seen nothing and assumed it was my imagination. i did not sleep well that night and over that year, made it a ritual to close my curtains out of fear that what i had seen would return. it came to be the most frightening thing i have seen, yet held my curiosity. at the time as a child, i did not know anything about flying saucers, ufos, aliens and other folk law. as a first-hand observer of the phenomenon, i feel a strange sense of obligation to share with others what i feel is a real and important phenomenon. however, for fear of ridicule only my family has known about it until now. i am certain i saw something unusual, it could have been a vehicle, but the mystery remains as to exactly what it was. when you do see the phenomenon, which is so out of context with reality, it changes you forever and that was my childhood experience.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Window(s),  Patterned
