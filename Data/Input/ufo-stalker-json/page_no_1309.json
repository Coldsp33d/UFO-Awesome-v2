somewhat late and while looking to my right i saw the object in the sky.  the sky was darkening but there was enough light left as i looked to the northeast that the ufo was dark against the lighter grey sky behind it.\r\n\r\ni think what i saw was a 3/4 view with the object angled somewhat towards me.  it was traveling very slowly (if at all)in a southeastern direction.\r\n\r\nunlike the triangles so often described, this did not have a flat bottom but rather looked like the typical, standard star wars star destroyer but with no detail-- just the general shape including the vertical section between the top and bottom.  so what i saw had basically an exact symmetry top and bottom.  also, unlike the star wars vehicle, the object i observed did not have that command bridge at the back.  after three-quarters of a mild rise from front to back, the top and bottom both angled back to the top and bottom corners of the center section respectively.\r\n\r\nnow, if i am wrong about the angle of the object in the sense that it was going parallel to me, it resembled (and i am sorry about the geek factor here) the tholian ship from the original star trek series.\r\n\r\ni thought two things when i saw it.  first, given the overall shape and angles (slightly darker grey lines) on the side, i wondered if i could be seeing an f-14 navy plane with its' wings folded back.  but, that wasn't possible as it was barely moving and too big.  plus, there were no lights and no exhaust.  there would have been no way for me to know if there was sound as my windows were rolled up and i was driving-- plus, the object was far away (i am guessing three miles).\r\n\r\nlet me be specific about the lines on the side.  it was hard to tell, but just as with a star destroyers vertical center section, there seemed to be a demarcation where a different angle above it joined in and below it where the opposite symmetrical angle joined in.  so we are talking two lines more or less for sure that were ever so slightly darker than the rest of the object.  there might have been another line above, but it was hard to tell.  also, given the distance it is possible all three lines were canted somewhat down as they proceeded from the back of the craft to the front of the craft.  i say this as i did have the impression of an f-14 from a side view with wings in supersonic configuration (back).  but, again, this was no standard aircraft.  there were no wings whatsoever.\r\n\r\ni liked how in this interview sheet a lead color was listed with the grey.  lead is a good descriptive term for the shade of the grey.\r\n\r\nthen, i thought, could i be seeing a kid's model of a star destroyer that was somehow tethered or being flown.  well, no to this one too--as it was not there seconds later when i turned off and left my vehicle to look.  plus, unless the kid's toy was inflated or some new type of kite, it could not have been stationary or very slowly moving like what i observed.\r\n\r\nthe object was about thirty-six degrees above the horizon.  my guess is that it was at least two miles away and at an altitude well below airliner level.  my best guess is ten thousand feet.\r\n\r\ngiven my brief observation, i cannot say with one hundred percent certainty that the craft was moving.  i could not focus on the craft long because of traffic that was coming up behind me on this well-traveled road.\r\n\r\nwhen i pulled off there was a police car in the parking lot of the apartment house that was parked there.  he was next to a row of bushes so there was no way for him to have seen what i did.  plus, the police in this area are sometimes not the best people to interact with.  so, i did not approach the officer to report anything or ask anything of him.\r\n\r\nas i left my vehicle i did look to the southwest and saw what seemed to be a plane approaching slowly at a moderately low altitude.  the plane was fuzzy to my view and primarily a light the color of sodium street lights as they can be before the lights become differentiated. my guess was it was a commercial airliner but it could have been anything, even a helicopter.  i couldn't stay to find out.  altitude for that aircraft, fifteen thousand feet as a guess.","distance":"Over One

witnessed a very strange object in the sky about a half mile away and about a half mile above ground.  i screamed for my wife to bring a camera.  she had to look for it and just grabbed her phone instead.  she took three photos but it took her 30 seconds to get her iphone5 and by this time the object had moved well away.  initially, the object was close enough to see the periphery, which clearly appeared to be rectangular with a giant yellow-orange-white flame inside that filled most of the rectangle shape but the flame did not extend beyond the well-defined rectangular borders.  for how bright the light inside the rectangle was, i was surprised to not see much of a halo of light around it.  my first impression was that it was just a very large hot air balloon because i heard what i thought was the sound of propane fuel burning.  i absolutely did not hear an intermittent propeller type sound. it was definitely more of a low steady dull rumble sound.  i had a clear view of most of the horizon.  the object moved from left to right from my vantage point facing northeast, slowly at first, then very fast, faster than a jet airplane.  it moved all the way across the sky easily in less than one minute, including the first 30 seconds or so in which it looked like it was just drifting along very slowly at wind speed.  basically, it just shifted into high gear and took off going away and up.  the object was ascending rapidly without question.  it was moving east to southeast in direction in mostly clear skies at the time.  the long axis of the rectangle seemed perpendicular to the ground at all times even though the pictures seem like it tilted (my wife must have slanted the camera in her rapid response).  the three pictures revealed almost a figure eight light source, almost like some kind of multiple loop circuit.  however, in person, the object looked very bright to the naked-eye like a giant, uniform flame burning upwards.  i would best describe it as a gigantic lantern.  the rectangular or cone-shaped borders seemed black and very thin and the flame inside the borders took up most of the rectangle but not all.  the pencil thin borders were blacker than the darkness around the huge flame inside the object.  it was almost as if the object was transparent between the flame and surface.  there was like a 7/8th moon out that night i believe providing some background light.  any insight into what this object was would be appreciated.  i thought hot air balloons just moved at the same speed as the wind.  \r\n\r\non a side note, i have also seen once a few months back a huge black triangle at night with atleast seven or eight lights around it moving west to east with some of the lights blinking and others not.  this object moved faster than any other i have ever seen in the sky and when it was almost gone over the horizon i heard the big sonic boom like the skies were opening up.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

parked in the cub foods parking lot on a side (closest to 35w south overpass, not nicollet side) i don't normally park on to go to the garden center hut there (and also go into the store). the hut turned out to be closed due to some earlier rain i believe.\r\n\r\nafter getting out of my car, i noticed a round/oval gray object not far above the roof line of the store  in the sky (a little to my left). (my car was in an e-w orientation to the store. the store faces s.) nothing significant made me look at the object - it just seemed like it was in my line of vision before i turned around to go to the garden hut. at first i thought it was an escaped balloon or something, just my eyes. but i stood there and watched it for about 3-4 minutes. it was moving away from me, like it was going upward and away i'd guess to the n.W. in that it was going upward and back from the top of the building. it was small (smaller than an aspirin) so it was pretty far away. \r\n\r\nthe weather was party cloudy i believe more toward overcast. i had seen a ufo before in michigan about 16 years ago so i realized it wasn't a balloon or a regular aircraft. around the time it retreated from sight, to my right, planes were landing at mpls.-st. paul airport - they were coming in over the 35w/62 crosstown exchange - a couple of them, very clear in range of vision, low. i didn't need this gauge to know that whatever i saw wasn't a plane or a balloon. i see a lot of planes and know my aircraft.  \r\n\r\nby the time i realized i should take a photo it was moving out of sight. i have an old cell phone (not a smart phone) so i knew the picture quality would be very poor even if i got to it early on in the sighting. emotion wise, i was a little bit excited to see it but because i'd seen one before i wasn't overly excited. i was like \"oh wow, that's cool. it's a ufo.\" i've studied about them and as a journalist have written about them, interviewing scientists and abduction researchers. my sighting years earlier in michigan was much more profound and visceral. (and ironically, it was the same summer i believe i'd covered the july 1997 mufon conference in grand rapids, michigan, and i was with another attendee of that conference). that one was a triangular shaped craft with lights, definitely not a plane, but very high up. \r\n\r\nrelatively speaking, the ufo i saw in minneapolis in early june 2013 was lower in the sky, and more of a direct flight path if that makes sense. ultimately i believe i lost sight of the object because it was simply going farther and farther away from me.\r\n","distance":"Over One

when i reviewed the pictures i noticed a spot on all three shots. i thought i had dust on my lens. i checked my lens and cleaned it. i took three more shots and when i reviewed them no spots.\r\n\r\nwhen i got home from our vacation, i downloaded all of our pictures into my computer and started to select the ones i wanted to print and frame. when i was selecting the ones from haleakala, i remembered the spots and looked at the pictures carefully. that's when i noticed the spot wasn't in the same area of the picture it was moving across the picture, which proved to me it wasn't a dust particle and the last shot there was a trail. as if it was moving very fast and away from me. i checked the shutter speed and it was 1/1307. i figured that, for what ever it was to leave a trail at that shutter speed it had to be moving very fast. a lot faster than a jet.\r\n\r\nof course i showed a lot of people the pictures, in sequence and tried to explain the spots movement and

the color and light were consistent the entire time i saw it.  it appeared to be somewhat elongated vertically and at its closest point to me, i may have seen a yellow \"flagpole-like\" light or beam coming out of the top.  however, the most outstanding characteristic was the speed of the thing.  it passed from where i saw it initially to several miles southeast of my house in a matter of seconds - so fast, it was like something falling (but not quite as fast as a shooting star) except it was traveling horizontally. in fact my first theory was that it was a shooting star, or meteor or some kind of space debris, but as it came closer i lost all confidence in that assessment.  as a point of reference, a high flying plane passing over the length of my house would not even make it from end to end in the time this thing cleared my entire visible range of the sky.  at one point i considered running into the house to grab my binoculars which were maybe 10 feet inside the house, but i was pretty sure i would miss it if i went inside even for the short period of time it would have taken me to grab them. for the most part, i did not feel threatened in any way. although as it approached its nearest point i do remember thinking \" maybe i shouldn't be standing out here like a sitting duck\" and considered that i should probably go back inside - but of course i didn't. i finally lost sight of it as it got smaller and smaller moving away from me, then just seemed to vanish.  i actually felt like i should have been able to see it diminish in size for a bit longer than i did.  i was just very suddenly gone.\r\n\r\n* i have to add a disclaimer here that the beam part may be due to my own vision issues (seeing starbursts or fuzziness around lights), outside of that though, i am 100% confident as to what i saw.* ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":48487,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.1008265,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06292013-0004","longitude":-94.5726667,"occurred":1372402800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder,   Fireball,   Teardrop","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1372495864000,"summary":"Very very fast, glows reddish/orange  but does not blink, vertically elongated, possibly a yellowish beam coming out of the top,  larger or lower than a high flying airplane ","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"64477","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Kansas City, Missouri","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:687"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Lincoln","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"From my deck i observed the first star-like light at 11:03 pm central time, to the sw about 20 degrees above the horizon, ascending to the north.  duration was about 10 seconds before i lost sight of it due to roof overhang.\r\nno blinking lights associated with this star-like light.\r\nthe second star-like light was observed at 11:25 pm about 30 degrees up from the ssw horizon, ascending and moving to the north.  this second star-like light appeared to be either farther away or smaller.  i watched it move from the ssw past the 90 degree mark overhead and then lost it against the night sky.  it appeared to get smaller or farther away as it passed the 90 degree mark directly overhead.  no flashing lights, just a solid star-like light.\r\nboth lights were straight-line in their path/direction.\r\nimmediately after the 11:03 pm central sighting, i observed 3-5 planes in a west/east and east/west direction, to the south at about 30 -
