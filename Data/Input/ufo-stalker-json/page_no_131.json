father were hunting in a remote area of northern canada. they had a hunter's camera set up for assessing game.\r\nthe camera is motion actuated and takes three pictures a minute when it detects movement.\r\n\r\nthe camera took the pictures of the strange lights in the night. please note that the am and pm settings were reversed by the owner when setting time; however it is obvious wether it's day or night :-). also the date setting is 3 days behind.\r\n\r\ni have included the images taken before and after the lights sequence. you can see that the lights are situated in the sky portion of the image, and that the landscape has not moved so there was no camera movement - that would rule out traces made by the moon on a moving camera. the camera was affixed to a post. the light were sufficiently bright to illuminate trees in the landscape, and we can see that the trees are not moving so there was no camera movement in the night sequence as well. i have no information wether it was a full moon or not.\r\n\r\nalthough they didn't witness the object, the father did see a bright light in the night when he momentarily woke up during the night. another unrelated person who was in the area that week end also reported seeing a bright light in the sky.\r\n\r\nhere's coordinates of the area where the pictures were taken:\r\n50.2437187,-71.023278\r\n\r\nalthough i do believe we are not alone in the universe, as it is a statistical impossibility, i must admit personnaly i am a bit squeptical about ufo sightings. however in that case i fail to have an explication for these light traces. i don't believe a firefly could have made these. perhaps you have already seen similar things and have an explanation, so what do you make of this?\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\njoris in quebec,

say i kept this a secret for a long time, aright here we go* i was a young child, going through a tough time being bullyed called names and such, some children go through but mine was worse, anyway to report,\r\nwhen i went bed, in my dreams i saw a being that was tall than a normal human but i wasn't scared when \"it\" approach me it didn't move it legs \r\nwhen \"it\" got closer, i saw what it was wearing robes with symbols and big mask there were symbols where the cheeks should be the symbols depicted what i only assume was humans on the left and earth on right of the mask \r\nit spoke to me it said \"child do not be afraid my intention are peaceful\" it voice was that of a female and it echo inside my dream i didn't bother to say anything i just stared at symbols, curious of what they mean \"it\" said \"child you do not fear me why is that?\" it ask me, i answer by saying \"this isn't the first time seeing strange things\" i replied \"it\" tilted it head then it said \"child do you want to learn and see the truth that your leaders had hidden from you\" after \"she\" said that i was thinking then i said \"yes i want to see the truth\" i said a arm revealed it self under the robes and place it aganist my fore head, a rush full of unkown energy went to my head and that when i saw everything that our leaders has hid us from \r\nthen i woke up having a worst possible headache, after finishing a other day of suffering i laid down my bed fell asleep i found my self in a different area than i saw \"her\" standing alone watching the view then she turn her head towards my direction \"are you ready to learn child?\" 'she' said, after those few days \"she\" tought me her langue and different aspects of life and such they were different then our understanding of them, before \"she\" left me she told me \"child the path that all of humanity is going is not only going be end of your species but others as well, you must spread the message i am giving you\" she said i nod \"we have watch your species live, for a long  time and see no improvements your species will die like the others in the galaxy that have failed, if you do not change then your species will be one of them\" she said i said \"i will teacher\" she said \"i am not your teacher anymore, it is your turn to be the teacher and humanity is your students child\" i smiled and nod though in my head there are being that we connot see but they can see us in this realitie defy our understanding of phsyics and logic anyway, she look at me and said \"child i will be leaving you but you must spread the message i have giving you\" i nod sadly she was leaving me after the things she tought me but she told me forgiveness was key, and so that day forward i kept it a secret for a long time and i must do it now cause war might break lose and maybe i'll find my peace for not sharing

minute because of how high up they were going and how fast, but i could see the moon reflecting off the craft when it flew past it. it was going so fast it looked like it was leaving a trail. eventually it flew out of view, but it made no noise. this was not airplanes or helicopters, i have never seen them stop and gain speed like these did. i live in a pretty rural area, and have observed a lot of planes and helicopters but this was not either. i also recorded on my phone but unfortunately it didn't pick up what i was seeing.

my windows. if i see something interesting, i go outside with my good camera. tonight, i saw a star-like object in the sky that was more like a cigar shape (up and down) rather than round. so i headed out. i was trying to zoom in on this thing and watch it, to see its shape better and also to see if it was moving at all.\r\n\r\n   i swear people are going to think i am crazy or something because i have been reporting a lot of activity lately. it is unfortunate to seem insane with what i am about to say but i am very very very serious about ufos and e.T.S. i would never ever report any untrue evidence to take the focus off of real sightings. in my lifetime, i want to see the world come to know the truth. i would never do anything to compromise that. so i guess you will just have to take my word for it.\r\n\r\n   while i was zooming into this object on my camera, to the left of me, high tree-top level, the brightest largest thing i have ever seen zoomed over my head super fast. it appeared out of nowhere and was over my head/house in a split second. it had to have been the size of i don't even know, maybe an nba basketball court? it was a giant oval/disc. the entire thing was glowing super bright white and had a gigantic tail that lasted as long as the object itself did. it was so bright, that it lit up my hands and some objects in the area, like the shiny posts on my back porch and the fencing in the back yard.\r\n\r\n   i was so freaked and surprised by this, i jumped up from a kneeling position and exclaimed \"holy ****!\". my next-door neighbors homes, on each side, are within 15 feet of my home. they had to have heard me. the first thing i thought to do was look around and listen. i heard someone next-door, or possibly a couple doors down talking quietly. my immediate reaction was to listen to if they saw it too. someone had to have seen this!!! it was so fast, if they weren't looking up at that exact time, they wouldn't have.\r\n\r\n   what i found most eerie about this sighting is that everything was absolutely silent besides for the crickets. when you see objects high up in the sky that are silent, which is what i have always seen, i guess you assume they are far away, so if they do make any noise, maybe you just can't hear it. but when something that large, bright, fast and right there, right at tree-top level is silent!!!!????... that gave me chills and my heart dropped to my stomach. this is the type of thing i thought would never in a million years happen to me. the type of thing i would only wish of experiencing.\r\n\r\n   about a minute and a half later, a helicopter flew over my house in the direction the object had been heading. however, i live in a major city. there are helicopters flying over daily. i do want to mention that. i do not want anyone to assume a helicopter is a for sure sign of something near where i live because it is not. but usually, they are headed toward the direction of our highways and are during rush hour on weekdays, to report traffic. it was about 20 minutes ago, at 10:30pm on a saturday night. \r\n\r\n   also, when i see an object near my home, i always wonder if they have a particular interest in the area because of the airport, nasa research center and a bomber plant built in 1942 all not too far away. oddly, this object, had it continued zooming in the exact direction it was, would have passed right over these places.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:00:01","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None, Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

very fast, and now looking back most likely was heading in a north diagonal direction, northwest basically. it also sped past me very quickly, like i only saw this for two seconds and it was flying or moving, whatever you would call that at least 2000 ft as it seemed very close to the ground. its motions are the only thing i can recall and it moved very quickly, almost as if i spotted it in the sky when i looked up. my feelings during it were terryfied and paranoid, making it to me, a ufo or a spacecraft moving at fast speeds. what really set it in stone was when i texted a friend about it, he said he saw the exact same thing and he was in florida and also ssaid it was heading north. after i saw it i became paranoid and ran up the street with my dog in my arms and locked the doors in my house a got a knife to hold to feel much safer. i would like to say i'm filing this report about 50 minutes after the event.
