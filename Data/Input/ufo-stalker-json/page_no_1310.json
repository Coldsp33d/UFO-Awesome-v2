 you're the one who doesn't believe.\"  i continued to watch the sky for another five minutes, but did not see it again.  i know this is crazy, but it's almost as if it \"froze\" while the airplane was in the area.  i am not a believer, however i cannot explain what we saw and i frequently study the night sky.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":48475,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.14358886198327,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06282013-0011","longitude":-81.53852323693812,"occurred":1372399440000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1372457255000,"summary":"Large glowing red light coming toward us then ascended","tags":["floating"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"44223","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:730"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Catonsville","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This information is being filed by the maryland mufon sd following a 1hr personal interview with the witness.  note that the witnesss home phone listed above is that of his mother and that the email address is that of his mother. \r\n\r\nthe witness, a 40 year black male, unemployed for the past 2 years following an auto accident, has had numerous sightings brginning at age 8. prior to his accident, the witness was employed, and has alwaws been employed, in sales. \r\n\r\nfor the past 2 years he has been photographing what he considers ufo sighting that he has encountered within a block or so of his residence.\r\nhe showed me a number of these photos.  unfortunately they are stored on his camer phone which has a very small screen. the camera phone is a sprint scp-2700, with a resolution of 1.3 mp.  the photos i saw were of supposed \"creatures\" in the foliage.  while suggestive, the images on the camera phone were too small to be seen clearly. these images need to be downloaded to a photshop-like software program where they can be scaled up for better viewing and analysis.\r\n\r\nbased on his lokg term history of sightings, the witness is convinced he is recording ufos, orbs, creatures, etc.\r\n\r\nthe witness is a pleasant, well spoken individual, who is utterly convinced he is being led into these encounters. he will continue to believe his photos are the evidence until/unless they can be clearly shown to be othersise.\r\n\r\nthe witness claims to be not computer literate, so his photos will have to be downloaded by soemone who is.\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":48474,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.2594478,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06282013-0010","longitude":-76.7353051,"occurred":1368342000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maryland","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,   Saturn-like,   Sphere,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1372454424000,"summary":"A 32 year history of encounters, the most recent of creatures in the foliage","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"21244","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":47,"locationName":"Catonsville, Maryland","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:731"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Date: friday, june 28, 2013. time: between 4:30 am & 4:45 am. event: 5 orange orbs witnessed in the pre-dawn eastern skies from the ground in orange, ca as i was heading to car to leave for work. the orbs were noticeably larger than planes and at first stationary before they began to drift apart. silent. one by one, each released 2-3 smaller orbs which descended, flickered white-orange in color before fading away below the orb that released it. after the descended orbs flickered & faded, the larger releasing orbs then flickered & faded out of sight one by one. the orbs may have been in sky longer before i exited house, but i witnessed event for at least 15 minutes. video feature on droid phone not sufficient to capture event, but attempted.

observe the sky. we saw the usual planes, helicopters and stuff. but then i noticed 2 more starlike objects moving south this time, one in front of the other, moving the same speed. my mom saw them as well. then she pointed out another small, starlike object moving across the sky, this time i couldn't see the one she was talking about. then we turned and looked behind us and saw this weird, cone like shape, more like a parabola; if you were looking at it from the side shape of light. it moved slowly then dissipated into a star like shape then dissipated fully. then we saw a asteroid or something, break apart in the sky. we saw it come down from the west, it glowed orange, then broke up into 2-3 smaller pieces and then went out. \r\n\r\nnot sure what the small starlike objects were.

and my teenage daughter were travelling back from a brief stay on the eastern shore of maryland, we crossed the bay bridge and travelled north on 695 towards route 83 north to pennsylvania.  on 695 traveling north, right around the area where there is an exit to 83 south, there was a sign that said 83 north 2 1/2 miles (as there has been for the past 33 years i have been travelling back and forth from maryland to pennsylvania).  the last thing i contiously remember saying before things got really wierd was \"that is how you get to the baltimore zoo\" as we passed the exit to 83 south to baltimore, we were preparing to bare right onto 83 north in a few moments as it is,i believe the next exit (or maybe the one after, but takes only a moment to get to once you pass 83 south).  my 17 year old daughter was driving and i was assisting with directions so obviously we are sober, alert and paying attention.  the next thing i consiously remember (and what seemed to be only a second to me), we are confused to find ourselves on the farthest left hand of the lane, rather than the far right lane (to prepare to bare right) where we were. there were concrete media strips and i noticed that on the right hand side, we had passed concrete media strips decorated with these beautiful stone bricks in various shades of brown and grey.  that must be new, i say.  just then we see gas stations, hotels and fast food restaurants and i think to myself, we must have passed the 83 north exit, continued straight which should put us in the direction of towson (and if you continue north on 695 to new york)...I believed at the time that we were just past our exit and just need to turn around, (i looked at my clock and only 15 minutes had passed since we saw 83 south exit).  i go inside the first gas station and was told i am very far from my destination and recieve directions that will take me approximately 2 hours to get back to 83 north...I think there must be a shorter way, we are only 5 minutes off course.  i asked someone outside who gives us similar directions and says that we are about 2 hours away from our destination.  when my daughter asked what town we are in we are told numerous times we are in \"washington, the district of criminals\".  the gentleman advises us to not continue further on this road, it is very dangerous and that we will wind up in \"downtown, district of criminals\"...He says to follow him and he will show us where we can u-turn, which he does. as soon as we turn around we are surrounded by trees on both sides of the road.  there were no trees there before, there were concrete median blocks for the entire trip and i couldn't see the 4 lanes of traffic on the other side of the road, all of a sudden there are plush trees blocking both sides of the highway and we can no longer see the 4 lanes of traffic on the other side of the \"median strips\" which are no longer there.  all of the signs are brown, road signs, route signs and there were no information signs (gas stations, restaurants, lodges)...All of the signs are brown...  the road has a tan pavement (?)...A second later we are back on black pavement and the signs are normal (green for roads, symbols for different routes and streets with different colors, blue for information-gas, restaurant, lodges) not to metion, they were all the same cities we had just previously passed with brown signs.  we see that we are by nasa...On route 50, in washington, below baltimore (?).  we see a triangle shaped flying object flying low directly above the ground straight down the highway, over our car and behind us, it was travelling low and slow.  then a few minutes later, we see a diamond, or similar shaped flying object going from west to east with round lights on the outer surface spinning around the shape of the object that dissapeared over the trees on the far left.  it took us 2 or more hours to get home.  i have looked at a map, and found route 50 in washington.  there is no way we could wind up there in 15 minutes from the area where we were and let alone any route from 695 directlty to route 50...It definately would take at least 1 hour and 45 minutes.

for regulus and sighted the moon against it.  i observed them converging at 15 min arc/ min in my sextant.  of course that is impossible for any celestial object, because the earth is moving at that speed, so all celestial objects appear to move with it.  the moon's apparent motion is 30 sec arc /min against the stars.  satellites move much faster.  \r\n\r\nnothing stands still.  i now realized it was not regulus.  i took the light's altitude to confirm it was standing still.  it was geo-stationary.  it was hovering over the same point on earth between 200 miles and 3500 miles west of my location.  i can demonstrate the math upon request, but won't here for brevity.\r\n\r\nthis light was far from the positions possible for geo-stationary satellites which are far too dim to see anyway.\r\n\r\ni sighted it for twenty minutes.  then it simply disappeared.  switched off.  went dark.\r\n\r\nnothing in the atmosphere could have behaved this way.  nothing in space could have remained stationary without controlled powered flight.  nothing manmade could maintain geo-position.  we just don't have the power yet.\r\n\r\nit seems to me that since most people would have overlooked the significants of the unique properties of this light i observed, these events must be far more common that we imagine to make it probable enough for me to observe.  my calculations suggest that for a likelihood of my observation to be greater than negligible such an event must occur unobserved 11 times per every hour somewhere in the world.\r\n","distance":"Over One

they came through earlier than usual. it was circling around the group which this time was up in the upper statratusphere i think. while he was doing that the smaller objects i have often seen with it were in a lower altitude. as i had been standing there a yellow object started flashing his light and coming lower and at me, i think it was trying to warn me that what ever these new objects were not something to be around and was trying to warn me to get back into the house and that is what is what i did. i figured it knew more than i did. i have seen these smaller craft on more than one occassion fighting other ufos as fighters. i have known since shortly after discovering their existance they were also aware of me. this is the first time i have had one of them approach me and made me feel better. it came down to tree top level trying to warn me.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

i was having a cigarette out the window of my 5th floor apartment, facing north, when i saw a bright white light with a smaller red light descending from the clouds towards my direction (south). i thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, and thought nothing of it, but then i kept watching and smoking, and then i saw 2 very bright white lights moving from west to east across the sky, just over a bridge leading to the downtown core. they were moving very quickly, faster than any airplane (maybe the speed of a jet or a meteor?). for a moment i thought it could have been a terrorist attack, or planes about to crash into the downtown core because they were traveling incredibly fast and dangerously close to the ground in a busy city centre. i called for my boyfriend to look out the window, and he missed them. but then around 5 seconds later, there were 2 more similar objects (large, very bright white lights) moving in the same direction (east) very quickly. my boyfriend saw the latter objects as well. once the objects went further east, our view was obstructed by buildings/condos further northeast. i kept watching, and i saw them actually weaving through the buildings/condos. i thought they may have been some kind of helicopter or meteor, but the objects did not make any sounds, and they were moving up, down, and side-to-side around the buildings/condos, almost like how flies are able to buzz around people but they moved incredibly quickly, as if gravity did not affect them. then they moved northeast, into the clouds. in total, i saw about 4 or 5 objects (5 if i count the first object that descended from the clouds as a separate object than the 4 i saw moving horizontally from east to west). \r\n\r\nduring the event, i tried to take a picture, but the objects were moving too fast for me to turn on my iphone screen and to take the video/photo. i took a picture of the direction where the objects disappeared into, but it is dark, poor quality, and you can only make out the city lights. \r\n\r\nafter the event, i heard planes flying overhead. it is strange because the planes made noticeable sounds of propelling through the air, but the objects did not make any sounds.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with

strange object in the sky. after noticing the object i went outside to take more pictures of that area of the western sky. that object did not show, but other objects showed in the photos. strange objects were not detected in some of the pictures. i also, zoomed in on the object by using a pc software and was able to capture a close-up.\r\n\r\nthe following day on the 26th, after a thunderstorm, approx. 6:30 pm, i decided to take pictures of the same area of the sky. i could not see any objects with my naked eye, but did see an object showing in the photos. some of the specs are from raindrops on the window, because i took those pictures through the glass on the porch, but there is a distinct object directly in front of the sun breaking through the clouds. \r\n\r\ntoday
