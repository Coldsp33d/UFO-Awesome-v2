(you will not be bored). as much as i would like to declare myself a \"great fiction - adventure\" writer, i can not claim that. i will go to my grave demanding that it is all true, for no other reason than because it is.  if no one believes me, fine, but i don't need to know what those little girls at fatima heard, i already know more. \r\n\r\ni have had issues. the doctors said i would have to have a liver transplant to survive in 1992 but i refused and they called me \"delirious\".  so i adapted that \"pen name\" as a cover. at first i was scared to bring out my story and so i wanted to cloak it a bit with the pen name and cure for addiction. then i heard one researcher say \"the best way to hide the truth is put it right out in the open\". maybe that is what i have done, but so many can not get their minds around it. maybe you can.\r\n\r\nits time for someone like you to know. please email me back if you are interested and i will send you my story,","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Window(s)","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":48454,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.96306,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06272013-0009","longitude":-96.8218685,"occurred":629020800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,   Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1372360440000,"summary":"At 2 am i came inside my house and a very bright light appeared, next thing i know i am aboard the craft","tags":["light"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":8603,"locationName":"Addison, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"Alien Encounter","$$hashKey":"object:794"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Vlora","country":"Albania","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Could anyone explain what this is? didn't see it when i took the photo.

Township","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was 13 in 1964. this incident happened at the time when the entire eastern part of the united states had a blackout. my mother told me that if i told anybody about what i saw that \"the men in the little white coat's would take me away in a straight-jacket\". however, i've always wondered if the pilot of the small plane that the \"craft\" dove at, ever reported the incident. and of course, because of the power outage, the news reports that ensued talked about, as i recall, both a story about a meteor and a failure at the power facility at niagara falls.\r\n\r\nhanover township was at the south outskirts of the city of wilkes-barre. my parents had built a house in a new development on land that was adjacent (and being reclaimed) from coal strip mining amidst a small forest area which included also, a quarry. and at one end of the expanse of the strip mined shale field, there rose up a cullum bank. if you climbed to the top of the cullum bank you could view the expanse of the wyoming valley, surrounded by mountains and the susquehanna river flowing through the base of the valley. on the other side of the river was the west side drive-in. if i had a pair of binoculars i thought it would be easy to see the movie playing on the drive-in screen. to that end, i borrowed the binoculars from the man who lived across the street and trekked to the top of the cullum bank to see the movie \"tom jones\" which was showing there. i needed to get to the location while it was still daylight and the trail that led to the area went through the forest section around to the far side of the cullum bank, as the near side was pretty much a really steep incline to the cliff. i arrived early before the sunset. i was enthusiastic but, hadn't considered either the cold temperature or the wind which was whipping up. nor had i considered to bring a flashlight, as it dawned on me, that when the darkness happened, i would have a tough time finding my way back. in the distance, at the far north end of the valley, behind the mountain range, i noticed flashing light. this was bursts of light which ping ponged left and right for maybe five minutes. this didn't look like fireworks. i didn't have a clue what it could be. when i did happen to catch a burst looking through the binoculars, it was just a burst of white light.  the movie still hadn't started, so i just kept observing the flashes. then the flashes started to move behind the mountain range on the right side of the valley. the flashes were at regular intervals every..So many seconds.  it's a long mountain range. at a point, a couple of minutes later, i looked through the lenses at the drive-in screen to see if the movie had started. it had but, as it was still just dusk, the screen images were just too light to be enjoyed. the wind started blowing up, i was getting cold so i thought i should start back to \"civilization\". i turned my gaze back to the direction of the flashes behind the mountain range on the right. the light bursts behind the range was now brighter and more intense and traveling faster. and then, right before my eyes, hovering in the sky, somewhat higher than the mountain peaks but, on this side of the range, there was this stationary mass of electrical light, brighter than a star. i looked through the binoculars. it's shape was that of a spinning top, with a point at the top and a point at the bottom. it was just pure energy/light, redish toward the top, whiteish in the middle and yellowish at the bottom.  but, the flashes continued behind the range...Just a little bit before they stopped. i kept staring into the binoculars, trying to adjust a clear focus. it was colder now and the wind was blustering more and my eyes started to tear. i lowered the binoculars and cocked my head to my right as there seemed to be a swooshing to the wind. i was standing pretty close to the end of the cliff. and i'm looking at this gliding craft, coming parallel to me, over the edge, about 15 feet away. i could see it and see trough it as it was transparent. it was piloted.  it was like three triangles...Like a plane without the cockpit. looking at it head on, as it approached me, there was a triangle about 8-9 feet high. inside the triangle was a center triangle with an individual sitting, suspended, two arms, two legs, headgear. the other triangle came off to the back, like the back end of a plane...Not really a perfect triangle. there were three red globes on the bottom angles, one at the back, two on the sides. i watched this glide right past me, veer right and disappear into thin air.\r\nat this point i got scared. i wanted to run. turning to proceed back through the forest, i was too scared to go that way. so i pitched myself off the face of the cliff to take the steep run down, sliding, tearing my jeans in the process, to arrive at the bottom of the cullum bank and run  back through the shale field. looking up in the sky, i could see only the electrical object which was now slowly moving more toward my position. i had a clear bolt path back to the development and by the time i reached the end of the street i lived on, which intersected with a forest section, this object was almost directly above me. i heard a small plane. in the sky, coming from what would be the south west, was a small, single engine plane, flying well below the height of the electrical craft. i watched with shock, as this little plane came closer the electrical object dove right for it, causing the little plane to maneuver into a steep climb. this electrical craft dove underneath the plane then boomeranged up, turning on its side as i watched three revolutions of red light and it disappeared. what happened to the little plane? ...And the pilot of that plane? i don't know! i wanted to call the forty-fort airport. i wanted to call the local radio station. i wanted to know if anyone else saw what i did? i ran home and told my mother. our power was out. it was only later that i found out the power went out, on the entire eastern united states. and of course, my mother wouldn't let me tell anyone. i will say that after this experience i had what i would call an uncanny \"awareness\" of just life in general. i have never been \"into\" sci-fi or anything having to do with the whole ufo phenomena. but i've often wondered if that pilot of the small plane ever filed a report that my experience would corroborate. this happened when i was 13. now i'm 62 years old and don't have to consider the men in the little white coats coming to get me! thanks for listening.

recollection.  but i got home an hour later than normal.  and i wondered what the hell happened.  i remember just glimpses, like being lifted up and such. and once again wind in my face.  and also   i have a red blemish on my right hand back side just below the knuckle.  it has been there every since 1997.  its tender to touch. \r\nnow i don't know if the two experiences are connected.  but i feel

had installed 9in 2005 looked so well). our location was in new england, north dakota- a very small prairie town of about 560 people. i was proceeding along the south side of our house  snapping pix, then came around to the east side of the house and noticed my husband was filling a bird feeder under a tree in the yard. he was facing roughly north as he stood filling the feeder. i snapped the pic of him and the nice evening sky... neither of us saw anything in the sky at the time at all- and i did not immediately get the film developed, so i cannot say with any definitive certainty what day or time i took the photo. our best guess is that it was roughly sometime in july?? 2006, and likely early evening approx 7pm-ish (??). it was only after the prints were returned that we noticed a strange box-kite-ish looking 'thing' (somewhat blurry, but quite large!) in the sky roughly in a ne position relative to where we were, filling the bird feeder and taking the photo.  there are some gauzy white clouds in the photo in a band behind the craft(s) or object(s)- but most of the sky is slate-blue overcast, though sunlight is present and high contrast shadows are on the green grass cast upon the grass by the house and below the tree my husband is standing under. he himself is standing in the shadow cast by the tree. in the sky, roughly ne from our house  are 2 crafts or object(s) visible in the photo... but i didn't even notice the second one until i got the photo onto my computer and (just recently) chose it as my desktop photo while a computer repair guy was at our house in ohio. (we moved away from north dakota in 2011.) i was telling  our computer guy about the ufo photo and showed it to him, and he showed me how to enlarge the view of the photo on screen -- at which point i noticed for the first time ever looking at the photo that there seemed to be a second object further in the distance than the very obvious large one closest to us. as best we could tell, the second, more distant object or craft looked in general shape and (somewhat fuzzy) detail still looked very much in general shape/outline to   resemble/mimic the more easily apparent appearance of the large object closest to us.  most of the questions you have asked about i cannot answer becasue neither my husband or i saw the craft(s) or object(s) in the sky at the time the photo of them was taken. it actually seems very weird to us that we did not see the closer object because we were looking in its direction and it is really pretty large looking /close -looking.  i can tell you that there were no kids out in the field behind us flying box kites.. and that none of the power poles distantly visible, nor objects or  buildings in surrounding neighbor yards had things attached or attachable to them that could explain what we can see as a somewhat blurry, but really definite and large object looming quite close to where we were but (maybe??) 500+ ft above in the sky! the second , more distant but similar looking object is even harder to guess dimensions and elevation of than the near object...  but as big as the near object looks it actually spooks me out that we did not see it at all until we got the film back.. what finally triggered me to send you the photo and this (likely rather unhelpful) 'sighting' report is that it really blew me away when i realized there was seemingly a second one of these odd objects in the distance! somehow that seemed even weirder than the fact of seeing the (equally inexplicable) closer object shown in the photo--! not sure why, but the thought that there were two of these things hovering or passing above made me think finally that this was all just too odd not to file a report , even though so many details are unknown (since we did not 'register' seeing the object(s) in real time.  which is strange in and of itself given the size of the object closest to us!  at any rate- there you have it !!

noticed a bright white light coming from the south and heading towards me.  my first thought was a commercial aircraft with it's \"headlights\" shining in my direction.  as the object got closer, i noticed there were no flashing lights and found it a little strange that the brightness or lighting pattern never changed (as one would expect with a commercial airliner).\r\n\r\ni continued to watch the object as it remained in a linear path heading to the north.  as it passed overhead, another orb appeared slightly behind the main orb.  it was smaller and much more dimly lit than the \"main\" orb.  it was following the same path, but continuing to trail slightly behind.  all of a sudden, the dimmer orb changed direction, heading momentarily to the east, then accelerating at an angle to come up to the east side of the main orb.  it continued to stay on the east side of the main orb, moving at exactly the same speed. \r\n\r\nat this point, i opened our back door and yelled for my daughter and wife to come quickly.  as they came out, i very quickly told them to look at the main orb (which was very easy to see), but told them to look for the much duller orb.  in the few seconds it took me to explain, the duller orb had moved back to a position of following the main orb.  my daughter immediately saw both orbs, but my wife was only able to see the main orb.  at this point, both orbs were slightly north of us, but remained constant in color with no variation.\r\n\r\nwe walked 20 feet west off the patio into the back yard to continue viewing (we have a big cottonwood tree that began to block our view).  in that short walk, both orbs disappeared.  we continued to look for another 30 seconds or so, but they did not reappear.\r\n\r\nthere was never any sound associated with the objects and light emitted or reflected never changed.  the main orb was a fairly bright white and the smaller orb more of a dim/gray.  i would estimate that they were higher than a traditional commercial aircraft, as we are accustomed to seeing them fly over occasionally and there was also a commercial airliner flying from east to west at the same time to give us further reference.  it's lights were flashing and it could be heard after moving past our house off to the west.","distance":"Over One

15 feet away. it appeared to be just off the ground. it was right next to the front right tire of one of our cars. and only about 1 to 2 feet in size. very hard to describe. mostly white with some

 in the dome is a swivel seat in which i saw who i believe was a marine pilot in a green pressure suit with no helmet.  it sounded like a diesel train.  just before i saw it, there were a series of twister like rotational updrafts off in the distance.  it was capable of changing bearing without changing the direction it faced.  it can travel very low to the ground.  when i saw it, it was about 200 feet in the air.  the pilot noticed me, flew within 1/8 mile close to me, nearly hovering in one spot at one point, and then headed off into the commercial flight lines with an incredible capacity for acceleration and was easily capable of speeds approaching what i consider to be a thousand miles an hour.  i was in vancouver wa and the location i was at had a reasonably decent view of the flight lines that go to the coast whereupon i normally watch the planes alter course and head north to canada, or south to california.  it reached the point of breaking south within 30 seconds and then simply disappeared into the night...  its definitely a ufo to me but having seen the pilot it was unmistakably a decorated military pilot at the helm.  the height of the fuselage was about 10 feet tall, 15 feet wide at the nose and 40 feet wide at the widest point through the stern.  the pilot was about 30 years old, dark hair, military haircut, sitting in a pivot style captain kirk chair.  the craft flew such that the stern was angled up from the elevation of the nose.  i can't recall if i saw the bottom of the craft but i remember wondering where the hell the diesel train sound was coming from and then i saw this in the air.  i do not recall specifically any lights on the bottom of the craft, but due to the angle of the craft and the low proximity to the ground and the distance away from me, i could not ever see the bottom of the craft.  i had someone with me at the time and she saw this craft as well.  the surface of the craft had a look of corrugated metal like would be used on an overhang for a backyard deck along the sides of the craft, and a flat matte grey upper surface.  the dome provided a 360 view of the surroundings.\r\n\r\nit was positively the most advanced aircraft i have ever laid eyes upon.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":48431,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.7632744,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06262013-0013","longitude":-78.5922692,"occurred":1352970000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1372278343000,"summary":"The pilot was about 30 years old, dark hair, military haircut, sitting in a dome in a pivot style captain kirk chair","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/48431_submitter_file1__craft.png"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"98686","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":223,"locationName":"Raleigh, Washington","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:815"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was out on my back porch looking up at the sky. it was the supermoon night. something caught my peripheral vision, so i looked straight up in the sky. i saw an object as bright as a planet and about the same size directly overhead. i'm not sure if it was stationary at the time, or if it just seemed to be so because i jerked my head up so abruptly to look at it. \r\nanyway, after i had the object in my field of vision, it then zipped -- as fast as a shooting star if not faster -- from directly above my head to about a point 20 - 25 degrees in front of that in a northwesterly direction. then just disappeared.\r\ni had just watched the space station pass that evening, this was not the space station.\r\ni at first thought it was possible a shooting star due to the speed. is this possible?

girlfriend and i took a trip to burma to visit family and tour the countryside.\r\n\r\nwe flew into yangon on june 14th, 2013. the following morning of june 15th, we drove to bagan, myanmar. on the night of june 15th, 2013, we arranged for an english speaking tour guide to take us around bagan. the tour-guide was a local archaeologist for the myanmar department of archaeology.\r\n\r\nwe met the tour-guide and driver at approximately 9:00am at the sky palace resort in bagan. the first temple we visited was the shwezigon pagoda. the tour guide showed us around the temple, and i took some photographs of it.\r\n\r\nupon arriving home, in malaysia, we noticed something strange in one of the photographs of the pagoda. initially i believed it to be a lens flare, but after some research and viewing of other photographs i believe this is real. i am not sure what it is, but i do not believe it is a lens flare. i always take my photos in burst mode and i shoot with a high quality canon dslr (60d). the photos were taken free-hand in succession to one another. sometimes  adjust aperture or iso to get better lighting. i have noticed a glowing white red and green object/orb in one of the high-resolution photos. i have attached photos for you to analyze. they are not edited in any way, shape or form. i believe the object to be some form of ufo, and it is genuine in nature. some reading online has shown me that ufos are not uncommon in the area of bagan.\r\n\r\nthe ufo was not noticed during the tour as the sun was quite bright during the walk around the temple. everyone was focused on the temple or surrounding statues. we were also wearing sun-hats and glasses in an attempt to block the sun/sky.\r\n\r\nmy personal digital enhancement of the object shows a disc or tube shaped object emitting a white glow with red and green lights at the edges. there are birds in the photograph, and based on the relative distance of the birds i believe the object is quite distant.I believe the bird in the photograph is an asian crow, but i am not 100% sure. in the first photo, the object can also be seen on the upper right side of the photo, outwards and up from the pagoda steeple. it must have moved across the sky.\r\n\r\ni have attached three photos. 4593 is for reference, 4594 contains the ufo on the top right area, 4595 contains the ufo on the left of the pagota. the last two photos were taken roughly 2 or 3 seconds apart, enough time to change the aperture slightly.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

skywatch, as there was a clearing in the sky after some of the heaviest rain i have seen in years. the air was very clean, with a few light clouds in spots.\r\n  i was looking straight up when i saw a blue-white object streaking overhead, and passing beside the top of the 125 ft douglas fir in our front yard. i said \"look!\", to my partner who saw it right away, too.\r\n\r\nall we could say to each other without taking our eyes off of it is \"oh my god, look how fast that thing is going!\" neither of us have ever seen anything that fast, other than a meteorite, and this was definitely not a meteor, and we just don't have anything capable of that speed.   this object was on a steady path, had no flashing lights, and seemed to be lighted by its own power (rather than reflected sunlight). the se to nw trajectory is one that we have never observed in a satellite, but this was no satellite.  that speed would fling it into outer space.\r\n\r\nmy partner and i agreed that it's speed was at least four times the speed of a satellite.  it had to be travelling several thousands of miles per hour.\r\nin the check-box, for lack of better description, i checked 'star-like', but star-like is more a pinpoint of light, and this was larger than that, i want to say visually it had width as one would perceive when viewing a planet. it was blue-white, but more blue than white. also, it was not extremely bright, yet was highly visible for the duration we were able to view it, and did not fade in brightness as it got farther away, though it appeared gradually smaller due to distance.\r\n\r\nfrom the second we saw it, it was 90 degrees overhead, and it was at 30 degrees from the horizon just a few seconds later, when we lost sight due to clouds low on the horizon.\r\nboth my partner and i are wondering what is going on in the western washington skies, as this is my 3rd sighting in as many weeks, and too many to count since the first of the year, several of which were shared sightings. i am an avid amateur astronomerof many decades and have no problem discerning satellites, jets, and the iss from the phenomena we have witnessed and are

the morning. we had just turned off of linwood st. left onto glendale st. in roseville mi. i happened to glance up the sky was very clear and in front of us to our left there were 4 extremely bright and low white lights, 2 in the middle very close and 2 on the outside so it was this line coming towards us very slowly. i didn't immediately know what it was due to how low and bright it was i have seen aircraft headlights on coming towards me but these lights were a purer white almost like a fluorescent bulb white. it was to the point that i was freaked out and stop my girlfriend and just kept saying \"thats the real thing, thats the real thing\"  as the line flew towards us we noticed the shape of the craft and because of how low and slow this object was flying we could make it out clearly. the craft was a y-shaped craft with the bottom part of the y being the front. this craft resembled how a 747 would be shaped except there wasnt a tail. and i know this due to the stars passing behind it as a reassurance. there were 5 lights on this craft. the 2 close white lights that were in the middle were directional inset headlights on the front of the craft (we know they were inset into the front because as it passed over we couldn't see them anymore they faded consistently with just being blocked out of line of sight) the 2 outer lights were on the tip of the wings and they were huge white orbs attached and very thoroughly lit throughout these were the only lights we seen the entire experience. the last light was a pulsing very red light that was in the bottom of the v on the back of this craft not on the bottom (we know this because we could only fully see this light as it was moving away) and it did not blink it pulsed, it stayed on red the whole time and just pulsed brighter like when it wanted to not consistently and not blinking like an aircraft light does on and off. the noise was weird because for how slow it was going and low it wasn't until the object was past overhead quite a bit that we heard the engine and it wasn't a normal airplane or jet engine it was uniform (not wavering or changing pitch or loudness like conventional craft) and it was quieter it was almost stealth like in nature. it took about 6 minutes for this craft to fly over it came from the ne and headed from roseville towards detroit. we lost sight of it over the houses ad it kept flying off. we were both talking about it for a long time and thought about it and the more we thought about it, the less likely it seemed it was a normal aircraft. so i finally decided to report it because i think it was something very weird and by definition it was a ufo.","distance":"101-500
