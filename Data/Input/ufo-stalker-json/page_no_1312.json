slowly moved away and light dimmed leaving only an outline of a transparent round object. this was the first ufo sighting that was completely different than all others.\r\n\r\nsince then i've been out gazing at the sky at all hours of night looking for moving or unusual objects. i normally see several satellites moving across the sky, which look like small stars moving at constant speeds. \r\n\r\nmonday morning at 5:15am i was looking and i had been checking out satellite positions on the nasa satellite web site.  i was looking straight up when i noticed what first appeared to be a satellite moving from nw to se. as it passed what appeared to be a far away star the little light started following the bigger light at a slower speed. in addition to seeing the light it appeared to have an outline of an cigar shaped body that was mostly transparent except from the reflection from the bright moon. the cigar shape was towing the light behind it. it could only be seen briefly as it moved away from the light. \r\n\r\nten minutes later i saw another solid bright light moving east to west at a similar speed as the first object. i was able to get a better idea of the height of this object as a fighter jet flying at high altitude with red lites flashing flew overhead. both the plane and the object appeared to be at similar heights over 40,000 ft. i had another high altitude jet fly by at the same height a few minutes later. both jets were flying in normal flight patterns of traffic at high altitudes maybe upwards 40,000 ft. higher than normal. i was able to see a slight reflection of the object where it wasn't lit up, that's how i new it was close to the height of the planes because i could see the unlighted bottom of the planes also.\r\n\r\ni went back in to check the nasa site and there were no satellites flying over texas at anywhere near that time. so that would make them unidentified. this sighting wasn't nearly as dramatic as the one two weeks ago but very interesting. i have no doubt the past sighting was from something out of this world. the memory is burned into my mind.","distance":"Over One

of 6-8 small square dull white colored objects headed from northeast to south east. they were irregular in size and shape but square is the closest i can make them to be. just north of where we were standing on our street (which goes north to south) the group of white objects stopped suddenly and until i looked east i saw the diamond shaped craft with the multiple colored lights that we have seen recently has heading north east to north west. the group proceeded south from there in a quick speedy basis. the diamond shaped one headed on west in supersonic speeds, none of them seem to be aware of each other last night i took our dog out for his walk around the same time and i observed a blimp shaped object flying really fast from south to north, it was doing corkscrew type fight path it had rectangular windows along the sides that changed from white to red to yellow and back to white blinking off between light colors and all windoows apeared to change color at the same time. tonight our local object was running all over the place as if he was challenging them to come back. other than our local one there were no other visable ufos in our

cats run around one of the lights as if it was scared. then another light appeared exactly the same as the first, the second beam of white light appeared about 3-4 feet from the first beam of light. they both were stationary, i just stared and i had no clue what these lights were, because i knew they were different than any lights i had ever seen. so i started looking up and the lights were coming from darkness in the sky right above the house. i knew what i was seeing was not possible or was very rare to ever happen, and then the thought of aliens and ufo popped in my head. i tried my best to study the beam of light and how it could be so perfect and straight. it was as if the light came from its source and then there was no trace of it leading to the circle itself but there it was a circular beam of white light. i watched the first light disappear, and after that i ran away from the windows.\r\n\r\n now that i think about it i have a theory of what this possibly was. what if there was aliens visiting earth and the beams were there to pick them up to beam or materialize the aliens back to the ship. the cat was scared so maybe the cat sensed or saw the aliens they could have been invisible and beamed up to the ufo. just like in star trek how the people would stand on the white circle to be beamed down to the surface of a planet.","distance":"20 Feet or

 i just don't know.  but i would love to.  please advise if you have ever heard of a similar incident.  \r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":48407,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.554058672729504,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06252013-0003","longitude":-78.96469716682064,"occurred":1275045300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maryland","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1372160619000,"summary":"5\" horizontal laser light rose from 1000' below us to eye level in 1 minute.  no sounds changed direction ascending.  flashed once every 10 seconds.","tags":["sound","flash","light"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"21539","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1124,"locationName":"Lonaconing, Maryland","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:882"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My boyfriend and i were looking at the night sky around 8:15 hawaii time from our backyard noticing all the stars out. we then noticed directly overhead a fast moving \"star\" going across the sky.It seemed to fly toward the north east. it was moving very fast. we first thought, could it be a satellite?

the bath tub. i got in and laid back. there is a large window next to the tub and we keep the blinds at an angle so we can look out and see the sky. i was watching the birds outside and a passenger jet went over. we are over the takeoff pattern for sacramento airport for jets heading east. then about 2 minutes after the jet flew past i noticed a triangle object in the sky. at first i thought it might be a bird, however there was no division between the body and wings. this was just a triangle. also at the height it was, a bird wouldn't have seemed to be going so fast and its heading was perfectly straight. it looked to be about 3 times the height of the jets that fly over our house look to be. it was going from east to west so it was flying against the normal jet traffic, but like i said it was much higher in the sky. it was a dull slate gray or black in color, and it seemed to have a circle on the bottom. honestly i can't say it wasn't a b-117 fighter although i see jets of all types where we live and i have never saw a b-117.There are air force bases all around sacramento so i cant really count this out, but if it was a b-117 he was headed some where awful fast. the

24th.    this was approximately 1:oo am , if looking straight up it would have been 5 to 10 degrees to the south and 15 degrees to the west. i was letting the dog out, and looking at the stars when i noticed this object, which i do not think was in our atmosphere. it appeared to be in space, but had to be very large. there were 3 orange to amber lights, very bright. i watched it for 5 min or so, then wondered if my eyes were playing tricks on me. so i closed my eyes and counted to 60 very slowly, then looked again. lights were still there. so i watched for a few more minutes, then a smaller white light come out of it, flying straight north. with incredible speeds. it then made a u turn, and flew back to the 3 other lights. i am one of those skeptics from being in the military (usmc), knowing the gov and military have plenty of aircraft the public has no knowledge of. i believe that 99.99 percent of sightings is just unknown manned aircraft. but there is no way this could fall into that category. this was most definitely in space. and had to be extremely large.  i would be interested in hearing if anyone else had seen this object.         thank you, ","distance":"Over One

and took more pics and then it suddenly broke up into 3 smaller white objects and disappeared. the digital pic of #240 is really the most interesting and you may have to play with the zoom ect to get

vision, i noticed what looked like an extremely bright meteor, gradually increasing in brightness to the southwest of my location (about 260-270 degrees azimuth).  it was about 45 degrees elevation, fairly close to saturn.  the sky was cloudless and smoke-free (for the first night in several due to various fires).  the moon was not directly visible from my location due to my roof-line. \r\n\r\nas i watched the object, it slowly decreased in brightness until it was invisible.  i thought, that's cool, i just saw a meteor that must have been headed straight towards me because it left no trail at all.  then less than a minute later, it showed up again a little farther north.  but this time i watched as it gradually and evenly increased from invisible to a tiny pinprick of light, then to it's full brightness and back again to invisible.  \r\n\r\nat this point, i ran inside to get my girlfriend to come outside to witness it.  i told her to look up to where i guessed it would show up again, and sure enough, after about 10 seconds, it appeared again - exactly like the previous two times.  i had her run inside to get my binoculars, and while she was gone, it appeared one last time before it disappeared from view.  \r\n\r\nat its maximum brightness, the object was much brighter than any object in the sky - brighter even than jupiter at its maximum brightest.  the object appeared to be traveling  north from around saturn towards ursa major and was completely silent.  also, it seemed to be traveling significantly higher and/or slower than commercial airplanes normally fly.  the color of the light was always brilliant white when visible.  finally, the object spent more time invisible than visible as it was traveling.   i've seen countless planes and helicopters around here (a couple miles southeast of the us air force academy) and have never seen one that had lights like this object.  i've seen satellites as well and this object appeared much, much brighter than any satellite i've ever observed.  the entire sighting lasted for about 3 minutes until it disappeared for good.\r\n","distance":"Over One

unusual orange-reddish light  due nw that brighter than any stars or antenna masts markers in the sky. it was slightly moving n-nw , then stopped for about 45sec, then traveled se, then changed direction instantly moving nnw again, it was at an unknown distance, but no more than a mile or two away at a 45 degree angle. it's orange red color was steady for about 3 minutes while traveling nnw, then became a little dimmer as it changed direction south, then dimmed and resembled a star for a minute and was stationary, then became even brighter and began traveling nnw again. but not as fast as it was originally for about 2 minutes. the light then dimmed and resembled a star for about 3 minutes, then disappeared entirely. my home is directly above the landing path for barksdale afb, and being prior military and having b-52s and all kinds of other planes flying and approaching at all times of the day and night i a certain this was not a plane or jet. there is no jet engine or strobe light in the world that can put out the light we saw, or move and hover like this. my wife and i had our suspicions about the ufo, but on my way to work the next morning the local radio station kvki dj was talking all morning abouta ufo that approached barksdale afb airspace, the tower hailed it 3 times to no avail and dispatched fighters. who knows what they saw, but this area, particularly the afb has had numerous sightings over the past few years & with the base housing half of our nuclear bombs & missiles, why not come check it out? \r\n\r\ni have seen some weird things in my life in
