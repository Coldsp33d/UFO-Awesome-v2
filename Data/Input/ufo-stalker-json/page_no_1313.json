it was wide.  i got curious and went and got a pair of 10x50 binoculars.  i looked at the trail and noted a bronze colored sphere at the south end in the clear part of the sky.  the sphere's angle changed and it appeared somewhat oval. it appeared to have been going in a southerly direction and was responsible for the contrail. the object was stationary when i saw it however. then it changed direction did a 180 deg. turn and went back into the contrail. since the contrail was alone in the sky and short in length, i expected the object to emerge from the other side. i observed the contrail for a number of minutes, 7:48-8:05 am mst.\r\nthe object never reappeared.  i checked at various distances from the contrail but saw nothing but blue sky. the object had gone back into the contrail and did not come out. slowly the contrail lengthened due to upper atmosphere winds and still no sign of the object. whatever it was it was not an airplane nor a weather balloon. no airplane etc. was involved in this event in any way. to put it another way the contrail \r\n\"swallowed up\" the object as the object never reappeared after going into the contrail. there was clear blue sky all around

jasper he can take pictures of the wildlife) \r\nhe started to film the ufo, but then he realized he had to pull over to the start of the road, for safety reasons. \r\nwitch was the nothing but black part of the video. he stepped out ans started to film it. someone say him standing \r\nout with the camera, he soon pulled over and started to watch with him, then more and more people stopped. the ufo \r\nseemed to dart all over the sky coming closer then far away, it had to lights they would change colour every so \r\noften, between red, blue and green. the clolurs blinded into each other, but when it was on it side you could \r\nclearly see there was two lights. at some point of the video you could see faintly another one following it, my \r\nfather said he never saw it until he look at the video. my dad got 4:43 mins of it, he had to leave to go do \r\nhis job. the video camera is a little old so the video looks a little fuzzy, and it couldn't focus on the ufo \r\nsince it moved to quickly. my dads friend neal, once said saw something like this when he was child a long time \r\nago, he said his father woke him up to go see it and he described the ufo, that sound quite like we

 what made it stand out - it was large, flew in formation, silent and brighter than a jet-liner, lantern-like. it think it would be pretty-well impossible for anyone standing in the back-yard looking up to have not seen these lights. i don't know if it was some summer solstice festivel or a special terrestrial craft. i'd like to have a corroborating sighting or news from yyz radar. again, it would be impossible for radar not to seen these objects if they were airborne vehicles.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":48364,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.570841627578936,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-06232013-0027","longitude":-79.7908444115339,"occurred":1371879600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1372032351000,"summary":"Orange red - lantern-like objects flying in formation","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/48364_submitter_file1__SightingJune2113NorthMississauga.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"L5N 7C4","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Mississauga, Ontario","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:955"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Petaluma","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was sitting on my front deck at 9:30 pm.  i was looking at the full moon when i saw a star that was moving to the right, then it started getting closer to where i was.  i then realized it wasn't a star.  i was mesmerized and watched it keep getting closer, then suddenly it went to the right of my house and disappeared.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":48363,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.2905909,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06232013-0026","longitude":-122.7101277,"occurred":1371961800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Bullet,   Missile,   Cigar,   Disc,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1372028692000,"summary":"First thought it was a bright star, then it started coming towards me and got real close. then it went south and looked like it evaporated.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"94952","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Petaluma, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:956"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Lethbridge","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On the night of june 22, 2013 at approximately 11pm, while observing the super moon, my wife & i noticed 9 reddish-orange orbs flying east at high-speed over north lethbridge, alberta. theses were not flares, airplanes or helicopters. the objects made no sound and were in scattered formation (altitudes ranged from the lowest orb flying approx. 20,000 to the highest being approx. 40,000 feet)for about two minutes until forming a triangle formation pattern and then disappearing straight up into the stars. the whole event lasted about 3 minutes.
