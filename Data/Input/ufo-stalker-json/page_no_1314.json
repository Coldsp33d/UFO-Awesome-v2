yet here it is.\r\n as with the days ago sightings, i was on my porch smoking late at night, and sky-watching, which is something i've been doing a long time.\r\nearlier in the day, knowing that a 'supermoon' was rising, i went out to observe it, and noted that 'chemtrails' were being laid in the night sky, which has been happening a lot lately.  it is also maddening for star watchers like myself. i keep having the thought- is there something in the night skies that someone does not want us to see? i am seeing a disproportionately high amount of odd phenomena on the very few clear viewing nights that have been available, and i don't exactly live outside and look constantly for these things. odds are, i am seeing maybe 1% of what is out there, and yet i am still seeing a lot. i feel dutiful to report these sightings.  for all i know, i or my partner and i, are the only ones in the whole city out there looking up in the middle of the night on a pretty regular basis. i hope we

straight up, my eye caught an object rapidly moving east. i watched as it went straight overhead, and then without changing speed, abruptly changed direction in a rounded turn to the south, a turn far too fast and tight for any plane or jet to make. it was impossible to determine altitude, except that it appeared higher than the highest jets fly, and perhaps as high as satellites are.\r\n it was visually about the size of mars, but very white.  after it turned south i watched it until it eventually faded into the background haze, with total eye contact of aprox. 24 to 26 seconds. \r\n\r\n

have had in my life, i was 14 yrs old, and this was not the first. i was camping with my mom and step dad at maple leaf park camp ground in earlville ill during july of 1976. on one of the mornings just after breakfast, i decided to go swimming at the pond. i don't know why, but when i reached the beach area i picked up a small twig and began to draw a design in the sand. it wasn't much, just a 1 inch circle with a six inch triangle around it, then three dots just outside the flat lines of the triangle. i did this for three mornings on my way to swim. i still to this day can't remember why i traced these in the sand. anyway, after i finished swimming on the third day i walked with a buddy of mine to the pool table house to shoot a few games of pool, and then we left. on our way back to the campsite some movement in the sky ahead caught my attention. as i watched i saw ten light gold colored discs flying in a triangle formation, moving between the cloud tops, right to left. i was walking east so i gathered that the objects where going north. all where identical and each had a darker orange band or stripe around the outer edge. they appeared to emit their own soft light and where a little fuzzy or blurred looking, sort of like a picture slightly out of focus. i watched for five to seven seconds and then i tapped my buddy on the arm, pointed to the sky and said \"look at that!\", but when he looked up they where already behind the clouds and gone. he said, \"look at what\". i stopped on the road and remember being a little upset that he didn't see what i did. i had a butterfly feeling in my stomach as the image of these things in my memory would just linger. they seemed to fly with a purpose. this is the third time i can remember seeing strange lights in the sky,

at about a 2 or 3 second interval.The other lights seemed to follow at different intervals and slightly different altitudes, some higher some a little lower.They were all tracking from the sw to the ne. we would see the lights appear in the sw emerging from behind the trees at the end of the block but much farther away like a small plane would.\r\nthey would then dissapear just slighty past what would be straight north.They were moving in the opposite direction of the way the clouds were moving in. in total we saw about 18 of them.They made no sound at all, my dad was a pilot and i was raised around planes of all sizes and commercial aircraft...These were not planes. no sound, no marker lights, no red or green strobes, also no chopper sounds like a helicopter. they seemed to pulsate an orange glow.\r\nthey would ascend slightly just before dissapearing. i did get some footage with my digital camera but it is fuzzy and shaky. i got one with a very close zoom and maybe seemed to have a conical form but not sure.\r\nas far as my feelings and reactions...I do not think i have seen anything like this before and i watch the skies all the time, i think of my self as a star

we had seen ufo's told her no so when it got dark she took us outside and she pointed them out to us. there were 2 to 3 of them and they were hovering in the sky 1 would above the dam or plant while the other 1 or 2 would hover across the sky, they also would go up and down for a short distance then in a blink of an eye they would switch places. we observed this the entire mth we were there. there was also write ups in the local paper ( the daily interlake) about peoples cars staling and watches stopping when they were closer to the objects. these objects were doing things that no plane or helicopter could do. i think the 3 colors that would blink were white, blue and sometimes red. mostly they were just white lights in the sky. i knew these were not planes and knowing they were going to be there once it got dark was surreal because i knew they were ufo's not something we could explain. they were still there when we went back to ca. when our vacation was up. when ever i told anyone about it i was laughed at. people to this day still ask me hey seen any ufo's lately.+
