not hear anything. that is when i saw it a orange round ball object that looked as if it moved in waves slower then faster it was moving with the and just made a wide turn and came right at me over the top of some homes on the river and it looked as if it stopped but i think it was my line of vision because it made like a u-turn and then went to the north northeast. it looked brighter on the top and the bottom and it almost looked as if it was see though in the center of it it looked as if it was very close almost right over me. i ran into the house to get a camera and my cell phone and ran back out. i started to go back to the spot i saw it but went to the back yard and i think i could see it for a second but it would have been 3 to 4 miles away by then. i thought it was going to do the same thing as the first round orange ball like object but it had a dome over the ball. that object got so bright i thought it was going to bust into flames but it just disparaged just gone. this ball looked as if it was gone to get brighter and that maybe because it got closer to me. the thing was the way it moved like in waves. i have photos of other things but not right at me and almost on top of me. before i ran i looked to see if i could spot a light beam from the ground that some one could have been doing this but nothing that would look like a flash lights beam going up. this was not a falling star this changed direction it turned from the river came back at me then made a u-turn the go north northwest from me. please if anyone also saw it post it and contact me i would like to hear

experiences, i soon after went to go visit my boyfriend who lives in the city. it was late at night and i had looked out the window at an extremely purple sky with a large and strange cloud formation. i instinctively felt the need to take a picture. so i borrow my boyfriends camera. i was unable to see any lights at all in the sky at the time, not even planes, on account of the cloudiness. i set the camera function to 'night landscape'. i know night vision is actually most preferred, but sadly didn't/nor do i have it. but also very unfortunately, you don't get to see the very purple hue of the sky. \r\n\r\n  still..After taking the picture, a formation of lights appeared at the top, nearly center of the picture and of the cloud formation. i'm not 100% on what it is, honestly. only

food restaurant when i (don) saw a glowing orange/white object emerge from behind a grove of trees about 300 yards away. i noticed it first because it appeared to be flying very slowly and with no noise or nav lights. i thought it might have been a plane or a balloon but since i spent a career in aviation and my son is at the united states air force academy (and had the object in his field glasses the entire time). it appeared and moved slowly from right to left at about 15-20 degrees above the tree line and was moving upward to the west and south as it gained altitude. it moved up, hovered, moved left then right, and began moving off to the south. others reported it in meeker to the local police department and i have the officer's name. having seen an object before and having an inherent interest in aviation, i knew this object was under some sort of control but had no typical general or military aviation characteristics. we all felt very surprised that we could not make sense of the object. no noise, no nav lights, and a strange shape and glow left us all a bit unnerved. we lost sight of it as it abruptly lost it's lights but my son who had it in his filed glasses, could see that the object was then black and spherical, about ten meters in diameter and continued to move to the south without lights of any kind until we lost it towards the horizon or somewhere in that area. multiple observers and witnesses in town, 6 there at the site.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

approximately 50 feet above us rather quickly. we were able to get a good look of the flying objects threw an opening in the trees. i saw a triangular shaped flying object with a haze around it. the front object was very large in size with red lights, the 2 separate objects that were following it looked like red balls of light moving in their own paths. the 2 red lights were flying behind it never beside it. the 3 objects hovered slowly over the tree tops towards the north and over our pond in the back yard. we could not see them after they flew over the pond because of the many trees. unfortunately my camera did not pick up what we saw, it actually turned off i fumbled around trying to turn it back on in the mean time keeping my eyes on the objects. i am disappointed i was unable to capture vital proof. i would like to find out if anyone else in the surrounding areas saw what we saw. my boyfriend did call the canterbury police department and the national ufo reporting center. the center said they had a similar sighting called in from connecticut that same night.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":48303,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.273281277924006,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06212013-0013","longitude":-71.52062757009713,"occurred":1371789900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Hampshire","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Fireball,   Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1371839809000,"summary":"3 flying objects in canterbury nh triangle shape and 2 red balls of light behind it.","tags":["triangle","light"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/48303_submitter_file1__101722610151528594134370833493675n.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"03224","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Concord, New Hampshire","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:1104"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Boise","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I woke up at 6:00 am (mt) on june, 21, 2013,and started a pot of coffee, then went and got dressed. at 6:30 am  i poured myself a cup of coffee then walked through the house to the backyard to have a cigarette. it was a beautiful morning with blue sky and several wispy clouds.\r\n\r\ni immediately noticed the round bright white object against the blue sky. i lit a cigarette and stood watching it. the object moved in a straight line, went through one wispy cloud, then against the blue sky, and into another wispy cloud - then disappeared. i stood there for another 15 minutes but it never came out.\r\n\r\ni was totally calm while watching the object. we have an airport a few miles away, but this object was too high to be landing. so, i figured it was a plane flying high, going to seattle or portland, but it did not come out of the little wispy cloud and it really didn't look like an airplane.\r\n\r\nthen i thought it was a satellite, but again it should have continued on a straight path, not disappear. a planet would not have moved in the sky. i am at a loss as to the identity of this object.\r\n\r\ni am reporting it because this situation happened and i wanted someone to know. i didn't get my camera because i wasn't disturbed by the object until it disappeared.
