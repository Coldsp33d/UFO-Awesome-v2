dinner and visiting with them. just before she got into her car, i gave her a hug and held her, during which i noticed a light up in the sky out in the distance beyond her above the tree line. i should mention my parents live in the middle of the city, not in the country. just a typical suburban setting. i'd say... at first there was nothing unusual about this light. it reminded me of a plane, and for the first 1/2 second or so that was what i thought it was, as it was a regular, plain yellowish/whiteish light. however, in the other 1/2 half of that first second i noticed it was moving, in the direction of where i was located, but not as fast as a plane should have been going. my next thought was it could have been a satellite in orbit. following that thought was that could not be the case, it was much too bright for that and too close. as mentioned earlier, it was far enough away and high enough in the sky i thought it was a plane, and did think so for the next few seconds....\r\n\r\nabout 4 or 5 seconds into watching this \"plane\", the light dimmed. it was still visible, but by now it was much smaller in diameter then before, i'd say about 1/2-3/4 of the size it was. it was still yellow/white in color. but what was really incredible was what happened next! as i see it getting dimmer, there is a time, which i'd say was less than 1/2 a second again, where th dimming stops as well as the light itself quits moving. remember, this whole time it is moving in my direction very, very slowly. in the next.... 3/4 of a second i see in the area brighten up really quick and shoot up, creating a tail. it reminded me instantly of a shooting star, except it was out into space, the tail was angled up , not straight up but at an angle as thought to get into space. the head of this \"shooting star\" had what i thought was some blue in the light, while the tale had some hints of orange. \r\n\r\nmind you, this all happened very quickly. i would imagine from me first seeing it to the ending lasted no more than 15 seconds. my poor girlfriend, i was huging her and she was talking to me, bless her little heart when she noticed i had a look of \"what on earth is that?!?\" on my face, and realized i was not paying attention, turned around and saw the shooting star going up and out into space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas mentioned, at first i thought it was a plane. after seeing it was going too slow i thought itwas something else. what i first thought of was the soap opera \"guilding light\", in which the lantern or light or what have you, is rotating. the light was also not a round light, not a perfect circle. in fact, it was somewhat box like, not quite 100% but had some.... hard to define edges. that was another reason i thought of that soap opera, it did for some reason bring up a light in a lantern for some reason in my mind.\r\n\r\nas it shot up into the air, i couldn't believe what i was seeing! sure, planes might turn off their lights for whatever reason. objects can slow down in the air or maybe it was a helicopter or blimp, who knows. with whitman afb only 60 miles southeast of where this is located it wouldn't have surprised me much if it was one of those guys. we see the b-2's fly around here once in a blue moon so you never know what to expect. however... i have never heard or seen anything do what i saw last night. the little 8 or 9 year old thought it was pretty cool, but the grown up in me kept thinking \"what the hell is that!\"\r\n\r\nplease feel free to contact me regarding this event. it happened so fast i didn't get a chance to get a picture of it. however i did get the time right after, 10:40pm on the dot, and my compass app on my iphone had the approximate direction as west north west. i then texted myself a description of what happened within the first 5 minutes, and posted this on mufon's site as soon as i possibly could.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

time, but it was too strange and high -tech for humans even now! this was 1974. the ship, or whatever stopped because i stopped, thinking that i could get them to land. i liked \"the day the earth stood still\" and had thoughts of meeting an alien.I opened my car door so i could signal them but as soon as i did, a third light came on and it made a little air noise, like compressed air flowing for a split second and it shot off like a bullet. i guessed that it was a good 20 miles away in the first second of flight. we could see it go like a meteor southward and i could estimate that it was somewhere over the benton harbor airport area in one second. lost sight because it kept traveling at that speed as far as we could tell.\r\nthere was no other sound the whole time and i had my sunroof open that night.\r\ni could see it overhead staying right with my car as we traveled.\r\nafter we stopped, people from the car behind me and in front of me came over and started talking to us about the ufo because they stopped when i stopped but were never that close to it. it appeared to be just above the treetops.\r\nthe next day i was listening to the radio and a lady from st. joseph was

pulsation would increase and then slow as it slowed. i was very attentive and slowed down trying at this point to figure out what a helicopter was doing there this time of night but was more puzzled by the single orange light since the red/green nav lights were not present. there were open fields on both sides of me, farm land. to the left was a tree line perhaps a half mile or less away. the craft smoothed out its trajectory still moving slowly. there was no rural traffic at all that night. as the craft slowed to a hover over the tree line i woke linda. she was pretty fuzzy for a minute and asked what is that?\r\n\r\nby this time i was stopped and she was becoming restless. at that moment two other rounded discs came up from behind the trees and hovered staggered just to the left and below it. first one and then the other started off in a path i judges would take them very close to mexico missouri to the southeast. linda told me she was afraid and we should go. i believe she started crying. the original object traveled across the field moving from my left in a eastern direction at maybe 10-15 mph. i backed my car a little down the culvert to try and get my headlights up but the object crossed in front of me one telephone pole length in front of me just over the telephone pole. i could have hit it with a rock. it gave me the impression that it looked like spun aluminum softly burnished and it seemed to glow orange from within.\r\n\r\nit continued to travel across the field and started to move ne then accelerated rapidly and moved away. i could still make out the light so i took off as fast as the car would run. it was a 66 lemans with the high performance six and four barrel so i was running maybe 110-120. i cleared the town of vidalia at 110 and continued on. i slowed down as the road met highway 61 north and drove maybe 80 up past new london, missouri. there is a small river valley just outside of new london to the north, salt river i think. at the far eastern edge of the valley toward the missippi river there was an installation of three radio towers visable at that distance and there i saw the same craft or one like it doing circles around the top of the towers until the tree line obscurred my line of sight.\r\n\r\ni observed that this was niether a helicopter,or fixed wing craft. it made absolutely no sound.  it was not a balloon as it accelerated and changed altitude as smooth as molasses. balloons don't outrun cars at that altitude with no wind. this was not something that we possesed the ability to make in 1966 if even now. it was perhaps fifty feet across.\r\n\r\ni got two friends and we went back out to the towers after i dropped linda off. she was so frightened that she hid her eyes and refused to talk about it. i called the tower at quincy illinois the next day and asked if there had been anything on the screen other then routine traffic at around 3 am the night before. there was silence opon the line and the tower asked,\"why, did you see something strange?\" i told them that if i had i wasn't about to make a formal report and thanked him and hung up.\r\n\r\nat the moment this happened i realized this was not something from here. i was overcome by a great since of awe and peace and excitement. i was energized after that and did not go to sleep till maybe 7 am.\r\n\r\ni submit this now if for no other reason then to ad my observations to others and perhaps add a piece to the puzzle. i know what i saw and was very close to it and with my knowlege even then of aviation i understood this was something beyond our capability.Thanks for your work. thomas smith\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

night . we had observed venus earlier to the west north....Just above tree tops of horizon. this came from similar direction. some one said to look could see venus again? was a very bright light moving west to east. so was not a planet or star. someone said space station. which i and others have seen before but? the orbit was wrong ...In my thinking though am certainly no expert. so the light was first observed west very similar to venus reckoning moved steadily in an east direction increasing in size due to proximity. in my observation was not within earth atmosphere. the light reflection or inherent was white and very bright. as moved from east to west went over us. not directly more like a 2 o'clock position. i thought object had shape to it  hourglass or a length rectangular? there was never blinking lights as an aircraft just steady bright white light that increased again due to proximity. object continued on west to east path . i say object because stars or aircraft don't do what we observed next. it seemed to be accelerating and gaining altitude ...Path was steady throughout observation. then ...The best way to describe was like a star trek ship going into warp

pike, se cleveland area). at first i thought i was dreaming and it was a hoax becuase i did not belive in such creatures or crafts (whatever they are). the craft was accurately darting left and right, then stopped momentaritly before moving straight up in air. it was almost as if it was searching for something or someone. then a single beam of light emerged as it was \"scanning\" the area or continuing a more in depth search. this occurred more than once with the beam \"scanning\" roughly about 4 times in 4 different directions. there was a small airplane (no where near the craft that flew over our home, it was loud and you knew it was a plane). the air craft in the distance was quite unusual and i have never witnessed anything like this in person. i have only seen such crafts in movies. this was a creepy feeling for not only myself, but our family as well. we never lost sight of the object, after about 15 minutes of observation, we decided 7am came early and we had to go back to bed so we could get up for work. to our knowledge, ti was still there after we went back in the house, i am not sure when or if it left the area.
