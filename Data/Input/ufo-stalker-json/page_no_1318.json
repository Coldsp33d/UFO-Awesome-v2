passage toward lummi island, washington. the night sky was crystal clear, and i was marveling both at how incredibly calm and glassy the sound was and that i could even see the stars reflections in the water. i'd never seen the water so calm there, especially to be able to see the stars reflecting in it, so i got out of my car and stood at the railing as the ferry slowly left strawberry point and chugged toward the island's landing dock (i'd guess it only goes 10mph or so). about one minute out, i saw what i assumed were two lights on a car (one white the other red) across the water rounding a bend on haxton way, the road that curves along the southern tip of the lummi indian reservation (across hale passage from lummi island) approximately 3/4 mile from the ferry. i guessed i was seeing one headlight and one red running light on a car, close together, but they weren't following that curve in the road i was very familiar with. and because i could see those lights' star-like long reflections in the calm waters, i continued tracking them awhile. but when the lights moved beyond the end of that small peninsula, and carried on out into the strait between the mainland and small island just off it across portage bay--can't recall name of that island, its the lummi tribe's sacred island off limits to non-tribe members--i knew they weren't from a car of course. as the ferry got about halfway out on the 6 minute crossing, i began to assume i was seeing the running lights on a lummi fishing vessel. but even over the sound of the ferry's engine i normally would be able to hear a fishing boat's engine from that distance, approx. 3-500 feet by now. the two lights, a white one with a red one right next to it, continued on--perhaps just a few feet over the water--and so, still unsure of i exactly what i was tracking, i waited for this \"boat\" to cut across the many long, narrow reflections of house lights on the reservation's shoreline shining across the absolutely flat, still sound water. i was waiting for those reflections to be interrupted and stirred about, which a boat's wake would do. but when these two lights--which appeared now to be moving faster than any fishing boat could, and i thought i might be seeing some fast harbor patrol boat or such speeding out toward open waters--crossed paths with those house light refections and did not alter them in any way, the hair on my neck stood up. it was impossible. at this moment a man waiting in the car behind mine jumped out to the railing, he was seeing the same thing i was, and we exchanged silent shrugs, hands up in air etc as if to say 'what was that?' i then next saw the red and white lights pair moving so fast, just over the water and curving northwest beyond strawberry point and out toward sea and out of sight past the northern tip of lummi island, that i let out a loud gasp and 'what the f--k' exclamation. i expected the other guy to reply, but he just shook his head and quickly got back in his car without saying a word. having seen another unexplained light phenomena on lummi island the year prior (i just posted that sighting to mufon earlier)--and having zero explanation for any boat cutting across those house lights reflections without a single ripple in said reflections, its completely impossible--i was absolutely sure i'd just seen a ufo. when the ferry reached the lummi island dock, i asked a ferry worker directing traffic off the boat if he'd seen those lights. at first he just gave me a weird look, but then he said 'lots of odd things happen over here' as he waved me to drive on up the landing's ramp. i was of course stunned by all this, driving my car up the road and pulling off at the first pullout i could find with a clear view of hale passage to look for more lights, etc. i must've sat there looking for an hour, trying to digest what had just happened. will never forget it. it was 9 years ago--i just heard about mufon on the radio so just now reporting--but, especially writing about it now, it feels all the more vivid in my mind. thanks for running a place like mufon...","distance":"101-500

1/4 mile from the island's general store and ferry crossing dock, i turned right on constitution when i saw a red glowing orb-like light, perhaps 3-5 feet in diameter, hovering 5 feet above road level about 75 feet ahead of me. at first it appeared stationary and i thought it might be some odd glow from a house light, but as i accelerated west on constitution it began moving ahead of me in apparent unison/speed with my car now up to 20 mph. this 2-lane road cuts through thick, tall trees and passes just one house for approximately 1/4 mile before a 90-degree right turn--and its very dark on lummi island--so once i'd passed that house (and its one porch light) i knew this red light orb couldn't be attributed to any manmade light or reflection. it continued ahead of me on the road, its red light glowing into the trees it passed, for perhaps 20 seconds when--still about 75 feet ahead of my car--it followed the road's path taking a sharp left turn and disappeared behind the trees at that corner. the red glow of its lights increased there, leaving a short trail in its path and bathing the trees on both sides of the road perhaps halfway or further up those tall douglas firs. i accelerated to that corner to try and re-establish visual contact, but it was gone by the time i made the turn which is about 50 feet from the entrance to the tree frog farm's entrance gate. throughout this experience i felt that rush of excitement combined with fear that i might be seeing non-human, at first unsure but then fear rose and goosebumps up my spine when i saw that not only was it moving, but apparently  tracking my speed as it kept the same distance from my car down the road. i wondered if it was possibly the light on the back of very fast bicyclist, or single tail light of a car driving with its headlights off--but when it made that sharp left turn and accelerated like no bike or even fast car could around that corner, i knew it was something else. and that stunned me. i stopped my car well past tree frog farm, where the road cuts through a clearing beside a field about 1/4 mile from my cabin, when i realized i'd lost the red glowing orb. my thoughts raced, and i wondered if there could be any connection between this light's appearance and the fact our discussion group had just been talking about the possibility of ufos on lummi island. one member had been describing her experience of living there many years before when the navy had actually dived to investigate a famous ufo sighting (it had dived into the waters just south of lummi, i believe back in the 60s or 70s. i will never forget that experience (and another i had on lummi a year later, which i'll detail in next submission here). sorry i'm just now reporting it 10 years later, but i just now heard of mufon on coast to coast recently and thought i should mention it.)","distance":"21-100

delivering newspapers.  this is the second of three experiences i am reporting.  it was cold (<30f) and very clear.  this intersection is on a slight hill and downtown tulsa was clearly visible in the distance, at approximately 4+ miles.\r\n\r\ni had stopped to look at the sky and the view of the skyline in the distance, and i was thinking about the sighting i had, appx. six weeks prior.  i looked around and noticed a saucer at around 450 feet altitude, north-north east of me, at 80 above the horizon.  it was approximately 45 feet in diameter, about fist size at arm length.  the edges were sharp and clear enough that i could estimate distance without reference to scale objects nearby.\r\n\r\nthe object was traveling east south east at around 60 mph (50-75 mph) or about the same speed as a car going a bit too fast for city streets.  it was apparently on a course from passing just south of the tulsa airport toward slightly north of downtown tulsa.\r\n\r\ni watched as the object continued at the same altitude and speed toward downtown, at least until it was passing within a few blocks of the city center four+ miles away (4 mi east, 1 mi south), and until it was about 1/2 mile past downtown.  then it abruptly changed direction to probably directly north.  it continued in that direction and at the same altitude for 2 miles, now at about 100 mph, or less than twice the speed at which it originally passed over me.  at about two miles north of downtown, it very abruptly changed direction and speed.  it angled upward to ~40 degrees and suddenly accelerated to at least 4000 mph, and continued on that course and speed until it was no longer visible among the stars.  the estimate of 4000+ mph is based on the fact that it seemed while flying at a 40 degree angle, it covered two miles of terrain in under two seconds.  thus, min. 3600 mph ground speed at 40 degrees climb.\r\n\r\ni was not particularly affected by this sighting, emotionally or psychologically, given, i

was in the street mid-block.  the sky was perfectly clear, no clouds or other obstructions, a few small scattered trees, thick star canopy.  for no particular reason than the sizes of the objects, i noticed directly above me two disks.  i immediately thought \"flying saucers\".  each disk was appx. 45 feet in diameter, convex on the bottom.  they were moving nne directly toward the tulsa airport at appx. 10-15 mph.  they were at 125' altitude, the second directly behind the first at a distance of appx. 60', same altitude.\r\n\r\nthe under surfaces of each pulsed in pale brass color, but with a moderately dull-looking finish (i.E., not shiny).  as the objects passed overhead and neared the horizon, at 25 degrees or so, the upper surface became more visible.  it was also convex.  the upper surface had a whitish dome that remained constant in color--not a bright white, but slightly brighter than the under side brightness.  apart from the dome, the upper side had very little brightness and was greyish in color.\r\n\r\nobjects were completely silent.  i heard nothing, and apparently neither did the numerous dogs in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nmy immediate feeling was that this was a most extraordinary thing to see and i wanted to find others to alert, who could also be witnesses.  as i gave something of a start, as though to go knock on a door, i suddenly became quite calm about the event.  (actually, at no time was i alarmed or frightened, nor do i think i would have been so in any circumstance.)  with this very certain calmness, and still with a very clear head, i decided instead to simply watch these things and \"savor\" this moment.  in retrospect, the sudden dropping away of any excitement was very unusual, and i attribute it now to an effect brought on deliberately by the object and/or its operators.  i watched as the objects flew on at the same speed and very low altitude until they were no longer visible behind the houses and trees in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nwith that same sense of calm and acceptance, i continued on to complete my rounds that morning, then went home to sleep more before going to school (high school, 10th grade).  after a couple of hours of sleep i awoke with a start, fearing i had not done my rounds that morning, but as i bolted upright, i then recalled the morning up until i saw the objects in the sky.  i can remember what i did immediately after they were no longer visible: i continued on for several blocks considering the matter.  but beyond, say, 5 minutes past the event up until i awoke in bed, i can recall virtually nothing at all.\r\n\r\ni am absolutely certain this was not a hallucination and not a dream.  it was impossible for me to have been mistaken in my observation.  my father was a chief instrument mechanic at a local aircraft repair center (spartan), and i had a very thorough knowledge of aircraft and electronic principles at that age.  i had been in airplanes many times, and had seen a variety of airplanes.  for as long as ten years i had been collecting photos of common and exotic airplanes, and my father and i often played at aircraft identification when outside together.  my father eventually went on to become a faa principal in electronics and powerplant, overseeing several major us and foreign airlines.\r\n\r\ni subsequently saw a single object of the same appearance, on

felt this strong need to look at them again last night. i was able to resolve all the problems that had precluded me from viewing them.  i know what i saw and felt and it was something i will never

stepped out of the side door of the house. as i was in a heated debate on the phone, i looked up and noticed something in the distance above the treeline. i stared at it, and as i did so, short bursts of flame began to come from the bottom of the object. the flame would switch from left to right as the object wobbled a bit; as if it was trying to maintain balance. that's when i yelled to my girlfriend to \"go get my camera\". she did, but it took at least 40 seconds for her to do so. as i continued to stare at the object, waiting for my camera, i noticed that the flame at the bottom of the object began to lose it's intensity. as the flame went from a full flame to just a red glow, i noticed that the object was slowly losing altitude, and drifting slowly south east, toward lake michigan. as it dropped below the treeline, i began to run out of the yard and down the street so i can see around that particular treeline. i could, and again, i could see the object. the red glow at the bottom of the object was barely noticeable at this point, and the object began to descend more straight down than southeast and down as it was before. it began to lose altitude faster, until it went below the treeline at that location, which was approximately half a city block to the south of where i was when i first began to record. i waited at this location for about 30 minutes for the object to ascend or reapear, but it never did. while i was recording, i was not looking at the viewfinder; i was just pointing the lens in the direction of the object, so i had no idea if i actually had what i was seeing on the camcorder. but after a discussion with neighbors and others who were present, i went inside, connected the camcorder to the television, and began to view the footage. i've been from that point on, compelled to find out what i saw is. i contacted the local police, military, faa, news stations, etc., trying to find out if they had anything on the radar at that time and area of that day, but.....Nothing; even though i expressed to them all that i had this thing on video!! this incident has not only caused me a great deal of concern, it has changed my life, and challenges many things i believe. i have always been open to the possibility of the existence of such things, but never saw anything that came anywhere near actually convincing me that they are real. all that has changed now though. that thing had no sound whatsoever, it had no wings, and it had no tail end. it looked almost like a giant church bell with a flame at the bottom. had i not recorded what i was seeing, i would have long since just assumed it was something normal, that can be explained. but after viewing this thing in slow motion on zoom, i am convinced that it is not, and can not. i will be attaching a copy of my video with this report (if it will upload). my animus is to have an expert opinion of what it is that is on my video. it was certainly intelligently operated, and it was definitely a mechanical craft of some sort, and not a balloon or anything like that. i for some reason had a feeling of desperation as this thing was descending. it is the same desperate feeling i felt that made me look in that direction and up in the first place when i first noticed the object. i'm left feeling as though whatever it was, it was losing power, running out of fuel, or something to that effect, because it seemed to be struggling to maintain it's altitude. it was a struggle that it evidently lost. the object was moving slowly in the direction of the lake; which leads me to believe that it was attempting to get out over open water. in  fact, it seemed to be trying very diligently to do so. i have no idea if it landed in the water or over land. all i know is it landed or
