the direction which the object came. in the front of my house approx 1 mile away there is a high hill, cliff,or small mountain approx. 420 ft. high and this is the direction which it went.] the ufo flew to the east north east. when i first noticed it i saw a bright light with a red glow around it. i first thought it was a plane, approx 5 seconds later it was a lot closer and brighter .At that point i new it was not a plane. my camera was about 14 ft. away on my dining room table, i keep my camera in a plastic bag, because of dust and dew. i had a bit of a problem getting the camera out of the bag,because of the excitement and the speed of the approaching ufo. by the time i got back outside again the ufo was almost overhead.It had gotten very bright and the red glow had gotten very large.[above i was asked if there was a shaddow, i guess there must have been a shadow becausr it travelled over me, but it all happened so fast and i was trying to get a few pictures i did not notice.]  i then had to remove the dust cap, turn off auto focus, set the lens to infinity. by the time i got the object in the viewfinder, the ufo was going away from me, over the roof of my house. i had shot 2 pictures by this time. the ufo was getting progressively smaller the further it got away from me. i ran into the patio door through the house, out through the front door onto the front deck.It was after getting very small. there was a tree  obstructing my view, i moved to my left to get a better view, but the object disappeared,behind the mountain in front of the house a few seconds later. i did not have time to get another shot.It only took 30 seconds give or take a few seconds from when i first saw the ufo and when it disappeared. the ufo was aprox. 1000 ft. high. almost all the sky was covered with light cloud, but i could see the moon clearly through it. there were patches of heavier cloud.The exposure were taken as canon raws.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

high to be a street light. i stopped my van got out,watched as several other lights begin to rise up from the ground level.They started moving in my direction at 40-50 feet high,they came within 200 ft.From me,i got back in my van and raced down my dirt road to my house.When i got out of the van i seen them coming.I watched them until they stopped overhead and hovered at tree top level.Unnerved, i got back in my van and drove like hell away from there back down my dirt road to the main road.In a paniced state i drove to my friends house about 3 miles away,but he wasn;t home,driving back to my house there was a orange dodge ramcharger driving like a bat out of hell,coming from the direction of my house.As i rounded the curve i seen the lights over the main road,genoa rd.The guy in the ramcharger must have seen them too..Driving about 80 mph i drove under the lights and back to my house.As i drove under the lights they started following me.When i got back to my house i could see them coming, when they came over my property i went in the house and got my guns and came back out.They were hovering over me no more than 50 ft.I could have thrown a rock and hit them.There were 7 white orbs about10-12 ft. wide.I raised my .22 rifle with a scope  and was going to shoot,when i looked thru the scope to shoot,i could see right thru them, and see the stars behind them. as i was ready to pull the trigger, a very strong calming feeling washed over me..And i felt at peace like nothing i've ever felt.I propped my gun against light pole i was standing by, and just watched them for what felt like 10 min. they started leaving, heading in a line towards the full moon.I watched until they were out of sight. when i went back inside my house i looked at the clock and it was 4:30

and i were in an apartment on heritage street in kitchener, ontario when i looked out my southeast-facing balcony to see two bright, red-orange balls of light - one slightly in front of the other - moving from the treeline at the horizon to 15-20 degrees from us. the first thing i noticed was their speed and silence. then, they rotated slightly counter-clockwise and wavered towards each other, so close that their lights almost appeared to touch. they seperated again slightly, and hovered in place. by this time my partner and i were both on the balcony, watching, and then we saw 2 more of the same lights coming from south (rather than southeast), heading towards the first two. it was at this time the first two objects dimmed their lights (or perhaps, rotated the beam away from us) and we clearly saw them as being pitch black, perfectly spherical orbs. we did not see any details like wings, propellers, a tail, etc. they did not leave any trail of light nor did they have a corona. they moved more quickly than airplanes, and occasionally seemed to 'zig-zag' very quickly instead of flying in a perfectly straight line. their movement was especially fast when the first two orbs adjusted their position before hovering.\r\n \r\nin formation, the orbs abruptly stopped hovering in place and ascended straight up, to be quickly lost in the cloud cover.\r\n\r\ni would guess the orbs to be about the size of a helicopter, but it is hard to judge. \r\n\r\nwe called the waterloo regional airport (close by, southeast of us as well) and asked them if they knew anything about the aircraft, and after holding for a short time, the answer we got was a big no.

of the indian river.  directly across the street was a large swampy wildlife preserve with the river directly beyond.  the swampy area contained water deep enough for a kayak, and during a heavy rain even developed white caps.  really a lovely view from our third story deck.  i often liked to go out on the deck to watch the stars.  after living close to philadelphia for so many years, complete darkness to observe the stars was a joy.\r\n\r\nthis particular night i was looking at the stars when suddenly, and i do mean suddenly, a beam of light came out of the night sky and shone on the swamp directly in front of me.  one second no light, the next a bright white light.  our complex was primarily owned by summer folk and they hadn't arrived yet, usually after memorial day they would descend like locusts.  therefore, there were no other townhouses occupied at that time on our street.  we were one of the few year-round residents, hence total darkness.  there was absolutely no sound and no sight of where the light was coming from.  the light covered an area of approximately thirty feet in circumference, coming from an elevation of approximately 200 feet, and was perhaps 100 feet or more in front of me.  i think i was in disbelief for quite a while, then in awe, then wanting to call my husband two stories below to come look, but afraid if i turned away it would be gone.  so i stood tranfixed for about 20 minutes and the light never faultered it's position.  then it was gone, like someone had turned off a switch.  still no sound.  my immediate thought was i had a ufo experience, and i still believe that.  i don't tell too many people about it though.  don't really want to get measured for a white jacket.\r\n\r\ni told my husband the next day and while he listened politely i could tell he thought i'd lost it.  however, that night it was back and i did call him to look.  he was dumfounded.  it only lasted perhaps ten minutes that night and i never saw it again.  i have no evidence, only my experience which i will never forget.\r\n\r\ni was watching a program tonight about a woman who lived near willow grove, pennsylvania in 2008, her sighting, and the ensuing mufon investigation.  it was the beam of light she described that caught my attention and compelled me to send mufon the account of my experience.","distance":"101-500
