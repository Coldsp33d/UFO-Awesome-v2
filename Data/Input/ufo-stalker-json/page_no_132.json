comet/meteor although i have seen many before and this did not have a tail or a fuzzy edge etc.\r\n\r\ni was dumbfounded and immediately contacted some friends with whom i have had many discussions with....One i have witnessed a ufo sighting with.  i was pretty \"hyped\" up for many hours after seeing this thing...It was huge and certainly not venus or .....\r\n\r\ni was able to capture three good pics...Meaning the object appears in all three pics with movement sse to ssw moving across the sky...Across the sun then i honestly could not take my eyes off the first pic after discovering it....By then i was unable to find it/capture it again.  i would say the whole \"passing\" time took just a few minutes....10-15 at the very

worth. just south of joint fighter base, the old carswell afb. saw a blackish greenish plane flying low just above trees to nw. it was flying too slow and low for a normal plane. i watched it for a good 30 sec trying to figure out what it was when it went behind a 15 story building. it reappeared west of building after 10 sec just north of interest 30 approximately 500' above ground. i was focused on it looking for details. no cockpit window or windows at all. i had view of port side which had three rectangle type picture frame outlines down the side. it had a tail section that would be the rudder part but didn't see any wing structures on tail or otherwise. maybe it was too low or my angle for me to see them? then, it stopped in mid air in place for about a three count. then rotated 90 degrees, in place on it's tail so now it's like a rocket on launch pad. hung there for another three count then took off straight up and within one body length of itself vanished. just disappeared. no sound, no con trail, nothing. my mouth dropped open and i started looking at other cars and driver's seeing if anyone else was looking up like me. \r\nthe whole time the plane was lightly shaking like two magnets do when you put common poles facing each other.\r\n\r\nlater i talked to an flight instructor at the base, he is also an x air force 1 pilot. i saw his air force 1 license. i told him my story and he told me to look up the aurora. i did and the pic is close but not correct with what i saw. i spoke with him again and told him the pic is not correct. he pulled it up on his phone and we looked at it. i told him like the pic there was no cockpit window. he said because it's a drown because it travels mock 10 humans can't handle it. i pointed out the pic didn't have the rectangle frames on the side. he said they were on the other side. which would work because the pic was of the starboard side. i ask him what the engine was and he said he didn't know. i said i thought it was magnetic of some sort because the way it shimmered and the moves it made. he looked at me like i was either a total idiot or i guessed it, i don't know?","distance":"101-500

brighter in the center and faded towards their edges.  they were moving quickly in a regular pattern with 180° instantaneous direction reversals. some were tracking the same path, and others had

then in an instant, they all merged into a triangular pattern with three lights only. they stay this way for about 10 minutes and then resumed the  traveling patterns. after another 10 minutes or so, they resumed the triangle formation.  one or two of these lights would flash on and off rapidly while traveling.  after another 10 minutes, they begin the traveling  patterned and then, in an instant, united as one  lyte, this time in a completely different location. whenever they stop their movement, they united always at the edge of a cloud, imperceptible if you were not looking for them. the incident lasted for at least 30 minutes. at their final resting place at the edge of a cloud they slowly faded away over about 15 seconds.  by the way, at one point i went inside to get my phone to

area approximately 20 miles northeast of raleigh, nc near the town of wake forest. my daughter had been over for dinner and as she was getting ready to leave i escorted her outside to her car. we were standing outside carrying on a conversation when, in the distance, i heard the approaching sound of a helicopter. as i looked toward the sound i see the lights of the helicopter approaching. and by the way they were blue. i would say first off that often it is hard to discern how far away an object is in the sky. sometimes objects are farther away than they might initially appear. but i could clearly see the helicopter and it was facing broadside to me as we were watching it. and at this point the helicopter was hovering---i'd say perhaps for maybe twenty seconds or so. it then began to turn to the right towards our position and began to accelerate very rapidly. i would also note that the helicopter seemed to be a rather large, twin rotor aircraft. my sense was that it was military. and i could plainly see blue lights both fore and aft on the helicopter. one thing that struck me was that the helicopter was flying extremely fast for something with rotors.\r\n  but as the helicopter passed by us i exclaimed to my daughter, \" that helicopter is chasing something. \r\n  so, my best observation of what i saw was something like a yellow round, faintly glowing orb or ball way out in front of the helicopter that it was trying to catch up to. and as we were following the helicopter going by us left to right we could see the moon in the distance.And only because at that moment the moon was lighting the sky could we see what the helicopter was chasing-----a massive black craft or, rather, what i would describe as an oval shaped craft much larger than a commercial airliner, perhaps the size of two thirds of a football field. the craft was not completely round but more of an oval shape. we could clearly see it although the sighting lasted only four or five seconds. there were no wings and absolutely no sound from it, the only sound being from the helicopter. i would estimate the helicopter was four to five hundred yards behind the craft.\r\n  here's another observation, really just a gut feeling that the helicopter was chasing the craft as opposed to escorting it. i don't know why but that's just the sense i had. i think probably because they were both traveling at such a high rate of speed","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Hovering then
