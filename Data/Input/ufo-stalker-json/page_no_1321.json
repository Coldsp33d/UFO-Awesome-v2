States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was outside on the front porch having a cigarette. i came to notice the light very quickly, as we have a very wide, unobstructed view over the poway valley from our home in the hills. the light was bright; equivalent to a xenon automobile headlight in the night sky from 2-4 miles away, and changing color in a random (to the best of my knowledge, random) manner. i did not see the structure of an object, just the light emanating from it. i was visiting my parents at the time, and asked my mother to step outside with me to witness this very unique spectacle. she stood with me for ten of the fifteen minutes that i was watching the object.\r\n\r\nthe object moved swiftly over the town center, about four miles away from the spot where is was witnessed. it rapidly ascended, descended, did loops, sped up to striking high rates of speed, and made swift turns. the light continued to change color and remained at a similar intensity regardless of what direction it was moving. i was awe-struck by the rapidity of the ascensions, as the object would move from approximately 20 feet above the ground (relative to the floor of the valley) to over 1400 feet (relative to sea level, using a known landmark mountain as a reference point) in just a few seconds. there was no sound coming from the object. familiarity with the topography of the valley and a known reference point; black mountain, standing at 1558 feet, were used to calculate approximate distances. the object swept across the valley at speeds of approximately 60 miles per hour, ascending and maneuvering at this maximum speed. there were short periods where the object would dive low and hover, then rapidly ascend to the maximum height from which it was witnessed, +15 degrees over black mountain, which is about ten miles from the home; the home itself stands at about 660 feet above sea level.\r\n\r\nmy mother stated that she thought the lights (white, pressurized sodium) on the ground over a community park were brighter than normal in comparison to other nights, i disagreed and suggested that we check the next night to see if that was true. we could not reach consensus about the ground lights near the community park, i felt they were about the same intensity the next night. we both agreed that there was some sort of conventional explanation and didn't pursue the issue further. neither of us have been able to determine what it was and we have not seen it again since.\r\n\r\nwe agreed that the turns and maneuvers were not possible in an airplane or model, and that a model helicopter would not be able to bank or ascend so rapidly like we witnessed. so here i am, just over a year later, wondering exactly what it was we saw that night. i am certain of the date and time, i recorded it for later reporting. i witnessed this event from 2215-2230 and went inside the house after this, as neither of us had the time or energy to pursue an explanation. i hope to know some day what it was that we witnessed over the valley in the night sky.","distance":"Over One

bright light like a star to the north.  it got brighter and dimmer and i could see the colors blue and red.  i drove closer to it, then i handed my phone, which has a camcorder, to my son and turned the car left so my kids could see it.  at that point i lost sight of it, but it must have approached the car very quickly, because my kids said it was over the car.  they were frightened.  [at this point] we were by the park in hinckley.  there���s also an elementary school park; it was not that park.

many nights just gazing at the stars looking for unusual objects. i've seen hundreds of satellites moving slowly across the night sky. i've seen the space station as light reflected off of it from the sun as it moved across the sky. i used to see them more frequently living on a farm in cross plains, texas. now living in the city the lights keep me from seeing such a large number of stars and planets, but on some nights the visibility is good. on several occasions recently i've see what i initially thought was a satellite moving across the sky only to see it make a complete u turn and head the opposite direction and i've seen small dimly lit objects moving in different directions across the night sky changing speeds but nothing i could say for sure it was a ufo. \r\n\r\nlast night i was having a hard time sleeping, so at 4:00 am i got up and went out to the front porch, it was a good clear night. when i first stepped outside i look across the street toward the western sky where i frequently see bright planets and stars, but when i looked up this time i immediately saw this very bright circular object, it was a bright as a car head lamp at one block away. it didn't cast a beam, it glowed brightly. i first thought to myself wow that is the brightest planet i've ever seen, not even thinking about ufo's. as i stood there for a few seconds it started moving away from me, so i sort of ran toward the road to get a  better view. as i did this, the light started to dim until all that was left was a round transparent sphere. it looked like a clear glass ball in the sky. as it kept moving away it slowly disappeared out of sight. i actually stood there for a few minutes with my mouth wide open staring at the sky. this was like nothing i've seen before. it was big and bright and made no sound. i didn't see any air traffic around for several minutes. i know the patterns the planes take as they approach the airports or take off. i also see fighter jets as they take off from carswell, they usually fly very high once they get this far. this object was within our atmosphere. hard to tell how high but to guess 5,000 ft or less.  at that height i would guess it was 300 feet

moving between floydada in floyd county and matador in motley county just after 10:30 pm. we had stopped in floydada for gas at 10:25 pm. i was driving the speed limit of 75 mph with the cruise control on. \r\nit was very dark because there was a new moon. my husband, first saw the red lights to the south of the highway. it was a huge field of bright sequentially blinking bright red lights and it was a little ahead of our position. \r\nmy husband said to me \"look at all those bright red lights. it doesn't look like any kind of airfield i've ever seen, besides this is floydada. no airfields this large around here.\" then i looked and commented that i didn't think airfields had rows of bright red blinking lights. then he said \"they are blinking sequentially.\" \r\nwe were only about a few of miles outside floydada heading east. there were about 60 to 100 of these red lights in horizontal rows blinking simultaneously about a mile in length and about tree height above the plains. then suddenly we noticed that we were alongside parallel to the field of red lights, just about in the middle. my husband was telling me excitedly about this as i looked over and saw the same thing. it was parallel with us. \r\na few minutes after seeing the red light field become parallel to us, we then saw 6 to 10 bright white vertical lights appear within the red light field flashing upward in sequence. however, the white light \"pillars\" were not in sinc with the red lights. these vertical white lights continued for several minutes and then vanished.  \r\nsince i was driving, my husband kept his eyes on the objects. i was looking as much as possible. the objects traveled parallel with us for about 10 to 15 miles continuously then slowed a bit so we were ahead about a quarter mile or so. then suddenly they were back parallel to us. \r\nby now we were discussing how we were certain that this was and event like nothing either of us had ever encountered before and that these were something unknown and extraordinary. we were not afraid and did not have any feeling of urgency or anything. i wanted to pull over and watch but my husband was so tired and wanted to continue home. \r\nthen, however, another large object just appeared in front of the red light field. it was a round object, not a sphere but a very large circle or large cylindrical shape, flat on top and bottom, out in front of the field of red lights still blinking simultaneously. the round object had several rows of bright white light panels rotating around it. it appeared to be rotating slowly. this was all totally bazaar!\r\nthese followed along parallel to us for another 10 miles or so until we came to the canyons of the cap-rock off the plains where the highway cut into the canyons and blocked the view.\r\nwe both think and talk about this almost constantly. it was incredible to see such a thing! we had to tell you about this.\r\ni am an amateur painter and i am attempting to paint the scene. i won't be able to do it justice.  \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile,

years old while my buddy was 16 or so. their was an entire community that witnessed it and a video exists with a neighbor but not currently available to me. my friend and i were playing basketball on my driveway when we noticed a translucent string above my house. it was stretched tight from west to east, and about no more than 6-8 feet above my one story house. we got on our roof to see it closer and it was like fishing string, translucent. my friends family came outside to see what we were doing on the roof and we explained the situation to them. they got their video camera and began filming. a neighbor across the street came out and saw the string also and asked where it came from. we explained from atop the roof it appeared to be coming from the beach area (west). he got in his truck and left to search for the origins of the string; by now more neighbors were outside. meanwhile, we noticed the string elevated slightly (about five degrees) east towards a two story christian school behind my backyard (about 50 to 75 yards away). we went to the school and climbed on it's roof to get a better look to see how far the string went east. surprisingly, when we got on the roof of the building we were astonished to find the string shot straight up, angled at about 100 degrees straight up (it was almost perfectly perpendicular to the roof top). we squinted our eyes as best as possible to see how far the string shot up and what it was attached to (a kite or balloon we thought). we noticed high above their existed a hovering dark object, about the size of this letter \"o\". it was a clear blue day but the object was too high to see much detail. as we stared at it the object a bit longer, maybe 10 minutes or so, we noticed the object ejected another object. the ejected object circled like a satellite around the main object for a few minutes, maybe five. then the ejected object slowly traveled (i want to say north east, maybe east) while the original object remained hovering still, and then it too disappeared. i remember being so shocked at what i was witnessing i completely forgot about the string. i didn't notice if the string disappeared with the hovering objects, or earlier, but it too was no longer to be found. i think this event is unique because i've never heard anyone talk about ufo's and weird physics defying string. i'm hoping others have witnessed something similar to this event. i don't know why i'm barely coming out with this but i guess we had nobody to report it to back then and newspapers would not have taken our story. now, with the internet, and my recent discovery that your organization exists, it just seemed appropriate. ps i'm a math teacher.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

driveway just outside my garage door. i was looking to my right, when a bright light in the sky caught my eye. i looked up and saw two glowing objects moving west to east, maybe 1500-2000 feet high. i then saw a third similar object quickly approach the other two, also from the west. the object to my right rapidly accelerated, passed the first unit and took the lead. the three objects then flew in a \"v\" formation. at this time they were directly overhead. they passed over the house and continued east. as i turned my head back to the west, three more objects, identical to the first three, quickly approached from the west in the same path as the first three, also flying in a \"v\" formation. i listened for sound closely for sound, and heard nothing. i also could not detect any vapor trail, etc. behind the objects.\r\nwhen i first saw these objects i said \"holy crap,\" and just watched.\r\njust as the second group of objects were passing overhead, i could hear a prop plane in the distance. i began scanning the sky for it's lights but couldn't see it. i wondered if the pilot saw the same thing i did. \r\nthen, from the east, the plane flew overhead, along the same flight path as the two sets of objects. in my mind, i couldn't see how the pilot could have missed them. the plane i saw was fling slow, maybe 100-140 mph, at approximately the same altitude as the objects i saw. the plane appeared to be black, no wing tip lights, but did have a dimly lit tail light. the plane was a single engine prop and reminded me of a cessna 172 (which i used to fly), but was a little larger. the plane continued west.\r\nin the instant i saw the first two objects, i thought \"meteorite.\" but i immediately realized they weren't because of the color, size and speed of them. next, i thought \"ufo\" and thought they could have been military test flights or perhaps extra-terrestrial. i wasn't really frightened, but i remained very still as they all passed over.\r\ni wish i had a camera at the time. now, two days later, i'm still thinking of the event, and felt that i needed to tell someone about it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
