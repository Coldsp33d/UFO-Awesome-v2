yards. it is a completely clear and calm night and the stars are bright and easy to see. \r\n\r\ni live directly beneath jetway j8 or j6 at (30*07'26.27\" n) (82*38'18.90\"w)\r\nand noticed 5 airliners in rout heading south west away from my back door like always approximately 35,000 feet give or take 5,000? so i know at least 1 or 2 of these airliners should have seen this also. \r\n\r\nas i'm standing out back looking southwest watching the airliners fly over and i noticed to my left a really bright star only that star is moving then i noticed it somewhat began to dim to a dark blue then got bright as a landing light then dimmed to the color of a normal star then dark blue again where i all most lost it and repeated this sequence 4 more time. \r\n\r\nas all this is happening i'm trying to put together what am i seeing? first i thought it was a plane then satellite and maybe it's the sun hitting it under the horizon and then it got to my 2 o'clock and just instantaneously stopped and blended in with the surrounding stars!!! \r\n\r\ni didn't take my eyes away from it for over 30 seconds and it was just sitting still then i started to question if i was still looking at the same thing doubting i really just saw what i saw so i started to scan the sky again to try and regain sight of it. then another light that looked like a landing light caught my eye at my 11 o'clock taking the exact same path only faster it seemed. \r\n\r\nnow this is where it gets scary. when the second one gets to the point where i lost the first one that blended into the stars the one i lost brightened back up and instantly matched the second ones speed and directly fell in behind the second one and following it out of sight and seemed to change directions to the north east?\r\n\r\nthe colors i noticed were star white. dark blue and bright halogen bulb yellow like a landing light or reflection from the sun off something metallic. they were the exact size of a normal star just looking up at night.\r\n\r\nthis all happened in under two minutes and guessing if it had been continuous it would have crossed the horizon well under a minute. the airliners take 3 or 4 minutes from the time i can see them directly overhead. i could hear the airliners overhead but not the lights i were seeing. they had to be well over 70,000 feet if they were even in the atmosphere at all?\r\n\r\ni've had a pilots license 20 years this november so i have a little knowledge of what i'm seeing when i look up and i've never seen anything like what i saw last night so if anyone could please explained to me what i might have seen please feel free to contact me i'd love to hear your theory's.

have a ultralight airplane licence. i am very capable of making the difference between a commercial airplane strobe, its landing beam, a satellite, a military jet, a meteorite or common stars. what i have seen crossing the sky this day i have never seen it before or since.\r\ni got up early this day and went outside my house to smoke a cigarette. the sky was crystal clear and since there's no big cities around where i live one can appreciate watching stars at night with no artificial light pollution. it happens that i was looking west since the deck outside my house is oriented this way. that's how i've spotted a very bright object (much brighter than the surrounding stars) coming from this direction. there's the greensboro airport not far away from winston salem and sometimes and depending on the wind direction one can spot commercial or private jets making their approach. but they 're easily identifiable since they're flying way under 500 knots with all lights on : landing beam, strobe and green and red wings lights and the noise can not be misled for something else. \r\nnothing of the sort for the object i have seen. the light emitted was too bright for a landing beam and the speed way above a commercial jet even at cruising speed. \r\nthe altitude was very high in the sky although difficult to estimate in the beginning of my observation. i would say higher than a commercial jet and lower than a satellite\r\nso at first i thought it was a satellite. but i had to change my mind when i saw that the object was pulsating from the higher brightness that made me spot it in the first place to zero light emitted in a cycle of 4 of 5 seconds then returning to high brightness etc. there was clearly a pattern to it and it was not a strobe and usually the satellites reflecting sunlight on their solar panel have a constant brightness. besides it was too big to be a satellite. so in the end of the day i don't know what i've seen that night.","distance":"Over One

packed up and where heading home.  we had come up in two suv vehicles so on the way back i was driving alone. we were going to meet up in evanston at a restaurant to eat before the last push to where we lived in utah. my two buddys where in the frist suv and i was following them.  as we reached highway i noticed several deer just eating grass on the side of the highway.  i slowed down to look at the deer amazed that after a week of hunting not seeing any deer worth taking there large groups so close to the road.  i was looking to see if there were any bucks but all i could see was doe's. when i looked up my buddys suv was not in front of me the road was very curvy so i figured he was just out of sight but he could not have been more the 30 seconds ahead of me.  i was pushing it a little trying to catch up to them but it was very dark with no moon up, and the road has not very straight.  most of the time there was nothing on both side of the road but woods.  somewhere near the wyoming border i am not sure exactly which side, i had just came out of a slight right curve my radio went out, followed by my jeep suv beginning to slow down like my truck had just be shut off in neutral.  then from the field to my back right a huge bright light came on like a spot light.  i remember turning to look at the light and then the light fading.  i remember turning around and realizing the suv had stopped rolling and was dead. i remember looking around not seeing any thing but the dark night, then the truck lights slowly came on.  i was confused and scared.  i started the jeep and just wanted to get away.  i remember driving as fast as i could for about another 20 minutes or so to get to evanston.  when i arrived at the restaurant where my friends were already seated and there food was coming out. they told me they had been there for 25-30 minutes and asked me what talk me so long and gave me a hard time for driving so slow.  i told them about the light but when they started giving me a hard time i just dropped it.  this event has stayed with me very clearly over the years, i have told some of my close family and one or two friends.  one friend of mine that i told brought it up in front of other friends to embrace me. so i really have just kept this to myself.  they reason i am reporting this is when i came home today my son was watching a show on tv about a family

and then i noticed movement and it came closer and got bigger. i then thought this has to be a plane, until it got brighter and was making no sound. you can usually hear a plane either as it's passing over or after it has past overhead. this made no sound at all. it was weird. i ran into the house to get my iphone and caught it going away from me.\r\n\r\nunreal! 4th sighting in my area since last year!\r\n\r\nvideo sent to mufon contact.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

out of the corner of my left eye i saw an object and then looked directly up. it was about the size of 3 quarters side by side. black with swirls/stripes of dark brown. at first for the first few seconds it was a round ballon shape then looked like a butter bean. if you look at the side profile of a bean and it was heading from left to right, the left side/back of it slightly dipped down and picked up speed. i would imagine it was about 40-100 feet above us. we continued to watch it as it flew directly east slowly rising in altitude picking up speed very smoothly. i would guestimate about 15-20 sec later it rose smoothly and fast to a higher elevation. i wondered why and then saw an airplane come into my view traveling from south to north that i assume was landing at denver international airport. in my opinion it rose in elevation to miss the airplane. it was 2 quarters higher than the airplane at the time. the airplane passed behind some trees and the object continued its path into the eastern distance and disappeared into a little pin dot. i felt a surrealness come over me, an awakening once i first saw it slightly tilt back. i believe i saw an object i cannot explain other than as i have wrote here.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Path with

next morning and we were to leave around 4:30. i was restless because the house was hot and i cannot sleep while i am hot. i cracked open the window and set the tv sleep timer on. i stayed awake well after the tv turned off (10 pm). i have always had a habit of sleeping with my head partially underneath the covers and my eyes peaking out for some reason and i think this night explained why. i saw a light come into the room (i was facing the wall underneath the covers at this point still). i slowly rotated trying to not disturb the blankets for fear of what i might see in the room. i had a very uneasy feeling. i started to sweat like crazy and was struck with fear once i turned over. i saw a dark figure standing at my bed side. it had a large head and skinny appendages and thin body. i could not able to move once i saw it. it stood there for a long time watching me. i could not yell or move. i was only 3 feet away from. dare i move and let it know i was awake? i think not. i stayed there calm (still sweating) and scared. i eventually hit the point of exhaustion and passed out. i woke up the next morning tangled in the blankets soaked with sweat and tears.\r\n\r\na year later i decided to bring this up to my mom. before i even finished telling her about the green light, she filled in the rest of the story. she had said the same thing had happened to her when she was about my age. this made me no longer think it was a dream.\r\n\r\ni started thinking about the event. i remembered a prior incident. i had a dream i was falling from the sky and landed on my bed. however, i woke from this dream by hitting my bed hard and bouncing off of it. i was confused as can be. it made me start to wondering if anything else has happened before...","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":48076,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.5212402,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06112013-0032","longitude":-105.8605001,"occurred":928998000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New
