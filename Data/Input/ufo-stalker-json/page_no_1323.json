upwards. i looked up and saw a star like object directly over head. pretty far up maybe the height regular planes fly when traveling to another state.It was still a bright day outside. there were clouds out but there were no clouds in the region of the ufo. i thought to myself \"hmmm this must be what a ufo looks like. but the only way for me to really know is for it to disappear.\" i was still walking while observing this. as i came from underneath the tree the star was gone.\r\n\r\ni had now stopped in my path. i decided to look up for a while, the object reappeared... it was turning invisible to visible like someone was playing with the fade to transparent but on photoshop but in in real life. i observed this for 10 mins. \r\n\r\nat the brightest section of that \"fade adjusting\" it was bright like a star. it looked like it was reflecting the sunlight. it was silver in color like aluminum.\r\n\r\nat the mid of the fade i could actually see the shape and of the craft.\r\n\r\nthe craft faded away. i started back towards the bus stop. upon reaching the buss stop 10mins or so went by as i wondered and replayed the event in my head. the idea of recording it with my phone also dawned on me too. sadly every time i took it out to record the event the ufo would turn fully invisible. another couple mins would go by and it would come out again and this proceeded a couple times until i gave up trying to record it.Another star like object was on the horizon. i did not realize when it may of popped up or if it had been there the whole time. at this time the sun was starting to set and the color of the sky was of a orange hue. so at this point i believed it to be an actual star. until it started to fade in and out again. \r\n\r\ni noticed that clouds around the object were being sucked up. i observed this for a while more than 10mins this time. until it completely disappeared and didnt re appear. \r\n\r\nthe buss was late by the way as expected....\r\n\r\ni saw another star like object but this time it was south west heading east. this one could of been a plane but it had the same steady bright silver star like color as the other ones. it was also traveling pretty fast compared to planes in my opinion. it seemed like it was heading my direction.\r\n\r\nit disappeared and i realized the buss was just down the street....\r\n\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\ndidn't know of mofun till the movie sirius aired. even then ive seen so many ufo i didn't think it was relevant to list the events.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

still very clear in my mind because it was unusual and i could not explain it. after a quick summer rainstorm early one evening, my brother and i were perched on the hood of his 1971 plymouth duster which was parked on the street and were each drinking a beer. we were facing north up the street when two spheres appeared over the horizon to the north. these spheres roughly followed the road. they passed overhead and we lost sight of them as they fell below the horizon to the south. they were probably in sigh for 60 seconds or so, give or take 20 seconds. what was unusual was the constant speed (not a high speed, but not slow either, maybe 40-50 mph but hard to say without reference points) at which they both moved, in parallel, and in a straight line. it was difficult to tell how high they were, but they were under the disapating cloud cover remaining fron the storm, maybe 1000-1500 feet. they were unaffected by the wind which was blowing at ground level at 10-15 mph. there was no sound, no light, no emissions coming from the spheres. it was difficult to judge their size as they were not near other objects for any reference point and their height was unknown, but a rough estimate is 25-30 feet in diameter. from the ground, the size appeared to be that of baseballs. they did not seem to be reflecting light (nneded to check to submit), as their silver/aluminum color did not vary. i am writing this to you at this time because y'all may have encountered something similar in your research and i would like to know what these spheres might have been. at first we though they may have been weather balloons, but we ruled these out because of the constant speed and straight line motion. i am interested in your thoughts and whether you have any other similar sightings. year of observation could have been 1975-1978, date sometime in mid-late summer. thanks.","distance":"101-500

and glanced up, watching birds.  something shiny caught my attention and i looked up and saw a sphere approaching from the west.  at first i thought the sun was simply reflecting off of it, but it was too bright and as it moved the light didn't waver as it would have were it merely reflecting light.\r\n\r\nmy first thought was that it reminded me of a satellite in the night sky.  the way it moved, the single, unwavering light, and no sound.  but of course it wasn't a satellite.\r\n\r\nour house is surrounded by tall trees.  the object skimmed over the treetops; perhaps about 35 to 40 feet above them.  there was absolutely no noise coming from it.\r\n\r\ni looked away as i went down the steps towards the garbage can, then looked back up as i stepped onto the yard.  it was finally dawning on me this was not something you look away from.  it was now going over the house, still shining brightly like a powerful light bulb.  it was moving along at a pretty good clip; maybe about 40 to 45 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nlost sight of it for a second as it disappeared behind some treetops, but i trotted to the driveway and it came back into view for another couple of seconds, still heading easterly, before it again disappeared behind treetops.  it would have gone over my neighbor's house next, but only because its path seemed to be following the road rather than heading in a strict eastern direction.  it's path was bending slightly north as it made its way across our property and disappeared from view, as does the road.\r\n\r\nthe south side of the road ~ which i live on and which the object was flying over ~ is fairly heavily treed as opposed to the north side, which is more open farm field.\r\n\r\nit occurred to me after the object disappeared that this was likely just a drone used by law enforcement, but as i pondered the event it seems to me that drones are typically used for spying, which requires stealth.  so why would it be emitting light, and a very bright one at that?  furthermore, i've looked at many pictures of drones and none look like this object.  additionally, the speed was surprising.  it was moving considerably fast and again, i'm not sure

night conversing, talking about various subjects and observing the night sky when all of a sudden a orange orb just appeared out of the sky at a distance from us, moved closer to us and began to descend closer to the tree tops, hovered in position for 20 seconds, changed direction several times and hoved in place again, then changing direction with it's position and altitude and then disappeared. my freind and i both continued our conversation and then after 2 minutes the orb reappeared, this time from a different position in the night sky from where it had originally appeared and began to perform a series of airial movements. at this point my freind and began to speak abpout what we were actually seeing, as this orange reddish colored orb made absolutely no audible sound that we could detect. we both simized that it was not an airplane based on the actual movements of the object, so i thought it could have been a helicopter. my freind went into the house and grabbed her high powered field binocculars and we started examining this object. i could not see any other structure pertaining to this object except the orange orb, which seemed to be spinning around the circumference of the orb its'elf. we both watched as this orb made abrupt stops, turns, accelrations, decensions and ascentions in the sky. i could not beleive this might possibly be an actual ufo, because at that time i really did not believe in them. as the object was overhead i took the binocculars and tried to trace from the orb to the ground to see if this was some kind of possible projection from another location. my friend and i did not see anything like that, after watching this object perform these manuevors for approximately 3 to 5 minutes, it ascended into the air extremely rapidly and disappeared again, not fading away, it just vanished. so sure enough after about 1 to 2 minutes it appeared again, so this time i went in the house and grabbed my wife and all 3 of us stood hear watching this object play around in the sky for about another 5 to 7 minutes, before disappearing for the last time. in all i guess we observed this object for a total length of about 13 to 20 minutes visable in the sky. this then prompted me to inquire if others had seen this object and i saw 1 other person had seen this object and sent in inquiry into a local hagerstown

2013\r\ntime: 9:50 pm local, dusk \r\nweather: mostly clear, scattered alto cumulus.  according to the weather network: ceiling 8,400 ft., ground wind 10km/h from sw, 10 celcius\r\ncamera:  nikon d7000 dslr, nikon 70-300mm vr lens set at 300mm, manually focused, video at highest quality setting.\r\n\r\ni was in my back-alley driveway picking up raspberry sticks i had pruned earlier that evening, when i noticed four or five very bright, flickering, reddish-orange lights moving just above, behind and beside the tops of nearby spruce trees, at about 45 degrees elevation, south-south-east.\r\n\r\n\"fire balloons (aka. chinese lanterns),\" i thought for a second.  \"cool.\"\r\n  \r\nthey were close together; the group at first sight covering a spread of about 5 degrees.  however, as i watched, i saw they were quickly fanning out, each moving on individual horizontal or downward vectors.  my impression was that i had just missed seeing the objects being launched or emerging from a single spot.  the trees started to block my view, vexingly preventing an exact count, but four were in sight at the same time for sure.  there may have been a fifth object.\r\n \r\ni suddenly realized they were not balloon lanterns!  first, the colour was wrong (reddish orange, not the usual whitish yellow). second, they were all very bright (initially), at least a bright as airliner landing lights.  third, they were quickly spreading out, not trailing along together.  fourth, they flickered too wildly.  fifth, and most tellingly, at least three of these objects were travelling into the wind at a fairly rapid rate. i should add here that, in the quiet of late evening, i heard no sound from these objects and saw no blinking navigation lights.\r\n\r\nso, after a few seconds of observation, i realized i had orange orb ufos in sight (for the third time in the last 2 years: once in amsterdam--april, 2011; twice in edmonton--dec., 2012 and this day.)  i ran for my photography equipment, nowadays almost always at hand for just such an unusual occasion.  i have seen other anomalous flying objects, but visually recorded only one once before.  my nikon d7000 dslr with 70-300mm vr lens was on a small table in the open garage and the tripod was on the backyard deck.  in about twenty seconds i had the camera and tripod setup in a spot with the best visibility (on the deck, which is elevated).  by this time, only two objects were were still in sight, now due south, my view of the other two or three presumably blocked by the trees.  actually, a third, dimmer object was also in view, but i didn't see it at all until i watched the video later.\r\n  \r\ni recorded three video clips, one each from my deck, driveway, and back-alley, moving to keep the subject in view.   my personal feelings while recording were those of urgency and technical concern (to get the ufos on video) mixed with contained excitement and a certain amount of eerie awe at viewing alien technology in person.  i felt no unusual physical or psychological sensations nor were there any noticeable electromagnetic anomalies.  my attention was split between viewing the objects as closely as possible and the process of operating the camera.  caught up in this dual preoccupation, and with every second precious, i completely forgot about the binoculars i also keep handy.  i also neglected to take some still frames.  video was all i had in mind at the time.  \r\n \r\nto my naked eye, the objects looked like single, orange, disk-like blobs with a reddish, wildly irregular, upward flickering.   they looked very similar to an object/light i had videoed this past winter.  in that case, the object was further away, and i had only a short focal length lens on the camera, hand-held at night.  this time, i had closer objects, a tripod, a tele-zoom lens on my dslr and the sky was not completely dark.  as interesting as watching the lights was, it wasn't until i viewed the video clips on a monitor that i saw any shape or detail.\r\n \r\nin clip one, taken from the deck, there are three objects, two objects are brightly lit, the third very dimly lit.   all the objects are defying the wind, which is from the south-west.  the lowest object rapidly drops from view, dimming as it does so, descending and or heading south-south-west away from me.  in that direction is our city's river valley, a small zoo, some large parks, and forested trails. the remaining bright object moves west, from left to right nearly horizontally.   it appears to subtly adjust course as it moves.  a third, dim, unseen-by-my-eye object enters the top left of the frame just before i stop recording, following the object going west.  i didn't notice this third object until i had viewed the clip many times, so fixated was my attention on the brighter object.\r\n \r\nthe second clip is taken from the driveway. the object looks bigger, closer in the second clip, so, from when i first saw it, it seems to have changed course somewhat more to the north, toward me.  also, it seems to have brightened or more completely illuminated itself compared to the first clip.  while recording the second clip, i checked the focus briefly as it looked fuzzy/blob-ish on the camera's small live-view screen.   oh, and the objects (and the scene in general) appear darker to a degree in the video than it was in reality, owing to the equipment's limitations in low-light.   to my eye, the object was a very bright, flickering light, whereas the video revealed it was in fact a glowing, seemingly irregular cylinder with the brightest light emitting from the base.\r\n \r\nin clip three, the object appears to move in a slightly winding, serpentine motion, noticiable if you zip the clip back and forth quickly.  while recording clip three in the back alley, a passing dog-walker distracts me and i loose sight of the object as it goes behind a pole. i wait for it to reappear, but, to my unaided eye, it has disappeared in the gloom. so i stop recording after a moment or two in order to move the camera yet again.  however, i don't see or record anything further.  i didn't mention to the dog-lady that i had a ufo sighting in progress because the ufo was fading and going behind the pole.\r\n\r\nupon reviewing clip three on a monitor, i was surprised to see that the object did indeed reappear from behind the pole,  but it had dropped its illumination so substantially i couldn't see it in the deeply twilit sky.   had i seen it, i would have been able to capture another 10 seconds or so of \"flight\".\r\n\r\ni am pleased and impressed by what i saw and the footage i captured.  i have familiarised myself, through study and direct observation, with the usual things commonly mistaken for ufos.  i can attribute nothing natural or human-made to my sighting on may 3, 2013.  \r\n ","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

flying south but as i watched it i noticed it was heading in a more southeast direction. it was going at what seemed to be a constant and relaxed speed, a bit slower than planes usually fly but not by much. a few times it looked as if it turned slightly transparent or invisible but the lights stayed the same, it was under cloud cover so i don't think clouds were the culprit. it was completely silent and any plane or jet flying that low would have made noise. i felt calm and intrigued as i watched it. it certainly didn't seem like anything to be afraid of. i was going to get a video of it

toward the rear. \r\nbut the sky is overcast (rained all day) and the object was below the cloud cover.  \r\n\r\nthe object wasn���t perfectly round, nor oval, nor did it have a long tail. it did seem to have almost a ���bullet with wings��� shape, as it passed more sidelong to us, like the flame was forming some kind of small ���wings���.  they weren���t wings, but the flame, the closer it got, spread out in a short winged shape\r\n\r\nthe object seemed to curve to the ne. \r\n \r\n it appeared to be a deep orange as it went out of sight to the northeast.\r\n\r\n\r\ni did run to grab my camera and have it on video, though not sure of the quality.  \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

to wards were it had come from ( direction) , then i ran into house for my phone ( i would nt have run for anything else as just recovering for a lung collapse ) when i tryed to take a pic my mobile

pictures. it was probably around 2 or 3 in the afternoon.  my camera is a digital nikon.  when i uploaded the photos, i noticed a small cylindrical object behind an airplane. at the time i took the picture, i hadn't noticed either one. i take my pictures so that they upload very large & i reduce their size by 80 to 85%. when i went to reduce this picture, i noticed the object.  there was a golf tournament in nearby memphis and i observed a blimp in the sky the day after this happened, but it looked very obviously like a blimp. this object in my picture does not have the 'under carriage' you see on a blimp and the size seems wrong.  i played around with the picture & made it even larger and inverted the colors and the object is obviously there. pictures taken in the same area of the sky within a few minutes of the same time this picture was taken do not show anything there, airplane or otherwise.  i reduced the size of the picture to about what it was when i uploaded it and reversed the color inversion so that is back to normal.  it is not a bird, or another airplane; i do not know what this is, which by my understanding makes it a

lane of highway 65. i first noticed the formation as it descended over the eastbound lane of highway 10 aprox. 600 yards from the front of my vehicle. initially, the polk st. bridge (north to south) obstructed my vision but the craft were still visible as i approached. if you are familiar with the area, they would have passed over the food and fuel on 85th ave. and highway 65 southbound just before descending in front of me and possibly 8 other vehicles heading eastbound. there were 2 vehicles astride two more vehicles at the same level, but the 2 farthest from me lagged behind about 10 feet or half of a vehicle. so, the 2 nearest to me were about half of a vehicle forward of the other 2 vehicles. they had an oval configuration with a slight dome and black bands around the center of the vessels. they were around 75 feet high at the point of descent and dropping down to treetop level over aquatore park when i lost sight of them behind the blaine water tower. as i arrived at highway 65 i looked over the park but they were gone. all in all, i saw them for around 20 seconds from start to finish.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
