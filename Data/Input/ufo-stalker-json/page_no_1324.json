because there isn't any chance of rain i set up my tent without the rainfly so i could see the stars. i'm unsure of the time but i estimate sometime between 2:30 and 4 a.M. i woke up having to use the bathroom. lying on my back i was looking up at the stars when i noticed a brighter than usual star directly above me. i have no idea how high it was because it only appeared to be a star. it was a very bright white, almost with a blue tint to it. i don't know the location of constellations other than a fewmajor ones and the north star so it didn't occur to me that it could be anything other than a star. then it started moving maybe two or three minutes after i initially noticed it. it was faster than any plane i have ever seen up here, and that comparison includes 2 fighter jets i saw last year, (f-16's i think). i would say it was going a little faster than the jets did. it moved in a nne direction, in a straight line initially, then after it had crossed about 1/3 of the horizon it began to zig left and right in about 1 second durations, doing the same angle of change each time and continuing nne overall. each turn might have been 5 degrees or so. it only took about 20 seconds for it to go beyond the horizon i could see. i was more alert and scanned the sky for a little while and saw another light maybe 5 minutes later i noticed another stationary light is similar brightness wnw of me. i watched it for a few minutes and then it started moving at about the same speed to the right across the horizon from my perspective. i was only able to see it for a few seconds before its path took it behind a mountain that blocked any more view of it. \r\n\r\nthere was no moon out, no clouds, no wind and no other lights like planes at that time. i didn't hear any sound at all i would associate with aircraft, just very silent. i intend to be up here camping for a few more days so i would be happy to show an investigator where i am or provide gps

total)close up encounter with a ufo at approximately 7 pm back in february of 1969 in northwestern,east canaan connecticut at our home in litchfield county. my recollection of the event is as follows.We (my mother,father sister and myself)were heading north up our driveway in our car in east canaan connecticut at about 7 pm on february 7th 1969 we got about halfway up our drive when a bright multi colored  object about 60 feet in diameter appeared in front of us at about 500 yards in front of our car we were facing in a north direction still, it hovered at about 500 feet above ground for about 45 seconds above a tree line that was across  route 44 at the top of our driveway,the craft made a humming type of sound,then the craft elevated in a bright green flash and disappeared in a north westerly direction,the night was very crisp,clear and very very cold and after the craft disappeared we agreed not to say anything about this event.The craft itself was greyish silver in appearance and resembled a child's antique spinning top,it was about 60 feet wide and about 20-40 feet tall,it had circular pulsating lights in the middle of the craft of colors blue,green,yellow,red and white,there were also small portal type windows above the circulating lights,the lights seemed to rotate in a clockwise motion then reverse direction to a counter clockwise motion that same year in september about 4 miles away in ashley falls massachusetts in berkshire county one of the world's most scrutinized and studied ufo abduction cases to date took place as well. up until 1 week ago 6-2-13 after seeing a new ufo show on the science chanel about that abduction case in ashley falls mass, i had no idea this event and several others like it involving the same individuals as the first ashley falls mass. sighting in that area even occurred,i thought i and my family were the only ones who saw any type of ufo and that there was no other ufo activity in that surrounding area at very close range,we saw this craft at less than 500 yards away at about 500 feet above ground hovering for almost 1 minute .Our family agreed never to speak about this event minutes after it happened and for all intents and purposes none of us ever did until now.I have been seeking answers as to why 1 week after our sighting i had a recurring 3 year nightmare/dream..I post this interview so that you all may listen to this and possibly if you yourself had an event you might come forward and speak of it with someone or share it..I will be seeking council with a world renowned ufo abduction hypnotist and i myself will be hypnotized and hope to find out why my dreams happened over and over and what happened after the nightmare and dream state paralysis ended and my memory faded each time..I also taped this interview as this is the first time in over 40 years i have actually talked with my mother about our sighting and wanted to confer with her and possibly gain some new insight or possibly remember parts of the event that were forgotten in my memory,as i was only 5 years old at the time, that by talking with her would be remembered as was certainly the case..This event happened it was real and it completely changed/ altered my mind and it is my hope that with all i have been through with relation to this event as recently as 2011,to gain some sense of why !!!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Window(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then

in a stationary position.  it started to slowly move southwest for about 1 minute.  as it remained in this path, the yellow began to fade.  it then turned to orange and changed (slight curve) to a northeast direction.  it changed again to red and finally black.  for about a minute, i watched a black oval slowly traveling east northeast and then it disappeared completely.  just vanished.  it could have been due to the marine layer.\r\ni did not really think it was a plane due to the size and color.  i had suspicions that it could have been a comet, but it had no tail. the change of direction made me question this as well.  i logged onto the internet to see if there were any comets passing the earth, but one was only 53ft long and the other was millions of miles away.  recalling the halebop comet, they looked nothing alike.  halebop was stationary while i watched it.  it was fuzzy and had a tale.  this appeared brighter, clearer and closer.  that night was the first time in

looked up and saw the flying saucer rising over the trees in the direction where i believed it had landed.  as then flying saucer came over the trees, it was so close to me that i could touch it.  there was a bubble on the flying saucer and we were able to look at one another, face to face for at least two minutes until they gradually vanished i  the air.  as time passed, i would return to the place where then ship landed.  i would call out to the ufo and they amazingly responded as star lights bounding off the trees.  you have to be very careful because they have resources where they can

very large pulsating red, white, and blue strobeing circular light hovering in the trees. i first tried to take cell phone pictures but they only caught small looking light dots. not at all what i was seeing. so i got my canon power shot g3 camera out of the closet and the battery was dead because i had not used it for awhile. i grabbed the charger cord and plugged in and shot photos and video out of my sons window for more than one hour. the shape i was seeing was not changing, but the still photos show color changes and shapeshifting. most of the frames i shot were just dark with no visible image, and many others were pictures of different color orbs, mostly blue. i had to suppress my flash because it ruined the pictures. so all of the photos are of the lights without any other light. i did not know what i was catching i just kept shooting. i also tried some video with my canon camera but it only caught a moving small dot light similar to what i've seen on the internet. but the still photos were amazing, they caught shapes, colors and clear images. one clearly looks like an adult and a child made of lights.  i stopped taking photos before it left and went to bed convinced that i must be seeing things! i thought i would go outside in the morning and find some pole with a light on top of it that i had not noticed before. a plane warning light or a cell phone tower that was just put up, but nothing was there. just trees. i also did not know what i was catching as i had to use my viewfinder feature on my camera to enlarge the images. since then i have downloaded them to my computer for further enlargement and what i captured is nothing short of amazing. i have kept the photos on my cell phone and canon camera so that i can show them to someone for authentication. right now i can't wait to have an expert look at them. i will share only one of my photos here but will show all of them to someone for authentication. i'm attaching an  orb photo as that seems to be the more common one. i will hold my special photos as i feel they are not to be given away for free.
