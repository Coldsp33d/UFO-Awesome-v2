realized they were too close to each other to be a normal flight path. i looked up and scrutinized better only to realize that one of the 3 aircrafts was a real airplane with mandatory green and red light and blinking white one. crafts are flying east to west. the other two flying crafts are on the north side of real airplane, no faa required lights, just dull big orange ones on what seems to be their bellies. i heard only the plane not the other flying objects. plane could have been on landing path to fll airport, or could have departed from mia airport. plane is about between 5k and 10k feet high, thus moving rather slowly across the sky which gives me time to observe the other 2. my position is about 20 miles west of fll airport. as i am following the aircrafts in the sky i am now looking westward since it is the directional trajectory, and soon loose sight as view is obstructed by neighborhood trees. i continue my walk and look up in the sky now eastwardly. 2 more of these unidentified crafts are following the first group, same apparent altitude, same size, same speed, same trajectory. suddenly, one of the two accelerated upward and at a much greater speed disappeared into space. the second vessel continued on its trajectory, following it seems the first group. i am very sorry that i was the only one on the street to observe this event, i would have definitely called upon others to look up in the sky and co witness.  please feel free to contact me to corroborate this written report. thank you for including this report with i what hope will be others. i want

was going to show my boyfriend the north star, it was all so static up there. i started to admire a bright star that stood out from the others when to my surprise i saw it just fade away. i was shocked but the last thing i thought of was 'ufo', it did get creepier when the 'star-like' sphere lit up in another area of the sky before slowly fading away once again. a perfect almost controlled dimming, as if someone was purposely dimming the light. it did this for a few more seconds, fading before moving somewhere else.It followed the same path but it took different directions. there were no clouds in the sky that night what so ever. at this point i called my boyfriend, still staring at the sky. his exact words were 'what the hell?', but like me he was skeptical, until the star like sphere descended a good bit and it increased to a tenth of its previous size and brightened up to a beautiful blue-white like color. believe me in those mere seconds i pondered every option of what it might be, a plane, a jet, space debris,shooting star? but it moved in a determined direction, with controlled dimming and had no sound(which is what really disturbed me)it also descended and ascended, hovered and changed in size. it was shocking and emotional and i am not one for going out seeking these experiences. it was in fact really beautiful. it hasn't left my mind in a week now, i've told a few relatives but nothing compares to seeing it i guess. i guess maybe it did affect me in an emotional level perhaps because my brain experienced something illogical. thanks for

when we first noticed them, the lights were clearly, visibly twinkling even though the area we were in (an apartment complex) was very light polluted.\r\n\r\nthe objects faded with time as they very slowly moved eastward.  this made me think that they could possibly just be satellites moving into the earth's shadow, a phenomenon i had seen before with individual satellites, but they drifted much, much more slowly than any satellite i have ever witnessed.  the movement was all but imperceptible except over several minutes (perhaps 7-15 minutes), whereas most satellites i have witnessed have had a readily perceptible motion against the background stars, bringing them from horizon to horizon within a few minutes.  these objects moved perhaps four fist-widths (held at arm's length) across the sky from the time we spotted them until they slowly faded away.  that, combined with the fact that i have no idea how a swarm of object in orbit could possibly move collectively in the manner i saw according to my (albeit amateur) understanding of orbital mechanics and my personal experience with satellite watching, left me at a loss to explain them.\r\n\r\nthe size of the swarm as a whole was very large, possibly being twice the size (or more) of an open hand held at arm's length.\r\n\r\nmy date and i were both eyewitnesses to this event.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":47982,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.054414882728544,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06092013-0001","longitude":-93.89969437553034,"occurred":1370668200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Iowa","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1370762835000,"summary":"Green and red lights like on an aircraft, but there was a swarm of them with no sound, nor perceptible movement.","tags":["hovering","lights"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"50036","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Boone, Iowa","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:1813"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Hilliard","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Was driving home from dave and buster's with the kids it was around 10:00 pm and was looking at the sky and i saw this strange lights and they were very bright and they were at first in the formation of a kite(it seems like a kite to me), i ask my husband if he sees it and he said yes and it was just stars, then i ask my oldest child to look and she said that is no stars, stars are not that bright and that stars don't move, that's when i saw the formation changed its now more in a v shape and now they are in three's. there was maybe 12 or more i was trying to keep an eye on it and all of a sudden it was there then it just completely disappear, my husband keep insisting it was stars but there is no way that it was stars. i feel weird cause i don't know or cant explain what it was and i didn't want to frighten my youngest so i agreed it was a star but i know and my eldest know that it wasn't a star, i tried to talk to my husband about it and he didn't want to talk about it, he keeps insisting it was just stars. i would really appreciate if anyone know any explanation for this or saw it as well. thanks.
