the size the moon would look except it was low in the west sky and at that time the moon would have been rising in the east. it was a sphere that had multiple swirling colors and was stationary. at first i thought it was something on fire, but there were no flames or tail or smoke. it was perfectly round. after a few minutes, on the side of the circle facing south, a rectangle opened up and the thing started moving very slowly toward the north. i watched until it was out of sight as it went behind some low clouds to the north, maybe 10 minutes or so. i was so mesmerized by it that i didn't think to take a picture. all of a sudden i found myself standing in the middle of the street with my mouth open. i have tried to draw it,  but i can't capture the feeling of the swirling motion of the colors. it was amazing to witness this. i have at times been watching something on ufo's and thought \"why didn't they take a picture?\". i just couldn't believe what i was seeing. i have no idea how large or how far away this was. if someone had just glanced up and not really paid attention, they might have thought it was a harvest moon. but i stopped and looked at it closely and saw the swirling

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On the night of 5/14/2013, between 2045 and 2100 central time, i opened my front door to let my dog outside.  i followed her, and just like always, i happened to look up into the sky.  there it was, moving swiftly and silently, directly over my home.\r\n\r\nmy first thought was that it was some type of drone aircraft, then i immediately realized i heard no sound.  what truly caught and kept my attention was the lighted tips of the object, which formed a perfect triangle.  also, the lights were not very bright, however they were white (non-colored).  all three lights seemed to radiate at the same intensity, and the best way i can describe it is as if a dimmer light switch is adjusted to about 70%.\r\n\r\nanother thing struck me as interesting is that it was flying in a \"skewed\" position.  let me try to describe.  if you imagine an airplane, with a light at the nose and a light at the end of each wing, the light at the nose will always be in the lead, and the wing lights will always stay equidistant in their position, and  uniform as the plane moves forward.  the same would be true if there was no light on the nose, but two lights at the tips of the wing and one on the tail.  from a view on the ground, the flat side with the two lights at the tips/edges would be moving forward (in the lead), followed by the light at the tail.  \r\n\r\nthis object flew forward as if it was turned at about 30 degrees off the center axis, so i could not tell what was in the \"lead\".  it only kept its  uniform,  steady shape as it flew.  \r\n\r\nthis entire sighting lasted approximately 10 seconds.  of course, i had no camera with me, and i did run in and inform my wife of what i saw, and unfortunately there were no other witnesses. \r\n\r\ni have always had a historical fascination with \"stuff\" like this.  i had read enough non fiction about such instances to know that black triangles and the \"cigar\" shaped crafts are some of the most recognized shapes that have been recorded. so, i knew exactly what it was when i saw it. \r\n\r\nshape: what i saw was most closely described as what you have in this link as fig 5. first version of tip lights illustration.  the tips definitely seemed a little rounded, not pointed.\r\n\r\nspeed: well, i could not judge the speed but it seemed to be moving swiftly for the sighting to only last for about 10 seconds, especially from the point of view i had.  \r\n\r\nsize: if you take a silver dollar out of your pocket and hold it between your index finger and thumb, and then extend your arm above you and look at the flat side of the coin, that is approximately how large the object appeared from my ground perspective.  i have read that some witnesses state that these things are very, very large.  well, if they are, then from my view (size of a silver dollar), it was fairly high up.\r\n\r\nother features: some articles i have seen reference a light (red) in the center of the underside of the craft.  there were no other lights visible on the object that i saw.\r\n\r\ndirection:  i found my home on google maps and

i always like watching the sky for anything unusal. driving down alburtis rd towards macungie, pa i thought i saw a low flying object in the near distance but was blocked by the shipping warehouse after first seeing it. i was aproching the turn by mack trucks and saw another car pulled off to the side of the road ( i do not know if they were there to watch the object or for other reasons) though they were pulled over at an odd spot. i drove up the road a bit and pulled over my the school bus depot. from there i rolled down my windows and observed the object for roughly 5 min then it moved slowly towards the mountains. after i lost it behind the trees i decided to head home knowing my wife would be wondering why i was so late though i wanted to follow it(just to deterime if it was a helicopter). total time seeing the object in that spot would be roughtly 10 min though most likely slightly less. the object itself was low flying if i had to geuss i would say 300ft and it was just red light i was trying to see probing white light (like most natural aircraft) but did not see it. to be honest if i had to say it was most likely a helicopter but the bright red lights and lack of sound espcially for being seemingly so close made me think it could be somthing else. i work and live near the hospital and can hear their helicopter all the time and this seemed to be slightly lower

engineer very well versed in engineering, technology in general, aeronautics, astronautics, astronomy, meteorology, and physics.\r\n\r\nthe sighting took place over about 1 minute sunday morning january 6, 2013 about 7:15 am cst. it was in the east and on the compass about 140 degrees azimuth and 40-50 degrees in elevation.\r\n\r\ndriving east from bedford tx to longview tx on hwy 183 just south of dfw airport when i noticed a very bright, very well defined, very small cylinder with sharply defined, round symmetrical ends the ends being mirror images it had the typical pale yellow orange color of a cloud at sunrise. no wispy or rough edges, completely smooth, symmetrical, and geometric.\r\n\r\nfirst thought was a cloud but the obvious smooth well defined geometric shape and the fact that there was never a change in the shape seemed to belie this. in addition as i turned south on hwy 360 south i was able to scan almost the entire sky and there was no other cloud in any form or fashion anywhere else so i rejected cloud.\r\n\r\nnext a jet con trail however as i watched keeping this in mind, again, static, no growth, movement, dissipation, or edges becoming ragged. i want to point out that since i was a child the first thing i do when i walk outside is to look up in the sky and will, invariably, stop and watch as a con trail is painted on the sky so i'm very familiar with the dynamics of con trails.\r\n\r\nall of a sudden the entire object disappeared and re-appeared flashing 3 times in approx 1 second. it returned to full brightness for a very few seconds then rapidly faded and vanished, in place no hint of motion, i'd say in about 1/2 second very quickly. object never reappeared. on the long trip to longview had many opportunities to see jet condensation trails and it reinforced my belief that what i saw was not a cloud nor a con trail.\r\n\r\ni've seen weather balloons naked eye and through binoculars and this doesn't fit as the cigar shape was almost parallel to the horizon plus the flashing and disappearance would have to be caused by something eclipsing a very large object in the sequence above.\r\n\r\ncould not be a reflection in my windshield because the object remained at the same point in the sky when i turned through 90 degrees.\r\n\r\nno idea on distance, altitude, or size. i never felt panicked or stressed but calm and stimulated by the experience.\r\n\r\nway too bright, large, and fixed to be a satellite. no way any known astronomical event too bright if nothing else, not marsh gas and if i understand correctly temperature inversions are much closer to the horizon and thus would negate them as the cause. someone attempting a hoax way to complicated if not impossible.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":47924,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.8370727,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06062013-0011","longitude":-97.0819541,"occurred":1357459200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1370548042000,"summary":"Hovered

(from targhee towne subdivision, just over the wyoming state line in teton valley, near driggs, idaho) larger than a star or planet, flying under 1 mile altitude. object glowed white, looked like a single object, but when observed with binoculars, was actually 3 objects flying in tight triangular formation. \r\n  orbs moved silently northeast, curving in a wide arc, till they began to go through cloud cover. my husband, daughter and i moved to the back porch, looking through binoculars. my daughter got a great look at the formation through the binoculars of the 3 orbs before they ducked behind the clouds. at this point, the orbs were out of sight for less than a minute, then re-appeared as they continued traveling up over the mountains, just to the north of the grand teton. looks like they flew right over mary's nipple up by targhee resort, about 6 miles away.\r\n   seeing strange things in the night sky is a regular thing in this valley - i'll sign on again soon, and give a timeline of other various events over the years, with full details. \r\n   always happy to see our friends from way, way, way out of town :) i must admit, it's a beautiful place to sight-see. although based on their past behavior, i think they were most probably checking out water resources in alaska basin. (i've seen about a dozen of these formations flying in and out of the basin over the years.)\r\n   objects eventually went over the mountains, dropping down below our line of sight. entire encounter lasted about 4 minutes. \r\n~3 white, glowing lights, no pulsing, steady curved flight-path, no sound, no vibration (sometimes you feel a charge while they pass over). we've had several sightings similar to this. \r\n~myself, my husband, and our 13 year old daughter were all witness to this encounter. if anyone wants to get together and chat about it - find me: chris, in targhee towne, with the big garden. folks will know who i am.

spring concert over at this school. upon traveling by foot, we first noticed it while walking east. the object was hovering in the south direction. luckily i had brought my new camera to record the school production. this occurred at about 5:40ish. we stood and watched it periodically and noticed it hadn't moved at all. it just floated there at a very high altitude. i snapped several shots and kept getting nothing at first. my camera is a cannon powershot sx500 and capable of zooming in quite a long distance while maintaining detail. it wasn't until we got to my son's school (still monitoring the object to make sure it was still there) that i brought it to other parents' attention. there were over 30 people all outside waiting to be let into the school. quickly, all eyes were turned to the skies. many met what they were seeing with confusion, keen interest and some skeptic. soon, even the skeptics were unsure what they were seeing with their own 2 eyes. the object was still hovering and unmoved. still giving off some kind of odd glow. after 4 more attempts with the camera, i finally managed to get it. it didn't take long for all those who witnessed what i'd seen, to be convinced, whether they believe in et's or not, that this was simply not something man-made, but rather some kind of organic life form. the object was gone once i left the school an hour later, with no trace of where it had gone to. i am excited and pleased to have a very clear photo of the sighting. i am hoping someone out there can tell me what this thing is!","distance":"Over One
