was clear and the sun was at about 40 degrees above the horizon to the wnw. i was actually just talking to my friend about how i believe in aliens and what i have heard and read about them recently. his response was he didnt really believe. so maybe 2 minutes after the conversation stopped i noticed something in the sky and said \"hey look at those birds.\" they were flying from the south to the north west over the water and just above a tree line about 1500-2000 feet away. my friend said \"thats not birds\" and i immediately realized that it was something else. the best way i can describe it, it was sort of cigar shaped, basically invisible except for what i thought was birds, maybe it was giving off heat or reflective waves that looked black to me. a good example of its shape is the spring from a click pen or a cork screw shaped but but spotty, by which i mean you can only see bits of it. almost like when you see an optical illusion on the horizon on a hot sunny day, except much more visible. this is really strange, because as i write this i have the television on and south park just started, the episode where the world gets visited by aliens for the first time ever. anyway i want to guess the object was 50feet in length and 15 feet wide. we watched it for about 40 seconds until it disappeared in the distance. when i first saw it, it was just wsw flying at a controlled pace going north west. we both just stopped what we were doing and stared until it disappeared. my friend was saying \"what did we just see\" over and over. we were both in shock and i told him i that i believe its ufo. when we fish out here we are always scanning for brids that might be eating schools of bait fish and thats why i noticed it. if i was to draw a description of what i saw, i would draw a spotted zig zag line. :;:;:;:;;","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

the weather was neutral and calm. it was not followed by thunder which we would have heard as the radio was off. i asked if she had noticed it but she hadn't. again another giant flash of blue light

my girlfriend left for work at 7am and came back in saying there was a helicopter circling the neighborhood. she say it was black and white and had no markings or numbers like a police helicopter

\r\n   then we got back to my parents house, which is in the middle of a bunch of woods. i started walking down the street and all of a sudden i was walking in the middle of this field, that is about a quarter of a mile from my parents house. \r\n   out of the corner of my eye i see what looks like 2 or 3(i can't remember now) greys. i look over and instantly this green light catches my eye. then as soon as i focused on the light, they moved towards me in such a way..... i cant even describe it. i was instantly filled with more fear then i ever thought imaginable. i had a phobia of spiders before this, but now i see that that's not real fear. i still don't like spiders but i don't have a phobia anymore.\r\n   as soon as they got close i woke up in my bed paralyzed. i could move my eyes and think but i couldn't make a noise or move anything. i started to fight it with everything i had, i was so confused i have never felt anything like it! i tried with everything to scream to my parents, to anyone i just wanted someone to help me, i felt so helpless. all i got out was a couple quiet noises or something, the only reason i could tell is that my dog(new dog i had for about 4 years) was staring at me tilting his head back and forth in a confused way. \r\n   i snapped out of it, i don't know how long it went on for it felt like an eternity, and i felt a presence and like someone (or something) had been squeezing my arms and legs pretty tightly, almost like they were still there. i felt violated in the worst way i could imagine.\r\n   i have had several incidents since this one, all started while i was sleeping, all the way up to as recently as last tues. june 4 2013. there were some incidents when i was on the same pill but there were a couple when i was on nothing. \r\n   it seemed like i was regaining more and more control every time it happened until one time on march 23 2013. it looked like i was in my parents living room but i could tell i wasn't. long story short i was able to swing my limp arm at them. i was on that pill that day. now i am not a drug addict this is all happening by pure chance, my teeth are breaking apart and cause me a great deal of pain.\r\n   i am doing this because i need help. so please i have to know exactly what is going on, maybe with hypnosis it can help me to fully overcome it and put a stop to whatever is going on. i know its not likely but please i need help!!","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":47895,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.0536549,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06052013-0017","longitude":-76.6393712,"occurred":1313838000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maryland","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1370459472000,"summary":"I was sleeping, in my dream i was walking through a field when i noticed 2 greys. when they moved closer i woke up paralyzed.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"21921","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":655,"locationName":"Maryland","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:1987"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Twin Falls","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Ufo  over twinfalls  idaho usa,  this is  real  they are here 100%%% blinking  over city  and  like  playing  red  orange  light  blinking 23;43  night   photos  proof !!!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Insignia","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":47894,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.5656768,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06052013-0016","longitude":-114.4572311,"occurred":1370328180000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Idaho","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1370458098000,"summary":"Fly  over  city  vith blinking  light  red   vhite  orange","tags":["light"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/47894_submitter_file1__P1050698.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/47894_submitter_file2__P1050702.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/47894_submitter_file3__P1050706.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Twin Falls, Idaho","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:1988"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Bangor","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I walked outside to my front yard to take pictures of the stars. when i looked up i saw a bright, white light that was moving and appeared to be larger and lower than other stars. i ran inside and asked my partner to come and look at the object as witness. we watched the single,bright oval object steadily cross the sky with a slight wobble, no sound, just above the trees, street and river (approx.500+ft in altitude). we viewed the object for about a minute until we lost sight of it behind the trees. i did manage to capture it on video.

may have been visible to pilots.  \r\ni first checked to see if the lights were connected to a larger object, like the bottom of a spaceship, but no, they were not connected.  the lights had an orange

were military helicopters for drones launched from seal beach base, based upon path.  but could not come up with any conclusion that seemed reasonable.  \r\ni videotaped for a few seconds, thinking it
