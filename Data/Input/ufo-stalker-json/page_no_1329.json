looked up and saw 3 to 4 orbs following behind a airplane then out of no where they changed course it was like they where putting on a show. \r\nso since thenjust about ever ynight me and my husband come outside at night and just look up at the sky and we see flying objects in the sky. sometimes 3 or 4\r\n   they look like flying stars but go really fast and change direction with ease. \r\ni have even pointed a light at one and got flashed back it scared me very much.\r\n i dont talk about what i see with no one except my husband i think people will think im crazy...But  \r\n\r\n     last night i saw the brightist bigest ufo it was 11 pm and me and my husband where outside looking up and we saw what looked like a star but it was moving very fast and then it got brighter and brighter it just glided across the sky it was very surreal. we saw it for about 10 min intill we couldnt see it no more due to trees then about a hour later we saw anther one but im sure tonight we will see something like its happing every night . what i want to know is why are we seeing things almost every night are we the only ones that find objects flying all the time are there other people that see things liked this, am i seeing what i think im seeing? are they satellites?  i dont know but i know im scared and not sure whats going to happen are we going to be invaded or does the goverment already have contact im just not sure but im sure i sound crazy but im really not  i am a normal person. i would love some answers. i know for sure if someone would stand with me for 10 or 15 min you would see something unknown flying above.\r\n is there any one else that see things like us every night? as soon as we fix our camera we get video we tried but are camera broke it wont turn back on

1980's. there are several stories from waking in the middle of being taken out of my house by this tall being when i was stationed on crete, greece, to several recent ones. the reason i am reaching out now is because of the recent episodes and questions i have. i recently woke up with a round patch, about 1.5 inches in diameter, of hair missing from the left side of my head (above and to the left of my ear) to teeth that i think were pulled and put back. as for the teeth, i just woke up one day and had 2 very loose molars on the right bottom side of my jaw. they did hurt but that only lasted a few days. they are still loose but without pain. in november i awoke in the middle of another episode. i was in a hotel room and woke up hearing chirping sounds going back and forth. i was covered from head to toe in a white sheet and was surrounded in very bright white light. i felt something at the foot end and tried to kick at it as i was very upset. i just got heavier and could no longer move. i felt something near my shoulder at this point. i did try yelling for it to leave me alone. i know i got a few words out but again was only left heavier than before and unable to move or speak. i just kept hearing the chirping going on. i eventually just blacked out.  when i woke up in the morning i felt extremely heavy with difficulty moving. i had a very hard time getting out of bed and to the shower. i had to give a speech at a university and as i was being led to the room i had extreme difficulty going up 2 steps. i fell back once and just pushed myself back to move on. at the same time i was in an extreme feeling of paranoia for a few hours. i had to sit outside for a while just to pull myself together. anybody that knows me knows that i don't fear much of anything. i have been awakened a few times in the middle of something going on. on other occasions i have been aware of something going on but couldn't open my eyes but tried fighting my way out just to be completely unable to move while getting some words out - yelling for my freedom.\r\ni have twice seen the tall thin creature with the large head and small eyes. on one of those occasions i did see several short creatures with the large purple eyes looking at me. the tall one seems to be the abductor. the second time i saw the tall one it threw the sheets off of my feet at the foot of my bed. i remember it lightly slapping my feet. it was slightly hunched over looking at me with the little one scattered on both sides of it. that happened at my apartment in texas. while in greece, i don't know if it was returning me or trying to take me but i fought hard holding on to the couch with my rt leg and hand. it had me half way out of the large window that was as wide as i am tall.\r\ni am heavily involved in the spiritual having done several exorcisms. i am a hypnotist. i have 2 degrees (math and biology) and a paper away from my ms in computer science. tests give me an iq of 154. i was working for intelligence when i believe it all started. for some reason or another i don't like to sleep at night no matter how tired and will stay up as late as possible. i am not scared to go to sleep just don't seem to want to.\r\ni have many more details to each event but think they would be best spoken if there is any interest in them.\r\nare these things happening to others?\r\nthank you for your

i've heard during that time i thought i should say something to somebody.\r\nthis event happened at night with a clear sky. i was standing outside my home when i saw a small travelling light in the sky which, at first, i thought may have been a plane. however, as i watched this light, travelling in the east, and moving in a southward direction, i noticed it slow dramatically, almost to a stop. within a few seconds the object shot straight up. it had made a very definite course change on a sharp angle. \r\nthe object travelled for a very short period, (possibly one second), then disappeared with what appeared to be an explosion, or ???   something. the explosion did not make any sound. it only appeared to be explosive because there was a shower, or burst of sparks as it disappeared.\r\nafter that it was gone. \r\nit was not near to me as far as i could tell. it seemed to be a very long distance away. it also appeared as though it might have been in outer space,.... i'm not certain about that part.\r\nthe only reason i've had a concern about this object for so long is that i know we do not have any technology which would allow any air ships to make such a sharp turn. nor would it have disappeared so suddenly.\r\nthat very same night, one of our local television stations reported that local police and some eye witnesses in nashville had reported seeing a ufo. when this was reported i guess i put two and two together. it probably was the same object.\r\ni cannot add anything more to this. as i said, i know it's not much. but i am confident that what i saw did not operate within the technologies we possess now, nor then.\r\ni also have another report which happened at about the year of 1984 in another area of tennessee. however, i think that one may have been military. i'm not certain.\r\nthanks for taking the time to read my e-mail and take my information. i wish i could add more or be more

the same orb sighting tonight especially those who live in north west alabama.Actually the gadsen report that came in prompted me to report online & i will have video of tonight's sighting on youtube shortly. the first light orb came in traveling low around close to 200-300 ft off the ground in straight path coming from the south heading north east.It was very very bright! brighter than sirius. it was moving extremely slow & about 5 mph. it took 4 minutes just to travel a few yards & over my yard.It was partly cloudy when this came over but was below the clouds. what's interesting, the gadsen report says he saw it going south west to north east but gadsen is southwest of north west alabama so logically it couldn't had been the same one.But with saying that we spotted a handful of other light orbs higher in the sky right after the low travelling orb & we saw them in all different directions. they will be medium bright & then get extremely bright all of a sudden & then dim & disappear.I noticed one of them still visible after thinking it was gone.They weave,wobble & hover sometimes & even make a curve in direction. \r\n\r\nanyway,i have a thought.Imagine a bunch of these low`orbs scattered in a horizonal line sweeping through our country at the same time headed in the same direction for instance, all coming from the south/ south west, headed in a north eastern direction? the light orbs that are a few thousand feet up are going in all directions. then again they might be all swarming up there & a few come down to say hi. the must like me a lot.

exit to the casino and my boyfriend said to me look what is that on top of the casino, which you are able to see from the freeway.  i looked and i seen a big glowing ball, i said to him \" i am going to take a picture ok\" he said sure.  as i took the exit to do so, all of a sudden my vehicle shut down and all my interior lights including my car stereo went out as if there were no power, i started to panic because i wasn't sure what was going on and my car only had 3,000 miles on it.  i said to him what is happening?  he didn't respond and i told him to get the time and then as i started to approach the stop sign my vehicle was on and my stereo lights and dash lights came back on.  it was as if the power came on but not like my vehicle started it was just back on.  i then proceeded to pull over to take pictures of the object and my boyfriend did also the object was a bright white but once i started to take pictures it turned orange and then started towards us.  no sooner i took out my phone to take them, my boyfriend said to me \"  hey i don't know what the heck it is but whatever it is, it is coming straight for us, i laughed as i thought he was joking, i continued to take photos but i was only seeing my shutter open and close. my boyfriend started to put his phone away and said lets go its coming fast, he said i am getting out and going to walk i am not trying to get abducted.   i have taken lots of pictures of orbs, and sphere's and other unidentified  objects and thought this was one for my photo album.  i continued to take photos and my boyfriend became uneasy and asked if we could go,  i again chuckled and said ok just a few more.  so i took a few more pictures and then proceeded on to the casino.  we arrived at the casino about 10:50 or 11:00 pm, and we got out of my vehicle and i was unable to stand without holding on to my boyfriend, i told him that i felt weak and my legs were very weak, and so we went on the elevator and my head felt as if i were on a merry go round for hours, almost as if my brain was spinning and as we got off the elevator i then had to stop i told him i had to vomit and i thought we needed to leave and go to the hospital, i asked him how did he feel and he said \"not good i need to vomit to\"  as i stood there i became very scared and said i don't know what is going on but i am weak, he told me to hold on to him and lets sit down inside then we can go if i didn't feel any better.  i then remember being in front of the casino, but have no memory of what i did inside or how long before i felt better. once we got home i connected my phone to my computer to see what we got in the photos.  i looked at all the pictures and i had to lighten them because i wasn't able to see them.  as i lightened them  i was able to see the object as it approached us it was a lighted rod coming in multiple directions meaning left to right but as is approached us it had passed in front of a couple of vehicles that were passing by in actually passed right over the rear end of a vehicle, and i have a few photos of it coming straight for us, then i have a photo of a green object coming towards my vehicle and my boyfriend took pictures of the object and then an object with windows also my speedometer reads that while at a complete stop my vehicle states it is a 60 mph and my rpm's are at 3.  my boyfriend accidentally took photos of inside my vehicle and there is a cigar like object in my car and my car clock was a fluorescent green and bright. this object seems to have a red color in the top of it and in the center of it.   once the object go closer to my car the surrounding area became clouded as if there were a dust storm, i was unable to see the road and in one photo the object that had windows in it, the lines in the road were like they were all over the place they were no longer the painted line that were there at the beginning of this ordeal.  i do have all the photos which i had to lighten.  i am willing to take a polygraph test for my boyfriend and i,  i will pay for them myself if necessary.  i am also willing to go under hypnosis if possible, i believe they abducted us and i have some type of implant in my abdominal area.  since this encounter i have a burn like mark on my stomach and i can feel it move on occasion which if feels like a sharp object  poking me i have actually felt it travel around my stomach area and when i experienced this that night i  had felt it and i am very scared of not knowing what they did.  i hope we can discuss this or maybe you can direct me to the right individuals for the hypnosis and polygraph.  i am scared and no one believes us.  \r\n\r\nthank you so much\r\n\r\nannette gonzales","distance":"Over One

sky. tonight was an amazing night to go out for stargazing. as i looked up, i thought at first i was looking at just stars. then i realized, they were moving. as they passed, i pointed them out to my friends and my children. at first they thought they were looking at just the stars too, but once they focused they noticed a bunch of objects were moving in the night sky. there were no clouds in the sky, so it was not an illusion or our minds playing tricks on us. my daughter decided to take my phone and use the flashlight on it on one of the objects to try to communicate with one of them by flashing the light on and off again and it worked! we then went inside and got a normal flash light, they did not respond back but did with the phone. for three and half hours my daughter and i counted over 25 objects flying in the night sky disguised as stars. we also noticed when a plane would fly by, they would put their light out or would just disappear entirely. i can surely say that what we were seeing tonight was not airplanes or an aircraft that is of our world.
