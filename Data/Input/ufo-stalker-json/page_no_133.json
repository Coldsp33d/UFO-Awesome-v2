(writing this now to mufon - i realize it seems the motion of the lights are similar to the process of processing film in cannisters - something that requires precision for less grain in the negative).  the lights disappear. there is at least 10 seconds of silence. darkness in front of me except for the residential street lights near by.  the ground lights up spanning 5 meters in width in a motion of liquid light - waves like the ocean and transparent in amber and fire-like color.  it looks like a mirage and holographic projection.  i felt compelled to get out of the car to investigate and touch the liquid light.  i remembered from ufo television shows the light could be unsafe. i decide to make a photograph quickly.  i look at the b shutter setting on the camera. the film will not photograph exactly what i am experiencing. i put the camera down.  there is complete darkness from the field.  silence so beautiful. i wait.  after 6-10 seconds 3 meters east from the location of the liquid light another glow appears. hovering above the field a rectangle shaped form with a width of 2 meters is glowing of lava and liquid metal slowly dripping like honey. the glowing looks exactly like a animated cartoon projected over a moving holographic 3d image. the glowing lasted for 5-9 seconds.  i was mesmerized by the movement and wondered how it could be generated.  the glowing image disappeared.  it was quiet. i waited. a bright diffused faded white round light approached directly in front of the car on the empty road.  i immediately hid below the steering wheel.  i thought it was a motorcycle.  there was no sound.  i started to the engine. i am frightened.  an extremely bright light white lit up the entire field and road side and pointed in my car.  i glance to my left window and see a bright multi-beamed star-pointed light hovering at 6 meters above ground. no sound. silent. the light with no glare.  the multiple beams are thin varying in length and are retracting in and out like a radio antenna (example: shape of light - sputnik satellite).\r\n\r\nthe light pulsed a few times and aligned itself visible on the right rear-view mirror.  i realize i can see the light and the light can see me from the mirror. i am driving fast and careful not to over-rev the tachometer. the light is to my right window directly in-line with me. no sound. silent.  i felt time had stopped. there is no sound.  i can hear my engine yet there is no sound. the ground below the object is not lighted from the light.  i am on the freeway. there are at least 12 cars driving past the light.  i thought those people will think that is a helicopter. will they not notice the beams of light are varying in length and pulsing in and out?  the light stopped above a stop sign and i felt it was waiting for me and watching me drive away.\r\n\r\nwhen i arrived home i was happy at sunrise. happy to know they are from another galaxy. advanced technology.  i drove back to the location and watched the sunrise near a row 15-20 newspaper stands.  it was my frist time to notice the news paper stands on the sidewalk facing the panorama view of the east - an open field of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 101-500 Feet","duration":"00:07:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

to compare my picture and one picture i have to agree that the first picture may have been a bird but the second picture he sent me did not look like birds and this could not compare to the picture that i sent him and i had to totally disagree with him.  i told him there were no birds in the sky that day when i put my camera phone up to the sun for brief couple of shots of the eclipse.  there was a passenger jet going by up in the upper right corner of my picture.  i did not see my pictures till later that evening when i took a good look  and i saw two dots in my picture above the sun.  when i zoomed in on those two objects i could not believe what i was seeing.  i know those are not birds  and i have shown other people this picture and they also agreed that they are not birds. these objects were way too far up in the sky when that picture was taken and i really would like another opinion from someone else.  i personally have been studying ufo’s  on my own for the past 20 years and i have had one other in counter which i did report to you guys back in 2003 and you made it clear that what  i saw was probably a ufo because it was a black triangle.  but back to this picture if you could please have someone else look at this again.  there is no way that these could be birds.  thank you for your time.","distance":"Over One

on the main road overlooking the atlantic oceans the small village of neils'; harbor cape breton was dark a t the time. i awoke to light filling my room. i got up and walked into my parents adjoining room. once they realized i was standing there they sent me back to bed. i turned around to find a full-sized grover from sesame street standing there smiling at me. he was easily as tall as me and i felt no threat from him. i said hi. my parents asked who i was talking to and then sent me to be when i said who. i bid grover goodnight had to move around him to get to me bed and then went to sleep. he wasn't there when i woke up. \r\n\r\na year or so later we moved to a tailor court near sydney ns. while walking down the main dirt road one after noon with a friend, the friend has to go home to pee. so i waited on the road. since it was mid day there was no traffic. i found myself looking up where a circular object that reminded me at the top of the rings of a stove top burn was hovering among the clouds. it seemed to hover over me as a was staring straight up. it appeared as a set of concentric chalky rings with sky blue between them. i stared at it for a time then watched it go in an out of a cloud before flashing off toward the east. all the while appearing like a white flat coil to my young eyes. it would be several years before i hear the term ufo. weirdest of all was that when my friend returned, he asked where i had been. apparently he had been looking for several minutes and i was no where to be found. i only remember looking up and watching the shapes move. as far as i remember i never left my spot in the middle of the road. suffice it to say that concentric shape has haunted me the rest of my life. \r\n\r\nsince then i have kept alert for any description of

into the habit of looking up at night sky, which is what i did, and i noticed what i first thought to be a plane, but this object was blinking red ,blue, green and white lights. the object also seemed to have a smooth coasting feel to it, maybe do to it not producing any noise. for the steady pace it was moving and for the night sky being so clear, i was surprised that there wasn't any noise coming from the object. i ran the dog inside and had my wife come outside with me, so she could see also. we observed the flying object and another one appeared from nowhere, right next to the flying object we were already watching. now there were two. i then seen a third flashing object flying from the opposite direction, head towards the other two. at some point there was a fourth object flying in another direction. we watched these objects fly different directions until they were out of visibility but they would quickly head back towards the area that i had seen them in originally. one of the objects became stationary, approximately 2-3 miles away from were my wife and i stood, and two of the other objects seemed to fly close to the stationary object and then fly out of sight and eventually fly back. this entire time i was taking pictures and videos with my phone. aside from a couple random blinks that i captured on video, the rest of my pics and vids were completely dark, not even the bright stars could be seen in them. the lights were at times pulsating rapidly and at other times the would have a steady continuous flash that alternated in colors. one of the objects even put of a bright white flash once, like a camera flash. my wife had to go inside and attend to the kids and after a couple minutes i went inside also, so i could download a camera app that may be able to capture what it was my wife and i were looking at. i came back outside around 11pm and they were gone. the sky seemed to be darker and the stars didn't seem as bright as they were. i've seen planes in the sky at night and whatever i seen this night in the sky was unlike any plane i've ever seen. this was my first time seeing anything like this and i'm still a bit weirded out over what they could have been.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:45:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then
