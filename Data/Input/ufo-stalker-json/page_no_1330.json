(my car, that is.) the entire road became red under its lights.  i really panicked because it was so close and for whatever reason, it had deliberately, unmistakenly headed right for me. it seemed to be hovering above my car approximately at telephone pole height. there weren't any other cars on the road, and i didn't know if i would make it out of there alive. my foot hit the pedal hard and fast and i remember getting home just a few minutes after midnight. as i walked in the door, my mother, who was watching my son was still awake.  i said, \"ma, i saw a ufo!\"  she just said, \"oh.\"  i had reacted to whatever it was above my car as if i were its prey.  that was my survival gut reaction at the time even though i had always wanted to find out about ufos and of course, beings from other planets, etc. that encounter was just a little too close, however. for some reason, i felt the ufo was ours. it was just a feeling.\r\n there is more to this story, but i fear any subjective, rather than fact-based speculation might be foolish.  a few years later, i called \"the press democrat\" newspaper to see if anything had been reported.  there was an article which appeared in which local

on 7 mile beach in the evening looking for shooting stars.It was a dark and moonless night with stars covering the night sky. there were minimal lights on the beach which allowed us a clear view of the night sky. at approximately 11:00 pm, my girlfriend said \"whats that? i happened to be looking in the same diection and immediately answered, i dont't know. what we observed almost simultaneously was a dark shadow, very large, moving across the sky in a northerly direction, obscuring all of light from the stars as it passed by. after about 3 seconds, the shadow transfomed into a craft, which was visible for about 3-4 seconds and then seemed to cloak itself back into a dark shadow, as if becoming one with the surrounding sky and was gone. after it had disappeared, i asked my girlfriend to describe what she saw, since we both had a startled verbal response when we saw the craft materialize. what we saw was a large craft, that i estimated to be the size of a couple of boing 747 aircraft, i am guessing to be at 5-10,000 feet in altitude, moving off to the north at a reletively high rate of speed, of at least several thousand miles per hour. the craft originally was the dark shadow we saw moving across the sky, and then began to materialize. the cfaft as i saw it was of a similar shape as the \" bird of prey\" from the star trek shows. i saw gull shape wings which had a solid navigation light running almost the entire length of the leading edge of the wings. it had no tail fin but in general was of a chevron shape.It made no sound, and had no other discernable lights. it appeared to have a protrusion off the front, which i would assume to be a cockpit type of area. my girlfriend described the craft as more of a \"v\" shaped craft, looking similar to a seagull without the head area and she did see the light on its edges, more of which she descibed as a glowing light. my eyes are much better than hers at distance, so i believe i got a better look at it. this craft stayed in our view for 3-4 seconds, and then in a very similar fashion from the creature in the movie \"predator\", it seemed to dematerialize into the surrounding sky, or just get absorbed by it. we both talked about it in detail for days. we both saw that craft on that night, and know that what we saw was real. we talked about how if only one of us saw it, you would question yourself forever, if you just imagined something. in this case 2 sets of eyes and 2 minds saw exactly the same thing, so we will forever know the opposite. we witnessed a craft more than likely, not of this earth.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s),  Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line

almost a triangle theme... there were at least 20-30 throughout the night, some just passed overhead and flew passed above, others took their place in the sky (some moving their positions, others just slightly moving, and some even falling slowly to the ground.\r\n\r\ni stared directly above and yelled for the others to look.  a triangle shaped object with 3 white lights at each corner and one red

my entire life starting as a child to the present day. i have many other events i could tell but this is the one that stands out because of the scenario. the difference in this event is the fact that i was fully awake and conscious. unlike most abductions where i am in a haze disillusioned state most likely due to the techniques used by the abductors. no i am not crazy. \r\n\r\nthe incident started in the middle of the night at about 3am. i was in bed sleeping flat on my stomach. i was not fully asleep but groggy. the next thing is i felt something touch my left ankle. did not think much of it until the touch turned into a grip on my ankle. my leg was lifted into the air. startled i spun around and instantly went into a panic mode. there standing holding my leg was an entity commonly referred to as the greys. off subject i am a gun enthusiast and own many firearms. i sleep with a firearm near me. at the time i had a small 25 cal. pistol in a drawer near my bed. when i saw the entity i panicked and instinctively grabbed for my pistol. i pulled my pistol and aimed it at the entity at which time he dropped my leg. he turned and ran out of my room. this all took place in a matter of seconds. my kitchen was the next room to my bedroom. in the kitchen was my dog. i kept her in the kitchen at the time because she was having issues with peeing on the carpet. when the entity ran from my room i heard my dog scream in fear as if she was being beaten. the sound a dog makes when they are in severe pain or fear. i got up and ran in the kitchen. there was the entity standing by the kitchen wall with my dog about 5 feet from him yelping and crying really loud. i again aimed my pistol at the entity. he stared at me and i froze for a few seconds. i was just ready to pull the trigger when he turned and went right through the wall as if it was not there. i slowly walked in the kitchen at which time my dog stopped yelping but was still crying and extremely scared. i slowly walked over to the wall and noticed a slight rippling effect on the wall that looked like heat waves like on a hot day when you see heat coming off of hot pavement. i touched the spot on the wall where the entity went through and it was very hot. i stood there for a minute and touched it again and it had cooled back to normal. here i was standing in the middle of my kitchen with a pistol in my hand thinking i cant believe what the hell just happened. i was in shock and just stood there for a few minutes. the next thing i did was i picked up the phone and called my uncle and told him what just happened. you have to remember this was 3am and he was not in a good mood to here something like this at that time in the morning. but after hearing what happened he came over. i let him in the back as that is where i was because the back door to the home was in the kitchen. he came in and we talked for a few minutes as he was trying to calm me down. he then went into the living room and told me come in the living room. he said look at the floor so i did. i could not believe what i saw. there was little child sized footprints on my living room carpet. i had vacuumed the carpet earlier before i went to bed so the carpet was all raised. but there on the floor was child sized footprints. not barefoot but shoed prints. my uncle was shocked and was a little scared after seeing the prints. this is one of many incidents that i have had with the grey entities. as i said this one is different because i was fully awake and aware as i am now writing this piece.","distance":"Unknown,
