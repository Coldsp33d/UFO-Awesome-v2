lunch, and backyard at 1530. i live under a commercial approach path into john wayne airport with my fianc���e, and i often watch the planes fly overhead. it's reminiscent of my time spent in the military. as one such craft passed by i noticed a metallic flash at an altitude at least 500ft above the commercial craft. after a moment's observation i realized the object had no trajectory. i sprinted back to my bedroom closet looking for my pentax 24ucf binoculars. using the compass on my iphone, set to true north, i noted the object at 3 degrees north. i also took note that it hovered above the eastern-most edge of columbus park. through the binoculars i could clearly make out the distinct shape of a \"soda can\" cylinder. the shape appeared to be made of two different materials; one half was a highly reflective, metallic surface, and the other half a dull grey material (there were markings here i could not make out). i felt exhilarated and had to share. i yelled for my fianc���e to come and see the object, and she confirmed it with the naked eye.\r\n\r\nten minutes passed as the binoculars went back and forth and then two black \"balls\" appeared at the object's base. it seemed to sprout a tail that corkscrewed with the object's rotation. when the tail finished growing, the balls disappeared. another commercial plane passed between us and the object, blocking my view with the binoculars. instead of being angry, i was jumping up and down at the reference for distance it gave me. i curse my luck for not having a working camera because it continued to rotate silently, it's tail spinning like that of a kite. after another 10 minutes the object briefly shimmered a bluish silver, obscuring its outline for the first time, and moving north very slowly. the tail seemed to drop away from the object and vanish before the object itself shimmered once more and became transparent. i say transparent because it was still visible in the binoculars. my fianc���e could no longer see it, but in the binoculars it seemed obscured as if hidden behind a cloud that wasn't there. it continued north until out of sight.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I had just crossed broadway on the way to the gas station to pick up something when i stepped into the mcdonalds parking lot and saw three pulsating star-like objects appear one at a time and ascend from north-east of sandia crest. this intrigued me and i continued to watch.  their initial ascent appeared not to be from the mountain itself, but rather i would guess that they appeared less than 500ft above the crest at some distance further east.  their initial trajectory reminded me of anti-aircraft artillery tracer fire.  they were ascending from the northeast to the southwest (directly towards the center of town.  what caught my eye was how absolutely brilliant they were - brighter than stars.  it is not unusual to witness bright reflections off aircraft in the area, but aircraft are different.  these were constantly strobing.  i can't imagine any man-made source of white light that bright in daylight.  if it were a reflection, it would have to have been a faceted surface, but then again the objects did not appear to have any mass.\r\n\r\nthey continued to ascend more slowly as they neared and gathered more distance between them.  at this point, i was still thinking that it was something related to the base, but then i saw the game changer.  they were ascending towards (if extrapolated) what appeared to be a translucent disk hovering several thousand feet above albuquerque - nearly overhead.  my first thought was that it was a weather balloon convinced that the bright lights were something on (an extremely long) tether. a lady was coming out to her car, which by this point, i was standing near. she asked me what i was looking at and i pointed it out to her.  we watched and discussed the objects in increasing disbelief as more and more people began to notice us watching and then witnessed the objects as well.  the entire incident lasted approximately 1/2-hour with the lady watching the latter 20 minutes of it with up to two-dozen other people observing them for varying periods of time.  \r\n\r\nthe three object continued to ascend and disperse around the sphere - still motionless - until they no longer appeared to pulsate, and did, in fact, resemble stars.  through the continued ascent, it was apparent to myself and the lady that the objects could not be on a tether, since they were now all around the sphere and appeared higher in perspective.  at this moment, we took note of a southwest flight descending to the sunport and agreed how odd it would be for kirtland afb to do something of this nature 1) over albuquerque proper and 2) not over their airspace and 3) still allowing commercial flights in the same vicinity.  \r\n\r\nthe three object began to become impossible to discern because of their altitude and the sun.  it was then that the sphere (where up until this point still looked like an oval) started to move north.  it then made a 90-degree turn east towards the mountains staying at a steady altitude, however the perspective this afforded us gave us the perception that the oval was actually an oblong sphere.  whenever the object changed direction, its orientation did not change.  we also could agree, judging by the mountains, that it was a couple thousand feet higher than the mountains.  it then moved north again.  while moving north, it did vary its speed both accelerating and decelerating sharply at speeds not inconsistent with commercial aircraft, but performing maneuvers more similar to helicopters (absolutely, this was not a helicopter).  it even appeared to do a tight horizontal corkscrew (like a whirlpool) before heading west while begining to ascend eventually disappearing (becoming so small, we could no longer see it).\r\n\r\nit was tan to translucent and shiny.  the whole time we thought how odd everything was.  i can't believe no one thought to take a picture.  we left thinking that we would see it on the evening news because we were all pretty sure whatever it was would have afforded northeast albuquerque quite the show.  i even called a station to ask them to investigate.  they said the sunport and kirtland afb didn't report anything and that basically i was nuts.  but two dozen people saw this. i must believe that their were more across town.  agreed, if it was kirtland, they wouldn't own up to it if it were their's (or something else), but we were certain others would have witnessed this enough to cause a stir in the news - but nothing?\r\n\r\ni know what i saw.  i know others saw what i saw.  i just don't know what they were.  true definition i suppose - unidentified - flying - objects.  not saying they were from space,

nothing can be observed through the trees (homes, et cetera). following the tree line, the trees in the back sort of curve around and behind the leftmost home and back to the street - so from my perspective on the ground, i have a larger view of the sky toward the center of this clearing made by the home construction and less of a view toward the left and right, as those tress were closer to me (left). trees toward the right followed the road back, but further view this direction was also obscured by trees on other lots further down. \r\n\r\nironically, we were talking about ufos and aliens when the sighting occurred.\r\n\r\nnot too long after james and i were on the phone a large craft became visible from behind the left of the tree line across the street.\r\n\r\nwhatever it was, it was moving extremely slow, i'm guessing appx. 5 miles per hour.  \r\n\r\nit was a black triangle. yes, i know how cliche this is, but it is what it is however, here's something that isn't cliche (at least i don;t believe it is). the triangle was moving backward. backward! \r\n\r\nat the time i wasn't, but i'm now an electrical engineer. i graduated top of my class from one of the best engineering departments in the country. i've worked with nasa. i've been weightless aboard a modified c9-b aircraft. i almost went to work for lockheed martin as a ballistic missiles systems engineer. the point i'm trying to make is that i now understand principles required for flight. i understand the dynamics involved and i know, without a fraction of a doubt, what i saw that night. here's the thing - it wasn't an airplane. it wasn't a balloon. it wasn't anything that i've ever seen... and i've looked, extensively. it also wasn't conforming to any conventional methods of flight. period. this thing used something else entirely. nothing that big can move that slow without utilizing a different technology altogether.   \r\n\r\nthe craft continued on an eastern-ly path. its course never shifted, nor did its speed. i was able to examine the craft for at least 3-8 mins. closely too! \r\n\r\nthe craft had two red lights and one white, systematically-blinking light.\r\n\r\neach light was in one corner of the ufo. the white light was at the back, or what i'm going to refer to as the top of the ufo. \r\n\r\nthe \"tail\" light blinked about every second or so - when it did blink, i could make out ridges, or lines running perpendicular to the \"base\" of the craft, well almost to the \"base,\" it was very large, so that light didn't illuminate the entire side of the craft... about 1/2-3/4 of it i'd say. \r\n\r\nthere weren't any other noticeable features. it wasn't shiny, as i recall the ridges' texture resembled something like that of a spray-in bed liner for pickup trucks. \r\n\r\nimmediately after seeing this thing in the sky, i made a comment to my friend on the phone and then, i'm guessing, let him go because of the excitement.\r\n\r\ni, hesitantly, ran into the house to try and grab a camera. there happened to one near the door, but the film was completely used so i had nothing to visually document the ufo.\r\n\r\nmy mother was asleep on the couch, and didn't wake up in time to witness the event.\r\n\r\ni ran back outside and observed the craft continue to move toward the east and then disappear behind the tree line.\r\n\r\nnot at any point did someone drive down the road. i've never seen anyone report this sighting and it's really boggling that no one did as a major highway runs to the west of that position. \r\n\r\ni'd love it if someone could let me know if there have been similar sightings. this is something that has been of extreme interest to me for some time now, for obvious reasons.  \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":47787,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.220214274387285,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06012013-0015","longitude":-94.22438110275775,"occurred":936169200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1370144552000,"summary":"Black triangle ufo flying backwards; very close sighting.
