2- & 2. it was one then another just behind & above the 1st. there were 6 like this , then there was one by itself kinda taking up the rear. they were extremely bright and a vivid orange. the brightest orange i've ever seen in the sky. there was a full or near full moon that night & they rivaled it's brightness, only they were of a much diferent color. let me say here that i am very familiar w/ all objects you see in the night sky. i have been an amateur astronomer since i was a kid in the late 60's-early 70's. i have a celestron telescope & have taken a lot of really good photos of nebulae, galaxies, etc. over the years. i also have a background in engineering & was a math major in college. i tell you this to let you know that i know every single thing that you would normally see in the sky.This was nothing i have ever seen before. these things were so unearthly looking, & strange that i can honestly say ,that when we stopped & i got out of the car on this lonely country road, i was actually scared. i mean they looked so unreal. they were heading south at a steady pace but not too fast.Depends on how close they were, but they didn't seem to be that far away ,because we seemed to be getting more up under them before we stopped. they were pulsing a bright orange & sometimes got brighter & then dim a bit. they were far bigger than anything in the sky with the exception of the moon.The point on the road where we stopped ,according to google earth was- 34 deg 52min 15sec n & 87 deg 08min 18.58sec w  as they got to the south of us the strangest thing of all happened. they just were gone. they were there & then they just were'nt. i have no idea where they went,but i'll tell you this, we were both shaken & a bit unsteady as we started to drive again. i want to stress again that we are not nut jobs or crazy people, just a normal couple (other than being musicians-haha) & this was something i just can't explain. my best friend is a florence ala. police officer & he can tell i don't usually run into things i can't explain. this was not any type of aircraft . when i got out & we turned the car off, they were dead silent , no sound at all.They were not planets ,i know all the planets & besides ,they were moving. they weren't meteors, they were too slow ( unless they were really far off -top of atmosphere)but i think they were much closer.They were not weather. were not fireworks, or flares. i thought of flares when i 1st saw them ,but but soon i could see that they were moving horizontally & intelligently. so anyway, i've gone through everything i can think of ,but i just can't think of anything that fits.The total duration was approx. 2 min. we felt strange for a few days & couldn't stop thinking about it. they were just so strange there are no words to truly describe them.............Steve","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":47743,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.8589898,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05302013-0016","longitude":-87.2086695,"occurred":1369454400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alabama","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1369965625000,"summary":"My wife & i were driving west . we saw 1st  one lite , then others as we came out of trees. 10 bright orange lights.","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/47743_submitter_file1__FlyingSaucersfri9pm52313.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"?","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":5,"locationName":"Rogersville, Alabama","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:2412"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Lawtell","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was in my back yard looking through my telescope. i was observing the sky with my naked eyes when i seen this light in the east start to light up slowly then was really bright for around 30 seconds then slowly dimmed to dark.  i went inside my house to start saving my telescope and came back out around 30 seconds later when i noticed the object(bright light) was now in the north eastern sky around 20 degrees.  it stayed bright for around 5 minutes this time move ne then disappeared. never really saw it moving just shining bright hovering. i cannot explain what i saw i just know what i seen.

with two friends, i noticed a brightly glowing object that appeared beneath power lines, to the right of a stand of trees, and above a house on a small hill. the object caught my attention because it appeared suddenly and was traveling in a different direction than the easily identifiable commercial aircraft that passed periodically overhead and followed an identical flight path. at first i thought the object might have been an airplane or helicopter with landing (or other) lights illuminated; but it was much brighter than any aircraft landing lights i had ever observed previously. it seemed to be traveling faster than the commercial aircraft in the sky. there were no blinking lights associated with this object. the glow suddenly faded over a period of approximately two seconds, transitioning from bright white, to soft blue-green, to faint blue-white. the object then disappeared. i mentioned the presence of the object to my friends, one of whom looked up just after it disappeared. i immediately wondered whether it was a satellite; although it had glowed brightly in a similar manner to a large meteor, it was moving much too slowly (800-1200 mph from my vantage point, assuming it was at roughly the same altitude as the commercial aircraft). the object then reappeared about six inches of sky to the right of its last observed location. it glowed a soft blue-green and faded to blue-white over a period of about three seconds. again, i told my friends. it disappeared again, at which time i concluded that it was not a satellite, as i had never seen one glow brightly, disappear, reappear, then disappear again; it was unlike any aircraft, meteor, or satellite i had seen before. my friend had looked up again, but was too late to see it. the object reappeared a final time, some five or six inches to the right of its previous location, and one or two inches farther north. it seemed to have changed direction slightly. i told my friends once more, and one of them looked up, then exclaimed that she saw it, too. (the other had not been paying attention.) again it glowed a soft blue-green and faded to a faint blue-white over a period of two or three seconds. i lost sight of the object when it did not reappear.

(which i had seen fly through the sky a few weeks earlier).  i immediately thought i was looking at arcturus or sirius, but sirius hadn't even risen above the horizon and i was able to locate arcturus in the eastern part of the night sky almost directly above me; but whatever i was looking at was far brighter than arcturus.  \r\ni then received a call from my brothers girlfriend and told her to go outside and look in the direction that i was witnessing the object.  the first thing she said when she found it in the sky was that it was pulsating and changing colors.  then she asked me what it was and if it could be a comet or asteroid.  i had explained that if it were either of these that we would be seriously screwed because it would have a trajectory path towards earth, and that it would be visible during the day time hours.  \r\nwhile on the phone with her i had grabbed a pair of binoculars and steady them with a tripod.  i was able to observe the object which was cylindrical in nature, like a cigar, rotate in the sky while changing colors and pulsating light.  at one point it actually looked like an upside down jellyfish.  it was very weird!  when i had finished speaking with her i grabbed my camera and mounted it on my tripod and tried taking a few shots of the object before it disappeared behind the tree line.  i sat there wondering what it was that i had just seen and why i wasn't seeing any other aircraft in the sky.  normally, i can sit and watch planes coming in to land at boston fly a specific flight path, where this object was located; hence why i initially thought it was an airplane.  \r\nthe following night i thought i would try to look in the same area for the object i observed and was amazed to see it in the night sky for a second night in a row!  i thought i could repeat the process on the third night, but it was no longer there.  i thought i would try and give it a shot on the fourth night and again no luck, however the planes that take the flight path where the object was witnessed finally began running again, leaving me to believe that it was not coming back.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Okay first i would like to say i have no idea what this was. i can only go by my memory of the event. but the event is still very vivid in my memory. i have never told anyone else about this but my wife. there was only 1 other witness to this phenomenon and unfortunately she passed away in 1999. i only asked her about it one time in my life about this indecent and that was in 1998 i think it was in sept/oct of that year. for many years i thought that what i experienced was a dream until me and her talked. she was my cousin and she also experienced what happened. this happened i think it was in 1989 or 1990 i can't be sure. but me and my cousin her name was aleshia was at a playground that was down the hill and behind her home in a place called the west end housing community. where the playground stood there is now a home. the entire housing project was tore down and rebuilt in 2004. it was a warm summer day and it was approximately 8pm. me and my cousin were sitting on a set of swings just talking and swinging back and forth. there was a basketball court about 30 feet from the playground. a couple of older kids that lived 4 houses down from my cousin were setting up a ramp made with 2x4's and a concrete cinder-block. they were riding a dirt bike and jumping the ramp. there was 3 of them. i didn't know them personally or know their names. i also have no idea if they experienced what me and my cousin experienced or not. as i was swinging i leaned my head back and that's when i first noticed it. in the distance across the railroad yard was a ball of light and it was rapidly changing colors. it looked to be at a good distance away but within about 5 seconds it was directly in front of us. the glowing ball was about the size of a basketball maybe a little bigger. me and my cousin both stopped swinging immediately and began to gaze at this object. for some reason she said nothing to me and i said nothing to her. we both were not afraid. i asked her in 1998. honestly i can't tell you what i was feeling because i felt nothing different then i normally did. as this ball of light hovered about 2 feet off the ground it slowly moved closer to us. i could have reached out and touched it if i wanted to that's how close it was. it was changing colors  the entire time. i couldn't tell you all the colors it flashed because there was so many. the ball proceeded to circle in between us and around us 2 times. as this was happening we both didn't move or say a word. it wasn't because we couldn't. i don't know how to explain it. it was like we just didn't seem to care. we didn't follow it with our eyes or anything. the object came back in front of us and suddenly there was a flash of light like a flash of a camera. then it was gone. for some strange reason neither one of us didn't even acknowledge what just happened. i did notice that right before the flash the sun was just starting to set. now it was almost dark. we both looked at each other and said our goodbye's and started our way home. my house was only 1 minute away. when i reached my home i seen the clock said 9:12. i remember when i left my house it was right before 8pm. the playground was only a minute away. so i figured about 45 minutes had passed since we seen the ball of light. me and her had no recollection of where those minutes had went. the guys riding the dirt-bike had packed up there ramp and was gone. neither of us remember seeing them leave. back in 1998 was the first time i ever mentioned it to her and even before i could finish my question she finished it for me. she looked at me with big eyes and said i thought that was a dream i had. well that's what i tried to convince myself all these years,but it wasn't once we compared notes we were both stunned. she was in the process of leaving to go get her daughter during this discussion. she told me we would talk about it at another time because she said she was now scared. well we really didn't see each other that much and before i got to talk to her about it she died in a car accident. now over the years i have never mentioned this no anyone. i just thought people would call me crazy. i don't have any memories of anything that happened during our lost time. but as a child before this incident i use to have some crazy night experiences. one thing that i remember was i use to hear knocking in the corner of my house on the roof. i thought maybe it was just my imagination,but this also happened at my grandmother's house also. the knocking was very loud and clear and the last time i remembered it happening was in 1997 at my grandmothers. well about 8 months ago i told my wife about all of this. and

our pool when my wife pointed out a \"white dot\" that appeared to be tumbling and falling over south hall county. we observed it for about 5 minutes before a cloud bank obscured it. it appeared to be shiny, depending on how the large surface was turned in our direction. it was erratic, and not under any apparent control. it had an erratic movement, both downward and laterally.  with the motion it displayed, occasionally a larger, reflection surface appeared to us.  we could not estimate the size, due to the altitude above the clouds, but had the idea of a tumbling door from an aircraft. when i realized it was moving laterally too occasionally, i went into the house to get my binoculars, but when i got back, it had disappeared behind the clouds and the tree line, based on the movements the last time we saw it.  this was in a north, northeast direction from us.  we speculated that it could have been maybe a door coming off an aluminum skinned aircraft. i have been watching out for
