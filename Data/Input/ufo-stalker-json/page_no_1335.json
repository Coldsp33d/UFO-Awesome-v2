sky. i have to mention, this is not the first time we've seen something in the same general area. the first time was on the 4th of july last year. but back to this incident. i looked up and saw the glowing red light and it did appear to be moving in a strange way, almost too slowly and in an indiscernible direction. i kept trying to make up my mind as to what it was. we live very close to the burbank airport so we see planes all the time. in this case, that familiarity allowed me to identify this as something different (again). we watched the light and i said \"is it still moving?\" i stared at it and noticed it moving slowly to the left and thought ok, maybe it's just a plane that's so far away it seems to be moving slowly. and then the light began to diminish very quickly, as though it were moving upward and out of view although i cannot say i saw anything move upward. it faded very steadily away into nothingness, almost evaporated. moments later, a helicopter appeared and shined a light into the general area. it flew past where the light was and left, circling back around our apartment building. neither my fiance nor myself noticed any sound from the helicopter although we may just have been excited, this being our second sighting. we also saw an airplane moments later and knew instantly that what we just saw was not any kind of aircraft we know about. as we looked at the plane i saw the red light flash one last time and go away. it occurs to me now that perhaps this was not the same red light. i can't be sure, but i am certain there was a second red flash after the first red-orange glowing light faded away.\r\n\r\nthe first sighting was very similar, although the light was blueish green and not red. that time it also zig zagged a lot more and clearly shot upward into the sky at an extreme speed i have never seen before. it was still daylight so that may be why i was able to see the departure better. there were also more witnesses to the first sighting. approximately 8.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path

light above the roof line of the apartment across the courtyard from me. i've seen that light before 6 years ago in south elgin illinois and thought to myself very excited \"they're back\". i quickly walked off the patio to the parking lot that's about 100 feet away to get a better view and was amazed to see 3 more light below the 1st light. these lights came up from due south at about the 10 o'clock position to the highest light and 9 0'clock to the lowest light. i checked my pockets for my cell phone for a camera and realized it was in the house on the coffee table. i chose to watch these lights that moved too slow for a fixed wing aircraft or helicopter. there was no noise from the lights as i tried to make as many observations as possible. these lights where orb or ball shaped and were mostly a deep but light admitting orange red color. after about 40 seconds real time even though it seemed longer, each light followed the same path of the one in front of it which was traveling upwards and to the n.W. simultaneously. all 4 light objects ascended in to the cloud deck that was aprox. 35 to 38,000 ft. up before going out of sight. this event took a total time of no more that 90 seconds from when i first observed them. i took note of the cloud wind direction which the upper level winds were coming from the north west to south east and these objects or lights were moving across the wind direction, leaving me to believe that there must have been some sort of propulsion to move them in that fashion. i walked back to my patio to get my cell phone to notify a friend when i saw a gentleman on the other side of my complex call to me and ask if i saw those lights too. his name is brian and he was clearly shook up by what he just saw and he dialed 911 from his cell to report this sighting. he asked me if i had seen them all and i told him yes i saw all four of them. he replied that he saw at least 20 of them just above tree top height and all but four had made a triangle formation and traveled off to the east and the remaining four were the lights that i described. we were discussing the event and the possibilities of what they might be other than ufos, we did conclude  they were not balloons or flares. a police officer from the st. charles pd did come out at that time and asked if we reported a 911 call. the two of us explained to the officer what we experienced and some details. the officer expressed that they felt badly that they had missed this event since they had heard of sighting like this in the past. the only other observation i can make and this is kind of hard to explain, these lights did not seem to have the ability to reflect light off of its surroundings. the full moon gives off an orah around it that admits light. these light objects did not seem to do this and reflected no light off airbourne particulates. anyway i am up for answering any questions you may have. thank you for reading and taking the time. i felt the

approximately 9:35pm i stepped outside into my backyard (in south newmarket) and immediately noticed a triangle of three white lights in the nw horizon, towards bradford/west gillimbury. they looked like stars, in terms of size and appearance, except that they had never been there before, and they glittered gently or fluttered a reddish colour, but were predominantly white.  i don't know how far away they were, but i held up my hand and the triangle was about the same size.  at first i thought they were helicopters, but as i watched them they didn't move.  a helicopter actually passed through the triangle while i stood there (about 10 minutes after i first saw them) going east or northeast.  after approximately 15 minutes i noticed that they were slowly descending, relative to the power lines stretched across the same section of sky, but the movement was extremely slow.  after about half an hour they had descended from about 20 degrees relative to the horizon to below the treeline and out of sight.  the triangle formation was maintained the entire time.  the bottom two went out of sight first, and by the time the topmost light had also slowly descended behind the treeline the bottom two would have either a)been on the ground, or b)been beyond the horizon, though it was hard for me to tell how far away they were.  i should also note that the \"fluttering\" or \"glimmering\" was very subtle when i first noticed them, but as they got lower and lower the effect intensified, and while i could still see the last one through the trees the effect was strongest, and that's also when the reddish hue was most noticeable.\r\n\r\nfor the duration there was no noticeable sound (ie: engines, propellers, etc), and there were no regular interval blinking lights as you might see on an aircraft (as i said, one actually passed through the formation (relative to my view of them, i think they were much farther away than the aircraft) with red and blue blinking lights, so i had

we spoke to no one about it.  i called you to make this report in an effort to see if anyone else has reported anything similar but i don't want any publicity and don't want to talk to anyone else.  the whole thing has me a little scared.   \r\n\r\nnote: we have seen balls of light in this area before, and have seen unidentified objects, but nothing as close or as dramatic as this.  my parents and grandparents owned this same land for many years, and they said that all kinds of weird stuff happened here but they did not talk about it much.  my mom and dad saw a ufo over clearwater lake in the early 1970's. i remember that my grandfather talked about some missing time and seeing a red fireball back in the 1940's, and that my parents always checked and locked all the doors and windows in the house at night, even during summer when it was cool enough to leave the windows open.  they didn't talk about it much but now that i think about it that was pretty strange, since we are far away from any other houses out here.
