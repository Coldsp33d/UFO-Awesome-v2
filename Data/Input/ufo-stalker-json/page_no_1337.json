talking and drinking one beer. we felt good and the weather was atmospheric. there were just a few clouds in the star-bright night sky. we were walking around the spreehafen in hamburg and at 23:00(approx.) a big and stationary spotlight appeared. my friend had seen this light before but we dont know where it comes from and why it is there. but it���������s a big city with a huge harbour so there���������s nothing to worry about. \r\n\r\nwe were looking at the nearly full moon and talked about it. we lowered our sights at the same time and witnessed a strange phenomenon:\r\na light in an oval or orblike shape appeared in the sky and flew for about a second in a continous straght line. its consistent and in comparison to the assumed altitude of 1000 ft/300 m slow speed could only be compared to a model aircraft. it had a flightangle of approx. 200 degrees in comparioson to the horizon and flew into the north. we both have interpreted this as a slightly shape changing but defined orb in a distance and altitude of ~1000 ft(when i���������m looking at a map the distace could have been much further afar). it was looking as if it wasn���������t in a relation with its environment unlike all these things that the public knows. it was more plasmatic and had no noise emissions. the strangest thing is that we were walking side by side and saw different colours. for me it was like a fireball and golden-yellow (homogenous, intense) but it definately had no tail or other outputs except light in its defined but not fixed shape. for her it was metallic white-blue. it disappeared without any interactions with its environment like it only had put its light off.\r\n\r\ni don���������t think that it was illuminated by the spotlight but i have not checked this possibility at the time.\r\n\r\ni was more excited because i���������m in the ufo and paranormal phenomenon topics for a longer time. nevertheless we continued our walk because we could not find anymore evidences for another sighting.\r\n\r\nwhile we were looking into the moon again and talking about a hypotetical relation to the sighting i���������ve turned around. wtf there was a fox chasing us in 30 ft/~10 m distance. it was looking at us four times while holding the distance. i heared a crowd of three random people coming towards us on the other side of the dike, so i went nearer to the fox to film it with my mobilephone because the fox would go away anyway at least when the noisy crowd is near enough. and so it happened. all in all the fox made a little confused but curious impression. i���������ve never heard of a fox chasing people in a industry and harbour /ghetto area... but there are many ducks to hunt.\r\n\r\nthe big spotlight with its source somewhere in the center of hamburg, maybe hafencity, turned off a few minutes after we���������ve seen the ufo and the fox.\r\n\r\nwe were excited and looked at the moon again at various times but there were no more incidents except some normal drunken or drugged people. i���������ve taken a photo of the spotlight and filmed the fox after i had time to grab my cellphone and make it film. the ufos presence was way too short for a documentation.\r\n\r\ni dont know what this ufo was or if it could have been an astronomic event (nothing had impact on its brightness and homogeneity!). maybe it���������s a weather phenomenon i don���������t know. it was a strong wish of mine to see something unexplainable at some time. now i���������m encouraged to continue my way with interesting phenomena and the search for the truth that lies behind our systems. i���������ve got a strange feelingmixture of sobriety and immediacy that lasts at least until now. peace","distance":"501 Feet - 1

viewers that day. at least 4 others saw the same thing se our location, prior to when we saw it. very simple. disc shaped and it looked like a disc that i had seen a picture of from the 1950's. it appeared to be silent and speed about 100-200 mph between cloud cover. full object was visble for under 20 seconds. i never doubted what we saw. the object was silver, like an airplane with what appeared to be rivited sections. it was definately not an airplane, blimp or any aircraft that i have ever seen flying. my father worked in los angeles for northrup aircraft in the 50's and rocketdine. he once showed us a photo of a very similar vehicle at the plant he worked at. i am very happy to report this sighting and i now know that someone else saw it. i think the other viewers were military personell. the flightpath from where they saw the object took it right above us. it was a mid-day sighting with partial clouds. we immediately told someone who replied that we were seeing stars and he laughed. i do not believe that extra-terrestrials come trillions of miles to earth on vacation and that they don't stop over for some r&r. i believe that my sighting was of a secret project by a government, maybe ours. i also don't believe that those same aliens come all that distance just to crash on the earth...So...I know what i saw and i believe that it was made here

things in the past at night, and to me, those instances were significant, but never made anything out of it.  so, i just leaned back and looked up.  there it was.  i questioned that maybe it was a bird, but i knew that this was entirely too high to be a bird or even a plane, b/c it was round in shape.  i thought maybe a balloon- particularly a weather balloon, but in the past i've seen those and have shiny exterior.    however, the more i looked, the more it simply hovered.  i thought i was losing my biscuits and looked away.  the logical individual in me was simply saying to myself that it had to be some kind of balloon, but the height it was at- that's no balloon.  i watched, and it suddenly seemed as if it started spinning vertically, if that makes sense?  i thought i saw wings, if that makes sense?  i actually rubbed my eyes, and turned.  then, i kept seeing it just hovering, and then it was really crazy- seemed like these orbs or what i'd say an axis is starting to emerge from both sides.  \r\n\r\ni almost felt like it knew i was watching.  again, i knew it wasn't an airplane, and still thinking a balloon?  then, it was like it was teasing me- sort of like a back and forth motion.  that's when i got on the phone to call my friend, and it started moving away.  needless to say, my mom, my neighbor were unavailable for me to tell them what i was seeing.  i only got in touch with them after the fact, and i had thought about taking a picture, but something stopped me from doing that.  \r\n\r\nwhatever it was- it was a dark, metallic color, round, and changed shapes,

the binoculars, we could barely make the lights with the naked eye).  best guess is that the lights were over or to the east of orlando (but appeared miles from the rocket) and that based on the relationship to the rocket, the lights were spaced 1 - 3 miles apart.  the lights then followed the rocket down range, then disappeared.  at a time when it appears the rocket booster seperated, at
