 but she didn't see it.  her eyes are bad, for one, and she'd been watching tv in a dark room when i called her so her eyes were having a hard time adjusting to the light i guess.\r\n\r\ni've been using the word \"dance\" to describe what they did because they really did dance.  it was breathtaking.  i've compared it to a marching band, or synchronized swimmers.  it was very whimsical, and almost musical.  i am having a hard time remembering the detail of each individual object -- i think they were circular or even football shaped, and i vaguely remember seeing a bright dot on at least one of them, but that could have been a star shining next to it or through it.  i also remember what looked like a flashing light on one, but that also could have just been the flicker of the stars.  i do know that they were 3 objects that interacted with eachother - not like aircraft, but like creatures.  it's weird, but... they seemed to interact like dolphins.    it was one of the most beautiful things i've ever seen in my life.  it lasted 30-40 seconds or so, i think.   to my dismay, they faded into the sky, still dancing.  i watched for another minute or two hoping they'd come back, but they were gone.  this sighting happened at 12am; the 2 hours before the actual sighting (10-2)were very eventful, i could easily file two or three other reports about the *other* things i saw last night.  i stayed out till about 2am, but absolutely nothing happened between 12 and 2.  :(","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:00:40","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":47579,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.67295326805444,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05222013-0015","longitude":-105.0087051176942,"occurred":1369206000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Disc,   Sphere,   Teardrop,   Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1369286247000,"summary":"3 lights formed shapes, danced in the sky","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"CO","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Englewood, Colorado","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:2900"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover), Unknown","city":"Grundy","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On 10/16/2012 i was working at a water injection well on deskins rd in vansant va. at about 1:00 pm we noticed a bright shining cylinder high in the sky. it apeard to spin from time to time and reflect the sun light. it hoverd in one spot for a long time and then it slowley started moving to our right. while watching this we noticed a orb which came out of know where moving around and then it descende towards us and went by on our right about 30 to 40 feet away. it was lit like a light bulb about the size of a tennis ball with something moving inside. it followed the road and went up into the tree line and we lost sight of it.One guy said when the small orbe went past he felt at peace. also there wase some other orbs up higher next to the main object.We also saw some jets just befor seeing the main object.And jets after seeing the main object.Also the cross shaped object flying frome right to left high in the sky it appeared to have a white glow to it. it was a very interesting day. and as i was saying there were multiple witnesses which were co-workers.And there was a feeling of excitement.The object moved off to the north west and i had to leave to return to the office.Up on arrival to the office other co-workers were asking if i saw the object.So some of them saw it to there were passenger jets flying by and the main object was at a higher altitude.

that's why i am here. i would like to start off by telling you that about 3 weeks ago i saw an unidentified flying object that looked like a fireball in the sky, and since then i have felt like i am being watched. two nights ago as i was about to go to sleep i saw something in my room through my peripheral vision. i don't remember going to sleep, but i do remember waking up in a metal room and i was lying on a metal bed and i was restrained. i struggled to turn my head and i saw many people lying in these metal beds just like mine and  i focused on one in particular which i realized was my sister, it seemed that everyone was in some state of unconsciousness. at that point i realized that something was very wrong and i was conscious of the scary situation i was in. i started to panic and tried to free myself. at that point i realized that i was surrounded by short beings, they were grayish in color and seemed oblivious to the fact that i was trying to fight my way out of the restraints. suddenly out of nowhere came a bright light and another being appeared, this one was taller and had a more oval shaped head with indentations in it and it was almost tan in color. it communicated with me telepathically and i asked it what it was doing to us and it said \"we are looking at your dna.\" i asked it why it was doing this to us and it replied \"all humans have alien dna, but not all humans have the same alien dna\"  i asked it where they were from and it said \"we come from sirius\" and it also told me that they have been coming to me for a long time. at that point it disappeared and my fear returned and i started screaming from the top of my lungs, the next thing i remember is jumping up from my bed screaming waking up everyone in the house.I haven't slept for 2 nights

an airplane when i see one and can even use the planes as a control to decide whether or not what im seeing is a ufo or plane.\r\n  the first ufo was one of the most amazing i've ever seen. i was on my way to the bank with my roommate when i saw just above the building outline a very bright star in the sky. this was around 5 p.M. so it was still very light out. it looked as if a bright bomb just went off. i stared untill the building blocked my view and went inside the bank to do my transaction. upon leaving the bank i immediately looked for this star again but what i saw next was incredible. it was no longer in the shape of a star but had the same intense brightness to it. it had elongated itself in just the ten minutes i was in the bank. it started as a large star shape and ended stretching across the sky. if i held my hand up to it to get a size it was about half the size of my pinky finger and im estimating it was a good 20 miles out from my position. this must have meant that it was huge in size. lots of other people had to of seen the same thing especially at my bank because i was pointing it out to anybody i could. my roommate seen it to but didnt think anything of it cause he hates when i talk about this stuff. but i watched it for as long as i could then went inside. after about an hour i came back out for a smoke and it was gone.\r\n  the next set of sightings all happened one after the other which i thought was odd considering ive never seen so many different looking ufo's in one sitting. i was calling my brother to talk to him about a  sighting we shared in a few years back in washingtons national forest. about 30 seconds into the call i looked up, as i always do, and noticed two star like bright shapes shooting across the sky directly towards a plane just taking off. i thought they were gonna crash so i started freaking out and my brother kept asking wats going on but i was just so transfixed on the situation above to answer. once they came close to the airplane they simply faded out and disappeared.\r\n  only a cople minutes after that last sight i was telling my brother what had just happened and was looking a little to the left from where i had just witnessed the two star tlike shaped and saw another incredible sight. it looked like a shooting star but instead of a straight line it kind of dotted across the sky and every dot it left behind was a different color. then disappeared just like a shooting star. the best thing about this sighting was that it looked as though it was only a couple hundred feet off the ground and maybe only a couple of blocks away from my backyard where i was during all these night sightings. \r\n  then i started to freak out about that and my brother was just puzzled as to what was going on. i looked off to the left and noticed 2 or 3 litttle uniformed lights bobbing and weaving in the sky. they were also star shaped. at this point i ran inside to get my other roommate who is very interested in these kind of thngs and pointed up to the sky where i had just seen the 2 or 3 light and saw in the distance, with my roommate as a second witness, a dim bluish greenish light coming right at us. as it neared it got very bright and very dim and kept dropping and increasing in elevation and it was going very very fast. it changed direction almost above our house then went straight for an airplane that was coming towards us and the ufo was going away from us. i could swear they almost hit and when they had come close it slowed way down and the plane it passed turned around incredibly fast for the size of the plane and stated chasing the craft,\r\n  after that i saw only the little satalite looking ufo's that would constant blink in and out of view as it flew over head. as soon as my other roommates came home i told them what had happened and i was all filled with joy. it was one of the most memerable nights i've ever had.

a clear night, and little wind. i was just a few houses away from home, when my son yells out \"ufo!\" i looked in the direction he indicated, on his side of the car, and didn't see anything. as i was turning right into my driveway, i looked again, and saw a red light. i parked the car in my front yard, and quickly exited, and rushed to the side of the garage that i expected the object to be more easily seen. i was not prepared for what i saw. i truly expected it to be a helicopter, because when i first saw it, it was where helicopters are often seen, going to our local hospital. what i saw was an object, taller than it was wide, moving in a direction that paralleled our local ridges. it was moving at a moderate speed, and it was a bright red. then, it changed color to a dark orange, but still a bright light. the color emminated from the entire object. as it continued on, the colors changed from bright red, to dark orange, then to a dull red, to dark orange, and back to bright red, in a pattern. and absolutely no sound. as it continued on it's path, it turned direction slightly more to the north. that's when i saw a small white round object, that seemed to come from around behind the main object, trailing it, and it made an orbit of the main object. when the smaller white light had come around the front of the main object, and went out of view behind it, the main object seemed to shrink, and just faded out. it didn't go out of view behind the ridge, or fade into the distance, it just disappeared. i wasn't aware my son was even next to me, until i heard him say \"where did it go?\" i replied \"i don't know.\" he then said \"that was a ufo, for sure.\" the time that i observed it, standing by the side of my garage, was less than two minutes. i was very focused as i was watching it, and felt kind of disturbed when it had gone. i asked my son if he had seen the little white light, and he said \"yes.\" i said \"good. i was hoping my vision hadn't blurred, or something.\" we went into the house, and talked about it for a few minutes, and then went to bed. it was late, and we both had to work the next day. \r\n","distance":"Over One
