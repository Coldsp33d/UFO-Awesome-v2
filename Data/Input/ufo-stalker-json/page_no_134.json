green light to the south, just before 11pm. it was blinking on and off every 2 seconds. naturally i first thought it was a plane since i'm only around 10 miles from the little rock airport.The shade of green was richer than plane lights, then i saw that was the only light-no red or white common to aircraft. as it moved straight west the speed was easily 3 to 4 times faster than aircraft-at that distance airplanes crawl along compared to this thing. the shade of green and speed is what got my attention, but then after traveling approximately 1/5 of the sky (horizon to horizon) it abruptly stopped without appearing to slow first. it then moved straight up an inch or so then stopped again, then moved back east to about where i first noticed it. this time i could detect a faint green glow on the object. it stopped again, then moved straight down and disappeared below the tree line which suggests it was heading south. each time it stopped and changed direction it took maybe one second. holding my bent arm up to the sky it seems to me had the object traveled from horizon to horizon it wouldn't have taken 30 to 40 seconds. needless to say i was a little pumped up seeing my first ufo in the 62 years i've been alive. i watched another 10 minutes or so but it didn't reappear. i came in and logged on to mufon's site but didn't see any reports of this type. had i stepped out earlier i bet you i would have had a longer time to observe it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:06:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with

seemed to try to hide behind a light pole. then he walked over to a brick pillar and hid behind that! i got an extremely strange vibe from that guy. possible man in black.

that got brighter. i focused my attention to it and realize it was not just one small light. \r\nto the naked eye you could see 5 lights, they were in a horizontal line about 15 degrees up from the horizon. the left light was red, the right light was white, and it looked as though the 3 in the middle faded from red to white perfectly. the white light on the right would become extremely bright then dim, then the middle orangish light would brighten to white then dim. sometimes it happened together, sometimes it was the light 2nd from the right. but the dominate light that was usually bright was furthest right.\r\ni ran upstairs where i keep space binoculars and watches it for almost two hours. i still could see no connection from one light to another, but they were truely in a straight line and stayed that way.. by the second hour i finally noticed how far away it looked that i couldn't even see it with my naked eye anymore. to me it seemed as though ever so slowly it got further away.\r\nin the beginning viewing it normally from red to white light was about an inch of sky, by the end so small it couldn't be measured.","distance":"Over One

plane, saw the same change in colors. as we watched, with naked eyes and binoculars, it seemed to be moving about in different directions very slowly. we could judge this by the trees and power-lines in the foreground. at times we had to walk to the end of our driveway to view it, only to have to return to the house to see it again when it moved in another direction. after about 15 minutes of

i work as a security guard, and i looked up into the sky to the west of my location. i observed what looked like sunlight reflecting off of a plane very high up, probably at least 100,000 feet altitude. it was above the wispy cloud layer. i observed that the  object  that appeared  to be  reflecting was not moving and just hanging in the  sky. \r\ni notified another guard and he also witnessed the object in the sky. i notified an additional guard, and at least three employees also were notified and observed the object.\r\ni checked my star and planet finder app on my phone and there were no stars or planets in that section of the sky. i attempted to look at the object with binoculars and could see it since it wasn’t moving, but it just appeared to be a white light. \r\nthe object stayed in the same location in the sky for roughly 30 minutes, then when checked periodically appeared to drift very slowly to the north. the object was in the sky in fairly geosynchronous orbit for over an hour. from 0830-0930. i took several photographs of the object with my phone.\r\ni notified another guard at a different facility, approximately 10 miles to the northeast of my facility and asked him if he could see it. he later advised me that he and at least one other guard at his facility did see the object, but not until 1300. this guard advised me that he saw the object to the north  east of my location, and possibly higher since it was harder to see than the photo i’d sent him. this guard advised me that he’d seen the object  for about 30 seconds before it  did a “j loop” and shot off to the southeast. this guard advised me that when the object left it appeared as if a shooting star or a comet, similar to the objects photographed and video-taped over  salt lake city between 09/15/17 and 09/17/17.\r\ni had work to do inside the building so i wasn’t able to observe the object after 0930. when i was next able to check at approximately 1020, i could no longer see the object, apparently because it had moved to the north and east of my location. this means the object remained in the sky over the valley for 4.5 hours.\r\na little about my background. i was a police officer for 9 years prior to becoming a security guard. i also have a military background. i do consider myself to be a trained observer with a lot of experience. the other guards who witnessed have varying levels of experience, one has military experience, the others are experienced security officers and also trained observers. \r\n","distance":"Over One

videoed taped the light, my camera phone kept ending the video after so many minutes so i had to keep re videoing it. it seemed at one point to split in half and move as two separate lights several miles apart from each other and then go back together again. hill air force base is less than 1/4 of a mile from me, but the mountain is not on the base. the light seemed very large, larger than a car. i watched it for 2 hours. then i saw two lights come towards me from a playground park area. they seemed to be ground level. they came towards me and then went back where they came from.\r\ni was really tired by now and went inside. i wish i'd stayed outside longer.\r\ni have seen red lights travel over the mountain and come back again on several occasions. \r\nwhen i went inside i viewed the

porch listening to music. it was around 10pm est. it was such a clear night that, when i looked directly up to the sky, i could see a few stars. i saw this one star that was brighter than the others directly above me that was slightly north of the other four stars next to it.  \r\napproximately five minutes went by and i looked up again.  that is when i saw a green light. it was the size of a dot and only slightly larger than the bright star i was looking at just a few minutes before.  it appeared to be very high in altitude in the night sky. probably thousands of feet up in the air well past the air space of regular air travel.\r\nit was to the left of the bright star that was slightly north of the other stars in the sky and directly over head. this green dot was flashing.  the green color was as vivid in color much like a traffic light. the flash was one flash per second.  \r\ni went inside to call my neighbor in order to get a second witness, but she was not home.  i came back outside thinking the object had gone away, but it was still there.  it then moved to the right slightly blocking the bright star.\r\nthe green flashing dot all of a sudden changed to a red flashing dot. same tempo of flashes and red color as vivid as a stop light.  for approximately one minute it flashed red and then slowly drifted east all the while flashing.  it moved east until the tall oak trees in my yard blocked my vision of the object in the sky. \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then
