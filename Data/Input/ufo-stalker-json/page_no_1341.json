as it seemed the objects were rotating as they flew past, and not in a very fast speed. i should also note they were very high up, barely recognizable to the naked eye. luckily i wear sunglasses with polarization and allow me to see things clearer. i should mention that the 3rd object i witnessed gave off a reddish color to it. not sure if it was glowing red or maybe the surface was red in nature.

very obvious and thought i must be imagining it being as it was late and i was tired. i looked out the window which faces north. i saw a flickering object. i thought it was a plane but as i watched it i realised it wasn't moving, just flickering similarly to how jets flicker with their wing and tail lights - except seemingly more condensed in size in side than the distance of aeroplane lights - i could not tell how far away it was, but it was fairly low in the sky. \r\n\r\nas i realised that's not a plane i opened the window to see clearer, and i thought \"that's a mental star, i've never seen a star flicker as much or as colourfully as that before.\" as if it was reacting to my thoughts it moved in an almost circle and went back to being stationary. so i waved (i like ufos i've seen loads since i was wee), and went to get my phone because it's the only camera i have at this time. \r\n\r\nit was still there when i got back but my phone's camera was unable to capture it and all the pictures i took are completely black asides where i've caught windows of flat's/apartments opposite mine.\r\n\r\ni gave up trying to photograph it and just watched with my window open for a while - i don't know the exact time when i first noticed it but when i got my phone the time was 0134. \r\n\r\nin the end i stopped watching it because i had things to do but i was rather pleased at having witnessed star friends in my vicinity. \r\n\r\nlater around 0400 i was exhausted and decided to curl up on my couch. i felt all these energy sensations which i am sensitive to and experience quite a lot of the time. i reached for my phone and switched on my ce-5 et contact tool app. it was going crazy with the alarm whenever i brought it near my head and my right shoulder which was cushioned against the back of the couch, and also sort of above me but diagonally to my left side. in the peripherals of my vision i saw 4 tall beings positioned around me - there may have been one to my back but i didn't think to look. \r\n\r\ni couldn't see them when looking straight on. in approximate guess to their height, i think they were between 7-9 feet tall - from my perspective of sitting under them it's hard to be more exact. \r\n\r\nthey made me feel very happy and peaceful - however i can not promise that they were a part of my ufo experience or if i was having one of my \"spiritual\" experiences, i am not able to say whether spiritual experiences and et contact experiences are much one and the same thing because often they feel similar. i think i fell asleep around half past 5am, at which point i have no further recollection of to add to this event. \r\n\r\ni posted asking if anybody else in glasgow had \"witnessed a ufo last night?\", on facebook in the ce-5 initiative group and was suggested to post my experience here. i really can not verify how long the ufo was there, and my eye sight is not the best and i am aware that my glasses make things look more distant at times. however i am certain it was a ufo, because i've seen so many - most recently most of my sightings have been shared with 1 or more people, but not last night's witnessing.\r\n\r\n(as a last note i apologise if i have filled out the tickboxes confusingly, i wasn't sure if i ought to include the tall lights as \"objects\").","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

evening television before going to bed, when we suddenly heard a distinct noise coming from our open window. my wife asked, \"what is that noise?\" to which i replied thinking it was a street sweeper (we live near a suburb construction site where street sweepers clean up the debris left on the civilian roads). when we realized it was \"not\" a street sweeper, we went on our front porch, where the distinct sound was getting \"louder.\" i told my wife i thought it was a helicopter, but could not see anything right away. \r\n\r\nright at that moment, an object appeared approx. about a mile (terrible with distance; could've been closer/farther - it was dark out being 9:15pm at night)from where we were standing. we were also not the only witnesses, as at least 3-5 of my neighbours stepped out of their homes asking what the noise was. the object was flying extremely low; lower than an aircraft.....It was then followed by at least \"6\" other object similar in appearance, all heading in a parallel formation, coming from northeast, headed westbound towards arnprior/almonte, on. when all of the object were clearly viewed, it sounded like a \"fleet of helicopters\" but clearly it was not helicopters.\r\n\r\nthe night sky made it very difficult to view the shape of the objects, but what was distinct was the multi-coloured blinking lights surrounding the objects as they flew by....The most distinct feature though was the \"noise\" i cannot stress how loud it was, and how it sounded like a fleet of helicopters.\r\n\r\ni got on the phone with the local city/311 asking if there were any reports.....They gave me a number for the local police. the local police operator heard what i witnessed and put me on hold....They then returned saying \"i am not crazy\" and that there was a \"counter terrorist drill\" being conducted by members of the rcmp and mp......Funny how i don't recall the rcmp having access to aircrafts.....And why would they conduct the drill so late (9:15pm the event lasted about 5min.) and why in a residential area with (some) farmland? they did not appear to be \"airplanes\" nor \"helicopters\" and i also cannot stress how \"low\" they were flying.....And though i am a terible judge of distance, i will say they looked to be flying only about 1 mile above our houses.\r\n\r\ncoincidentally, an earthquake occurred here today in ottawa, on where it originated west of here in arnprior, on (the direction the aircraft were flying). i recall when japan, chile and haiti had their earthquakes occur from 09-10', there was active ufo sightings occurring before the quake(s) hit.....The quake registered about 4.8 on the richter scale here in ottawa....\r\n\r\ni updated and inquired if anyone else heard/saw anything that night on my social networking outlets, and have received little-to-no feedback......Aside from my wife, and 4-5 neighbours who witnessed/heard this event, there has been nothing else to claim other than the slightly \"fishy\" report from the local police i received when i made the phone call.\r\n\r\ni am not one to fabricate a story like this, as i am not an \"avid\" ufo believer (though i do not think we are \"alone\" in the universe) but i can honestly say i have n-e-v-e-r encountered soemthing like this, and am looking for answers....\r\n\r\nagain event occurrence:\r\n\r\ndate: thur may 16, 2013\r\ntime: approx. 9:15pm\r\narea: kanata/ottawa, on canada\r\noccurence: 6-8 aircrafts flying \"extremely\" low coming from ne headed westbound towards almonte/arnprior, on area. noise was very distinct sounding like fleet of helicopters or a \"train\" with blinking flashing lights flying parralel. shape could not be verified as the evening was very dark. approx. street areas where the objects were flying - huntmar/palladium dr. kanata, on & hwy 417 - westbound.\r\n\r\nthis is not a joke, i have not seen anyhting like this and it was very bizarre, especially with the earthquake occurring the following day almost \"12hrs\" after the initial occurence.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

out and said look at the shooing star.The light was a beautiful blue green with a bright blue core. then it seemed to float like it was completely weightless. as it fell it didn't burn up but slowed down and moved in a zig-zag flight path above a treeline near norman creek in coorparoo. the location is a parkland and it is situated  underneath the flight path for the brisbane airport. this was flying way to low to be confused with a helicopter or some sort of toy. both my daughter and i were alone in the park and there certainly no kids out playing as we had just run near where we suspect it had landed. it was difficult to determine where it landed as it dipped behind the trees and i saw it slowly decent and move further north. both of us were very confused by the object but it seemed
