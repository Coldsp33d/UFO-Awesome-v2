 it went right over the road in front of me, moving from left to right as it appeared to begin to disintegrate over the tops of the trees, after which the trees blocked my view of it.  the trees here are oak and are not particularly tall, so this thing was flying pretty low.  i assumed it must have been a very low flying meteorite or something, but the more i look into that sort of thing, the less that seems plausible.  it happened at exactly 3:59 am by my car's clock, and it stunned me so much that i hit the brakes and stopped in the middle of the road.  i looked around to see if it was possible that someone had shot a flare or something, but nobody in the neighborhood was awake.  i never saw it entirely disintegrate;  it just looked like a shooting star had just shot passed me at close range and went over the trees.  i even braced for an impact as my mind calculated when it might hit.  there is a body of water nearby and it occurred to me that if it had landed, perhaps it landed in there.  i don't know what it was.  i don't believe in aliens, but it was definitely unidentified and it was definitely flying through the air.  i figure it must be debris or something, but nobody can explain it or why it was shooting sideways instead of either going straight up or down.  anyway, i figured i'd add my account to the list of weird sightings.  thanks for the chance.

of may 21st, 2013. i was simply relaxing and looking up at the sky observing as the clouds were moving in from the south soon to cover up the moon and stars. the cloud cover was spotty but getting more solid and quickly moving in to completely cover the open night sky and the moon. where i live the jets frequently pass overhead either coming to or leaving midway or o'hare airports which are about 25 and 40 miles north respectively. it is a familiar sight. this night there were various jets at various altitudes coming from varying directions literally every few minutes. i usually can hear them as or after they pass. i am very familiar with them and how they look. i was sitting just quietly watching the clouds roll in. i then noticed a dark form coming from the west over the trees, it was a winged object and my first fleeting thought was that it was a bird. it crossed the sky from w to e in just a few seconds. it was about 35 to 40 degrees from horizon. and i tried to follow it's progress east. it just struck me as odd. it just felt odd because after i thought about it for a second it didn't seem to flap at all, just glide. i got up and walked a few steps to see it as it went east but as i looked for it and it was just gone as if it flew into the cloud cover. i began to dismiss it as nothing. then i saw a brilliant light for a couple of seconds equal to the luminescence of venus coming right from where the object would have progressed. from my point of view about 35 degrees above horizon and to the southeast of me. it was shining either through or below the approaching cloud cover. the whole sighting from seeing the first dark shape to seeing the brilliant light lasted all of 10 seconds or so. i waited until today (may 24th) to report this because i wanted to look tonight at that point in the sky now that the skies are clear, and there are no bright stars or objects anywhere near that vicinity in the sky. if it were a lone bird gliding by (not flapping) that time of night then to traverse that amount of sky it would have had to be only slightly above treetop level and it would have been a quite large bird. if it were another object much higher in the sky then to traverse that distance in the sky it would have been traveling very fast and been much larger perhaps 100 feet or so. with no point of reference it's hard to determine altitude or size. the object was black and the night cover was very grey. there were at the time interval of the sighting, 2 jets in the observable sky at the time. one at a very high altitude (30,000 feet) going southeast and from my view moving slowly across the sky at about 80 degrees above horizon and still northwest of me. the other traveling south and at a lower altitude maybe 3000 feet or less and straight east of me at about 30 degrees above horizon. both had visible blinking lights and usual flight characteristics for a commercial jet. if the black object i observed was actually large and at high altitude i estimate it was on a course that would have brought it close to the later of the 2 observed jets had it stayed on course. i don't know what it was i'm only giving my best observations of the few

downloaded the pictures to my computer and whatever this light was it changed color and position around a fixed star that can only be seen when the pictures are increased in magnification. i got the

(this was when i lunged at my camera :d) as it \"bounced\" and turned around in place, i found it had red and blue smaller lights on it as well, although white was the surface color. after about a minute it swooped down lightning quick in a slant direction and started spinning fast while moving around a tilted elliptical path. that's also when it appeared to have shape-shifted. it's kind of hard to describe the new shape. it was like an oval this time with maybe 4 or 5 dark, wide vertical louvres shaped like eyelets that apparently stayed on the same side, from my point of view, while revolving.  it was spinning quickly but it was going around a bit slower. it just went round and round for like 10 or more times. i have no idea how it disappeared as the huge factory beside our house was covering the sight. i also wasn't able to see the full laps because of the obstruction, but im pretty sure of it's path as it reappeared from behind the factory every now and then. does this all make sense?!? haha\r\n\r\nthe event lasted for about 3-5 minutes. i don't know how far it was from me or how high above the ground it was. unfortunately, i was too stoked to remember where my video cam was and i was afraid i'd miss the thing if i looked for it. i would've wanted to see more tho :) it was quite an experience. but never seeing anything like it before, i'm still skeptical.

smoke, and i seen something moving across the sky with very bright red and white flashing lights. this object was not high enough for a plane, and there was no noise (except crickets),it moved slowly and the trees that it passed did not move at all. there was no ring of lights, or any other lights on the object as far as i could see. then as it approached a wooden area by a neighbors house it just stopped, and hovered right above the trees. a few seconds after it stopped a bright beam of white light appeared, blinding even though i was about a football field distance from it. this spotlight effect lasted for approximately 15-20 seconds, and went off as quickly as it had came on. when the spotlight went off the red and white flashing lights reappeared, and the object remained hovering for a few seconds and then exited right back the way it came, this is when i really got spooked, because i know planes can not go backwards. i tried watching for it to pass through my line of sight but i never seen it leave. this object moved very slow, and no noise what so ever, no humming or roaring of engines, no disturbance of the trees or fields, and it went backwards after displaying a spotlight.\r\ni wanted to share my sighting for others to feel comfortable sharing theirs.\r\nthank you,","distance":"101-500

former pilot and also a current amateur astronomer.  on the night of may 20th, 2013 at what i believe was probably between 9:00 and 9:30 p.M. i was viewing the planet saturn through my telescope using a 25mm eyepiece.  the telescope was a celestron nexstar 4se maksutov-cassagrain (4\" diameter objective) with a focal length of 1325mm.  therefore the magnification used was 53x.  as i looked at the planet, i observed a yellow disc shaped object move in an angled straight path across my field of view in the eyepiece.  it took about 3 seconds to cross the field of view and therefore was moving too slow to be a meteor.  it left a type of \"panning or ghost\" trail behind it that may have been due to the light itself crossing the path of the eyepiece.  it did not leave  a chem trial or meteoric type of trail that remained in view after the object passed.  i quickly stepped away from the telescope and looked up to see if i could observe the object visually but i could not.  it is quite possible that this object \"may\" have been a satellite and that the trailing stream behind it was more an optical illusion as the object passed through the field of view, due to its brightness, as i have already mentioned. the object, in the field of view, was definitely round, was steady in yellow color and did not have any other lights, aircraft lights or blinking lights functioning.  it appeared solid in color.  the trail or panning effect of a trail behind it was also yellow.  in the telescope field of view the disc of the object was smaller than the disc of the planet saturn as it passed.  i would estimate that the disc appeared to be just larger than the size of the tip of a ballpoint pen when viewing it through the telescope.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

trees. i would have to say it had to be going mock 3 or so. i used to live near an air base so i've seen lots of air craft flying over head and at high speeds. this thing was moving so fast it made the planes look like they where standing still and made no noise at all. i came so close to deleting it off my phone. i would like to say that years before i saw an sr 71 and a f18 fly down the same
