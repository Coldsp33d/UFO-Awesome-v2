one appeared, it was not cloudy nor was it hidden behind a building, tree, etc. the three than proceeded to make a check mark formation, still remaining just as big and bright and not flashing or

wife, child, and i went out stargazing with some of our telescopes. we live in chino california about 36 miles east of los angeles so out light pollution and smog doesn't give us the best night sky views, but due to high temperatures and a light breeze the moisture and smog were all but gone and besides fighting the light pollution it was a particularly clear night. great views of the crescent moon, saturn, and jupiter, i am an astronomer with my masters degree in astrophysics, i hold a b.S. degree in aviation science, and a a.S. degree in air traffic control. i am very active in tracking passing satellites, the iss as well as other low earth orbit objects that can readily be seen with the naked eye or a decent pair of binoculars. so after our great night of gazing we packed up and headed for home, after getting all of the gear safely back into the house i stopped for one more to gander at the sky to take in just how amazingly clear the stars were it was 10:28pm, and i noticed two very bright blue/white stars that seemed misplaced around -2 magnitude. they were located near arcturus and were not part of the bo���tis constellation. as i watched them  for about 2 min. they dimmed down to about -0.5 magnitude and quickly started in the north eastern direction, their distance apart from each other did not fluxuate and they dimmed and started motion at the exact same time. it took them roughly 3 min. to disappear in the ne horizon. in comparison the iss takes roughly 10 mins to clear horizon to horizon, at 290 miles up and 17,000 mph. these two objects appeared to be higher up than that and moving about 3 times as fast. i use an app on my phone called satellitear which will show very accurate locations of any potentially visible satellites. the two objects in question did not match the locations of any publicly known satellites or iridium flares. i am a man of science and i like logical explanations for things, and this occurrence is above what i can personally classify. i am very interested to see if anyone else saw this occurrence it was rather astonishing to witness. i wish i had my equipment still set up because all my recording devices were packed away in the house at that time. i didn't feel or hear anything outside of the normal region that i live in.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

me saw the object. when it came into my view, it was an orb the color of a strong fire. there was some flickering but the orange fiery light emitted remained constant through the arced path; despite it's relative direction of travel to us. distance and size was difficult to determine, but i would guess at it being about 1000 ft. up and about the size of a car. the light intensity was approx. the strength of a street lamp at 200ft. distance from us would have been no more than about 1/2 a mile away. it traveled silently at a rate of approx. 5-7 degrees of view per second at it's broadest section of it's arc. lost sight due to distance, trees and other ground obstructions.\r\n\r\nthere were airplanes noted some time after the event, but it was obvious that what we saw was not an airplane.\r\n\r\neveryone was generally excited and giddy over the event though i was likely the most enthusiastic as experiencing an event like this was on my bucket list.\r\n\r\nthe object returned 2-3 hours later from the same direction and arc, but further away, perhaps 5 degrees lower from our perspective and bringing our viewing lower into the nearby trees. a late comer to our gathering observed this second passing and thought they saw a more mechanical blinking rather than a flickering as first observed.\r\n\r\nwe unfortunately didn't have any recording devices with us; being around water, but i have made an overlay on a map that describes the likely flight path of this object based on where we saw it appear and leave from our position.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

guam, on 12 may, at about 1945 local time (0945 gmt) both my wife and i saw 3 separate, bright (venus bright) red, moving  lights in the western sky.  the 3 lights were at about 15-20 degrees of elevation and about 245 to 260 degrees of azimuth.   they were separated by about 5 degrees of azimuth, at approximately the same elevation, and all three were near the elevation of orion, the moon and jupiter, but approximately 15 degrees south of them.\r\n\r\nthe objects made no noise that we heard, but moved towards us (to the east) and then made hairpin turns to the wnw and faded into the night sky.   the entire event lasted no longer than about 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nwe called atcc at both the won pat international airport and anderson air force base.  neither reported seeing anything on their radar during that time period.\r\n\r\none of us is a private civilian pilot and a holder of a ph. d. in oceanography with much experience observing the night sky.  nothing of this nature has
