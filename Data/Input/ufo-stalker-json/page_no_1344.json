at this time,directly in front of me. my first thought was that it was a very large falling star but quickly realized it was flying a straight path across the sky to the north. i also quickly realized it resembled nothing i had seen in the past such as a helicopter, weather balloon or airplane. it had no flashing or multicolored lights like you would see on an airplane or helicopter. i pulled over on the side of the rode trying to find my iphone which took me several seconds.  i finally found it and jumped out of the car.  by this time it was to the west. it was spherical and a dark orange in color.  the center of the sphere was a pale yellow or off-white color. by the time i got my phone on video mode, it was going behind a tree then vanished before i could reposition myself on the other side of the tree.  it must have turned toward the nw but seemed to have disappeared very quickly.  if it was an airplane, i should have been able to see the lights once i was on the right sight of the tree.  another witness had stopped to watch it down the road from me.  she was heading ne. she drove up to where i was parked and said, \"did you just see that?\"  we both were nervous and excited about what we had just witnessed. neither one of us had ever seen anything like it before and we are both over 40. we had the exact same perceptions re: color, speed, size, etc.  and both agreed it

still was no noise from a craft. there were no planes in the sky,as flights come over our area day and night enroute to large airports.\r\n3)when i first saw them i knew that they were ufo's as i knew

southwest of waldron, arkansas) in the late 1990s on a night fishing trip. last month, we decided to go back and see what we could see, since i just purchased a very nice dslr camera, tripod, wide-angle lense and large sd card. we wanted to capture something on film. so, i took my dad and two oldest sisters out for a few hours of photography. at the very least, there is little light polution out there, and i would hopefully capture nice star pictures. after not seeing anything, and taking 196 time-elapse photos of fifteen seconds per, i got home and began looking at the pictures. something looked like an odd streak, and so it caught my eye and i brightened the image and saw a lot more. if you have an address for me to send this photo (either the nef raw image, the un-edited jpeg image or the brightened jpeg image), please let me know. i cannot explain this. i have seen planes, satellites, the iss, meteors, and various birds, but nothing can account for the luminescence captured since there was very little light where we were at, the random patterns captured, the lack of any noise made, the fact that they only occurred in one of the almost 200 photos, or the fact that none of us saw these things. my camera is a nikon d5200, shoots 24.1 mpxl pictures, tamron 17-50 mm xr di ii vc lense, iso 1250, f/2.8, 15 second exposure, tripod was in use, star pattern is established, no editing to either jpeg or nef raw image, except i did brighten and \"save as\" a jpeg image to see more detail. if anyone would like to see it, the brightened one is about a ten megabyte file as a jpeg. just let me know where to send it and which one you want. you have my word of honor this is not a trick, hoax, photo-editing magic or anything of that sort. this is as i

gable end house of a terrace at around 10.30 pm observing the sky which i do on a regular basis..It was very clear night no cloud at all...A slight breeze but nothing that noticeable......I have seen high altitude objects before but have never been 100% that they weren't satellites or the i.S.S.....But this time...This was different....These objects were bigger than usual...I noticed the objects because im always out looking at the sky on good clear nights...The first object i saw was high altitude it was arcing it's trajectory and pulsating  100% it wasn't a plane...No flashing lights , no sound....I live on a flight path for manchester airport ...I know what planes look like...This was no plane, judging by the height this thing was at it must of been a large object...I watched it cross the sky and out of sight...I continued to watch hoping to see more...I wasn't disappointed...About a minute or 2 later ...Another one...Exactly the same...High altitude..Pulsating...Exact same trajectory across the sky....Both moving quite quickly aswell but long enough for me to watch them move across the sky for gotta be close to a minute or so....Another minute or so after the 2nd high altitude one disappears out of sight...Bammm...2 orangey/reddish coloured balls of light just appear out of thin air over the tops of the houses behind mine....I was facing north and they appeared to the right hand side to me .......2 separate craft...I would say roughly around 20 or so feet above the rooftops...Could of even been less...But i can tell you it was close!!...They were side by side with only a few feet between them....They arced there trajectory and shot around past me from the east over my head ..They then flew west at speed and were moving in sort of a rollercoaster style movement..They then began to twist around each other in sort of a double helix ...Then straight forwards again side by side but moving away from each other outwards...Then back in ..Then back out...In again..Out...They kept doing this until they flew over the rooftops of the houses in front of mine which are a couple of hundred yards away....It didnt take long for them to go out of sight...I only witnessed these  2 craft for what only seemed like about 20 seconds or so....But seconds that will be permanently engrained in my memory for the rest of my life i can assure you.....But thats not the end....Only a minute or so after the 2 glowing orb type craft i saw another high altitude craft doing exactly the same as the other 2 high altitude craft ...Pulsating...Same trajectory..Etc.....All of these \"objects\" that i saw all with no sound...I would love to know if anyone else saw it.... completely blown my mind!!! ....And i consider myself a bit of a researcher on ufology and the like...Iv been awake for roughly 8 years or so..Iv recently become more concious and spiritually minded ...Whether that has anything to do with what i witnessed ...Who knows...I dont know maybe im putting out that vibration and energy that i want to experience these things or that i am open to them in a positive way....I dunno..But this was just simply awesome!!....Like i said iv seen things before but never 100% certain on what i saw...But this was the real deal....No doubt what so ever in my mind!!!! anyway ..I dont know even know if anyone will read this...I hope so...I just thought it needed to be reported in case anyone has had similar experiences or could use the info...Btw unfortunately i didnt get chance to film anything....My mobile phone isn't the best and way to shabby to catch the high altitude objects ...And the 2 orbs were just way to quick for me too react...And to be honest i was just way too gobsmacked to think about reaching into my pocket!! sorry about that!! :) ..Hope this is useful to someone :)","distance":"21-100 Feet, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path

sleep. so i got up at i'm guessing around 2am to look out the window to quell my boredom. my view of the sky was obstructed due to the over hang of our house and the neighbors roof. the space machine came soon after i went to the window, within 30 seconds. it came over the neighbors house towards our house and over it heading north. it was massive in size! it moved slowly and silently. it was the size and shape of a football stadium. i only saw the belly of the machine, the lights are still to this day undecidable. the entire thing was lite up and also had intricate lighting shades the same color detailing \"instruments\", to say it was neon lighting does it no justice. but that is the closest i can come to describing it. the absolute beauty of this machine was amazing. it simply glided over the house and i assume continued on it path north. i was fixed on looking at the object so i don't know if the ground was lite up. i was not scared at all, i was in complete awww, i new it was not from this planet. i told no one, not even my brother for years, back then you just didn't talk about stuff like that. i will always regret not doing more at the time but i was just a kid. i did also check my self at the time to insure i was not dreaming. i did thou do my own interrogation the next day of our company but i found out nothing. i will disclose every thing if i am asked. it's

live. across the bridge on the reservation. i was singing some songs, waiting for bites, watching the sky. i could determine some stars from planets, and constellations. i seen a few airplanes going by really really high. i seen on the river a reflection of purple. it was a dark, royal purple. it wasn't very bright on the water, but i could see it. at first i didn't know what to think. maybe could be something floating in the water. then i noticed it was just a reflection somehow purple in that spot just like how the moon light reflects off the water. a certain spot was purple. that was a bout a half mile away.\r\n\r\n i looked up w. - s.W. over the river towards the dark hilly horizon to my right, from where i was. i thought i seen something in the sky and im sure i did because it kept getting closer. it's dark out here and there were not any lights on the exterior of this craft. i could see through the windows it was like hover/flying/descending west of me heading n.E from where ever it came from. from where i was at. i noticed that it was a craft and who ever was controlling it was having difficulty with it. i landed in shallow water west of me on a slope. the front of the craft sideways and facing the water/slope.  then it pretty much vanished. it looked like it was moving forward into the water. maybe it was an accident, something obviously went wrong. i couldn't move. i stood there and watched this happen. by the time i realized it was gone, however, i started to head up to the land from the shore so i could travel easier to the site instead of going along the shore. by the time i got there about the length of two cigs. i saw two bean shaped pods come out of the water. they weren't just shaped like beans. that was just the shape of the cockpit of each craft. which seemed reasonably aerodynamic. i figured they came from the craft that just submerged 10 minutes prior. they hovered out of the water. the crafts faced me in moonlit darkness, and about faced and took off. i watched them fade into the distance toward the south. i went back to my fishing spot and started to pack up. on my way home i was driving up the hill on the other side of the bridge and as soon as i got to the top i seen a purple looking star and then it made itself into a line. it went from the south direction in the sky i was driving almost straight, yet a little left  - into space. i don't remember getting home which was only a mile away. i just remember that and then i woke up thinking of the whole event. then i went fishing again til around noon. today. same spot. couldn't see deep enough into the water to tell if main craft was still down there. there was obviously something in the water though. you could see sort of in the shale under water in the shallow

bright points in the sky over the city of binghamton. these points of light were much brighter than anything i've seen in the sky. at first glance i thought the lights were airplanes flying away from me which gave them the appearance of floating. they steadily arose into the sky displaying a brilliant red color with a pulsing yellow to orange interior. i thought they could have been chinese lanterns, but as the first two objects drifted into the clouds, out of sight, two more lifted into the sky, and didn't take the same flight path. over the next 20 minutes my girlfriend and i witnessed a total of ten glowing objects rise and vanish into the nne to nnw. i felt a sense of surprise and wonder as i peered at the objects through the binoculars. my heart rate increased and i almost felt a sense panic also. since the sightings last night, i still feel a strong urge to find out what they were. i cant get them out of my head.\r\n     thank you for taking the time to hear of my
