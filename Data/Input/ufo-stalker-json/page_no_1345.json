then back to refocus and realized that it was moving,off to the right. after a fer seconds it just disappeared. i didn't see any clouds at all and thought it was strange but it must have been a satellite. but right after it disappeared i noticed another one moving in the same direction same same level as if it were following the first one and disappeared just about the same spot. i thought to myself there is no way that that was a plane,or a satellite. i had never seen 2 satellites following each other before.I don't recall any color and they were not blinking,they looked just like all the other stars in the sky. i text ed my roommate to tell him that's how i got the time. the next day i was at work and i found a post from someone online that i believe saw the same thing. ufo

mockingbird that was singing. i was taken aback by this very bright rectangular light in the distance. i live on the golf course tee and it looked to be at about the putting hole. \r\n\r\nmy first thought was, \"what's that doing there?\". it was a large, vertical, rectangular object that was brightly lit as if with led lights. it seemed to have the structure of a box kite. there were some secondary lights on the edges (or coming from within) that looked a little reddish/bluish and projected off of it... kind of starry and flickery. like if you were squinting at a led yard light. but this was up in the air about 100 to 500 feet. \r\n\r\nit appeared to travel closer and looked about the size of a semi truck trailer when it stopped a few hundred feet from me. i had turned off the patio light and walked into the yard to observe it at different angles. when it got closer i realized it was not something normal and i wanted to take a picture. by the time i got my cell phone and came back out (15 seconds)it was gone. it didn't appear to have passed by my house as i looked in other directions.\r\n\r\nit made no noise and my two dogs and the noisy mockingbird were totally unaware. i never felt threatened just dumbstruck over what seemed to be hovering in front of me. it made no more sense to me than if i had seen a large billboard \"floating\" over the golf course in the middle of the day!\r\n\r\nthis is my first time to see something like this. i do believe in the possibility of ufos but never expected this to happen to me. this morning i am trying to find an

for orion, i noticed a faint point of light that seemed to be moving near where i thought the constellation should be. as i watched, the object flickered and began a rapid acceleration away from the patch of sky i was watching and disappeared over the mountains to the southwest. a short time later, in the same general area, after orion's belt became visible, a similar pinpoint of light (faint star-like) caught my attention, but closer to directly south of my location. again, it flickered and moved away at a seemingly impossible speed, leaving a faint streak as it accelerated. this same type of \"light\" appeared over and over, in more or less the same general area of the sky for an extended period of time, each time ending with the light flickering slightly then accelerating away at fantastic speed until i lost sight of them.\r\n\r\nalthough not shown in the check boxes above (because the options you offer do not cover the general observations i observed) i noticed the same thing happening in nearly every sector of the sky, around the clock, only during the day they are much more visible (provided the sky is not cloudy) and the objects are easily visible to the naked eye if you know where and when to look. the flashes during the day are as bright as a flash bulb going off and i can see the distortion of the air around the objects, then, when several are in formation, they all fly off at a high volocity.\r\n\r\ni have been watching this happen now for about two weeks and have noticed that there are several maneuvers the objects make that i had not noticed before; as a formation moves away, it will stop briefly then accelerate at a right angle, dip slightly at which time several of the objects in the formation will sling-shot away from the main body of formation, often in different directions but most often straight up, showing a faint trail/tail of light behind each, each exceeding the altitude of the previous object until there are 5, 6, or 7 tiers high, then the entire formation accelerates away in the new direction at unbelievable speed leaving a disturbance in the atmosphere that can be seen by the naked eye. i have tracked them orbiting the laveen area while i put a laser on them until i get too dizzy to keep up, then they jet away -- out of sight. (when i put the laser on them, they don't leave until i stop tracking them with the beam). this has been happening around the clock as far as i can tell and i have counted as many as one craft per second materializing and joining a formation, then going into the above described behavior over and over again; the highest number i have counted in one formation is 20 before it started moving away and i lost count.\r\n\r\nmy sightings are not limited to just laveen/south phoenix; i have observed them in north phoenix, the west valley, the apache junction area and over the reservation to the south of phoenix. when viewed from the side at a distance, i can make out an actual vessel above the distortion. in addition, i have now noticed that this same activity has been captured on video where the subject being filmed is outdoors with a lot of sky in the background, on television. i have captured these activities myself on a small kodak ten mp still/video camera from my back yard (video files attached). i do not have the expertise or software/hardware to edit the clarity or contrast of the footage, but someone with the right equipment and software can clean it up and make the objects stand out better. please note that the time/date stamp on the files is off because the battery went dead and i did not reset the time and date on the camera.\r\n\r\nif you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at the number above.\r\n\r\nkind regards","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering

above the tree tops to my left. i noticed one light dropping or separating from the light above it. these lights were large orange lights.\r\nto best describe the size and shape of these lights, i will say they appear to be similar to, but larger than the lights of a large commercial aircraft landing headlights that turn on as jets approach runways for landing, at close range. roughly 10 times large than the oncoming traffic headlights. my first thought was that a small plane was on fire, falling out of the sky and breaking apart into pieces and about to crash into the forest next to the road, except that the lights disappeared  as i noticed them and there was no sound of a plane.  when i first noticed the lights they seam to be getting brighter then a second later they were fading out, as they separated from each other, with one light dropping below the other, then two visible lights disappearing.\r\n\r\ni thought that this was odd, as i scanned my rear view window to see if i heard or saw anything else i  wondered if any one else saw what i saw. \r\n\r\ni continued to drive on about another 10 minutes. my never lost nav. read out said 11 miles to sebring with a straight stretch of dark road in front of me and one blue van traveling about 1/16 of a mile in front of me, maybe one car about the same distance behind me.\r\n\r\nat about 9:00 pm straight in front of me about 45 degrees on the horizon at approximately 750 to 1000 feet above me , about ��� mile away ( hard to estimate?) i saw a bright orange light pop on, same as i had seen 10 minutes earlier. it just began to appear first small then large and larger until it was very bright like something was turning on, or powering up, and then it dimmed down and disappeared completely. it had my attention. then a second later a second light below the first and a little to the right  seamed to also fired up to a familiar bright flare and then dimmed down. this pattern repeated it self again as i was scanning the side of the road trying to navigate the size of the shoulder to pull over. unfortunately a very narrow gravel shoulder and dark descending grassy embankment left me no option to pull over with traffic approaching behind me. i assessed i could cause an accident or lose control of the car if i tried to quickly pull over so i just slowed down and continued to watch the sky as this second pattern of each light turning on, flaring up, and dimming down repeated itself. just then a third light appeared even further to the right.  at about the same height and did the same flair up and dim down expression. then all of the sudden there were 7 to 9 lights coming on all in a symphony in front of me, fairing up in varied stages, not at starting at the same second but with in seconds of each other, each flaring in a random pattern in front of me, then they started to move as some blinked on and off while they appeared to dance with each other in what impressed me as a joyous playful dance with each other.  i had the feeling that the lights knew i saw them and the lights interacted with each other in an intentional way. \r\nit did not seam to me to be a single large object with lights moving around on its surface, but it was very dark. i could see random stars in the sky after these bright lights dimed out.  this whole dancing lights sighting only lasted about one minute, with all the lights fading out quickly.  it has taken me far longer to write this recall  of the sightings than it took for me to experience the events. \r\n\r\ni continued to scan the sky for additional orange lights but saw none. i did see something else unusual as i continued to drive east toward sebring. i saw what look like a dotted line of small white lights in a strobe fashion blinking in a long skinny line changing direction across a section of the sky straight in front of me.  frist moving right to left then left to right. this happened repeatedly for several minutes as i drove.  this was ongoing and the lights were very dim white lights. this seamed odd as well but so much less significant to what i had just seen i dismissed it as insignificant.\r\n\r\nwith 10 minutes of the large orange light sighting, i arrived at the hotel i was staying at for a ufo conference hosted by paola harris in sebring florida.  as i drove into the parking lot i saw a group of people standing out side looking up and i suspected they could have see what i just saw. so as i passed them i rolled down my window and shouted ���did any of you just see a large display of large orange lights���? one woman and her husband saw the same event minutes earlier. they saw large orange lights as they were walking out side the chateau elan hotel adjacent to the sebring raceway. \r\n\r\n","distance":"501

(i am 61 and my sister is 63. her best friend is about our age...) i thought someone had fallen down or something similar...When i got to where they were, outside on a patio deck connected to the house - i could now hear clearly what they were yelling. they were saying, ufo, look!!! a ufo look...!!! \r\nwhen i looked at what they were pointing to, i was sort of disappointed because i was expecting a saucer of something that was solid. instead, what i say confused me because i remember saying to myself, 'how are they doing that?' what i was looking at appeared to be a roller coaster ride up in the sky about 50 feet above the distant treeline.\r\na roller coaster ride though has a beginning and an end which i couldn't see. when this 'roller coaster' just kept traveling, i thought - wait a minute, that's not possible...This was an inner dialogue that i was having as i'm watching the objects and the time that this took for me to realize something was 'wrong' was about 10 seconds.\r\nthe objects were reddish orange balls and seemed to be in groups of 4-6 connected in groups that were part of a 'train' that undulate up and down and i think initially seemed to emit a glow like trail inside or part of each group of balls..As i've said, they were going up and down, side-ways and moving in a direction - very much like a roller coaster would, except much more exaggerated as they got closer, or moved in a direction.\r\nthe first appearance seemed to originate from patchogue, coming from the south shore. this train of balls or roller coaster lights moved slightly west, towards us...\r\ni ran downstairs to the basement and retrieved a digital camera, ran back up and started to nervously taking photos. they seemed to slow down and spread apart always moving - except for a few seconds. some of the lights seemed to freeze as i was taking pictures. they regrouped after a few seconds and continued in a north, north easterly direction - until the lights seemed to fade out or just turn off...\r\ni would say that they seemed to maintain a general altitude of about 100 ft and they were about one mile away. hard to say...Whatever it was had an order or control or intelligence that seemed 'special' and flew with a purpose of some type.\r\nit was a clear night and we could see at least two commercial airliners flying in the sky during the time we were seeing these objects. the commercial jets that we saw looked primitive compared to how these other objects traveled. our jets flew much slow, blue lights blinking and in straight lines.\r\nalthough i was very nervous i did take at least 3 or 4 photos which i will include. i called 911 and i was instructed to call some government agency that dealt with reports of terrestrial air plane problems. i forget the agency name. i called them and gave them this story but i gave some inaccurate info. i told the guy that the objects were heading in a southwesterly direction instead of north, north easterly direction. he took the info and said thank you and good bye.

but now i may be dying, and want this told to someone, whether investigated or not.)\r\ni was out on our brick patio behind the house, with a clear view of 200 degrees or so, from southeast, arcing through west, to northeast. the morning was clear, although there had been some clouds earlier (and before midnight on the 15th). i do not recall the phase or position of the moon. a flash of light to my left, roughly 220 degrees true, (i am a retired submarine navigator)and position angle about 20. the object moved slowly and steadily toward the west, which was from my left to my right, as i had been facing west. \r\ni could not at that time judge distance or size - but if it had been a ship at sea, i'd have estimated its angle-on-the-bow, based on its direction of travel, to be about starboard 10 to 20. there was nothing under it that i could see. from knowing this area, i know that at that time, the land in that direction was crop-fields for corn and soya, early in the season for either. since that time a few housing developments have been built. \r\nmy first chance to get an idea of size and distance came after several minutes, when the  object flew over the southern end of a long tree-line, which ran south-to-north for about 1.5 miles. the tree-line's closest point to my house is slightly under a mile (land measurements given here). once over the tree-line, i could confirm what before i had known might be an optical illusion:  the course and speed of the object seemed steady, but it was definitely bobbing up and down. the tree-line was very uniform in height - but the craft was bobbing below it and out of sight, and then well above it as it moved. at this point i called my two teen-aged children, and was relieved that when i returned to the patio, the object was still there, moving exactly as before. we watched it until it passed out of our line of sight. i remained outside, and it returned 36 minutes later, reversing its previous path. \r\ni checked with the night editor of the indianapolis star to ascertain if anyone had reported anything unusual in the sky that night. he said that no one had, and asked me what i had seen. i gave him a brief description, and then i asked him if he thought that it could possibly have been the goodyear blimp, which was in the area to promote the upcoming indianapolis 500, run on memorial day weekend. he said that it didn't sound like a blimp, and then he put me on hold and came back a minute or so later to tell me that the blimp was not aloft, anywhere, at that time. i thanked him and hung up, not leaving my 'phone number or name. \r\nthe nearest i can come to comparing the object to anything familiar, would be to say that in light-pattern, it somewhat resembled a police car's rooftop bank of lights - although the colors were not the same, and the size, which i estimate to be 500+ feet from first-light-to-last-light. most of the time i thought i could make out dark silhouettes beneath the lights, and above it, extending out from each end of the lights both 'fore and aft.  (this does not exclude, say, a saucer-shape, or most shapes - this is merely the way it looked, as it bobbed up and down behind the tree-line and then back again, as if on a rounded or straight course, but seeming always to be moving in roughly a straight line.) but again, i cannot be certain of the silhouettes. then seemed more evident as i looked away, of couse, but the lights obscured any real chance for a good observation of the rest of the object.

and relaxed. a few moments later i felt an urge to look over my shoulder. i stared behind me for a minute wondering why i felt this urge. i was in a densely forested area with many trees but with ample distance visage. i looked back there and noticed something different in my vision. five feet behind me and about two feet above my line of sight and one foot to my left shoulder sat a branch. that's when i noticed something was a little more bleary in that spot. i didn't believe what i was seeing so i turned away to look at something else and then back. that's when i saw a distinct shape. i looked directly at it and felt that i saw it looking back at me. i then looked past the shape on both sides and got the outline. i then saw that it was reflecting the daylight and tree leaves around it. i noticed that it had two ears like an owl or house cat and a body that appeared to be like a chicken. i turned away again to make sure i was not hallucinating. i was not. i turned back to it overwhelmed by fear. this time i noticed that the side of the shape had a rounded feathers-like reflection to it. at this point i felt it seem to say, \"can you see me? are you looking at me\" that's when the tingling fear hit me. i didn't panic on the outside; just on the inside. i was about twenty feet away from the property end of the downed tree. i had walked the length of it to my spot. now i had to walk back down it to get back to the property. i was afraid that if i panicked i would slip off the tree, fall to the ground five feet below and then be attacked by the life form. no one would know where i was nor find me until i rotted. maybe. so, in mortal fear of being grabbed as i made it back along the tree i tried to act normal. i talked to my self just like i was talking while filming the video. i said, \"well, time for me to head on back,\" in hopes of having it think it was a figment of my imagination. i made it off the tree and back over the barbed-wire fence (to keep the cows on the property), grabbed my bike and walked it back to the path. i was afraid that at any time, it would grab me. when i got back to the house told my friend and his daughter what had happened. they humored me. later on i looked at the video and discovered that as i was filming i had turned the camera toward me and talked some more. to my amazement i actually have caught the life form on my video. it is over my left shoulder. i have tape of the \"invisible\" life form. i would like you all to analyze it and blow it up if possible. this is by far the strangest thing i have ever witnessed. i would be happy to show you the entire video and the place this all occurred. i have included a blow-up pic for now. thank you.","distance":"20 Feet or
