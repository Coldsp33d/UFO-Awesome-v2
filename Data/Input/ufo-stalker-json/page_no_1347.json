dinner from wendy's. i had arrived to my home only a couple hours earlier, after putting the kids to sleep and while my husband was out, i decided to turn the ac unit on, it hasn't been used for a while so i was very startled when shortly after i turned the unit on, the smoke detector alarm started going off. this caught me by surprise and scared me for a second ( i might be a little jumpy about smoke alarms because we did have a house fire , here,  at xmas 2008, that destroyed our home.) the alarm stopped going off on its own within seconds but i was so shook up and startled that i went outside my front door to calm down and have a cigarette. i live in an area where my neighbors have acreage.  as i stood outside my front door looking across the street i saw a huge bright orange light. i've never seen such a bright large round orange light like that before so i continued to look. the light didn't move at first and i started to think it was some sort of helicopter, because the light was hovering. then i realized that a helicopter at this range would be extremely loud. it was silent. after a few minutes, the light changed, i thought the aircraft was turning because of how the light kinda distorted, i realized that the object was now rising from the position i first saw it in. from my point of view i could see that the object wasn't just next to the trees, but it was rising. i was confused as to what i was seeing. the object started to come towards me and i felt a panic because i knew what i saw wasn't a plane or helicopter and it didn't appear to be far away from me to begin with, so as it very very slowly came closer i got scared and i wanted to go inside but i was fascinated with what i was seeing so as it got closer i walked toward the middle of my driveway, i watched as the object flew over the road i live on and went directly over my head. when i saw the object over the street i wondered how it could be so low to the ground moving so slow and not just drop from the sky. as it went directly over my head it flew just over the power lines in my yard, at this point i heard a very faint noise coming from the object. very faint. i had to look directly up to see the underside of this object overhead. i could very clearly make out the outline. at first i thought it was triangular in shape but as i got a better look i could see that it resembled a missile in the way it had a cylinder shape front end and body and some soft edges around what looked like flaps or wings at the bottom or back end ofthe object.The bottom was flat, kinda like what i think a stealth bomber would look like from the underside. the orange light i originally saw was no longer present, but i did see a faint bluefish white light, very small in size, on the object. i also saw on the underside, not the sides or top, a few square lights. randomly lit up. there were multiple square shaped spots that were lit up. these were not windows like on a passenger plan, it reminded me of a display screen with many squares, only a few we're bright, and these were not on the sides, the squares were directly over my head on the very bottom of the object. i watched as it continued on its path over my head, then over the patch of pine trees in my front yard, then it continued over the vacant lot next to me, the object was so low and moving so slow that the feeling of panic came over me again because for a second i thought what i was seeing was a plane, without engine sound, about to crash land. it was so extremely slow, i thought it was going to drop right in front of me but it didn't, and within a few seconds of it flying over head i couldn't see it anymore because it was so slow and low to the ground that once it passed by my trees, the trees blocked my view, that's how low it was. it was very large, like a passenger plane, but it didn't look like any plane i've ever seen. it was so slow moving and silent. it was dead silent that night, no traffic, no noise. if the object was a plane or helicopter i would have known, it was directly over my head. i haven't discussed this with many, only my husband who returned from wendy's just minutes after it flew over head, i thought there was no way in the world he could have not seen it because he would have been traveling toward our house just a few minutes before he arrived home. the speed, the lack of sound and the weird lights on the bottom baffle me. i did make a sketch and illustrate the object and the positions of the lights but i have since lost it, however what i saw is permanently etched in my memory.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),  Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then

was feeding my dog and walked out to throw the empty can in the bin when i noticed a strange light in the sky that did not look like a star. it began moving in erratic, nimble paths and stopped on a dime a number of times. i yelled out to my sister and we grabbed the binoculars and sat observing it for about 20 minutes to half an hour. through the binoculars we could see that it had a shape and was solid, it had about 3 lights, though the number varied as the object moved, we mostly saw 3 main lights coloured red, yellow and pale green. they pulsated a little but did not blink. the object as far as we could tell was triangular, but may well have been circular or disc like as we observed from some distance. the size of the object is difficult to determine as distance is unknown but it was big enough to be identifiable as not any kind of aircraft we have ever seen or know to exist, especially in this area which receives only occasional distant air traffic. the object was too high and too maneuverable to be a helicopter, it also stayed in the sky on the one vague area for too long and made no noise. in addition to this it certainly did not look like a helicopter when observed through binoculars.\r\n\r\nduring the sighting we noticed a number of planes appear on the horizon, that did not seem like civilian or commercial aircraft due to their speed and lights, as well as our identification of them through binoculars. at least 4 were counted heading toward the object, though significantly lower than it. eventually they disappeared, presumably into the horizon, though the object stayed. whether or not the aircraft were tied to the sighting or not is questionable. \r\n\r\ni would like to also that the object was still visible as i was filling out this report, observable out my window, it disappeared only recently and neither myself or my sister witnessed it disappear, or how it disappeared.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

very slowly across the sky. i wasn't sure what it was at first because it was moving too slow to be a plane. i then grabbed the binoculars that were next to me(because that's all i had with me at the time) so that i could see it more clearly. a few minutes later i noticed that a duller colored object of similar shape had joined it, trailing behind it to the right. a few minutes after that another craft that looked like two \"o's\" next to each other(like the number 8 on it's side) joined in and completed their triangular shape formation. the figure 8 craft left the formation, without me noticing, but joined back in a few minutes later. without me noticing again, the two that joined the first one had left and the bright white one was left. for around 22 minutes i watched it go in big circles, make \"ufo type movements\" and also a movement that resembled a ball bouncing between two walls at medium-high speed before losing site of it as it traveled over my head. also, and i'm not sure if there is any way to confirm this, but i also received several images in my left eye(i'm very right eye dominant so when i use binoculars my right eye is open while the left eye is closed)telepathically during the viewing of the craft. some images appeared to me like small video-clips, and others appeared more like files with words and images and possibly blueprints on them. the only image i can remember, because it showed up 3 times or more, resembled what i would describe as a humanoid skull or face with tribal designs covering it. at one point while viewing the craft through the binoculars i believe, but not completely sure, that i saw the same image on the bottom of the craft and at which time the craft appeared to resemble a kite. after i got off the roof, i was looking at the sky to see if i could re-locate the craft again one last time before going inside and i received another image which looked like a kalachakra-type image spinning around multiple times with the same tribal face image in the center. i've never experienced anything like this before and i don't know how it will affect me in the long run, but if somehow i could \"access\" the received information then it might give me some sort of closure to the whole situation.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Insignia","flightPath":"Path with

out moms for mothers day. it was around 9:30pm on a thursday night heading east on rt 60 toward vero. i looked to my right to see 2 yellow orange lights in the night sky flying at the same altitude but not close enough together for me to think they were the same object. i remember thinking that planes that low shouldnt be flying at the same altitude as it could be dangerous. almost as soon as i had that thought the 2 lights, which looked like ultra bright amber stars fused to 1 light. as soon as that happened i thought...Alright we that's not a airplanes. almost immediately the now one light shot into 3, then shot off maybe 3 or three more. there seemed to be no pattern to it. i remember thinking it looked like some sort of slow moving odd firework. after it shot into these 5-6 orange yellow star lights they all stated rapidly dropping in the sky. we were driving past cow pastures and before they got anywhere near the ground they merged into 1 light again and vanished.I was yelling \"whats the heck is that!\" \"what are those!\" over and over. my fiance looked only in time to see the one final light blink out. he started yelling \"the yellow orange light??? i saw it, what happened!?\". we then drove passed a more wooded area and though we kept our eyes locked on the tree line we saw no more lights. i have never seen anything of the sort. i have been searching online since we got to vero beach at around 10:30pm trying to see if anyone else saw it. i keep seeing one report in google search results from around that time that seems to be reporting the same thing on this site but i cant seem to find the report once i open the link. i hope someone else saw this. it doesnt bother me that i saw it as much as it bothers me that i seem to be the only one. that stretch

air. at first, i thought it was a star, but i realized that it was too close to be a star. it was a very bright yellow and light was emanating from it. i quickly turned to my sister and said \"***, what in the world is that?\" she looked and she had mentioned that she had seen something like it before a few winters ago. by this time the kids are looking out the window and they are beginning to panic. after looking at the object for a few seconds, it shot out what i looked like to me was a ball of fire. the ball was moving slow, and left a trail of light. then the ball came to a complete stop, it was below the main ball of light, but towards the right hand side of it....When the fireball stopped it completely changed to a yellow color just like the first craft, after a few seconds, both balls of light completely disappeared. we were so shocked at what we had seen that we didn't notice how fuzzy the radio had gotten, after a few seconds the radio station we were listening to were back to normal....I would also like to add that earlier in the day we saw what i could only describe as military drones flying in the area, this happened in the duration of 4 hours, we also saw 2 planed that looked like military cargo planed. about 1/2 hour after the sighting we have heard various jet

train the rest of the way home after a board meeting. it was just after 9 pm, twilight, sky was still pretty blue, with just a few scattered clouds. i crossed the tracks to get to the side of the terminal i needed to be on, bought my ticket and when i turned around and stepped out onto the platform two round dark objects caught my eye. they were visible above some tall trees on the other side of the block. they did not seem vary large but looked like they were very high in the sky. they hovered and did not seem to emit any sound. they were both in close proximity to each other. they were more or less stationary only moving slightly. like they were being rocked about by the wind but were maintaining the same position.Kind of like buoys in water.They did not emit any light. the one on the right looked like it had several much smaller dark objects spinning around it. kind of looked like a swarm of flies buzzing around it. there were very few other people around, but no one else seemed to take notice and i did not point them out to anyone. i tried to take a picture but could not get a good shot with the camera on my phone as the objects were to far away. i observed them in this state for about 3-4 min until the train arrived. i sat in a seat where i could continue to observe the objects through the window. they seemed to remain still as the train traveled north. i lost track of them after the train passed through an underground tunnel. we have a busy international airport here so i observe planes and helicopters in the sky regularly and these objects did not seem at all similar to that type of craft. i considered that they may be balloons or kites of some kind but it seemed odd how they were so high up and not moving at all how you would expect a kite or ballon to move. i know some commercial remote control drones can hover and go quite high, but there was two of them and very close together and no noise and i could not see any apparatus that devises like that typically have. ie: hellicopter blades, wings or fans. \r\ni'm hoping someone else saw it or if anyone could give me an explanation of what these objects might have been, i would be curious to know as i have never seen anything quite like that in the sky before.

moving.I looked straight up and in between the clouds there were 3 small clusters of lights in a triangle shape.I told my wife to look!! whats that!!\r\nmy first thought was that it was 3 jets in a real tight formation.I said they must be going to afghanistan.I don't know if that's the way! but that's what my first thought was, military.The lights we're a dim red,not blinking or anything.I couldn't tell the speed as the little round clouds covered the lights.Of course!!! for the 5 or 6 seconds i did observe the lights they didn't appear to be moving very fast.My assumption was that they were going due north so i turned around looking straight up over the house, waiting for a break in the clouds. while i was looking straight up,kind of scanning above ,my wife said look!!.She was behind me looking over me and to the northeast.Out of the clouds came a bright solid, not blinking light heading to the south east.Fast!! i looked at that then back up over the house to see the two, white blinking lights of two jets that appeared to be in pursuit of the object.The object went out of sight to the south east while i was still watching the jets, heading the same way.The clouds broke enough and i looked at the right time to see the jets go from heading due north and turn to the southeast. now, i'm not sure if i even seen the jets when i first saw the triangle shape lights. they were, i'm guessing to the south,obscured by the small broken clouds. the time was 9.47 pm may 8th. i called the national ufo reporting center in seattle wash. and tv 7@4 news.No one else had yet called.Today, the 9th,thursday, i heard of other people seeing the same event. i'm still waiting to hear the other accounts.
