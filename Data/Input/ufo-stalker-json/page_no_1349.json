all we could tell is that they were white lights streaking across the sky in the eastern sky front from lower horizon level up to about '11 o'clock' - almost straight above us but not quite.\r\n\r\nso we got the idea to shine our lights up at the sky at it and flash them on and off, high beams on and off - varying the pattern of flashing. we also drove the car onto a small inclined hill in the nearby park to do this. when we did (and the more we did it) the more active these 'shooting stars' became. it was like we were communicating with them through the varied flashing of our head lights on the car - because, as we flashed our lights they began to 'dance' across the sky more rapidly, more frequently and with more sharp angle instantaneous turns. they even began to make 'zig-zag' patterns across the eastern part of the sky. \r\n\r\nwe were enthralled and excited as to what this could be. so we came up with the idea to go out of town, find another hill and, again, flash our lights at the sky in the darkness to see if we could lure one down! so we went north of town down a reserve road to the east - on the north side of the saskatchewan river (the pas being south of the river). so we found a short road leading up into a cemetery that had an incline enough to shine our lights up into the sky. \r\n\r\nas we flashed our lights at first nothing happened. we tried for a few minutes and were about to give up when i told joe, my brother-in-law who was driving the car, to try one more time. sure enough, when he flashed the lights again we seen one light streak across the eastern sky from the south east to the north east approximately. then it stopped low on the horizon, just above the tree line to the north east about 2 or 3 miles away. the light then started to grow larger. we realized it was coming towards us! we had definitely managed to lure one of these lights down to us!! as it got closer (and very quickly!) we began to panic in fear. we hadn't really believed we would actually 'lure' one down! (i don't know if we really knew what we were going to expect). we were so afraid at this point both of us became speechless. but joe 'slammed' the car in reverse back down the road on the hill to the cemetery to get back on the gravel road back to town. \r\n\r\nby the time we reached the road the light from this ufo was right in front of us - extremely bright and blinding! joe spun the car around quickly and spun the tires to take off as fast as he could. it continued right behind us shining this very bright light into the rear windows of the car now. the light was so bright that even when we lowered all the mirrors it was still blinding. to turn around and look at it was way too bright to do so. it hurt the eyes it was so bright! \r\n\r\nno matter how fast we went it kept to the exact speed as us - not getting any further behind or gaining on us. mind you it was right 'on our bumper' from the moment we started heading back down the road to town after exiting the cemetery road. and joe had the car going as fast as it could go/as he could handle it on the gravel in the dark. but then, after about a mile, it did speed up a little and began to pass us. but it didn't pass right by us. it just kept pace with us again right beside us on the driver side of the car now. this is where it got really strange for us. \r\n\r\nfirst of all, we were both still speechless (literally). every time we tried to talk we couldn't! perhaps it was just because of so much fear. especially when it was travelling along side us we became even more in shock and fear. at this point it was no longer just a (very) bright white light shining at us. there were many different coloured (colored) lights flashing in a circular motion to give the appearance that it was spinning. these coloured lights changed 'spinning' through the sequence of the spectrum (like a rainbow shining from the lighter yellows through to the oranges, reds, greens, blues, turquoise etc right up to black for a moment and then right back to the bright bright white light - every colour and shade of the spectrum it would go through in order, then start over again: bright white, yellows, orange and the darker colours, then a quick nano second of blackness then the bright white again).. this sequence of lights changing colours white through all the colours to black and then white again only took a total of about 1 or 2 seconds. it repeated this sequence many many times - too many to remember. \r\n\r\nanyways, as this was happening we were still racing down the road - speechless. i wanted to tell joe to slam on the brakes seeing as we couldn't out run it. but not a word or sound could i utter. i thought that maybe if we stopped suddenly it would just fly on by us and leave us behind. although i couldn't speak somehow my thought to hit the brakes got through to joe like he read my mind. in fact it seemed like we had telepathic abilities at this time to understand each other's thoughts so that speech wasn't even necessary! so joe slammed the brakes suddenly and came to a quick stop. we expected this ufo to just keep going on by us - or were hoping. but it didn't! in fact the exact precise moment we came to a stop it did too!! it stopped next to us no different then your shadow would stop when you stop - instantaneously.\r\n\r\nat this point we lost track of time. it was like we were in some sort of trance with this thing hovering right beside us with it's ever changing coloured lights spinning around hypnotizing us! at this point we were both just staring into the changing coloured lights unable to move, unable to speak, unable to look away! we had tried to get it's attention. now that we had it this ufo wouldn't let us take our attention away from it! it seemed almost like time stopped, all thought stopped. all there was was this object beside us gripping our focus upon it, locking our eyes so that they were transfixed upon the colourful lights. like i said we couldn't tell how much time had passed. but i managed to 'snap myself to' finally just as joe was coming to as well. we were still in a trance like state though and still reading each others minds as we agreed that we better start driving again. \r\n\r\nthis time, as we started to drive away. the ufo didn't start moving with us. it waited a few seconds and then began to follow us a little further behind than when it was first following right behind 'on our bumper'. so we kept driving back to the highway leading back into town with this ufo still behind us about 30 to 40 feet or so. as we turned on the highway south back into the pas it did not take the highway with us. it went down the railway tracks leading to the railway bridge (on the east side of the highway bridge). we both thought this was interesting and we relayed those thoughts to each other. \r\n\r\nthen another extremely strange thing happened. as we drove towards the highway bridge and the ufo flew towards the railway bridge we expected that the ufo would either a) fly between the bridges or b) fly on the other side of the railway bridge because it was probably just a little too large to fly on the bridge itself down the tracks. but to yet another surprise it did neither. it managed to fly right down the tracks but it appeared to be flying right through the solid steel of the bridge from one end to the other!!! \r\n\r\nall joe and i could do to 'talk' was drop our jaws in amazement at everything that was transpiring before our eyes - unable to believe that we were both witnessing this together, unable to make a sound, unable to believe our eyes! we couldn't both be hallucinating we thought to each other.. then as we got to the other side of the bridge as did the ufo (or, more specifically, orb i later figured it out to be to have properties to be able to fly through objects - ie: the railway bridge) this orb streaked off into the south eastern sky and was out of sight in about a second. it went from an 'object' of about 15 feet across/along (as it was 'circular/disc like') when beside us to a pinpoint of light as it shot off up into the sky and then poof! it was gone.\r\n\r\nit took us about half an hour before we could speak again. we just drove in silence all the way through town to the south end now, still reading each others thoughts not knowing what to do next. we fleeted thoughts back and forth about trying this again on the south side of town - to see if we could 'catch' anymore! i'm not sure why we considered this after the fright of our lives just having happened. perhaps it was the thrill or the heightening curiosity as to what we had just discovered. but we both agreed finally that we were too afraid to try that again as we were exiting town to the south into the darkness again. so joe turned around again and headed back into town and we went home.\r\n\r\nbut the story isn't quite over yet.. we told our friends and family the next day, who thought we were crazy or 'on something'. so we arranged for a supper together with the family that next day to try to convince them that we weren't making this up or hallucinating or 'on something'. we were truthfully both sober. and i'm pretty sure it isn't possible for two people to hallucinate the exact same thing. anyways we weren't making much progress convincing them until the 6 o'clock news came on. and guess what! there were actually several others who had reported various coloured lights in the eastern sky that night in the pas area, including lights that streaked across the sky at incredible speeds, instantly making sharp angle turns! so were all of these ones hallucinating too??\r\n\r\nfor further proof we phoned the local airports (one north and one east of town) to see if there happened to be any planes or helicopters flying at that time over town or even anywhere around the pas at that time. there were none. our family didn't know what to say then!  but i sure can say a lot about it. and to this day, 20 years later, the event made such an impact on my mind (and soul maybe too) that i can remember it as if it were yesterday!","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100

as clear of a sky as you could ask for. a friend and i were on guard duty as everyone was sleeping. we were talking just doing our shift. we were not far from a mountain when we seen this object following the ridge line of the top of the mountain it was not moving fast at this point. the object was casting a solid light downward that was in a shape of a upside down cone. meaning it was very narrow to wider. this object we just watched it go the length of the mountain at the top shining the light down. it made absolutely no noise at all. i have personally been on and seen most all of the military aircraft while in the military. it was not a military aircraft or any aircraft myself or my friend had ever seen. after the craft got to the end of the mountain top it moved very swiftly to the left or east. maybe a mile or so from the mountain. this was just over our head maybe i would guess 1000 to 1500 feet above us. light still shining downward. then ,in an instant, the light reversed to the top of the aircraft shining upward. all at the same time in that same instant (bare with me it is difficult to describe what happened so you can visualize it)the light at that instant was shining in a cone shape making a not so big ring circle. the craft just ascended upward at a speed so fast it was gone instantly. when it ascended and instantly gone it made a very loud boom. then the amazing part of this with the light. this is not easy to describe. craft ascends in direction of the ring of light goes through the ring very loud boom and now the ring of light gets so bright it is like its day. while that is going on the ring is expanding exponentially from the small ring of light to getting bigger and bigger at same time getting less bright as it gets bigger until it dissipates into nothing from what my friend and i could see from what i remember about it. the craft was kind of chevron shaped. it was a very interesting experience. my friend and i made the decision not to talk about it to anyone. as we were not sure how the military would react to us. i was in artillery and i don't know what the protocol is when someone in the military would report such an event. honestly i don't care what anyone thinks or believes me or not i know what i seen. my friend and i did not want to take the chance and find out. i am very sure other people had seen it as we were not the only ones out their in the desert. i had thought about reporting this story to mufon a long time ago. i just felt like someone else should know. i would like to know if anyone has ever

towards hulbert.\r\n\r\ni was so scared, i drove a 100 miles an hour to newberry to get away from it.  i brought my brother and his friends back with me a little later to see if we could see it.  it was no where in sight.  i never want to see another object like that.  it was not from here.   a few years later i did see a black triangle object one night going to rudyard on a back road.  it appeared out of the fog and when the object seemed to notice i saw it, it simply vanished in front of my eyes.  it was incredible and i wondered what that was.  i had a strong feeling that was some stealth govt object at the time and i still do today.  the first one was not of this world.  it was too huge and too slow and absolutely quiet as it moved.

object was stationary like a star. it blinked once, which is what got my attention. the second blink seemed to be brighter and slightly larger. the third blink was almost like a camera flash. it was more of a directed light. it did not light up or brighten the area of the campground but almost like someone turning on a flashlight directed at your eyes. afterwards the object continued to blink about 4-7 more times. with less light that the 2nd and 3rd flash.\r\n\r\n5. when the bright flash hit my eyes i had turned my head and looked at my fellow campers, asked them if they had seen the flash and then showed them the object.  we talked about how it was not flashing in any type of pattern and how dark the area was when there was no light flashing. they confirmed the sighting and as we watched it stopped blinking.\r\n\r\n6. it just disappeared. stopped blinking. we watched the area in and within about 30-60 seconds, what looked like satellites from two different directions seemed to cross the sky in that area... not exactly in the path of what we had seen but just below it in reference to the horizon.\r\n\r\ni have camped up there many time and i have seen lots of activity in the

returning signals that i started to send back with very good lights. \r\nat one point, a square or cube shaped object appeared, elongated into a rectangle with a textured bottom of black and white

traveling too straight. they weren't airplanes nor helicopters as they didn't appear to look like any nor they didn't make any noise. at first i saw at least 10 or so orb-shaped objects traveling in a

slower (like they were in no rush to get where they needed to go). eventually they flew out of sight over the complex. i was so in awe that i didn't take any pictures or videos until another object appeared in the sky behind the first few. the lone object was going in the same direction as the others. i took the opportunity to snap a shot but it was of poor quality. it made me highly regret not

but they can tap in to ours . when i first saw the ufo i had a telepathic feeling that their telling me not to tell anyone , to keep this just for me like a test for intimacy i was in a psytrance festival on the highway 101 in the forst and as usual the whole vibe their was aliens :) \r\ni met these tow brothers in the party and they dropped me on their way to humboldt california , arcada i arrived their morning time it was my first time in humboldt i felt instead of going back to san francisco where i lived i though to o visit humboldt since im close i wondered around the city the whole day wearing a black t-shirt with an alien face that i drawn on it :) as night was coming i asked some people where can i find a cheap motel so i can get some sleep and someone told me that i have to get a car and drive about 5 miles from arcada their al find a nice chap hotel , i ddnt have a car and their was no cabs by that time so i had to walk the whole 5 miles i had my skateboard\r\nwith me so i skated half the way . soo tow miles has passed and i started to find my self in a dark place on my left  and right just farms and cows and kept walking and walking hoping im on the right way cuz where am walking theirs nothing but farms and theirs litterly no one on the road to ask i was afraid to arrive the motel late and not find a room then am gona have to walk another five miles back to arcada , umm and when i finally walked the whole five miles or even more i dont really no how much is it and how  people describe me the way i found my self coming up a hilll and i saw to motels :) the area was pretty much abundant theirs nothing but farms and these tow motels while i was coming up the hill i looked at my right and their it was a ******* flying saucer , a ufo vearyy clear and obvious in the sky when i first saw it i wasent sure what that is i dont no what made me think that if that was an airplane wich it clearly wasent cuz it looked like saucer disk shape it can reverse cuz airplane cant reverse and after i gad that thought the thing reversed then i realized that wah am looking at is a ufo vearry close to me right at the hight of the trees wich i dont remember after that the ufo started signaling me with green and blue light and as i heard from alot of witness the same thing blue & green light . that thing followed me  till i reached the motel it was vearry close from the motel i was thinking that i will go check in and get out with my laptop and video it while it was following me it was going behind the trees up an down theirs no way this thing could be a remote control devise or any thing like that cuz their was no one in the area at that time and it was a farm area anyways i got out of the motel looking for it it was gone !!!!!! i stayed up all night looking throw my window at the trees hoping they will come back since that day ive been hearing voices having delusions my psychic ability has improved to 100 % and same as my telepathic i havent told anyone yet its been almost a year i felt that i have to share this atleats online its crazzy i dont have to prove anything to anyone since my eyes saw the proof ","distance":"21-100

the trees from over the tennis courts moving seemingly slowly. i thought it was the sun at first but quickly dismissed the notion due to the fact that the light was so bright andd white and the sun was mainly below the horizon and the sun sets almost 180 degrees the other way. i thought it was strange because with all of the leaves on the trees light could not normally pass through that easily. it slowly hovered its way towards my neighborhood swimming pool which is across the street from my driveway at a slow speed. once it was over the pool from my point of view my friend and i could see the orb in plain sight with no obstructions like trees in the way. it went on an arc shaped path all the way down my street. from my swimming pool across my street and then back across finally heading east until the orb was out of sight. we didn't notice the little red tiny or orb which was maybe one 50th of the size of the larger white bright orb until it already passed the swimming pool and when it was flying away from us. the object seemed to maintain the same altitude throughout the sighting. it was definitely within the altitude height capabilities of a helicopter.  my friend whose grandfather was a pilot and is familiar with our human aircrafts like planes and helicopters agreed with me when i ruled out it being either a helicopter or an airplane. the only reason why we concluded this was because of it's unusually quietness for such a low altitude and the pulsating sound it made. we thought it might be some military craft but wondered why they would experiment with such a craft over a heavily populated area. sure enough about 10 to 15 minutes later at the exact same altitude going in the same direction the orb went, was a fighter type jet like an f16 or such. that is what really made us say ok, now the military is on to it. afterwords i was kicking myself for not taking my phone out of my pocket to video record it. i was in such awe i didn't think about it. the bizzarre idea that the craft sent some sort of brainwave down to keep us from getting our phones out was also in my mind afterwards but i doubt that was the case. i can't remember the date but i'm sure it was i. 2010.

it to my aunt why i do not know and i continued to pace back and forth taking my eyes off the object but everytime i turned around it got closer and then i mentioned it to my aunt but for years i have spoken about being visited by what i call \"oli\" other life form intelligence. the orb itself seemed to be alive, for months before this sighting i saw red and white dots deep in space. the red dots being faster than the white ones but the white ones having the ability to split. night after night i witnessed these red and white dots out in space i even heard my mother tell me there was a report on the news about red dots over the great lakes somewhere around the same weeks i was seeing what i was seeing. i no longer saw the red dots after the orange orb came. back to the orange orb, the orb was about 30 feet from the drive way and didn't shine light on other objects although it was very bright. i turned my back many times but it got my attention when it changed course in an 90 degree angle and slowly went over the trees i didn't bother to follow it because odds are it won't be the last time i see a \"ufo\" and i was right because i've seen them since 2006 and have been visited

officer with extensive training in observational techniques so what my wife and i saw and as i report it here is as accurate as it can be. we are non drinkers, non smokers, non drug users. so these are the particulars: at about 9:30 pm, 5/4/13 we were watching television in our family room/sun room ( which has 12 floor to almost ceiling height windows, skylights and trapezoid end windows) when my wife observed a strange glowing orb in the sky traveling from east to west at a rather slow speed. i looked and saw it also and initially thought it was a roman candle firework someone shot into the sky till i realized it was moving at a steady rate of speed horizontally. also we both realized upon going out upon our deck that the object made no sound, had no landing lights, no flashing lights and left no contrail. this glowing orb had within the glow what appeared to us to be a faint solid four pointed object . this glowing orb/object continued in its steady horizontal westward path towards cleveland while maintaining its elevation and ultimately went out of sight. this was a clear and quiet evening in a rural setting, in the country without distractions of lights or sound. once again, it was a red/orange glowing orb that traveled without sound or other lights, had a solid looking something within the glow and we observed it for approx 2 to 3 minutes. it is hard to tell the size or distance but it was close enough to see it clearly. if my cell phone would not have been charging in another room i could have taken photos but we both stood mesmerized by what we saw. to me it clearly was not anything i had seen before and we do see and hear airplanes, helicopters etc fly over our home quite regularly, this was nothing like anything we had seen before. also i should mention that it was a warm evening and our sliders and skylights were open and our deck in one step down out of our sunroom.  also we are situated on a piece of property that has an unobstructed view of miles of sky. what was it, we do not know. i did tell my wife that come morning there will be many people reporting the same as we saw due to its unusual look etc. the following day garnered no
