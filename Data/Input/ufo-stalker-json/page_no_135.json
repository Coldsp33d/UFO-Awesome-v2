sounded like a loud humming coming from outside of the house. it sounded like it was coming from right above the house. this sound lasted for about five minutes, then it faded away. i didn't bother to look, because the noise really creeped me out. i was just happy that it stopped! we've heard some creepy noises around here, but this one was really terrifying. the first odd noise we heard was a few years ago during a meteor shower my daughter woke us up at about 2 or 3 am in the fall to see. we were out there for awhile when we heard a loud screaming coming from the north west. scared the hell out of us. my daughter wanted to go have a look, but i made the two of us go back inside. this humming, though, was the longest bizarre noise we've heard around here.

compramos una oroch y estábamos de viaje para ver si la pesca de los lagos de la cordillera nos puede dar mejor ganancia porque acá las cosas económicas están muy mal.\r\nestuvimos dos semanas recorriendo los lagos san martín, cardiel, strobel y quiroga hablando con la gente de ahí y seguíamos viaje para el norte al pueyrredón, ghio y lago buenos aires, vamos lento porque los caminos están bastante malos.\r\nparamos en la curva de las horquetas para almorzar y estirarnos antes de entrar en la pampa del asador sobre la ruta nacional 40, mientras estábamos en esto se apareció un objeto ovalado, para decir se parecía a un chancho sin cabeza patas para arriba muy grande como de 8 a 10 metros.\r\nera de color plateado brillante y volaba bajo y paso por arriba de nosotros y después empezó como a bailar en el aire y subía, bajaba y daba giros y estuvo así por un cuarto de hora.\r\nhabía aparecido desde el lado de la cordillera y se fue para el norte, al rato seguimos viaje y antes de terminar la recta como a 40 km de donde estábamos nos paró un estanciero de la zona que iba con su señora y su hijo y una traffic que era de ellos y tenía el chofer y un guía y además 14 turistas chinos.\r\nnos preguntaron si habíamos visto algo raro sobre la ruta y les contamos lo del objeto volador y nos dijeron que todos ellos habían visto lo mismo y que algunos le habían sacado fotos y videos.\r\nle dejamos nuestro mail para que si podían nos manden alguna foto porque nosotros no sacamos ninguna y el estanciero nos dijo que lo iba a hacer.\r\npor lo que nos contaron era lo mismo y la señora dijo que era como un colador de fideos redondo de los viejos con patitas dado vuelta.\r\nel estanciero nos contó que un puestero de su estancia había visto hacía como una semana atrás un par de helicópteros blancos dando vueltas por la zona del paso roballos bien adentro de la cordillera y que uno de ellos aterrizó al oeste del monte zeballos mientras el oro daba vueltas por la zona en grandes círculos como buscando algo.\r\nmas adelante ese mismo día después de cruzar el río pinturas en la meseta de bajo caracoles vimos parados al costado de la ruta cinco 4x4 importados y un camión como los del camel tropy con una parabólica y antenas arriba, todos de color blanco y tenían en sus puertas un símbolo como un círculo atravesado de arriba a abajo por una línea y algunas letras y números.\r\nnos íbamos a parar pero alguien vestido con un traje blanco, había varios así vestidos, como los que usaron en el edificio de nisman nos hizo señas para que siguiéramos.\r\nmucho mas adelante y unos 10 km antes de llegar a perito moreno, en plena peladero nos paró un reten policial y nos preguntaron de donde veníamos y si habíamos tenido alguna novedad en el viaje, nos asustamos un poco por el lugar donde nos pararon y no les dijimos nada.\r\nesa noche tomando unos tragos en el bar de perito moreno y hablando con la gente parece que otras personas vieron lo que nosotros y que era un comentario en el pueblo, pero como que todos hablaban por lo bajo.","distance":"21-100
