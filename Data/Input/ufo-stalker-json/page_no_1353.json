a blob of white and then disappeared into the bright blue sky.  there were very few white clouds at the time but this object was definitely travelling at a steady pace like the wind blowing something across the sky.  i thought it might have been some trash or a balloon in the sky but it was too far upwards in the sky to be trash flying around.  when it suddenly turned from travelling south to east (directly away from me) and disappeared, i knew it wasn't a balloon or trash.  when it disappeared, right after it made the 90 degree turn, it seemed to have left into a pinpoint in the sky.  the

air was still. sitting down relaxing heard a distant pop  boom sound that got my attention and all the dogs on the block began to all bark. looking almost straight up and about 10 degrees to the west so at 80 degrees i saw a very bright object that was flashing or pulsing orang red yellow blue white lights randomly across it's shape that appeared to be rectangle. my first thought was fireworks as i looked up and instantly , as i saw the object thought airplane in trouble, but it was stationary or hovering. it remained stationary for over 30 seconds flashing brightly many colors  orange red yellow blue white, lighting the sky around the object. it began to move very slowly in a arc or in a half circle as if it was going to circle around the block. i did not hear any other sounds besides the dogs barking. i yelled a\" ufo \" several times and ran through the house grabbing the camera at my computer desk. my 28 year old daughter followed me out to the front yard and also saw the object as it changed from a arc to a straight course to the south east. i turned on the camera and shot, the cam was set to full auto and the flash went off. the object seemed to pick up speed it was at 60 degrees from the horizon. i quickly set the focus to manual infinite turned off flash and shot again holding the cam as steady as possible leaned up against the car. i put the cam in movie mode and shot for another 30 seconds but did not see the object on the screen. i stopped the cam and could not see anything with my eyes. my daughter said it was gone as it appeared again bright orange  and then disappeared before reaching the horizon at about 30 degrees. the first pic shows a bright orange streak, that was expected with the shutter time on auto but there seems to be a redish streak shooting in many directions that i don't understand as the power lines seem to blur slightly and not jet around. second pic same as the first. i did not move the cam that much it seemed to me. was outside till after 12am saw nothing else. must have cam ready for a encore.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,

the sun was not in my eyes, and if anything would have been there it would have been easily noticeable since the sky was as clear and as blue as ever. the first thing i did was scream and giggle hysterically because i had finally caught a ufo after looking towards the sky for years. my new husband, on the other hand, was not so easily convinced. he was determined to say it was a helicopter under any circumstance. so i enlarged and zoomed in on this awesome photo and even he had to say....This is no helicopter!!! whatever this was had to be traveling so fast that you could not see it with the naked eye and at the moment that i snapped the photo of the marvel that is salvation mountain...I caught it. i have never seen anything like this before and went on to google military aircraft to see if i could find anything like this and there was nothing. i then took the picture to a man in roswell (our last stop anyway) and he had pictures of foreign military aircrafts and all sorts of things and he too said he'd never seen anything like this. then i acquired the mufon brochure and here i am. i have only shown this picture to my husband and the man in roswell.

control desk facing south on my own on late nights in the office. i was reading. work had been busy earlier and then had quietened down. the control desk is in the north of the building and in the room to the south is a large window. the office is upstairs in the building. i heard a heavy large aircraft go from north to south. it sounded very heavy and so i went to look out of the south window. i could see nothing, there was some high clouds and no stars visible, but visibility was good and there was no wind. also there was no moon and the islamic fasting time of ramadan was almost due to end with the new moon a couple of days later, and this was a wednesday morning. i could see no lights as there would be from a plane even with some high cloud. then silently an area of sky lit up bright white and yellow directly ahead of where i was looking to the south. i can only make a rough estimate of the size but i think it was at least 500 meters long and 100 meters from top to bottom, it was the same apparent size from where i was looking as the housing estate which is also visible from the window. the initial flash was bright pale yellow/white which faded to orange then red and crimson and then to nothing. there was no reflection on the ground and no sound. it was as if the clouds were on fire, rolling away from the central point. my first thought was that it was an explosion and my second was that if it had then it was already too late to try and hide from it. there was no wind and as i stood and watched it, it faded very quickly to orange, red and then after about 2 seconds to a deep crimson well defined lenticular shape. it was laid horizontally above the industrial buildings and the scrap yard to the south.  it was massive. the flash didn't spread across the sky but was contained in the one area and the clouds rolled away from the centre. it was larger when it first appeared and decreased slightly and proportionately in size, as the sky calmed extremely quickly, and the colour faded to red. it had had clearly defined edges and a definite oval shape with even colour and no cloud-boiling before it disappeared without actually moving away. it just disappeared into nothing as i looked at it. \r\ni was standing at the window. a car came up the road travelling away from town. two street-lights were out. the car was small and the driver was wearing a yellow jacket like a worker going home.  he looked straight up at me as i stood in the upstairs window and that's when i realised my mouth was open in surprise. i looked at the clock, it was 02:21. then i saw someone i know walking along the street towards the town going home to his apartment and he waved to me. it was as if nothing had happened. i walked away from the window and i had a thought that it doesn't matter what i see and no-one would listen to me if i told them about it. \r\nit was a quiet night, the phones weren't ringing and the drivers were all scattered away from town on jobs. i asked a driver over the radio who was at the far side of where i had seen it and asked if he had seen anything like an explosion or bright light in the sky but he hadn't. i went back to the window after a few minutes and was beginning to doubt myself. then i saw a flickering light to the east above the hill. it was white and small like a small helicopter.  it travelled along the top of the hill behind the big house then came back into view. it turned in a curve and was travelling quite fast and went towards the place ahead where i had just seen the huge explosion of light. as it began to curve towards that place, there was a repeat of the massive flash i had already seen, with clouds rolling. brilliant white/yellow/orange  then fading to a dull red definite shape. in addition, this time i saw a large roughly rectangular object that shone silver and yellow with appendages like cylinders leaving a brilliant streak of pale white/yellow/orange shoot out upwards at about 60 degrees from the centre and to the west. this time the large crimson lenticular shape was slightly se and a couple of degrees lower than the first. when i saw this second disturbance i bit right through my fingernail and snapped it. it was as if i'd heard a loud noise and my ears hurt but i had heard nothing. my head and ears hurt all the next day. i saw one small helicopter - flickering thing go to it then circled around and went out of sight as if it had either gone behind or inside. the second one of these did the same but then flew right into it. the first one  had stopped beside it, circling, then flew back the way it had come but slower. i looked at the time, it was 02:38. i was transfixed but saw nothing else and i went back to my desk. i wrote down immediately what had happened. i also drew a diagram, rough sketch to show the size etc. of it. at 03:10 i saw a helicopter appear in the sky directly south of the control desk and closer. it didn't seem to travel to this point and just appeared there suddenly. i thought it was the one that had gone inside that was coming out again. it was  fairly close. \r\n\r\nabout a week later i arrived at work to begin my night shift and one of the two staff there told me that a gas man was in the building. he was a tall and well built elderly man with light grey hair and glasses. he wasn't wearing a uniform, he had on a chequed brown and red shirt and plain light brown trousers.He said he was looking for gas. the hand held device he had had a needle that swung. he went upstairs to the office room that was locked and he came back down again. then he looked in all the cupboards and tried a few other locked doors. normally this would have set off the alarms but it didn't. i began to follow him around. i was certain he wasn't who he said he was. he said the next door neighbours had reported gas and pointed towards the west side of the building. even though this has the appearance of belonging to someone else it all belonged to our company. i found myself standing next to him at the south window. he told me that from time to time a large gas cloud appears over the town and nobody knows what causes it. the other two staff had seen and heard all this and they both picked up on the fact that we have no neighbours who could have reported it, they were quite shaken. \r\ni was told by someone at a utilities company i worked for a few years afterwards that a gas cloud would only ignite from the ground and they hadn't heard of any over the town.\r\ni am recording this because i heard of another sighting the day afterwards in europe somewhere.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s),

caught the \"tube\" reference before about the rear of the craft.\r\nthe reason i had never considered it to be my sighting was the \"acorn\" shape description.\r\ni realized that it had to be the craft i saw at 14 years old over the roanoke-salem va. area and\r\nhad probably imploded or melted to it's internal framing.\r\n \r\ni was \"airplane crazy\" at the time and watched the sky for contrails and listened for planes overhead.\r\nin either case i got my dads wii army air corps binoculars to get close up views.\r\nearlier a c119 boxcar flew directly overhead of my house on the landing glide path for our airport.\r\nit was polished as all large aircraft were then, and the binoculars let  me see the plane as though\r\nit was 100 ft overhead, although it flew over sugarloaf mt. and was probably at least 2000 ft in altitude.\r\nit was such a thrill i became even more obsessed with sky watching.\r\nthe day of my sighting i noticed a 4 engine contrail and a single contrail to its left in the south-slightly-eastern horizon.\r\ni ran for the binocs since a single contrail had to be a fighter.\r\nthe planes were only brilliant specks ahead of the contrails.\r\nthe sky was clear and sunny and the sunlight lit them up like diamonds.\r\ni focused on the 4 engine first to see if it was an escort for the fighter, but it was a commercial airliner,\r\nand i was nuts for the military planes so i panned left for my first fighter sighting.\r\nthe glint of polished metal came into view, i adjusted the binocs and....Saw a perfect ball, no external\r\nflight controls at all.\r\n \r\nmy craft was a perfect sphere, perfectly polished or even an acrylic globe with a mirror finish,\r\nno rivets or panels at all.\r\nas it flew to the center of the horizon i got a 3/4 side view and saw the \"exhaust tube\" at the rear.\r\nthe ball to tube proportions were: tube 1/3 of ball diameter, tube extended out 1/3 of its diameter.\r\nthe flame trail length was 2 and 1/2 times the diameter of the ball, it seemed to have a high velocity\r\nexternal clear flame with a half diameter flickering yellow and red-ish internal flame plume.\r\nat the time i felt the tube was just to produce a contrail and not really powering the flight.\r\nthe ball could not possibly carry fuel to feed such a large exhaust tube.\r\nif a craft with no flight controls could maintain a perfect flight path, it had to have a propulsion system\r\nbetter than a \"hang on big tube\".\r\ni watched it travel until it dropped over the horizon. it went se to nw and was probably over the wv border\r\nby the time it left my sight.\r\n \r\ni decided not to tell anyone since i didn't want to be the \"kooky kid\" who sees things and who would have believed me?\r\n.\r\ni have cancer now and wanted to tell before i join the universe.\r\n\r\ni haven't yet made sketches of the craft, the chemo has left me too\r\nexhausted to make a decent effort, although when i have the energy\r\ni will make the drawings. i looked at it from four good angles as it\r\nflew across the horizon.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,
