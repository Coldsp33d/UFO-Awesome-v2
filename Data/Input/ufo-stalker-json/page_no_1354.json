went to bed early so i decided to soak in the spa for awhile (one beer when i got home and a single glass of wine with dinner). facing due south in the spa a boomerang shaped, translucent object entered my field of vision (from behind and to the right) moving from nw to se. lack of visual reference cues makes this thing impossible to size, but it moved like a big object and the reflection of the street and city lights glowed dimly off the curved bottom surface at a seemingly moderate height, well below the airliner traffic. it made no sound and really seemed to be more a boomerang shaped disturbance in the air rather than a visible object. speed was impossible to judge, except to say that it took 20 to 25 seconds to traverse my field of vision. i jumped up and stood in the spa to view as much of this thing as possible while it disappeared behind the houses across the street. this is the first clear and cloudless night in central california after many days of rain. could the

stayed with telescope while 2 other witness looked (with naked eyes) at the sky around saturn (facing south/southeast).  in an instant two meteor like objects came down from space in parallel at very fast speed.  they came in at a 35 to 40 degree angle.  they left a very small trial as they came down.  my initial thought in a split second was \"wow, that's weird seeing two meteors in parallel.\"  as soon as i thought that, the two white lights stopped their rapid descent in the sky and hovered for a second or two (at what i would guess was about 30,000 ft).  they were about 30 degrees above the horizon.  then the two lights began circling around each other in the sky almost like they were playing with each other or dancing in the sky together.  they did huge circles around each other at tremendous speed defying all physics.  both witnesses confirmed what they were seeing to each other and telling third person to come look.  the two objects were star like in appearance and less bright than most of the stars in the sky.  both objects circled around each other for about 8 seconds and then leveled out and flew away heading south towards iowa city.  as they flew away at about 30,000 feet, they left a tiny trail behind them, however, they didn't make any kind of trail while they were doing rapid circles in the sky.  objects flew away and disappeared behind house roof line.  third witness only saw the objects fly off for a second or less and didn't see objects doing circles in the night sky.  this incident happened at a different location in cedar rapids from where i live.  \r\n\r\nboth main witnesses thought had the objects went just a bit further down, neighbors roof would have blocked view and we would have missed the show and would have only thought we saw two meteors.  objects seemed to deliberately stop so we could watch them in this narrow field of vision.  i mentioned to my neighbor what i saw last night and her brother said he witnessed around 10:45pm on same night a bright white light, like a meteor, come down from space in same area we were looking and then it stopped in midair and then poof, vanished.  this person was located about 5 miles away from where i was located when these events took place.  \r\n\r\ni had goosebumps when i was watching the two objects because i knew i was witnessing first hand something that was not man made.  the other witness wasn't as shocked as me, but he said he went from being a ufo skeptic to believer after seeing those two objects dance around in the sky.  i had my camera phone with me and thought about shooting video, but i had a feeling the objects would disappear while i was fumbling around trying to film it.  turns out i was correct as the entire event only lasted about 10 seconds.  we both agreed that had we not been together to confirm what we saw, we may have doubted what we saw altogether..  it was surreal to say the least.","distance":"Over One

the back patio of her mothers condo. the patio sits higher and overlooks much of the city of fountain hills, az. we had just returned from a dinner, and discussing events over drinks. two of the six did not drink. about 9 pm i noticed a very bright reddish orange light coming toward us in the sky. it appeared to be moving slowly and close to the flight path of commercial airline into phoenix. the item attracted our attention in that it did not strobe and is odd color and very bright intensity. the item continued moving toward our patio and stopped and hovered in front of us. i could make out it appeared round in shape. after a few seconds it continued on its path and move directly over our heads. stopping once again for a few seconds, it then appeared to change to bright white color and then appeared to fade. a person from our group moved to get a view out of the way of the tree, and said it was going up. as i came to their position i could see it was increasing in altitude at an incredible speed. once it reached a very high altitude, it looked to be a pin point among the stars behind it, it zipped off at about its initial vector at tremendous speed and then a near 40 degree turn to fly off out of view. amazed, we all went back to the patio to talk about what we just witnessed, only to look out again and see another vehicle of the same color and intensity, but shaped more in an oval or cigar shape. this item was approaching us on the same vector and speed as the initial object. it stopped on it path toward us as well and hovered for a few seconds then seemed to turn. that is the point where this video is taken. rita took this and her niece took one with her phone as well. as the object turned, it started to move away from approaching us, and began to dim in color and turned from the red-orange to a white color. it moved toward an open parking lot and basket ball court about 1,000 feet from us and hovered for a second then slowly came down to land. we all witnessed this object land on the ground in this parking lot and it appeared to be a rectangular object about 8-12 feet at its long side, and maybe a couple feet high. the niece and i jumped in her car to to to the parking lot and not knowing the area she went to the fountain area, that was too far. by the time we got back to this parking lot, the witnesses on the patio that could clearly see it said it moved over the ground to slowly and into a wash area that is dense in plant life. we could find no evidence of this touchdown last night nor on review this morning, but there were some interesting impressions in the sandy soil.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

a glimmering star because it was too big and appeared to be moving. it wasn't the aircraft landing lights of a plane because of the size and shape. my thought was it may be an aircraft on fire coming into bangor international airport, so i yelled to my son to grab my camera. he came back outside seconds later, and i started snapping pictures of the object. because it was getting dark and my hands were trembling my camera wouldn't auto focus but eventually i did get several pictures of the object. it appeared to almost fade out of sight, but then appeared to come back getting brighter and larger. my wife asked if it was going to crash and that it was coming right towards us. i snapped a few more pictures and the object appeared to split and disappeared. i put the pictures on my

10 seconds of me looking at different parts of the sky. \r\n\r\n\r\nlater, a ship of some sort started either flying towards us or rising from the ground over the horizon (hard to tell via perspective). i believe it was rising because i noticed that another incredibly bright light was flying just above the tree line as that ship was rising up. that ship was flying so low my girlfriend could not see it (being 1.5 feet shorter than me) and it was heading west. as the other ship was \"rising\" it was a bright yellow, so bright i thought it could be a spotlight on a plane. suddenly, it switched from bright, bright yellow to a dim color with flashing white and red lights. at this point it \"appeared\" to start flying in our direction. it flew directly over us and was clearly a triangle in shape. it had a red center light and three white lights at each point. it looked very similar to the belgium ufo in the 90s. however, the white lights were flickering in all sorts of patterns. it is possible that lights lined the sides of it, which would account for the overt light display it was \"putting on\" as it seemed like 20 or so lights, not just the 4 we could see. we ended up seeing at least 5 of these. 3 flew in a triangular formation incredibly high and slow, another flew almost directly over us later in the night (at this point we had relocated to an open parking lot nearby). that one did not fly strait, but instead flew on a elongated bell-curve until it flew out of sight. before it came our way, it made a flashing pattern at another light in the sky as if it was \"communicating\" (one of the star-like lights). that light disappeared for a few seconds, then came back as if it turned off and then on again. all of these ships flashed lights in different ways. none of these \"came from\" the star like (blue/green/white light) ufos. \r\n\r\n\r\nas i said, i left and went to an open parking lot. i noticed that the \"star-like\" light had two twins that formed a triangular formation. there was about a mile - 3 miles in between them (best guess) and one was emitting and absorbing orbs. some we lit up, some not when they came out/went in. however, even without their lights \"on\", it was possible to see them as they reflected the lights of the star-like ufo. there were a lot of these orbs, potentially hundreds of sightings over the three hours. they would line up and flash in patterns, they would move and take sharp turns and they would dart across the sky with great speed. it was like a meteor shower at certain moments. we watched these things move across the entire sky, east to west, in less than a second. however, they would stop and flash for a while then move again. they were so fast, we would often watch them move from one side of the sky to the other in the time it took the orb to \"flash\" (meaning we caught its movement while flashing). we even saw an orb moving slowly then randomly split into two red orbs that moved quick. it was astonishing.\r\n\r\nthere was a lot of activity that night, but that about sums it all up. this went on for three hours. we also saw and heard planes fly over. the differences were staggering in terms of sound and lights. the planes were very consistent with the flashing and were audible. all other sightings were not making any noise and often changed their flashing patterns/colors.

saw what looked like a bright planet in the western sky that she had not noticed before so she focused on it for a minute. the object began to move very slowly towards the south. the object moved so slowly that at first she was not sure it was moving.  when she was sure the object was indeed moving she came inside to get me.  i went outdoors and observed a bright glowing planet sized object approx 75 degrees above the western horizon traveling south at approx 5000 feet elevation.  grabbed a pair of binoculars that we keep on a porch table and observed the object best described as a luminescent pearl that wobbled erratically as it moved silently across the night sky.  the object continued on it's southern trajectory as it traveled out of sight.  the entire sighting lasted between

trolley square neighborhood). we were enjoying a backyard fire, and at the moment 2 of us were outside while the 3rd went inside momentarily. i was laying down on my back passively looking at the sky while talking to my friend, when i suddenly noticed a light directly above my body moving from west to east. it was moving deliberately. my first instinct was that it was a satellite, but quickly realized that it was a lot brighter and moving much faster than any satellite i had seen before. i pointed this out to my friend and he jumped up and said ���look! there are more over there, 2 of them!��� i scramble to my feet, and said ���where, where!?��� he pointed into a dark piece of sky north northwest direction. i then saw what looked like two light grey or light tan masses that seemed to be moving at the exact same pace and direction. the objects looked like they had somewhat of a v-like shape to them. they were very difficult to see, but looked like they had mass to them, meaning they were darker in the center of the vehicles, and their silhouettes were fuzzy and difficult to define. the best way i could describe it was that they were ���cloaked���, and required a bit of effort to see. i lost sight of them once, and then found them again about ten seconds later; again, moving at the exact same pace, and heading the exact same direction. there were no lights on the objects whatsoever save for a random pinhole-like orange light that would blink periodically (i think i saw the dim orange blink 3 times).\r\n\r\n the entire thing lasted somewhere between 45-90 seconds; long enough for me to look back at my friend and realize that we were both absolutely seeing something that was abnormal to what is commonly in the sky. \r\n\r\nin the aftermath of the incident, and in accounting to his spouse what had just happened, we realized that there were some major differences in what we saw (he saw lights, i didn't, his seemed very far away, mine seemed to be a little closer).  we had no choice but to determine that we saw different things. what we cannot deny, however is that we both saw something simultaneously, and that there was an unshakable sense that the presence of all these objects were absolutely related to one another. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

 we were in our vehicle about to cross the bridge which crosses cave run lake and marks the county line of rowan and morgan counties.  suddenly a green orb which looked to be about the size of 2 beachballs came into our line of site traveling straight down at a steady speed in a very few seconds it made a perfect 90 degree turn and headed north traveling over the lake until it was out of sight.  we immediately slowed down to watch and then blinked our lights at our friend in front of us to pull over into the nearby boat landing which is known as popping rock. their was no one there and no boats out, besides this was way too far off the ground to be anything of the sort. also, there were no nearby powerlines which could have created this.  that was actually the second time i have seen this green orb, about 10 years earlier i  saw the exact same orb, and if memory serves me well it seemed to be traveling at very similar speeds. this is the first time i have reported anything of the sort and actually had one other event happen to me about 7 years ago in morehead which involved myself and a friend.  i would be happy to share this with anyone interested, i am just not going into details here because of the length of time which has passed since. please contact me by phone if interested.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\ndonnie langdon","distance":"101-500
