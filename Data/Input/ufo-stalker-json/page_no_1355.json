searching, even though i thought he was joking... there was a mix of urgency and excitment in his voice. it wasnt till we were about to turn into aurora meadows that he slowed down and pointed out the lights that i saw what he was talking about but by that time i only saw two orange lights that flickered off and on. they were horizontal then vertical then only one was left then there was nothing.

sky.  it was a couple miles away, prob between 10-20 miles.  the time was 11:45pm and the sky was clear with a sleight haze.  it was in the direction of south and looked like it might have crashed around lees creek. unless the object disintegrated it had to of crashed to the ground, which is more than likely a field.  the object looked like it was on fire, like a shooting star.  the color started out orange and slowly transitioned to green.  it was probably the size of a helicopter.  it sort of left a trail, again it was like a shooting star, but it was leaving more sparks than anything. \r\n\r\nmy friend thought it was a small asteroid falling from the sky.  while i don't automatically label things as alien ufo that was my first thought.\r\n\r\nexhilarated, my friend and i tried to drive out past sabina to around where we thought it might have crashed (lees creek) but it was too dark to see anything and we didn't have a clear enough idea of where the crash happened. giving up and low on gas we decided to head back toward sabina from snow hill road (an area closer to lees creek) we stopped the car on a lone country road. we got out and saw that 2 blinking lights had arrived in the sky above about where the crash would have been.  they weren't moving or going anywhere.  i would probably say they were small airplanes or helicopters but they weren't moving; although because they were miles away it might have just appeared that they weren't moving when really they were circling.  we stood there for at least 10 minutes and the 2 blinking objects were still there.  they were about as high as a helicopter would be if it were observing, so a couple hundred feet.  i was fiddling with my phone to call a friend and tell him what was going on (as we've shared events like this with each-other)and my friend standing outside with me claimed he saw a flash of green light that lit up the whole sky.  he can not determine where the flash originated from.  \r\n\r\nwe both wanted to drive out and follow the blinking lights to investigate more but my friends car was almost out of gas and no gas station was open.  the haze in the sky was thickening anyway and we were losing visuals of the blinking objects in the sky. so we just headed home disappointed knowing there was nothing else we could do.","distance":"Over One

it's not a star, is it? i said no. it's too close. it seems to be within our atmosphere. it was also too bright. although it maintained it's position as if it were a star. i went to get the video camera and binoculars. camera was no good. binoc's were great. we could see, very distinctly, four primary colors. blue, green, yellow, red. these colors were emitted as flashes of light. these flashes alternated and were patterned. they seemed to orbit some sort of circular craft. from 9:30 pm to just past 10:35pm, it remained in the same position and just about disappeared in the western horizon as the earth rotates. but then, while i was inside contacting a mufon member (10:35pm til 11:35pm), at 10:50pm she observed the ufo ascend and fly north a great distance at an incredible speed. as if it didn't accelerate, it was just still then moving very, very fast. i went out to see while on the phone with a mufon representative. i did observe it had move a great distance to the north, though i did not see it move to it's new position. i tried to film through the binoc's and have some very shaky video. some good steady scenes, but not close or clear. the colored light are very visible. i had the hardest time zooming in thru the binoc's. please be patient with the video. i watch all the ufo investigative shows, and this is the first time i have ever seen an unidentified

we were looking at the stars and the scenery around us when we noticed a red light with a white light on top of it so we thought it was just a airplane. \r\n\r\nwe forgot about it and then a minute or 2 later it got closer and we herd a very low humming noise. we got up and walked closer as it was coming closer behind the tree line. when it got into view over my house we see a large oval object about 10ft over the tree line and about 100ft or so long and 50ft or more wide, it had three dome lights evenly spaced out down the under side of the object with the brightest white light i have ever seen, the object was a dark grey or dark black in color and made a very faint humming noise and was moving very slow maby about 2-5 mph. \r\n\r\nthere was also white light beams coming from the object at different areas of the object scanning the ground and my house, the white light was like a laser beam it stayed the same brightness and same consistency from where it exited the object to where it touched the ground. after the object had made its way past my house it made a 180 degree spin as it was already moving. i felt so scared and my head hurt so bad, i started feeling sick to my stomach and i had goose bumps all over my body. me and my two friends were silent the whole time and we didn't know what to think about what just happened. \r\n\r\nthe object continued north at the same speed and eventually the lights on the object got a little bit brighter and it picked up speed incredibly fast and was out of site in a matter of seconds.\r\n\r\n just writing this statement of what i saw

family room watching tv. i decided to go to the living room to have a cigarette as my husband doesn't smoke. the living room is in a different section of the house separated by three walls and 3 doorways. i was sitting in a chair in the southeast corner of the house with 2 windows to my left and to the right and also a door to the right. there was a lamp on to my left as well as a dim light across the room near the door going back in the direction of the family room. i heard what i thought were voices but then realized it was an owl! we have lived here for 20 years and have never seen or heard any owls here! their hoos were, it seemed coming from all sides and were only hooing one at a time. example: from right, hoo-hoo..Hoo,,,hoo..Hoo, from left, hoo, hoo... hoo.. hoo and so on.\r\nmarveling at the loudness of the hoos and the seemingly numerous owls that had popped in for a visit, i went to the windows to see if i could pinpoint the locations. when i looked out into the darkness, they stopped, then i walked away toward the family room and they gave another series of hoos. i entered the family room where i found my husband looking toward a large window somewhat at alert and with the volume muted on the tv. i told him what i heard and he said he heard them as well. i observed his body language more closely and determined that he was rather alarmed and startled which i found satisfying as i felt the same. we seemed to both de at the same time to go out with a flashlight to investigate but i stayed behind and walked quickly back to the living room to watch his progress. i didn't see him so i came back to the family room and he was already coming back through the sliding glass door. he seemed frustrated and agitated and stammered, \"those things are long gone!\" i was quite startled because he had never progressed any farther than a few steps onto the patio. he had never gone all the way around to the front of the house where the sounds came from. i was disappointed so i went back to the living room without turning on lights this time to try to hear them again. i peered out the living rom door and i saw a huge disc in the sky barely moving coming straight from over our house going east! it had lights randomly blinking red, blue yellow and green!\r\ni went back to the family room and told my husband, he seemed totally uninterested and was watching tv again! i looked out the sliding glass doors that he had just a few moments ago re-entered and the craft was still quietly gliding, well, creeping along over the field next to our house! i thought how odd was because it seemed that there were small airplanes buzzing around it! i thought it would be in the news or something but never was. anyway, i grabbed a pair of binoculars and seemed to be fumbling a bit trying to get the caps off. i looked at the craft and it was not focusing. i was suddenly extremely fatigued and had to go sit down. i glanced out the door and could still see it and asked my husband if he didn't want to see the ufo, he said, \"no!\". that was it. we said no more and forgot about it.","distance":"21-100

property. please call or email first. you may contact me if you wish to. i tried. to take pictures and video but i'm only using a ipod and it only caught a pin point of light, not the entire object.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Path with directional

at 11:11 on april 27th 2013:\r\n\r\nhe and my roommate were sitting on the couch in front of our living room picture window.  he happened to see a random orange/red light in the distance.  he watched it hover and then move up and down erratically with no seeming path.  he then told my roommate and they turned off the lights and began to watch.  it continued to move erratically for a minute or so before i came upstairs and it dipped down before disappearing as i entered the room.  they also mentioned that it changed from orange to more red as it moved. there was a quiet excitement tinged with concern/fear they both felt.  i was very disappointed to have missed it.  it was too far away for them to get a clear view of the object, distinguish a shape, or hear if it made any noise.  we all discussed it for a few minutes afterwards, trying to find an explanation, but we couldn't think of anything that would move like that.  it did not seem to be a reflection of any kind, the light seemed to be emitted from the object itself.\r\n\r\ni have done a little research and have found nothing referring to this incident, nor have i found anyone else who saw what my roommate and friend saw.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

about 8:30pm. at that time of year in portland there is still quite a bit of light at this hour. i was in a car with three other people all of whom witnessed the same phenomenon. i first noticed three bright lights as we went over the ross island bridge; i was looking back in the direction from which we had come, sw towards lake oswego. the light at the top of the formation was white and brightest while the other two were red-orange. i pointed them out to the other passengers and we all, save the driver, watched them intently as we continued driving along towards powell blvd. they appeared to be hovering variably up or down in the sky, and we pulled over at around se 25th & powell to watch them, realizing they we could not explain the lights' intensity nor their motion. one by one they disappeared, starting with the dimmer (although still very bright) two on the bottom, and finally the bright white light which crowned the formation. after they did not reappear for about five minutes we continued driving to se ~60th and foster, at which point they would have been invisible at our altitude. this makes me think they must have been about 200-300 ft high in the sky. we were all pretty convinced we had not been observing planes or helicopters given the eventual disappearance of the lights.
