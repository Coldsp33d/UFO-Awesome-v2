i have a single large window in my bedroom which i close the blinds at night, the way i close them is facing downwards so i can look up at the sky laying near the window (head and body laying straight from the window, not sideways).\r\n\r\n as i take a look through the blinds, an extremely bright object came into my view near the side of the window, now at this point to me it looks exactly like what you'd see from the \"north star\" or a \"satellite\" reflecting the sun, it was that bright.. however, the way i knew it wasn't a star, or a satellite was that it continued to ascend in a diagonal angle (and it wasn't in our atmosphere), i could tell due to it passing each of the \"blind blades\" until it got to a certain point literally in the center of the sky, i'd say a few miles up, then started to \"wobble\" sort of \"bounce\" and very slowly move around, but while remaining in the same position. now to just to clarify, i'm fully aware of illusions of movements occurring when you stare at a far off object for too long, however i made a point of not doing this, basically \"refreshing\" my eyes and looking away every so often, while eventually getting off the floor and opening the window.\r\n\r\n now as all of this is happening, i catch something in the very right hand corner of my peripherals.. it was a large blacker than black, completely silent, possibly over 1 mile in size from one chevron end of the craft to the other, no visible externals of any sort, or lights. now let me make it clear, that it was dead-silent, also about 3am, and only likely to be no more than a mile away, it was meant to be stealth, and not seen, or heard. needless to say, a craft over a mile in size hovering/moving in a straight line (opposite direction of the star object) with absolutely no noise, literally right over every hattiesburg building in altitude, gave me tremendous goose bumps as i called my friend dale immediately to tell him whats going on, as he's talking to me he's googling sightings in hattiesburg being the skeptic he is (very sneaky), he found a farmer family that had a sighting, and matched my exact description of the craft which completely blew his mind. also, keep in mind this guy is pretty closed minded, and very skeptical of everything; now i'm not that way personally, i was taught to never shut things out by my parents and i've always had a passionate interests and an absolute 100% knowing in other life beyond our planet visiting our world. it's common sense alone.\r\n\r\nas the large black chevron moved forward consistently it left my view after about 5 minutes because it went past the edge of the apartments brick-wall of my apartment complex, so i ran around front, outside, but couldn't see anything due to how heavy the overcast was on the south-side of my apartment, so i went back inside and watched the star-like object continue to \"bounce\" so to speak in it's same position for the rest of the night. i was unable to sleep, so i continued to play games until about 6ish-am in the morning, while checking on the light every hour or so.. however i could not see the object any longer as soon as day broke, and i finally went to sleep.\r\n\r\nvarious details - i tried to record or take pictures with my phone, sadly i had an iphone at the time, and the camera literally couldn't even pick up the bright star floating in the middle of the sky, and especially the black stealth object.\r\n\r\ni've had a few other absolute \"beyond what we know of mainstream technology wise\" sightings, and the best part which i will report the other sighting as well, was with 2 other witnesses that watched the entire thing with me. basically 5 blue-star objects, half-v formation going thousands of mph across breckenridge apartments only a couple miles up, and then split off like 5 bottle rockets strapped together \"loosely\" and vanished instantaneously going in all opposite directions of each other no trails, (all bright blue stars) and dead-silent.\r\n\r\nthanks for listening :) loved the steven greer sirius 2013 april 22nd documentary,that's what made me come here. i'll continue to update, i'm always looking up! (also my drawing of the craft should be wider \"wing\" span) but it's close.

still dark outside.  i had my mother-in-law with me.  she observed the object as well.\r\n\r\nas we turned right onto rt 26 from rt 27, the only other vehicle we saw was a police vehicle in front of us heading in the same direction.  it quickly got out of our sight and we never saw the police vehicle again afterwards. \r\n\r\ni drove for a few short miles and then i (we) noticed a very large and bright light in the south-west sky, somewhere between a 30 to 45 degree angle from the ground.  well above the tree line, way to high to be any tower and much too large.  when i got closer, i could see detail.  \r\n\r\nit looked like a building in the sky with an extremely bright glowing light emanating from the entire under side.  it had a metallic body.  it appeared round or oval from it's underside.  it had detail to it's body/building structure, even appeared to have possibly windows or portals by the way the light came from it.  \r\n\r\nit never moved, just hovered in the sky.  the light coming from it's under side stayed steady and only after watching it for several minutes, then all of the sudden the light dimmed, however it was still very bright.  the light was an extremely bright glowing light.  it was not a light beam, but more like flood lights. to the right side of it, i could make out a small red glowing light. i could not make out any sound.\r\n\r\nthe sky was clear and dark.  i (we) saw no airplane, no helicopter, nothing at all except for this object.  when first approaching it, i said to my mother-in-law, \"what is that?  do you see that?\"  looking at it and seeing detail on it, i knew it was not even close to anything i've seen before in my life.  i am 46 years old and my mother-in-law is 81 (who's husband fought in wwii).  finally she said out of the blue, \"it's the aliens watching us, i saw that very same thing a few weeks ago near our house in the middle of the night.\"  even her statement shocked me. i was mesmerized with this object, i didn't know what to do other than keep my eyes on it and still safely drive. \r\n\r\nwe observed how it did not move, how extremely bright the light was, how completely different it was from any aircraft we had ever seen before, it was in no way an airplane or helicopter, it had no blinking lights nor lights in any similarness to them.  we watch it as i drove just sitting there in the sky over what appeared as open farm ground. eventually i past it to where i had to turn my head back to look at it, still just hovering in the sky.  then finally we were out of sight from it.  \r\n\r\na week later on our way home, coming through the very same area in daytime, we both studied the area in which we saw this object.  no towers of any kind, nothing but open farm land with some scattered

said that she was seeing ufos in the sky. i didn't pay much attention to what she was looking at because i was focused on driving. at that point they looked like stars to me.\r\n\r\nwe parked at guernsey dairy in northville some time around midnight or 1 am and were going to sleep there for the night. we got out of the rv to stretch. i had a bottle of essential oil in my hand and dropped the cap. my friend said holy *#%^@$!! i was still looking for the cap that i dropped. she said look it is a ufo! at that point what i saw looked like a row of street lights. the lights were very bright however, i couldn't see anything. she was so shaken up it rattled me as well. so we got in the rv and drove to the nearest place we could think of, which was meijer, down the road. \r\n\r\nwhen we got to meijer it was getting light out! we got out of the rv and looked up into the sky. we saw 3 grey disc shaped objects floating up into the sky sort of like hovery the way leaves would fall from a tree, except going upwards. we tried to talk to several people coming out of the store but all ignored us except for one. that one person was a male and we asked him if he saw these objects ascending into the sky. he said that he could see them. we asked what they were, and named things like satellites, airplanes, etc. he said that they were none of the things that we mentioned and he said that he didn't know what they were. \r\n\r\nso we went back into the rv and tried to get some sleep. when we woke up after several hours we went to my ex mother-in-law's house to take showers. when my friend got out of the shower she showed me three red dots in the shape of a triangle on the right side of her belly. at that point for some strange reason i disregarded it! i made some excuse that maybe she had gotten bitten by fleas or something. it was bizarre, why would i disregard such a thing? \r\n\r\nso at any rate, i'm not posting this to freak anyone out. i just wanted to finally get this up on mufon. i had many many experiences after this, but nothing quite like this one. it would be difficult to explain what i've experienced with this sort of thing over the years, but i don't feel threatened by these encounters in any way. this may sound crazy after describing such an experience. what i can say is that these beings that are out there seem to be on another dimensional

right at to go home i noticed this huge light pattern about 1/4 mile ahead, on the south side of the hiway. it was stationary. the lights looked too clear and vivid to be real and it's ruby redness captivated me while confusing me greatly. my first thought was that a new cell phone tower had been put up, but i felt mentally confused as if i couldn't think clearly. i turned right onto the road that i live on and then turned into a convenience store parking lot to get a better look at what i was seeing. there was a car there with a couple teens standing outside their car and i thought initially that they were looking at the object. i am not sure if they were or not because the clarity and the gem like quality of those lights made me quickly forget to look to see if they were also staring at the object. but what is strange about this experience is my state of mind which had changed into something like being under the influence of some drug, almost a dream like state that affected me as i watched this object with its beautiful lights. i think there was probably 8 lights outlining the rectangular object that looked as tall as a two story house and as long as a very large house. and no more than 1/4 mile in the distance, over the trees, perhaps around a hundred feet up in the air above the trees. i sit and watched the beautiful red and white lights and noticed that it was moving very slowly, a creep towards the south. in fact its movement was so slow that you could hardly tell it was moving at all, but it was. i sit there perhaps for 5 minutes watching it move like the hands on a clock to the south until it moved out of my sight, still over the woods that stretch southward from this hiway. it made no noise. \r\n\r\ni have never seen something like this that would be termed a ufo. and i am 62 years old. there is no explanation for this, being too large to be a copter and silent to boot. generally i am the type of guy that is curious and normally would have driven towards it to get in closer, yet i had no urge to do that, which is weird. upon arrival at home i would have generally told everyone about what i saw, but i didn't. and i don't know why. it wss only when i began to think about it today that i felt i should report this as it needs to be documented. i am not a ufo nut. yet i saw something here that cannot be explained by earthly things. i saw something that was just like a ruby with an internal light source, brilliant and so beautiful to look at. i have never seen earthly lights that looked close to this. these were just too vivid, too clear, with the lights being about the size of a pea if you held the pea up at arm's length. in the shape of a huge two story house, longer than it was high. i could not see an object behind the lights, but they were on something, outlining it. i am more bothered by the change in my consciousness at that moment than the object itself. it affected my behavior when i was observing it. and i cannot explain exactly how it affected my behavior, except that i didn't get closer which i certainly would have done if my mind had been working the way i am used to.

the went on down i17 to work.  it was approximately 630 am in the morning, as we had to be at work by 7 am. i believe it was sunday, but it could have been saturday.  if it was saturday then it could

i have always wondered if anyone else saw it or reported it. it was not a balloon, and it was not hanging from anything, like a crane. i didnt think much about it until later, then it creeped me out.  i was thinking that it looked like an observation room or deck that was floating in the sky, and not up on a ridge or on top a building were it should be.  i was thinking that it was supposed to be invisible, and somehow the \"cloaking\" device was accidently turned off, or maybe they wanted to be seen for a brief time. anyway, would really like to know if anyone else saw it, or if it has been seen in the phoenix area before or after. i have no photo as we did not stop, but my photo is one i found on the internet that is close to what i saw.  i am thinking that the photo is of a much bigger craft. thanks","distance":"101-500

was dark. from the west across the street there is a wooded lot. over the trees came the object it was a black triangle matte finish with 3 white lights on the underside that were a constant glow, it was huge bigger than a football field its depth was maybe one to two stories tall, it was solid and it was moving very slowly. i could have hit it with a rock.And i started to shake. it moved right over us and was not making a sound,  my husband thought he heard a humming sound but i did not hear it. we watched it move over us for about 30 sec then  i ran into the house to get my daughter. when i came back out it was still moving to the east very slowly till we could no longer see it.  it did not make a sound but just kept moving  very slowly toward mobile al. i was phsically shaken not knowing what it was. my husband did not want to talk about it.  we could not understand how something so big could just float by with no sound. we could just watch it and not believe what we were seeing. my husband thought people would think we were crazyif we reported it. i watched the news that night to see if anyone else had seen it but there was nothing about it. it was so large and that i can not believe no else had seen it. i was watching a ufo files program about sightings in illinois about the time we had our sighting, and the descritpion of the object was exactly the same as what we saw.

started thinking that was my first ufo sighting. the object appeared out of nowhere and was stationary. it was emitting different lights including white, blue, green, red and yellow. it stayed there for about 4 or 5 minutes total. \r\n\r\nabout 10 days after that i was at my balcony again looking at that part of the sky, where ufo appeared. then it appeared again with same characteristics as before. this time it stayed for a little bit shorter period of time. at that time i was sure that what i saw was an actual ufo.\r\n\r\nmonth or so, after the 2nd sighting i saw red light going forward and backward behind the mountain. it did that for about 10 to 15 times. i could see the path it was going on and it's trail was fading away as the ufo was moving away.\r\n\r\nthree months after that i was going out. it was about 6 or 7pm. the day was really sunny and i could see two dozens of airplanes and the trails they were leaving behind them. i looked at the \"avaz twist tower\" and next to it i saw a metallic disc-shaped craft hovering in the air. the car was coming along the road so i had to step onto sidewalk and i turned my head for about a second but when i looked back at the sky nothing was there.\r\n\r\ni'm pretty sure that what i saw wasn't an airplane or helicopter because i'm used to seeing it all the time. i will never forget this short period of my life because i always

to me. i've been an avid stargazer since birth, i follow ufology, and i have always believed that we were not alone in the universe long before anybody had brought the debate up. feeling quite robbed of my ability to see the lyrid meteor shower last night, as there was very dense cloud cover in my area, i decided to see if i could see anything tonight. as we went outside to smoke, we light our cigarettes, and as we often do, looked up. i was just glancing around trying to decide which constellation to marvel at, and as i did i looked to what i think was the star, alphard, i don't know my stars super well this was after the fact using starmap 3d, anyway, what i thought was a star begins to move slowly across the sky. as i had just stared to watch it i thought, \"oh, just another plane.\" as i live very close to bwi and there's constant air traffic over my house. but then as it got closer, i didn't hear any jet engine sounds as i normally always do, and as i watched it move across the sky, it seemed to be weaving, from left to right, in somewhat of a line, as it flew. i thought this was odd for a plane to be flying in this manner, and let out a, \"hmph.\", as if puzzled and as my friend dave knew what that sound meant, he began to watch what i was as well. we both obseverd this object for about 5 minutes, and at the very end of the sighting it made a very abrupt 90 degree turn and the light vanished, which is something i have never observed personally until last night. it left me with goosebumpbs as i had been waiting my entire life to observe a ufo first hand, unfortunately without the foresight to bring a video camera i didn't capture anything. but it felt unreal to me, i tried as i could to logically explain away what we had both witnessed. perhaps a sattelite, for example. but the more i tried, the more it seemed apparent to me that i couldn't explain away what i had seen, which led me to believe that i did in fact observe a ufo.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
