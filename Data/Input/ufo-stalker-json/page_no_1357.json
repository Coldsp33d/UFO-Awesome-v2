pit. we decided we would burn the brush and sit and watch for some meteors during the meteor shower, at about 955pm i had stood up to warm my back against the fire and i was facing the north west sky i noticed this bright round light moving towards us just over the tree tops behind my house, i quickly noticed it did not have any flashing red white or green lights that are  required  on all aircraft, i said to my wife for her to look at this light coming towards us and over our head, as she saw it she said what is that i said , well i don't know for sure, i can't see any flashing lights like a normal aircraft would have, but we should hear some type of engine noise in a few seconds  as it gets over our heads and past us which is normally the case when you see a normal aircraft going past you then you hear the engine. i also noticed that it appeared to be covering a large amount of distance way faster than any aircraft i have ever seen, and believe me i have seen many, i was an air force brat since the age of 6 and i also almost 9 years active duty in the air force. i said to my wife im gonna get my binoculars that were in my truck approximately 30 feet away from us,i kind of fast walked over to it grabbed them and headed back towards my wife a few steps as i was about to lift the binoculars up towards the object she said in an excited voice it just changed direction, i quickly looked up to get a fix on it with my eyes so i could put my binoculars on it and it appeared to have moved in an easterly direction form when i last saw it and it appeared to be in a hover for a second then just shot straight up and out of sight within about a sec to second and a half, enough to know that it was getting smaller and not simply the light going out. there was no sound at all. we had seen several aircraft flying around before we saw the object all had the typical flashing red , green type lights and sound, as well as after we saw the object. having been around every imaginable aircraft in our arsenal as well as many other countries aircraft, i can tell you for a fact this was not one of our known aircraft. i hope others were out watching the meteor shower and saw the same object.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

clear skies in low altitude.This time though we got a treat.We saw something that we've never seen this bright orb do before while in flight,it totally vanished right before our eyes.\r\n\r\nthe sighting was short & only lasted a minute or a few seconds over.I was star gazing for about an hour before the sighting.Matter of fact,every since our last star like orb sighting a few weeks ago,i've made it a point to go outside just after sunset & star gaze for awhile.As always,the very bright object was moving slow in a steady path but in a lower altitude than the last time seen.When gazing,i'm constantly looking around in all directions & the object seemed to just suddenly appear but i could be wrong.As soon as i spotted it i got inside the house as soon as i could & yelled for my wife to come outside.She came quickly & said yeah that's it again,so i yelled for my daughter to come out & look before it got further away.She came outside quickly & was viewing this object when within seconds,it vanished.And that was the shocker because even my daughter couldn't hardly believed that as bright as it was & as clear as we could see it,it just vanished.No trace anywhere,it was gone & out of sight. there were no clouds at the time & the moon was full.I had a cheap video camera on me,figured it was better than nothing but by the time i got the power on,that's when it was gone.See there was no getting fainter & fainter as it glided off into the distance,it was bright in a flight path & like a light switch it was off.\r\n\r\nthere is something to this folks. i don't know what it is but strange things are going on in our skies.And these bright single star like orbs i believe are unique. we've never witnessed more than 1 at a time.It makes one think of a pure energy source.

day, it was around 7:45 in the evening. i have an injured ankle that was swollen at the time (but i was still capable for outdoor activities) and all of a sudden it felt copmpletely soaked and tingly (my whole right ankle and foot) i didn't want to tell my daughter in case she'd worry about me. i looked up and thought i saw a plane, when it really turned out to be a cigar looking white object floating silently above the treeline. i pointed it out to my daughter, who for some reason didn't take it seriously. i found this weird. as we were playing badmitten, i kept looking at it as it floated silently and slowly above the trees. it was going sw and then suddenly i noticed it was going n. throughtout the duration of this time, i was constantly looking back and forth (quite often) and when i looked up after it turned n, i realised it had disappeared. i pointed it out, once again, to my daughter who actually didn't care and took the time to talk me into staying outside with her. this whole time, as well, i noticed our dog was acting strangely and looking at the trees it flew over. as i looked occasionally with him, i noticed two or three scaly figures walking where he was looking. i tried talking my daughter into going inside again, but she kept insisting everything was fine. our dog started to walk in the direction, very slowly, the ufo had beein flying to. my daughter called for him and as did i, but when he came my daughter suddenly became serious about it all. she told me she saw a golden orange light off in the trees coming from the n angle. however, she once again insisted we stay outside. i then accidentally hit the birdie to my car and she went to get it when she complained to me that she was feeling raindrops when it was a cloudless sky. i felt it as well. walking back, she complained to me that she had goo on her hand, but thought it was a possibility it came from the dog. shortly after, we went inside. i decided to call my father who is interested in ufos. only after when we sat down to report the incident and the time did we realize how short time had really been throughout the sighting and being outside. my daughter and i actually argud about how long we were outside and the specific times and how we both felt we were out for hours. she decided to check the phone history to see when we had come in ( and just saying, i called my boyfriend shortly before we played as well) we realized it had to have happened over 15-20 minutes. looking back, this gives us both shivers down our

were heading over the house. we were facing south and it was coming at us from the southwest then changed direction and headed straight north toward us. it became incredibly bright which was when we began to doubt that it was a helicopter. the light became stationary in the sky over the town and flashed a beam. i thought it may be a search helicopter with a very much brighter than usual light searching for criminals or the like. it proceeded toward us again at which point i was looking to see if i could spot a pilot as the light became close enough that if it were a helicopter i should have been able to see occupants in it. it was then that i realized there was no sound coming from it. if it was a helicopter there should have been the chopper blade sounds which are unmistakable. the orb was stationary for approximately a minute then reappeared slightly toward the west as if it had jumped sideways then it simply vanished with no sound or trace. the weirdest thing was that when we checked the time, it was 90 minutes later when it should have been only about 10 minutes. i have always thought that ufo sightings were usaf black ops but this one has me scratching my head wondering.

overhead if it hadn't turned more to the east. no sound that i could hear. but it might have been too far and it was breezy out. i waited for the plane (coming from the east) to pass to see if it

altitude in a scattered group, seemingly several miles away. i assumed they were helicopters on a training mission. however, as they came closer i could see no strobes or navigation lights, specifically no green or whites, only red and orange.  \r\n\r\ni have a pair of zeiss binoculars inside the doorway of the house so i quickly grabbed them and focused on the group of spread-out lights as they started to veer westwards, still some distance to the north of where i was. these are good binoculars, and i was able to get a detailed look at the objects.\r\n\r\ni saw no white aircraft strobes, nor flashing navigation lights. each shape appeared to be the same. they consisted of a broad central band of red/orange colour, with what seemed to be an intense paler hat on the band, and a deep red spot of colour underneath. the shapes and colours pulsed slowly, each cycle lasting perhaps two seconds. as i watched they drifted to the west and each light disappeared in turn, perhaps because of some scattered cloud although i thought the objects were below it. i could hear no noise or distinctive aircraft disruption from that area, despite the wind being from that direction. \r\n\r\nat the same time i was able to clearly see light aircraft in the area, and a civilian passenger jet at high altitude. i was able to hear the noise of these aircraft with no problem. it may have been that the objects i was watching were too far away for oral recognition, but i thought they were within 2 - 4 miles range.\r\n\r\nthe entire event lasted 2 minutes or so. i estimated the objects were probably travelling between 150 and 300 mph. i found it strange that they disappeared out of sight so
