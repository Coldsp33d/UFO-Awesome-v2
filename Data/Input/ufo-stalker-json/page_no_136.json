looked like it could have been an explosion in outer space. i don't think it was a craft although i wouldn't rule it out. \r\n\r\ni heard no sound. the light remained stationary as it changed shape,

would have been at that time of night was entirely obscured by clouds, different than the ones obstructing the western part of the sky, where i saw the light(s?). \r\n\r\ni've never seen a ufo in my

 the white light did not pulsate, did not change color, nor dim.  it remained consistently white and the brightness stay the same.  i also noticed that the object did not change direction, it did not change color, it seemed to be one piece, no seams, nor other appendages or other extending parts of the object.  there were no sounds, no wind, no propulsion, no engines, no static electricity, no vibrations, no barking dogs…. nothing other than this object moving silently across the tree tops until out of view.\r\nonce the object completed its flight beyond the tree tops to the west, i stood there continuing to collect my thoughts, mentally record my physical surroundings at street level, was there anyone else that also saw this object and taking note of the higher elevations, tree locations and any after-effects that might have been caused by the ufo.  i began processing in my mind what i just saw and took stock of myself as to what just happened.  there is no doubt in my mind what i saw and will never deny it.  i am a very practical individual.  i have been in the construction industry all my life, since i was a little boy.  i use visual distances gathering in my business constantly and can accurately determine what is the distance to an object when needed.  i’m also a golfer since my early teens and can read yardage distances quite accurately.  my experience as a builder over the years is based on solid and practical experiences.  i do not fanaticize.  i base my facts and decision-making on what’s in front of me and can also accurately conceptualize what something looks like when not clearly apparent.\r\nwhen i was finished with my analysis of what just happened, i returned to my home and told my wife and father-in-law,” i just saw a ufo”.  stating the obvious, they both did not believe me and told me i was hallucinating.  to this very day, i have only told my immediate family and close friends of my experience.  \r\nthe story does not end here, 14 years ago.  seven years later following this sighting, i had to go to work very early in the morning.  i left my house about 4:30 am.  my radio station is usually turn to 640 am (kfi) in the los angeles area, which begins with bill handle (host) at 5:00 am.  before the 5:00 show, coast-to-coast with george nori is airing.  at approximately 4:50 am, george takes one last caller from north carolina, which begins his short story of a fishing trip him and several of his friends just completed in north carolina.  this is where the story get’s weird!  they were finished fishing and everyone was sitting around a campfire.  it was dusk and not dark.  he described to george nori this ufo that came over their heads and was in clear view.  his discription of the ufo was an exact match to what i described in this report!  needless to say, i couldn’t believe what i was hearing.  when i returned home that evening, i told my wife what happened, and the next day i tried to call into the radio station, but couldn’t get through.\r\nthis is the first formal report that i’m writing and submitting to an outside agency “center for ufo studies”.\r\ni would appreciate your help in letting me know that you have received my report and if your archives indicate that there have been other witnesses to this event.  \r\nbecause this happened 14 years ago, my timing of this event may have a small degree of error.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:12","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":86907,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.6503717578311,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09242017-0024","longitude":-117.54907633865663,"occurred":1041292800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Blimp","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1506290382000,"summary":"Observed large cigar-shaped ufo with only one round light that had a reflective surface but it's contrast to the black sky created an outline clearly identifying it's shape.

possibly have been moving like this. it darted in different directions at high speeds. it would also ascend or descend slowly and precisely; or simply hover in one spot of various lengths of times. we also noticed two (extremely dim) lights below the brighter light, going down at 45 degree angles, making a triangular shape in the lights. we watched intently for over an hour and a half. we couldn't take our eyes off of this light. it was incredible. after some time, the light grew dimmer and dimmer until we simply couldn't see it anymore. we were both mesmerized and knew we had seen something extraordinary that couldn't be explained by anything we found with research. even i, being a skeptic about these things, couldn't believe what i was seeing. we attempted to take videos of the light on my iphone, however the quality is low--although in one of the videos you are briefly able to see the light moving in the sky. due to the distance away from us and phone quality camera, i wasn't able

to be the only one there that had the presence of mind to leave before something regrettable happened to them.  everyone else was entranced or hypnotized by these lights and they did seem to have a calming effect.... but i have had an interest in ufos my whole life and i know they do have a reputation for snatching people and this one could easily have snatched all of us and a thousand more as big as it was.  anyway i wasw the last to get there and the first to leave.  i have only seen one other ufo since then and it was flying over my neighbors house for about thirty seconds.  pretty cool but nothing will ever compare to this.  sorry i waited so long to report it.  maybe somebody else saw more....  \r\n","distance":"21-100
