(do not attempt to drive through the area without a good 4-wheel drive vehicle or atv and bring at least 1 gal. of water per person, per day) after spending the night at aden crater i went to demming, nm to get food and water. on saturday night ( sunday morning) while camping at kilbourne's hole, dona anna county, new mexico, i woke up to nature's call at approx. 1:15am. i have a tent set up in the back of my jeep for cold nights. i crawled out of the tent, grabbed my cell phone to see the time-1:19 am. the moon was half full 45 deg (approx) and setting to the west. the skies were clear. i decided to light a cigarette and look at the stars. i was camped inside the upper crater on a plateau just on the edge of the south inner rim. for approx. 20 min i observed (commercial aircraft and meteors had been seen earlier in the night) a commercial airliner flying nw to ne. i was facing the crater looking north with my head turned west to see the moon. i turned my head to the north looking at the stars when i noticed out of the corner of my eye a white light to the east just over the top of the crater's outer rim . as i turned to face the light, it grew in an instant to a large, brilliant, hovering orange-red plasma sphere with yellow and white outer plasma ring. the object was approximately 100-150 feet in diameter. the object actually lit up the walls of the crater near me slightly and cast shadows off the crater rim to the east as it's position was over the desert outside of the crater rim overpowering the half full moon to the west. i took a few steps toward my jeep and stood at the driver's side windshield by the driver side door looking over the roof. the object was approx. half a mile from my location approx. 2-300 ft elevation above the southeast crater rim. i was dumbfounded (and glad my jeep was there for cover) as the center two thirds of the object which appeared as a deep red and orange much like hot lava with the outer one third brilliantly ���white and shimmering like plasma, began to ascend very slowly. ���i observed the object for a few seconds trying to rationalize what i was seeing. i grabbed my iphone from my back pocket, switched the camera to video and tried to film the object. i hit record, tried to steady my hand on the hard to of the jeep, however the object started to ascend more quickly. as it ascended, the orange-red center of the sphere shrank and the yellow-white outer rim collapsed around it becoming a bright white spec in an instant. the object shot off at mind-numbing speed up, and to the east away from me.. i was only able to capture the object ascending for a few seconds, and what appeared to be out of the atmosphere. i took a few minutes to get a grip on what i had just observed...Looked around to see if it might reappear, however all was quiet as it had been before the observation. i noticed an airliner flying in over the horizon from southwest, waited for it to get overhead and decided to call it a night.\r\niphone can't upload drawings/sketches to this web-form.\r\nthis info with sketches sent to mufon new mexico","distance":"501 Feet - 1

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My parents and i had spent the afternoon walking in the mianus river park in greenwich, ct one sunday afternoon in 1979. as we started down cognewaugh rd. toward stanwich rd., i noticed a bright white light in the northwest sky. it caught my attention because of its brightness and size and also because it seemed too early for a star to be out. it was nearing dusk but the sun had not set yet. i continued to watch the light out the back window of the car as we made our way down stanwich rd. toward town. the light appeared to be getting brighter and larger. at some point i described what i was seeing to my mother, who was riding in the front passenger seat. she didn't have any trouble spotting it and became equally, if not more curious than i was. after a few miles, we turned right on a winding road that took us to north street. don't remember the name of the road. anyway, this road connecting stanwich rd and north street had a lot of ups and down and sharp turns, yet we were able to continue tracking object. it almost seemed like it was following us. while travelling 3 or 4 miles down north st., we lost sight of the object a couple times, but whenever we picked it back up it was clearly getting larger, brighter and closer. it was about this time that we began to get a little excited because it did not appear to be a helicopter or plane with lights on it; instead, it was looking like a solid mass of very bright light.  at the end of north st, we turned left onto maple ave and went about 1/4 mile or so to our driveway. my father had been concentrating on driving, hadn't looked up or been interested in seeing what we were seeing, despite our increasing excitement. as soon as we pulled into the driveway, my mother and i hopped out of the car and immediately looked back in the direction of north street. that's when the craft -- a large glowing pinkish yellow-gray football shaped disc with a light rotating around it very fast -- came gliding slowly and silently right over the trees across the street from us (about an 80 degree angle), over the greenwich women's club and south in the direction of the boston post road. having just seen an actual spaceship at close-range, my mother and i jumped in the car and took off in the direction of the craft was going. at the end of our street, we took a left on the boston post road and sped about 1 mile to the top of put's hill, where we spotted the craft just above the treeline. my mother pulled into the parking lot of the shalom temple, where we got out and looked up in absolute amazement. we walked out to the sidewalk and watched as the craft slowly glided out from over the millbrook neighborhood, over the post road we were standing on and over the greenwich high football field. the ship was quite large, about twice the size of a c-17 perhaps. the whole ship was glowing but an even brighter light was rotating around it counterclockwise. as it crossed the post road it seemed to wobble just a bit. again, it was completely silent, which was just astonishing because of its size and how close we were to it. after passing over the football field, the ship shot straight up and out of sight in a split second. amazing. it was so fast that it was almost comparable to simply disappearing. there was just the faintest trace left behind of it going straight up.  the sun had dropped over the horizon somewhere back on north street before we pulled into the driveway, so the ship disappeared about 15 minutes post sun set. still plenty of light out. it was the kind of light, for example, that would have been enough to finish up a baseball game on a field without artificial lights. the umpire would be speeding things up with an ever-widening strike zone perhaps, but it was your textbook dusk lighting when the whole thing was over. after it disappeared, we rushed home and my mother called the greenwich police, who said their phones were ringing off the hook with sightings. they said several of their most senior officers had called to report seeing the craft up close and that they were just as awestruck as we were. that was that. never saw anything in the newspaper or on television. didn't hear anything at school. maybe a week later my mother had heard that she'd heard a local restaurant/hotel called the showboat was advertising something with a plane that had lights on it, possibly the same night. but we, of course, knew what we'd seen up close and while it was still light out. it was a solid object that seemed to be solid steel glowing yellowish pink with the light revolving around it -- nothing remotely like a plane or any other earthly aircraft. it was silent, enormous and disappeared vertically in a half-second right in front of us. my mother and i have brought it up to each other every once in a blue moon just to remember and shake our heads in astonishment again, but we both know that there's no point in trying to convince anybody that we saw what we saw. neither do either of us feel like we have a need to do so. i know i didn't talk about it to classmates because i was 13 years old and right in the middle of that awkward period in junior high school where you're trying to figure out where you fit in, etc. and was not about to announce to anyone that i'd seen an actual ufo.  well, not really a ufo -- it was a spaceship from another plant, no question about it.

most likely wouldn't be writing this note.I am curious as to whether anyone else saw this object.Were it not for points of reference,(my window frame & the trees)i'm not sure that i would have continued watching object for a half hour.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

in from an angle it changed and was parallel with the ground. i thought to myself that this is not a meteor or shooting star. i continued to watch it move north westerly, disappear behind the roof of the house next door and reappear on the other side. i walked in the same direction  to get a better look. it stopped in a north westerly direction. it was shaped like a sideways ice cream cone with oblong lighted windows covering the entire object from left to right and up and down. there was about four or five rows of these very long oval windows. the object was very flat in the front except for a very bright light which created an immense arc of light. hearing a noise to my right, i gazed in that direction. when i returned to look at the object it had disappeared.\r\n\r\ni just checked

window to th northwest.  earlier i was admiring the huge bright moon while it slipped below the tree line.\r\n \r\nas i was taking a pill i looked up and saw 2 lights, shaped oval, hovering over an old bomarc missile base about a mile or so to the northwest, just appear out of the darkness.\r\n they just hovered there for about a minute not changing color or shape.\r\n \r\ni awoke my wife to see these lights, and just as she moved to see out the window they started moving to the east.  they made no noise and the clear white light just kind of flickered slightly.  they moved off to the east from the point i first saw them.\r\n \r\nnow i am a pilot with over 1200 hours in my log book and, who's father was a navigation tech. with both the usaf and with the federal aviation admin.  i grew up around loring afb and the presque isle airport (along with many nav sights in northern maine).\r\n \r\nmy point here is these lights were between me and the bangor vor, which sits a few miles off the north end of bangor international airport.\r\n there were no strobe or anti collision  lights, no wing position lights, a red light should have been visible as they were approaching me and the left wing would have a red light marking it.   as i said earlier, there was no sound at any time.  the lights were about 2 to 3 football fields apart from the time the appeared until they moved out of my sight.\r\n \r\ni see aircraft flying over and around home most every day.  bia is the home of the 101st air refueling wing, flying kc 135 stratotankers, which make a huge noise on take off and cruising overhead.   also we have a helicopter unit stationed here, flying uh 60 blackhawks, which are also noisy.\r\n \r\nthe lights approached no closer than  2 football fields near me.  i saw no other lights or aircraft in the sky.\r\n \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

truck for the next day. my truck was backed in my drive facing east and i had walked out my front door of my home that also faces east and was using the passenger door to place the items in my truck. i closed the truck door and pivoted to my left (now facing north) to go back in my house, when i noticed on the horizon 3 (three) objects approx. 30deg. above the horizon at an altitude of 3500'msl (2500' agl in this area). the objects were flying in formation, with the lead craft in the middle and the other two craft approx 1nm back and 1nm to either side of the lead craft. i was startled. i am a retired pilot, and the reason i was startled is that i initially stared at the lead object only due to the fact that it resembled an aircract, especially a turbo-prop, with an engine fire. my eyes were obviously drawn to the other two craft as well and i did not know what to make of what i was seeing. the craft were heading due west (270deg.) making no sound. as i stated, they resembled an orange-yellow fireball with no discernable sharp edges. the firey glowing light they emitted was no aircraft lighting as this light came from the entire craft. it was not light being projected onto say the fuselage or vertical stabilizer as pilots turn on below 10,000 feet when landing to light the logo or name on an airplane. these were independent craft and not one solid object as i noticed stars and  upper level cirrus clouds that were covering approx. 15% of the sky at the time of the sighting between the objects. i ran into the house get my binoculars, scanning the sky eastward seeing nothing else in the sky. i do need to add that these object were very contrasted against the night sky, there was no missing these things in the sky. i got my binocs and when i got back outside, there was a 4th object trailing the three, completing a tetrahedron formation as the 4th craft was trailing the lead craft by approx. 5nm. the craft were traveling at a speed, i calculated based on their distance away which being 30 deg. on the horizon at 3500' altitude, to be roughly 125kts. i must also state that these craft seemingly just appeared, as i had been facing east when going out to my truck. also, we have telescopes and are satellite and iss followers, so i am always staring up at the sky especially at night. the moon this evening is at 3/4 and is 75deg. on the horizon to the south southeast. the objects made no deviations in course/heading or altitude changes, there were no changes in speed. as i stated, i was so alarmed by thinking that this was an aircraft with an engine fire, but i had to take into account that there were 3 more of these things. they were traveling too fast to be lighter-than-air category man made craft. they emitted the yellow-orange light verses projecting light in a beam from say a landing light or courtesy lights. i am 50 years old, i grew up flying with my father and then at the age of 17 obtained my ratings and went on to have a careet in aviation with 10's of thousands of hours of flight time and this is the first time in my life that i have ever looked upward and have seen something i cannot explain. i have seen every type of aircraft fly both military and civilian so i had to write. i made no calls to cak (akron canton regional airport) being a sunday evening, i would have difficulty reaching the tower by phone. again, so i am writing you. i'm really kind of shook up by this, i just was asked by someone the other day if i had ever seen anything whenever i was flying, you know ufo's they asked, honestly and emphatically no i've answered anyone that has ever asked me that question and i have been asked a lot. i can no longer answer no.\r\n\r\nthank you,","distance":"Over One

green, blue and red very quickly. over the space of 15 minutes, i observed these objects make sudden changes in elevation while moving to the left and right. they did not move in unison or any kind of

movement but at a considerably higher speed. it's difficult to judge the distance but i estimate that it was at lease one mile. one of them appeared to be closer than the other. there were two other
