clould started becoming more defined. as i passed the old canyoncito exit i still could see the cloud and then the craft came out of the cloud. it was half the size of the smaller mesa  and lowered below the larger mesa. that is when i knew it was something more than the cloud. as it decended below the mesa it was slowly turning clock-wise, reminding of how an electric meter turns. i was afraid to stop and the weather was cold and windy that afternoon, and no other cars were stopping. i didn't think that i was \"spiritualizing matter\" because i never heard of a descripton like this, but i watched it for about 5 to 10 minutes. it was maybe a quarter mile in width,i don't know what the height could have been. there were no windows or lights, and i thought it might be a hologram since it was clouldy, but it was slowly moving and spinning.It was a dull gray that was the same color as the cloud before decending. it slowly moved between the mesa and at that time i was at the los lunas exit, after that i could not locate it in my rear view mirror. i think i called david jacobs phd, and or icar and left a voicemail. on monday my neighboor across the street came over and i told her about the ufo. she told me her relatives had stopped by on friday and they were upset after seeing something in the sky that looked like a merry go round on their way back from grants, nm to san fidel. the shape i saw was like a round layer cake in shape. during that next week there was unusual military activity, my landlord had seen some type of craft above the area hovering with a humming sound but the trees were not disturbed. he is a vetran and knows ths shapes and sounds of most military aircraft. we later called kirkland air force base and reported the low flying military craft and the two ufos. it was reported to base public affairs.I am not sure if this activity was due to local pueblo tribes conducting ceremonies.I was seeing orbs on and off for over a week that cause distress and panic. this object seemed to be very solid and i din't feel that goverment technology could produce something that masssive and dense. last visual i had it was traveling between the two

loud explosion like maybe a car accident. then we noticed the power went out in the neighborhood. we call the power company and they said there was reported 1100 outages already. we think--oh, a transformer blew maybe a car crashed into a pole or something. maybe that's what the noise was. no biggie--we've got a fire going, we're having fun. about 15 or so minutes pass and we see a quick streak across the sky then it stopped and moved steady across the sky. it was a reddish-orange color. no flashing, no crazy movement. just steady through the sky in a straight path. my first thought--oh, maybe it's a helicopter because of the loud crash we heard. but there was no spotlight coming from it and no noise. then we see another one. this one didn't move fist then slow down. it just moved slowly across the sky. our friends house that we were at is in a wooded area but off a main road through raleigh. when we first see the orange light it looks like it's just over the tree tops then went into the horizon. we saw a total of 6, one after another. between 2 and 5 minutes apart. \r\nanother friend of ours shows up and he said that the main road is blocked off in several directions and the officer said that a tree fell and took out some powerlines. \r\npower was restored at 11:30\r\n\r\nwhen my husband and i left there is an intersection if we turn right and all of it is blocked off. that intersection is directly behind the neighborhood we were in. we trun around and the next intersection down is also closed off. there is also a right trun between the 2 intersections and it was also closed off. if a tree fell why were there several areas blocked off? we had to take a back road to get to the main road we needed to take. also, if power was restored at 11:30pm and we left at 2:30am--why were they still blocked off in several directions and still working in the area. \r\n\r\nthe whole experience was strange. \r\n\r\nin the video i took i asked \"it would have a soptlight, right\" i asked that becasue someone said it was probably a helicopter. \r\nthe light looks like it's flashing but it's not. it's just goin behind trees. \r\n\r\nsorry it's

became restless because we didn't see anything. we just assumed it was because of light pollution from the surrounding area so we went inside to watch the capitals hockey game and kept checking facebook for any local reports of the northern lights. our plan was to run outside if anyone reported seeing the pretty colors in the sky so we could get a glimpse of this phenomenon, since it might have been a once in a lifetime event in maryland. this was the plan. we both fell asleep around 9:30 p.M. i woke up around 11p.M. and went to the kitchen to get a drink. i woke amy up and she got on facebook to check for any sightings of the northern lights. i managed to look at the microwave clock because the door to the backyard is in the kitchen and that is when i noticed the time. i walked out the backdoor and in to the backyard while amy was still on the computer. i was looking to the north for a minute or two and noticed nothing unusual. i happened to glance down closer to the horizon and to my right, which would have been east when something caught my eye. it appeared to be something moving slowly from east to west. i couldn't see what it was and the only reason i noticed it was because it blocked out the stars behind it as it moved. it made no sound and i thought it must just be a small cloud or smoke. the sky was perfectly clear, not a cloud in the sky. all of a sudden a perfect triangle of three lights appeared from this invisible craft or cloud and began to spin clockwise. at first i thought is was spotlights but then it began to move in a fast straight line to the west. the lights didn't blink, they were solid white the entire time. the object slowed down, the lights continued to spin and it just disappeared. i was dumbfounded. i love the paranormal and ufo programming on t.V. but am extremely skeptical because i had never seen anything to make me believe it to be true. if what happened next didn't happen i would still be somewhat skeptical. right after the first object disappeared, a second triangle of lights appeared about halfway across the horizon, followed a similar path but this one seemed to appear, disappear, then reappear moving in a straight line to the same spot as the first object. it then seemed to, what i can only describe as disappear behind a veil, but the sky was clear, no clouds. at this point i was shocked and had crazy goose bumps. i began to yell for my girlfriend who i could see sitting in the dinning room on her laptop. i would have yelled for her to come outside to see it but it all happened in about a 10 to 15 second span. she came outside and tried to calm me down but i was 100% sure that i had just seen a real ufo and this scared her. we continued to look for it to reappear and that is when we both saw what appeared to be the shape of a flock of geese followed by two bright greenish white lights. this freaked her out and made me feel like i wasn't crazy. these other lights continued for about another hour on and off and in differing arrays and in different parts of the sky. anywhere from one to four light in a straight row moving at varying speeds. we could see planes in the distance and these were not planes. nothing we saw together was the same or as vivid or close as the triangles that i originally saw though. i don't know what i saw last night but it is unlike anything i have ever seen.

several years ago. i'm looking up at the sky, 'wow'ing over how vivid the stars and moon are tonight. i stood up on top of a stone chair in the backyard in order to see the stars more clearly from the tree branches that were in the way. as i stood up i saw a flash of a white shooting star quickly pass upward but then just as quickly descended in a quick right turn and (i assume) disappeared because it went over the top of the roof where i could not see it. i ran to the front yard but it was gone. i don't know if it was a shooting star with a weird trajectory or some other strange but natural phenomenon.\r\n\r\ni had just woken up from a nap in which i dreamed of looking at the sky and seeing several ufos and then posted on facebook about my previous ufo sighting several years ago. so that was a bit weird and coincidental. \r\n\r\nafter my first ufo sighting i have become a complete believer. i am only interested in what they are...If they are et or our own government. i would love to

noticed to my right (east) a flat, black trapazoid-like shaped object (pyramid shape with the tip cut off) traveling west.  it had no distinct features on it or lights.  it was a black, matte (no shine) color.  when i first saw it i asked myself if it was a bird, a kite, some sort of glider?  obviously none of those things would be flying over a major highway! i held my hand and up to my windshield to give reference to size of it. comparably, it was about the same size.  a person may have completely missed it if they hadn't looked up from the traffic in front of them, it was traveling in-between the setting sun and darkened sky.  my brain was trying to comprehend what i was seeing, not loose sight of it and make sure i didn't run into the car in front of me.  it slowly crossed all 4 south-bound lanes and 4 north-bound lanes in a straight path.  i looked out my driver's-side window at that point, i saw streams of orange/red light hitting my window. ?  kept telling myself  \"you have to remember this!  don't freak out and forget!\" i was a bit freaked by the time i arrived home, but totally thought that everyone on that highway saw it; and thus, it would be in the news.  texted all my friends to watch the news for the story.  that did not happen.  i never let go the the experience, but wondered if i was the only one to have witnessed it that

county in the angeles national forest.  the sky is very clear.  we are about thirty miles from edwards afb.  i believe the time was 9:30 to 10 at night.  i made a post on my facebook page and the first response was at 11pm.  i was gazing up at the stars.  an object moved across the sky at great speed.  the speed was similar to that of a shooting star.  although i was in a shallow canyon, i did have view of a large portion of the sky.  the object was first noticed about 45 deg from a nominal flat horizon to the west.  the oject moved roughly west to east to around 45 deg from the opoosite horizon until i lost view.  this is a great arc across the visible sky.  the object blocked the light of the stars, like a shadow running across the ground.  above i checked \"transparent\" i was not sure if i could see the stars behind/through the shadow.  the size is impossible for me to quantify.  if i was standing starring at the night sky and i had my arm reaching up to the stars, my thumb or a thumb and a half could have been the width of the object that blocked the star light.  the moment this happened i felt an overwhelming awe rush through me.  i had nothing in my mental data base that could explain what i had just seen.  i finished up my chores and went up to the house.  the horses were kept at my wifes sister, shelly, house.  i was still all worked up from the sighting.  i told the story to my wife, deb, to shelly and a few others.  shelly was on her last day or two of life from a battle with melanoma.  shelly saids \"it's me\".  she had a good sense of humor but the comment left us all kind of speechless for a moment.  i now work evenings and get to listen to george nory on the way home.  it was through his show that i heard of mufon and was encouraged to report my

flashlight. i shined it up into the high trees to look at the tops of the trees more than 100 feet above here in the wooded area where we live. i had the flashlight on highest/brightest mode. to my surprise i saw rod like objects about 1/8 inch long & about the thickness of less than a human hair. these tiny objects were reflective & somewhat transparent in appearance & showed up in the beam of my led flashlight on it's highest setting only. on the lower settings & with a regular flashlight i could not see the objects but it appeared to look like a microscopic snow storm of sorts with these objects gently falling in the still air at about the speed of 1/3 the speed of a snowflake.  these objects or whatever they were, were mixed in with the dust & i suspect tree pollen since the other objects were round or irregular.  there were hundreds if not thousands of these objects in the beam of my light. i walked around our property & saw this at every location i shined the light upward. our trees are pollenating here in the woods at this time of the year so at first i thought \"tree pollen\" since we can see the yellow pollen on objects like a picnic bench. i looked up pine tree pollen magnified on the internet & this was not what i saw. the pollen looked round & irregular. i then thought since we live in an area where there is gold in the ground & asbestos rock in the area i thought perhaps asbestos particles. i looked up asbestos magnified on the internet & noted many tiny strands that looked like what i saw but perhaps \"broken up pieces.\" we had our doors open that day so i looked into the light beam in our house & saw these \"rod shaped things\" mixed in with the dust particles but these things reflected light & were all of the same shape. my wife saw the same \"particles\" in the light beam outside & confirmed what i saw. the strange thing was that all of these particles were somewhat transparent & reflective & about the same size. i went outside tonight 04-13-2013 & shined my led 1600 lumen flashlight into the sky & did not see these particles or objects again. for the past week my wife & myself have had headaches & have felt very tired. i am finally starting to feel better but today my wife complained of tiredness. perhaps this is the pollen. we do not know. over 5 years ago our dog at the time died of lung cancer & had been coughing a lot. i
