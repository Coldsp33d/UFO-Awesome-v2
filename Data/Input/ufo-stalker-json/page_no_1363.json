100 feet above treetop level, moving steadily along a southwest heading. it had a red signal light at the center of its ventral surface and white running lights on all three points. i thought it was an aircraft in distress because there are no airfields near my house and it displayed what appeared to be landing lights. i assumed it was an aircraft making an emergency landing. i immediately ran

conventional craft would have had some form of red and green blinking light associated with it. i found it exciting, the unknown is always something that has intrigued me.  this may not be the most

storm had been dying down, and lightning would strike every 1-3 minutes, with rumbling thunder about 10 seconds after each strike. the rain was steadily coming down, but not a downpour. by this time storm had been going on for about 30 minutes.\r\nsuddenly i saw two very large yellow-amber lights and a smaller, pulsing red light between them coming through the dense clouds in the distance. it was coming from the general direction of the airport, so my first thought was that it was an airplane. this is when i pointed the lights out to my partner (he was facing the opposite direction). but then i realized that no commercial plane would take off during this weather. judging from the size of the lights, i thought it could be a cargo plane, as we live about 20 miles from the niagara air force base, but my partner said that cargo planes have 4 yellow lights, and these were distinctly two very large lights. also, the lights were moving much more slowly than a plane would.\r\nas the lights got closer i saw that the red light was in between but slightly behind the two yellow lights. it was a bit more than half the size of the yellow ones, and it was slowly pulsing. i would say that the light was solid red for two seconds before going dim, and it was totally out for about one second. it was not making any noise-- if we had been inside we never would have known it was there. my partner said he saw it teetering slightly but i did not notice this. the lights were in our line of sight for about 1-2 minutes total.\r\nas it got closed we noticed that the lights appeared to be connected, rather than being on wings of an aircraft. they passed directly overhead and we made out what appeared to be a triangle-like object, but the surface was very dull. we do not recall seeing a third yellow light. right before it went over our building and we lost sight of it, each yellow light was approximately the size of the diameter of a aaa battery. when it went overhead it didn't seem too close to the surface, but it was certainly closer to the ground than any airplane i have ever seen (that was not in the process of landing). it still did not make any noise\r\nnormally we would have rushed outside to keep observing it but we didn't. i guess it was because of the weather, but we also were in such shock and awe that we couldn't move. both of us had our iphones with us, and during the sighting neither of us even thought to take any video.\r\njust as a side note, we have 4 cats and a dog, and none of them seemed to be acting out of the ordinary. all of our lights were out so we did not see any electrical activity.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

remembered, i couldnt stop talking about it to my mom, husband, friend. i didnt mention it to my granddaughter, son or daughter. the rest of the family werent told either, i was afraid that they would be frightened enough that they wouldnt come over. my house was the house that had all the family gatherings. i guess the other reason i didnt mention it to the rest of the family is my husband teased me and laughed it off saying i had been over medicating. i do take meds but its for diabetes. i didnt like the idea of being laughed at, which leads me to mention now that this occurance was 2 years ago. today i still cant sleep without having a light on in my family room, i do not stay up late by myself, when my husband goes on business trips i have my mom stay with me. \r\nmy husband, mother in law and 2 small dogs were asleep at 2:00am, morning but i was always up late. taking down the decorations since it was now january and the new years celebrating was over. i have a short 2 step ladder im using and reaching up to remove lights attached to living room window when i step down off the ladder and decide to sit down for a break. the lamps are on, tv is playing and i sit on the sofa and i'm doin that when i see something flying by. not in the middle of the room but closer to the wall where my step stool is. this thing flew, not with wings but like supermam would fly right by me. it was going south but actually turned its head around and looked at me. as it was looking at me it continued in the direction it was headed and flew right through my living room wall. as it flew by and out, my step ladder was right under it, it kicked my step stool so that i heard the metal sound like when someone would step on it or lean on it, metal sound. i could see right through it, i could see my wall, my painting on the wall, i could see right through it but it was clear as day. no loose clothing but a bald head, the funny thing is, the bottom half of this thing was in a triangular shape. although it turned and looked at me i was frozen, it was just gone. i dont remember going to sleep after that.I couldnt figure out what had just went by. i am catholic and i spoke with my priest about this. in our bible it says there are 2 creatures, angels and demons. i just didnt get the feeling this was either of those. i dont want to say alien but what else is there? i couldnt understand why it came from my family room into my living room all the while my lights were on. it just didnt seem to care if it was seen, right? or else it could have gone around my house, or even over my house, but it went through a lighted house with me looking right at it. my mom later asked me if i made the sign of the cross to bless myself. i hadnt, i was so surprised that it had just flown by my desk that had all my blest saints, angels, candles and other statues on what i considered my altar area and it flew by with little consideration for any of that. i have since had my house blessed again but i really dont think it was demonic, i think it was alien. i hear noises and i wonder, is it coming back? is this a regular pathway? from north to south? i laugh, me, a little mexican american woman in chula vista being visited. its scary.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line
