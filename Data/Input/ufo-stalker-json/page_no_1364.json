5th. as we made final descent to charlotte mcdouglas airport , i was looking out my window when i observed a unusual object that caught my eye . we where roughly 200 feet from the ground when incident occurred. i was looking down at the cars on streets and people in their yards when a fast moving cigar shape object that appeared to be 6-10 ft in length flew past the plane going the opposite direction that the plane was traveling . like it was leaving the airport and passing us. the object was between the plane and the tree tops, so i was looking down on it at a 45 degree angle. it appeared to be cigar shape with greyish dark dull exterior tapering slightly toward the ends of it .I followed it with my eyes with my fore head pressed against the window , i strained to see it as it disappeared out of view to the rear of the aircraft and was eventually blocked by the depth of the plane window. it appeard to be moving very fast and i tracked it only a couple of seconds before it zipped out of view. even though the object was traveling in a straight horizontal path it seemed to begin to ascend a short distance after it passed the rear of the plane. i am a non believer in these sort of matters. i only report this out of curiosity of what it was i saw. i thought maby a balloon used for air direction , but i saw no visible teathers on the object and i  thought wind indicators would have bright colors to make them visible to pilots. this was dull color and moving at fast rate of speed. i googled such balloons but found nothing like what i saw.  i thought if it was a toy floating then flying it near landing planes would be dangerous to the airplane. there were no exterior features like fins or markings. i waited til my trip was over to reflect and finally write what i saw. curious if it could have been a every day item that i mistook for a strange object. perhaps a pilot or some one who lives in the neighborhoods near charlotte airport could explain what it was a saw.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

real fast you can still see the craft,i used to think all this was cool until last fall!!!! anyway he was over an old strip mine and when i started putting my light and the laser from my glock almost instantly a smaller red one came from out of the north ,and just stayed in one place ,like checking me out the white one kept looking around and went over out of my sight.My dogs wer finished and with the red one still about500 feet over the mountain ,i just came on in my house!I've seen round ones one shaped like a thumbnail and i had a very very close up encounter with one that was shaped like

a video from surveillance taken in salem, massachusetts, albeit i was much further away... the video seems to be very close to the boom. i was several miles but it was very loud and the sound took no time to get to me. i didn't see any reports about this in the area, but i've seen many across the country and feel it should be considered ufo phenomenon. add west palm beach, florida to the list of

and looked up at the clear sky full of stars, we suddenly seen what we thought was a shooting star, only it didn't shoot down towards earth like stars normally do...It kind of did a squiggly move and it went so fast that it had a tail of light from the speed? in a funny way i can tell you it looked and moved like human sperm would? \r\nthen two more appeared and were moving the same way and all were about the same size. they would shoot off then come back in straight lines, but then they will move in a squiggly pattern off an on, as if they are playing or showing off? \r\nafter about ten minutes they flew off and never came back. everyone that was awake during that slumber party on the tennis court witnessed this event. i thought i would see posts or sightings reported by now, but apparently i couldn't find anything? and this happened when i was still only a child and i am in my 30's now. \r\ni did suffer a traumatic event as a child, but shortly after this occurred. so this means i can say that i don't think my mental health has anything to do with it. i actually forgot about it until a year of two

do, checking objects in the sky. i had been outside since sunset. this incident occurred at 9:53pm. at the time i was following a high flying jet(facing the west)when these 4 definite oval shaped objects crossed my line of sight from left to right. they were traveling in a 'v' formation, equally spaced apart as indicated on the rough sketch i have supplied, going from due north to due south. they were not very bright but bright enough to see their shapes. initially i considered them to be geese but they were too high and their formation was too rigid, so i discarded that idea. they moved very fast in a straight line across the sky. much faster than any geese i have personally observed. the entire sighting only lasted no more than 10 seconds(from horizon to horizon). having had 2 prior observations (1 report filed) of multiple objects traveling together i know these were not any conventional air crafts. having seen many pictures & videos of ufos, i would consider these to be ufos. this was the first time that i have observed 4 objects, in formation, at the same time. the objects continued north and i lost sight of them in the distance. just for the record, about 5 minutes after the initial sighting another object was seen (by me)by itself, traveling in the same direction. i only wish that someone else had witnessed what i saw tonight. had others seen this they would really reconsider what they feel about ufos...And their existence in our sky.\r\nat the time i was using high powered star watching binoculars. specifically they are zhumell 20 x 80 power binoculars, so i

the same time and stated \"what is that?\".  i look to the night sky often and familiar with most activity in our area.  this was not a normal sighting.  typically i would have chalked it up as a plane, however this did not have the characteristics with respect to the orange glow and lack of sound.  it moved from the east toward the west at what seemed to be a normal flight speed.  the oddity was the large glow aspect giving the object a round shape.  when i realized it was something unusual, i called out to my son to bring his camera.  we attempted some shots, not the best, but we weren't expecting to see something.  we watched it for about 3 minutes and then it was no longer in our sight.","distance":"Over One
