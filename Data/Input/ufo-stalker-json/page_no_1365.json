around a small, quiet rural iowa town just talking. i saw to the west, five brilliant white lights. the very high brightness of the lights is what first caught my attention. each white light was about twice as large as an average star in the sky, in a chevron shape. the point of the chevron was pointing east, and the chevron appeared to be slowly and silently moving east. at first i thought maybe it was a military formation of aircraft, high up, heading from the west to the east. the strategic air command (sac) south of omaha, is located west of the town's location. the lights were first seen by me at about 40 degrees above the western horizon, while driving west. the sun had set within the half hour, but sunlight still existed below the western horizon. we drove to a nearby school football field location, where trees would not obstruct our view of the moving chevron shaped lights. the weather was clear with no breeze and no sound at all. the chevron formation continued to slowly & silently get closer until it was about 85 degrees up from the western horizon. the ufo was high in altitude in the sky, maybe about as high as a commercial aircraft. at this point, a new, small pinpoint of light started blinking several colors at the center point location of all the much larger white lights in the chevron shape. the colors being blinked were red, green and white in a random pattern that sometimes repeated any one of the three colors. even the blinking frequency or lack of blinking was random in timing. at this point the five large white chevron lights were appearing larger than when we had first seen them. from our perspective on the ground, the five white lights were now the size of buttons, only with some 3-d depth on them. all five of the larger white button size white lights in chevron formation all simultaneously started to slowly converge on the pinpoint of the blinking light.(in the middle of the large white lights) at the moment the five lights all converged on top of each other, there was a bright flash of white light and the ufo instantaneously shot off into outer space in a north-northeasterly direction at a steep angle away from earth. there appeared to be a momentary light trail following the ufo out into space. it was viewable for less than a second and was multi-colorful. the young lady i was with seemed concerned and wanted to go home immediately. i took her home and then went to my uncle and aunt's home. i was both scared and yet very excited at the same time. i told my uncle and aunt about this occurrence and that we must call the air force immediately. my uncle's response repeated several times was a firm no. he did not want the family to be associated with the occurrence, or notifying the air force. in the summer of 1975, i was a high school student spending the summer living with my uncle & aunt, while working on the family farms in iowa...I did as i was told and did not spread this story beyond family and a few close friends. that was all over 35 years ago now.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

the time. i'm 33 now and what reminded me of the event was when i was watching alien mysteries on destination truth about the kecksburg sighting years ago. the reenactment of the witnesses description looked and acted exactly like what i witnessed just north of loami, il. \r\n\r\ni had got bored and decided to take a walk through the trailer park around 9-9:30pm. i was facing north and seen what at first i thought to be a meteor falling to the ground but it didn't fall to the ground, it was moving from east to west in a downward path but stopped and changed direction and moved back towards the east. it then stopped again and moved back west hovered for a bit then began moving again towards the ground where i had lost sight of it for a moment, it suddenly came back into the air and moved east once again then back west and back towards the ground where i did not see it again. \r\n\r\nwhen it would move it appeared to have a tail of flame coming from it and the tail would change direction with the ufo. \r\n\r\nlike i said it appeared to be a meteor at first engulfed in flames but its movement was not the movement of a falling meteor, which i have witnessed several times, and can tell the difference. a meteor does not change direction several times, land, return to the air, fly around a bit longer then land again. \r\n\r\nall in all i would say the entire event lasted approximately 5mins. i couldnt believe what i had seen. it was pretty amazing, had i been in my vehicle at the time i would have tried to follow it and find where it landed. it was much to far away to get to it in time. it was probably a mile to 2 miles north of loami and west of springfield, il\r\n\r\ni returned to my brothers trailer and described what i had seen but no one believed me, they all assumed i was joking or had seen a meteor.\r\n\r\nthere is another incident that i wrote off as a dream at the time and has nothing to do with this sighting. \r\n\r\ni remember waking up in my bed but not being able to move, in the corner of the room was a tall very skinny version of a normal sized \"grey\" alien with the large black eyes. standing closer to my bed were two shorter, normal sized greys. they seemed to just be starring at me and that's all that i remember. i was much younger probably 10-13yrs old. throughout my life i've had many occasions where i wake up in bed and can't move. i try to scream for help but nothing comes out and there is always a very strong, overwhelming feeling of not being alone. like i am being watched, but i have never witnessed anything in the room with me other than when i had seen the greys when i was young. maybe it was all just my imagination and i have read of instances where you are half asleep and half awake but can't move or talk because essentially your body is still asleep. not sure what the correct term for that is. i pretty much wrote the first event off as a dream and all the other times as the half awake half asleep thing. not sure if you guys are even interested in any of that, just figured i would share it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

trailor i saw a large flying obect that appeared tome to be on fire, i lowered my rifle pointing to the ground and my mouth dropped to the ground, i watched this object fly by it seemed to me to be in slow motion, it was disc shaped and it was horizontle, wtih blue, green orange and yellow flames on the top, it also had a tail, dont remember the color. i watched it until it went over the mountains going toward seligman arizona. i thought to myself that if it crashed it would be a very bad explosion. i didnt hear anything. this object was quiet as it flew by me. it was very low and seemed to be going the way of highway 40 ne. i ran in my trailor called my friends and they didnt believe me. so i grabbed my camera and start taking photo's of the sky sw area of the sky. there were no lights from city or homes as it was in the desert, it was dark outside. the next morning my friend called me and told me that a ufo had been seen in arizona nevada and california. (not so crazy now) i transfered the photo's from camera to my computer as i have a large monitor. they photo's were dark of course it was dark outside. i noticed little red spots in the photo's and so enlarged them, to my surprise i captured many lights and objects in the sky. i shared my photos with friends and they said that on of the crafts looked like the uss enterprise. obviously they thought it was a joke. but it was acctual crafts in the sky.

do you see that?!\" \r\n\r\n\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\r\n\r\nhonestly, aliens. we're nerds, of course we thought aliens. but, in serious terms, i/we knew it was something other than the airplanes, satellites and iss we sometimes see (have seen) passing over the location. we have lived here about 4 years now and this is definitely not normal for the area. \r\n\r\ni'm sorry, but i thought instantly, \"there has to be some other explanation, no @#$(& way are we seeing what i think we are.\" i spent the rest of the week trying to confirm anything that could explain what we saw without \"aliens\" being the explanation. no dice. \r\n\r\n\r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions in detail.\r\n\r\nafter i spotted the anomaly, witness 2 confirmed visual. the first light pulsed slowly once or twice, then slowly a second light off to the left of the first light began to illuminate and became very bright, just like the first one. the lights were very organic, there was no \"on/off\" like a switch or signal, it was all very gentle and slow to light up and pulse like an exaggerated fire fly.\r\n\r\nthe two lights then pulsed slowly, first in answer to one another, then in synchronization/unison. the lights were golden/white/amber colored (varied) and very large and very round (easy shape, no shifting). \r\n\r\nafter both myself and my friend discussed what we were seeing, the craft came down. i don't know how to explain it other than, at first, we saw bright lights through a foggy facade, then the craft came down and we could clearly see the ship with the fog just behind or above it. it was a black skinned craft or at least non-reflective. this next part makes me feel stupid to say, but, it sort of resembled the \"batwing\" shape used to signal batman. (omg please, i'm sorry to discredit with batman >< ) \r\n\r\nit was not stealth bomber shaped like our bombers (triangle), it was not like any aircraft or prototype i know of (fixed wing, kit, rc or recon and please, i know i'm not an expert but i do follow aircraft body styles for years now) or even conspiratorial shaped rumored craft (some of the more... 'creative' reports i've seen, this was not like that). \r\n\r\nthis was, again, organic in shape, very flowing and curved and natural .. simply put it was a very beautiful silhouette of a black ship. this craft featured at least two very bright lights on the bottom, closer to the perimeter of the ship on \"either side\". i could see such lights positioned in that manner being helpful for landing (like flood lights or alley lights on a squad car), but this craft did not land or make any move to do so. \r\n\r\nafter it descended a small bit (like i said, it was very high in the sky, so this descending still left it pretty far above our heads) and we got a very good confirmation of what we saw (no guessing was possible at that point as the fogginess was no longer between the craft and our eyes) - it seems like time kinda stretched out in a weird way. if we had been online, i would describe it like we were having a latency issue or \"lag\" for a minute - we had a strange non-physical impression of communication (contents below). then everything snapped back to normal speed...The craft slowly rotated a bit farther to the east (originally ne) and moved off very slowly, gracefully. no trail or track or disruption in the \"fog\" or the clouds in the area (and an entirely different altitude than the \"fog\") was apparent. \r\n\r\n\r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object.\r\n\r\nafter everything was over, we felt pretty humbled to have been allowed to see this. but at first we were in disbelief and incredulous and feeling a little silly. \r\n\r\nduring the event, and as indicated above after the craft \"came down\" a little, the non-physical/emotional wave hit us. it was really definite. it unwaveringly did feel like the craft was there on purpose, that exact spot and time as we were lying on our backs looking straight up at the sky. it absolutely did feel as if the craft was benevolent or perhaps the beings inside it were/are benevolent, if there were any beings (that part i would have no way to know, we could not see anything like that). we did not feel threatened or scared, never mind the fact that this massive object was exactly above our house with the kids asleep inside (which would normally have sent me into fits). quite honestly, there was nothing negative about this experience - it felt strongly at the time that a transmission was sent but i can't tell you the means of transmission. here is what i received although it does not translate out exactly - \"be at ease. yes, yes, we are here. thank you, thank you for being aware of us - we are most honored. we are visiting [you all] to say hello, we will return later in a more long-term capacity, we will not leave you again.\"  \r\n\r\nother than not immediately understanding the implications of the message, the feeling was very loving and connected but a bit formal and * very official *. the words \"here\", \"aware\", \"you all\" really felt more like, \"we are now permitted to let you know we are are here\", \"thank you for bringing us into your awareness\", and \"the waiting ones\" or \"those who are watching for us\". the words don't fully communicate what was transmitted but that's my best recollection - it was very intense and happy. \r\n\r\n\r\n6. how did you lose sight of the object?\r\n\r\nit left. i guess there was more on the agenda that night than just hanging out in houston with a couple of nerds in the back yard  ;) . \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings,  Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":46864,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.178988,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04202013-0004","longitude":-95.1743284,"occurred":1366182000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Chevron,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1366495493000,"summary":"Bright lights in sky, very high, stationary. lights pulsed twice, craft descended below cloud bank then rotated and headed east. completely silent.

moving.  it moved very slowly as well, and it took around three minutes to become a tiny speck on the horizon.\r\n5. i felt amazed and curious. i didn't really know what to think.\r\n6. the object eventually got too far away to see clearly, until it was not visible at all.

ufo sighting���- early 1970's\r\n\r\none friday evening i was driving northeast on rt.110 heading to my sister's house in shelton, ct. ���it was approx. 6:30 or 7:00 pm. ���it was dark out, so it must have been late fall or winter. ���the roads were clear and it was not raining or snowing. ���i would say it was a clear night. ���i made this trip every week at the same time to visit my sister and her family. ���as i was driving, i noticed an extremely bright light low in the sky. ���it was brighter than any star i had ever seen. ���it was not high up in the sky, where you would expect to see stars, but lower. ���because i was heading in its direction, i kept trying to figure out what it was because i had never noticed it there before. ���i thought the light was coming from a hospital-type facility near my sister's house but realized it couldn't be coming from there. ���then as i got closer, i thought it was coming from a street lamp but realized that the light was above the tree tops. ���(i even thought perhaps it was a spy satellite because there is a huge aircraft company in the area. ���however, the aircraft company was several miles back the other way and if this was a spy satelite it was way off course.) ���as i got even closer to it, i could see that it was staying in one spot, sort of rotating but pulsating at the same time. ���since it was above me, as i turned to go up the road to my sister' house, i couldn't tell how big it was. ���it made me a little nervous, and i wasn't about to get out of my car for a closer look. ���\r\n\r\nthis super bright, pulsating orb intrigued me more than scared me. ���i felt that it was no ordinary object. ���it was a little spooky. ���i was glad to get off the road and get inside my sister's house. when i got to my sister's house, i told all of them that i just saw a ufo over their property. ���everyone said i must have been mistaken etc., etc.\r\n\r\nthe next day, my sister called me at home and said i was right about the ufo sighting and that she was reading the local newspaper that morning (saturday) and it said that at least 100 people had called the police the night before saying that they had spotted a ufo. ���i wished that i had asked her to save a copy of that newspaper so that i could remember the exact date when this event occured.\r\n\r\ni have never forgotten this event and i can still see it clearly in my mind's eye.  the impact of it has stayed with me for more than 40 years.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":46850,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.2861407,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04192013-0015","longitude":-73.0903133,"occurred":184579200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Connecticut","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1366402712000,"summary":"Early 70's -
