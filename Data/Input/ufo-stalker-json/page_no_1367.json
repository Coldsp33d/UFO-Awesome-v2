it was too low and too small and well just clearly wasn't. we figured someone had released a lantern into the air or something similar, as this one was slowly coming towards us another one appeared over the trees on the exact same path as the first, then another one and then a final one. they were all several meters apart from each other, all moving in the same direction all following the same

and the 4 formed a perfect 4 pointed diamond like shape in the sky, all equal distance from one another, a perfect shape. they then after a couple of minutes of hovering like that started moving on

night was clear and the wind was calm.  my neighbor's security light usually washes out the stars, but it's been \"on the fritz\" so i took a moment to take in the night sky.  i immediately noticed a small but very bright red glowing object over the ocean; it appeared to hover. i immediately got my binoculars to get a better look. i was having trouble focusing with my glasses on, so i removed them and was able to see that the red \"ball\" seemed to have some slightly yellowish light in what appeared to be its slow direction of travel. the red portion of the object was much larger than the lighter \"side\" which gave me the impression of something that was more triangular than round--though the direction in which the object was moving could have skewed my perception.  no white lights were observed from the \"rear\".  i thought it could be some sort of emergency flare, but i've never seen one that looked like it as it remained illuminated for about two minutes and drifted slowly southward, vanishing in an instant. almost immediately, a second object--identical to the first--appeared and mirrored its actions. there was no observable launch from land or sea--no trails.  i dismissed that they were distress signals from recreational boaters (who don't piddle around at night in early april)--and the coast guard isn't known for pyrotechnics if they're performing a rescue. definitely not fireworks.  both objects simply disappeared after a total sighting time of approximately five or six minutes. i was absolutely fascinated by the whole thing and wanted to see if a third

elipse type ufo just hovering about maybe 500 feet high,up to my 1 oclock ,witnessed for about 10 seconds or so.Couldnt stop due to traffic to take a pic.I just stared at it super excited as it just hovered there.For size comparison it was the size of an m&m candy if you held it about 7 inches away from your eye.(also that kind of shape)seemed to be maybe 500 or 600 feet away,and maybe 500 feet high in the sky. it just hovered there no noticeable windows or con trails or disturbances,no noise cause i shut off my radio,it looked smooth,kind of like a  keg that was flattened with maybe 3 different sections like the middle was more outwardly pronounced and the top and bottom were slightly rounder in fact kind of like the m&m candy again..As i drove (now the craft about 2 o'clock high),i saw it move just slightly (kind of away from me and down) the distance it moved was about the same width of the craft,then it just disappeared,like it just flicked out. i drove around the rotary ahead of me,and came back to see if i can spot this again,to no avail.\r\n  i love my daughter jenna more than life itself, and i swear on her soul i saw this craft,no mistaking it for anything else. \r\n  i was looking around the internet after this,and saw the videos from cnn's video of a craft in denver colorado,one of the pictures it showed loooked exactly like what i saw,only the craft i saw wasnt moving fast like thiers was,as i stated it just hovered.\r\n\r\n i know what i saw,but have no proof. i will never for get this\r\n\r\ntony marcin","distance":"101-500

which both my twin and i have witnessed. we went on a late walk around 8:30 and cut through sanderson high schools parking lot. as we were cutting through the fire alarm went off, and as we kept walking i anticipated the cops showing up. so we decided to go through the woods to avoid questioning, and we got back on the street .\r\n\r\nwe we're going up the sidewalk and we began to hear a loud motor sound, in which i immediately diagnosed as a helicopter. a few seconds later it was extremely loud so i said \"that doesnt sound like a weather helicopter\" and my twin agreed . we saw it flashing through the trees and it was flashing red so we waited for it to get over the treeline to see what it was . it happened so quick but basically as the helicopter came over the trees i spotted a white starlike object flying consistently in front of it . i yelled at my brother \"do you see that white light ?\" he said yes and we ran across the street as it went back over the trees and i could still see the helicopter flying behind this object . so not only did i get a side view, i got an angled view . i immediately called family and thought about posting on mufon, but then decided it would be tedious . i then realized if nobody ever reports these things, who knows man . i never though nc was a hotspot , but if someone could contact me i have some really good information .

the craft in the center of the picture.\r\nthis item is definitely rectangular in shape and it does not look like something that can fly let alone just hover in mid air. the reason i don���t think it is moving is that it appears to have a small cloud sitting in front of the end on the left.\r\nthe bottom portion, which appears to be about ��� of it is not she same color as the top section, it seems to be a very light tan or a shade of yellow. it looks to me like the bottom section is wrapped in a light cloud, ant that cloud going out to the left seems to be coming from the unit somehow.\r\nlooking carefully, the out line of the bottom is quit clear, as are the corners, and there seems to be a darker shade of tan just below the brown on what i have come to call the front, perhaps that is closer to the color of the lower section.\r\njust above the white it looks to me like there is a row of openings running the full length of the side. it may just be that i am seeing something i want to see. i am sure you people have the tools and expertise to determine that.\r\n\r\ndirectly below the cloud and towards the bottom of the picture you will notice a black dot. when that is enlarged several times you will notice it has a halo of white cloud around it in perfect proportions all around it again i am not sure that it is anything worth pointing out but i did anyhow. i would like if you could determine if it is just a speck of dirt or something to do with the main item.\r\ngoing down even further, and below the vein of coal, there is a very small, elongated item that is hardly noticeable and can only be seen when the photo is expanded several times, it almost looks like a small twig; however, when it is expanded several times there appears to be that same white substance running the full length on both sides, there are several very white lines extending out a an angle on both sides. they do not extend very far and they also cross each other in pairs at the ends. they almost look like beams of light, again only speculation.\r\nlooking to the far right at about the same level as the star of the picture there is what appears to be 2 sides of a rectangle about the same color as the top of the main craft. this is so faint that one has to enlarge the photo several times to see it, and even then you have to look carefully. above that there is a white item with a black halo round it in perfect proportions, just the exact opposite to the one below the craft.\r\nin the upper right corner you can see two l8ines that look like jet trails or meteorites falling. problem is they look like they are moving in opp0osite directions. i have enlarged them several time and i believe they are just breaks in the cloud, but it would be worth a professional checking them out.\r\njust below the ���jet trail��� on the right you will notice a very small black dot, i thought it was just a speck of dirt, but when i enlarged it several times it looks like a piece of metal. the upper right corner is at 90 degrees. the top and right sides are very straight the bottom seems to be cut in a certain way as to fit something, the left side looks like it was straight and formed a 90 degree corner at the top; however, the left corner and part of the side appears like it has been broken off something.\r\ni took this photo near drumheller alberta sometime in the summer of either 95 or 97, i cant remember which, it has been sitting in my junk photo drawer since the. i don���t know what all those white spots are and i am not going to speculate, but they are not on any of the other pictures on that roll of film. i don���t remember what i had for a camera at the time but you can be assured it wasn���t an expensive one. i did not take the picture because of the item in the sky, but rather, i was interested in that vein of coal you see running across the whole width of the picture.\r\ni am not very good at guessing distances but if it will help, i was probably 30 or 40 feet from that vein of coal. the crest of the hill is probably about 23 to 30 feet beyond that, and that weeds are probably about 3 feet high. i don���t know the width of ground that i captured but i am sure you have ways of determining. because i was not aware of this craft in the sky i had no reactions toward it.

to look left out of my drivers side window. when i looked i saw a huge ball of light enter the atmosphere, at first i thought it was a comet and proclaimed so, but then suddenly it imploaded and an aircraft was there instead. i freaked out and started yelling \"what is that?!\" this made my boyfriend want to look so we got out of my car fast and looked at it. it was at a low altitude and started to zig-zag higher and gain altitude. after it did this is flew very slowly in one direction, it had three lights on the outside of it, on one wing was a red light (i'm not sure if it was a wing but thats what i got from what i could see) in the middle it had a white light, and then on the opposite \"wing\" another red light. the lights would flash like this.. red, white, red......Red, white, red from left to right and disappear (like one of those arrows flashing outside of a business to try to get more customers.) the lights repeatedly did this. i'm not 100 percent positive, but from what i could see it looked triangular. we kept looking at it until it was out of sight. not even 5 minutes later i left my boyfriends house and headed home, i was about a mile away and seen the object still flying very slowly. i stopped to look at it again on the road (there was no traffic around) and i thought to myself as i was looking at it that i was going to tell people about what i had seen, right after i thought this the object made a sharp u-turn and headed right toward me. i panicked and started to drive away fastly, i couldn't keep my eyes on it because there was a lot of trees (i was on a winding, very curvy road.) i eventually arrived home and kept looking at the sky, making sure it didn't follow me, as far as i know it decided to leave me alone. when i told people about this they asked me if i took a picture of it and i didn't. the thought to take a picture didn't even cross my mind because i was awestruck.","distance":"101-500

in the day on monday. i worked several years on the night shift and going to bed at midnight was early since the norm was more like 4 am after work. my live in girlfriend was away visiting relatives so i was alone in the house.\r\n      i was relaxing watching tv up till midnight, and as planned, went upstairs to go to bed. i saw an unusual light from the window and approached to see what it was.   the light was extremely bright; however, it did not bother my eyes to look directly at it. the light had the colors of a welding arc but it did not flicker. it was coming from the thick woods about 75 feet or so from the house. it cast shadows of the larger trees throughout the back yard.\r\n       we lived way out in the woods at the edge of a pine reserve; there were no roads to our house, just kind of a path where we drove our cars from the end of the state gravel road. we lived about a quarter mile from the end of the road. with the exception of our yard, the woods around us were almost too thick to walk through. there was nothing beyond our house except the pine reserve.\r\n       i was standing there at the window trying to figure out what this was. i thought it might be scientist doing something out there, but if so, how did they get that heavy duty lighting equipment out there? i studied the light running different ideas through my mind about what this could be but nothing made sense. i estimate it was less than three minutes since i was at the window. i decided to put my pants on and go into the back yard to get a closer look.\r\n       before i could put any clothes on the whole room lit up with orange light coming through the windows like a flash of lightning. then immediately it was blue light doing the same from the other end of the house. in a second it all faded away to darkness. i looked through the window and everything was dark. we had no outside lighting so i decided to go to bed and check things out when the sun was up. i glanced at the alarm clock, it was 4 am. i was so disgusted with myself for staying up this late; i had plans before work tomorrow. so i went to bed to get rested for work monday night.\r\n          monday i got up and went through my normal routines with no memory of what happened. tuesday was the same. wednesday night at work something triggered my memory. i thought to myself \"oh yea! i was going to check out those woods\". thursday i got a camera and entered the woods.\r\n          i was shocked, after entering the woods about 50 feet it all opened up. the trees were bent over with their tops pointed at the ground. very few were down and i do not remember seeing any broken. i remember thinking to myself \"how could these trees bend so much without breaking?��� i started taking pictures, one was very interesting, a tree that was about waste high bent over with its tip pointed at the ground and staying that way. that little limber tree should have popped back up strait as soon as whatever force let it go. \r\n       the site was about 60 to 80 feet wide and circular. all of the tree tops were pointed down and towards the center of the site except one tree in the center witch was untouched. this confused me, if a force was pushing down how could the tree in the center remain upright? there was no path in or out of this site, whatever this was had to come from the air.\r\n      i looked for foreign debris or disturbed earth or tracks and found none. i am no photographer, but i tried to capture this scene in pictures, but the pictures did it no justice. later i bought a camcorder and went out there again; tragically i lost the tape since then. \r\n      after that i began thinking about this event trying to remember all i could. some things did not match up. for example i was looking out of the window at this light fully dressed, how could i then decide to put some pants on and go outside? i thought i was at the window less than three minutes around midnight then a minute later looked at the clock at 4 am. how could i not then know i lost 4 hours��� time? how did i forget about this event for days and then remember something happened?\r\n      i wanted some sort of an investigation, but who do i call? some days earlier the sheriff came to our house lost and i told him the way out. during our conversation he told me if i had any trouble out here not to bother calling 911 because there were only 9 deputies in our large county and they could not respond. so calling a sheriff was out of the question, we were on our own. i did make a report to a web site for ufos back then but i did not get any response and since then forgot witch web site it was. i took the pictures to work and showed a couple of close friends. they were amazed but had no clue of what i should do. so about ten years have passed now and i think about this now and then. i have only told a few people about it. the event does not disturb me; however, i am extremely curious about what did actually happen.\r\n","distance":"21-100

my video ready and as it flew over me i started filming it.\r\n\r\nnot until i uploaded the video to my pc did i notice the object flying at speed behind uae (united arab emirates) flight 39. there wasnt another plane visible in the area on flightradar so i am really not sure what on earth the other object is, a ufo?\r\n\r\ni will admit to being shocked when i watched the playback once it was on my pc...\r\n\r\nwhat surprised me is that due to the angle uae 39 passed overhead its speed of about 200 mph is reduced so the other object must be passing behind at great speed.\r\n\r\nvideo
