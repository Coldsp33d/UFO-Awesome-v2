cant remember the exact date but it was in 1993. we (my husband and i ); we werent married then. we were engaged. we had just laid down to go to sleep. it was around 11:00 pm- 12:00am. all of  a sudden a bright light appeared at the bedroom window by our bed. we both got up and looked out the window thru the blinds but saw nothing, no sound or anything. then the light went away. we laid back down after that. as i was laying there ; all of a sudden ;it was like i was paralyzed and couldnt move. it was like i was being held down by the legs;arms;head, & body. i was still awake when this was happening. all i could move was my eyes. i tried to scream to my husband but i couldnt do that. we had a night light on in the room so i could see clearly everything that was going on. i saw one walking to his side of the bed at that time. i was so  frightened at what was happening to me. i could see my husband; he could not move either. i was trying to look around the room. all i could move was my eyes. i saw 4-5 small in stature alien type  beings; light greyish in color with big dark eyes;small mouth/nose; big head ;long arms/fingers. .They were around 3-4 ft. tall. there was two to three at the end of the bed. i saw one walking to the side of my husbands bed; looking at him. then one came to my side and was looking at me ; tilting its head but not saying anything. it looked at the other ones at the end of bed and looked back at me. i was trying to scream but could not.I was watching it. then it touched my head & face. i dont remember anything else after that. there was a loss of over hours when we woke the next morning. i and my husband had unusually clear type secretions coming from our belly buttons for days after this encounter. at the same time my youngest son was 5 years . he had told me that next day that  a monster was looking at him in bed. we had all went to bed about the same time. so i dont know if they took him or not; but he had similiar secretions from his belly button for days.  he was scared when he told me. he wouldnt  sleep in his room after that for a while when he saw the monster as he called. we never told anyone til now. we didnt know who to tell or if anyone would believe us. but its the truth; so we are telling it now. thanks for letting me tell about our encounter. to this day i still see ufo objects near our property. at night ; we both hear things on our roof in the living room area . usually around 10:00 pm; up to times of 4:00 am. i have tried to capture what it is; thats jumping up on our roof.  its walking across the roof outside but have not captured photos of it yet. we have a add-on to our mobile home with metal roof/ no attic so we can hear it clearly. its like something walks across to where either one of us is sitting and stops. we have turned the tv off and listened to it ;but then it stops ; like it knows we are listening to it. i and my husband have run out to the front to see if we can see what it is. we can still hear it walking then it stops. but we cant see it. so i dont know what it is. but its there. its no animals; thats what we thought at first but its getting more frequent the last few months. i look at my husband when i hear it; and he says he hears it too. so what it is ; dont know. but it frightens me sometimes when i am in the living room by myself sometimes. i hear it jump on the roof and walks on the metal above ; like to where i am sitting on the couch. so what it is ;dont know. its not a animal ;know that because we have went outside before right when we heard it to see what it is; nothing there. it stops moving when we did that. as soon as we went back in ;it would run and sounded like it would jump back off roof. so something watches us. we wanted to know what is going on about what happened to us and why this is still happening. this is what is happening now and what happened to us previously.

i look at the man and he is paralyzed stiff. i wonder at his condition and am half turned to him and the object.  pointing i yell out do you see that? he makes nothing. nothing. glazed over, staring. i reach out and take his head in my hands and point his head right at the object. and he just about falls over going relaxed on me!\r\nthen he just looks right at me and says deadpan, yah, i see it. i've always seen it. at that moment i realize he has been literally scared stiff or completely terrified!\r\n and now as i look back from the reflections of brilliance in his eyes, the object/entity is in the trees next door and i now realize it is really big there. and it is beyond descriptions now. changing into a ring there in the trees above us. i get an overwhelming \"communication\" that says we are going now and they can't stop for me with the other guy there. i yelled out to him they're going and grabbed his arm, running up under this object that has now become a burning silver ring above us. the ring is hissing now. the only sound it's made is this hissing right now. i feel it more than hear it. it is now a brilliant deep orange ring above the trees. the center has become the deepest violet/black with red shocks streaming from top to bottom as the ring is standing on end in the trees not laying down flat. it is alive i feel. i'm not certain what it is, but it seems to be a life of some kind. and now it is going. it is gone. appears to be gone, over the horizon while still there  in the trees for some odd reason. the man says how far do you think it is? and i say a long way. and the there is a clap, a boom and it is good and really gone.\r\nthe man looked at me and just says, do you think we should report this?  \r\ni tried to report it, but that didn't go so well, so i just said to hell with it. tried to report it to davenport at reporting center, but that didn't go well. it was too complex to get over to him i guess. at least in the format they used then. i haven't reported since trying then.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":46599,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":47.01480243494954,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04052013-0003","longitude":-122.93153527986075,"occurred":1300242600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,   Cone,   Chevron,   Circle,   Cross,   Cylinder,   Diamond,   Disc,   Egg,   Fireball,   Flash,   Oval,   Sphere,   Star-like,   Teardrop,   Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1365152540000,"summary":" object appeared 3 blocks from me hovering above the road. while observing a driver approached  the rear, appeared hypnotized   ","tags":["entity"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"98501","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":751,"locationName":"Tumwater, Washington","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:5782"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"El Monte","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This was a strange event,i got a letter in the mail that i was to receive a free camera,all i had to do was show up at a specific address at a specific time and date. note: this was a long time ago back in the early 90's.The location was in el monte california,so me and my brother decided to go.Upon arriving at the exact location we noticed that the address where we were led to was a vacant lot. we thought okay this was obviously a hoax,but to what end?,we were also very hungry and decided to go to the burger king across the street,it was here where the event took place.My brother told me what he wanted and i stood in line,about four people in front of me then this guy walks in who to me looked like a bum,dirty,cut off gloves,long brownish coat.And he got behind me and i remember looking at my brother and over to the cashier girl who also noticed this man.I feared he was going to ask for money,i expected it.Instead he leans over and taps my shoulder and i turn to him and he asks me or rather questions me.He says \"you really don't know what time it is do you?,you don't know what 145 is?

area, we arrived at 7:30pm. we parked facing south-se to view the movie. at approximately 9:05-9:10pm my friend that was seated in the passenger seat of my truck had leaned fwd intently watching the movie when she said; \"what the heck is that?\" i leaned fwd to see. i saw what could've be mistaken as reflection of lights on the windshield moving left to right in other words east to west in a straight line at 45 degrees off the horizon moving fast. i saw a semi-circle of faintly lit square windows facing me, going around the object the windows were vertically arranged and horizontal to the ground like movie film wrapped around a cylinder so i couldn't see the windows on the other side. the reason i'm describing the windows so intently is because that was all i could see of the actual craft, the only reason i knew it was solid is that it blocked out the stars within the circle of windows as it passed, it matched the dark sky perfectly with no reflection, none. i then looked for heat signature as the stars reappeared there were none. when i saw this i knew it was way different than anything i'd ever seen, so i got out of my truck as fast as i could to watch and listen for noise. not a sound. nothing moves that fast without making some noise. i watched this craft fly out of sight following the faint line of windows heading west toward enterprise. i noticed during this encounter that nobody else had seen this, they were all still in there cars watching the movie, at least 200 people, incredible. it was impossible to judge altitude of the craft, my best guess was maybe 500-5000ft. the size matched a baseball in your outstretched hand at its closest to us. the shape, again best guess, was of the disk type with the ribbon of windows at its edge. now a little about myself. i've been an aviation enthusiast since i was a little boy, studied them, most all of them, built over 200 models when i was a boy, studied to be an a&p mechanic and worked as a civilian contractor for the military for 25yrs. i've seen almost everything that flies civilian and military up close and personal, i can pick out by silhouette alone 99% of everything man made that flies. my friend that was with me has been an a&p mechanic for 20yrs and has lived in this area her entire life and with ft. rucker close by can tell you by sound alone, which helicopter is flying by. i'm 47yrs old and my friend is 50yrs old, aviation has been our lives. what we saw that night was beyond anything both of us could comprehend or understand. the aircraft, or whatever it was, seemed to be pulled through the air, not pushed like it would be with engines of any known type. the only word either one of us could come up with was \"incredible.\" there is nothing man made, that i know of, that can do what i saw done that night. we do not have that kind of technology. \"incredible\" ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the time was approximately 10 pm.  \r\n     \r\nthis is the 3rd time i have seen this type of object.  i did not report the first 2 because i assumed people would think i was crazy, stupid or both.  the particulars of this sighting follow:\r\n     *)  the object is chevron shaped, v shaped, as far as i can tell. \r\n     *)  the object also appears to be transparent.  the only way i could really see it is as a result of                       its motion.  it had an appearance like the bottom of a glass jar while moving across the sky.   \r\n     *)  the object appeared to be traveling at a very high rate of speed.  there was a plane, flying roughly perpendicular, at a higher altitude which allowed me some kind of baseline for speed.  in relation to that plane, this object appeared to be traveling at least twice as fast across the sky.  \r\n     *)  the object appeared to be very large.  even though the distance between the object and i was significant and the object was hard to see due to its transparency.  i had the feeling that it was very large.  \r\n     *)  the object flew in a straight line.  \r\n     *)  i was very scared.  almost irrationally scared.  i remember purposefully thinking about not peeing my pants.  i still am perplexed by this reaction.  i am not a person prone to easy scares.  \r\n     *)  strangely, i do not seem to be aware of \"losing the object\".  it just seemed to either stop moving, causing me to stop seeing its motion, or it just disappeared.  i did not see it fly to the horizon. i tried to reacquire the object but i could see no other motion.   \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

flare, and ended with a luminous flare up before it dissipated. like a tiny sun. this was not a flare as the position was fixed, no movement at all except for the burst of light. having been in the military, i'm very familiar how flares react in the sky. it's been windy here and dusty to boot so the light/illumination was obscured by dust particles i imagine and therefore was yellowish to orange in color. this was not a moving object.\r\ni would classify this as an astronomical event and was very excited to witness whatever this event was, possibly a novae. as a stargazer since my teens, i've witnessed many strange lights in the sky but nothing ever like this. i don't believe i will ever witness anything like this in my life again and have searched the internet to find an appropriate institution to report this to but could only find mufon to be the most reliable source to do so. i am hoping that you can forward this to the proper entity as i feel there has to be some recording of

evening. we were returning to california from a business trip to sierra vista, arizona. after dinner in ajo we headed north.  we first observed 4 lights off to the west, they were stationary and we were familiar with the area and knew they were no on a mountain of structure.  they did gradually disappear and then reappear in the east, then disappear and re appear again in the west.  i was able to get closer to the lights when they reappeared in the west. i stopped the car and watched closely. i believed i observed smoke coming from one of the end lights.  i personally suspect that this is air force related and that what i was observing was an array of lights on an object; however i am an engineer and would expect the lights to be flashing, i would conclude that if this was for some military use that may not be the case.  i am think this may be related to the ���phoenix lights���, but i guess that is what makes the a ufo.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":46576,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.0540381,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04032013-0014","longitude":-111.0881011,"occurred":1158377400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1365034226000,"summary":"A

frightened and ran into the house and locked the door.  she then said that they came through the walls and got her.  at this point my mother told her to shut up; that people would think that she was
