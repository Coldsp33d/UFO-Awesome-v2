i received a call from my parents who were driving on their way home from work. they told me to come outside because the object they had witnessed flying a few weeks prior was back. i grabbed my camera phone and went outside in my front yard. as i got outside my parents arrived home and pointed out the object to me. it initially looked like normal plane or helicopter lights (red and white/yellowish). however i noticed the lights were not blinking and it was flying at a very low altitude and @ a high rate of speed with no sound emitted. the object was flying south, it then banked to the east, this is when the size of the object became apparent. at first i could only see the center portion of the object, but when it banked i could see the sides of it.  two massive rows of white lights were visible, one row coming of each side of the center of the object making a large v or boomerang shape. if i had to estimate the size of the object it was no smaller than one football field across. after the object changed flight to the east we lost sight of it. the whole sighting lasted only about 20 seconds, and as i stated earlier i thought it was an everyday craft at first so i had put my camera phone away, so unfortunately i didn't get a picture or video. i don't know what we saw that night but i am pretty sure it was not an ordinary commercial or private aircraft. my house is

in our sleeping bags on our backs looking straight out into the sky when a ufo comes directly over top of us...It was big round and had orgy-red lights underneath it slowly rotating above us...It was soundless it shot off so fast not a sound came from it n i asked my friend did u just see what i did n his voice was scared and replied yes. suddenly it returned but lower this time my first instincts were to get out of there, as i freaked out to get my sleeping bag open there was a static show. from the trampoline and sleeping bag n ufo caused a serious static show it was going off like fire works lighting up if you've ever seen static at night its bright so imagine a bunch going off at once..I then ran off the trampoline inside the house. we told my friends mom but she did not believe a word us young kids were saying which i think prevented us from coming fwd with this at the time and report it.. we kept it a secret and it seemed me and my friend kind of forgot about it then one day it came back to me i asked my friend what he remembers and his story was a little bit different almost like his brain was trying to forget it. it bugs me that i don't have the exact date on this siting but i no what i seen was ufo and this is no made up story. i was feet from the ufo and it was straight above us so therefore looking right at us. i think if we feel alseep that night we would have been abducted no doubts specially after reading all these reports on here. i also wish we never ran into the house but i think that's just how us kids seen it. what really strikes me is the static

ascended, about a foot a second, all the while roaring like a jet.  even though this seems counter to logic, i remember the thrust of the flames pointing skyward as it rose (seems so backwards then and now).It was intensely bright and lit up the surrounding woods.  in all, it probably rose no more than 20 feet above the treetops and then simply disappeared, the sound and all.  this all took no

normal speed i came around a turn i could see about a half a mile in front of me in full view many orange lights low in the sky just above the freeway. my first thought is that it was military and that it looked like an invasion or attack just because of the number of orange lights and how low there were. then i realized that this in no way could be military, there were no flashing red or blue lights that would distinguish one of our aircrafts. the orange lights seemed to be hovering or suspended in mid air but it seemed like they were all moving together at a slow crawling speed. what came to my mind then was the phoenix arizona lights in 1997. i had a feeling of fear and amazement i knew that what i was seeing was something amazing. it was so shocking and so incredible that all traffic on both sides of the freeway slowed down drastically (from about 70 mph to about 20 mph). i could tell everyone was looking at the lights trying to see what they were. i have never seen anything like this before and it's hard to explain exactly what i saw because there are no words to explain what exactly was in the sky. i would guess there was approximately 20 lights but possibly more. the lights took up a space of about 1/4 a mile long. at first i thought that each light was an individual aircraft, but the more i looked at the lights i realized that the lights all lined up perfectly and geometrically together, the angles each light were to one another was mathematically prefect, and they moved in unison together that it could mean that this possibly was one huge aircraft in the sky and not many small ones flying in a formation which is what i initially thought. it was flying too low for it to be any aircraft i have ever seen. if i could guess i would say the object/aircraft was about a building's length high in the sky maybe about 20 or 30 stories up from the ground. i have seen helicopters low but this was to big and moved too slow to be a helicopter. since this object/ aircraft was flying directly over the freeway, and the fact that traffic slowed down so much as we got closer to the object; i was able to look directly up at it from my windshield and i could not see any kind of shape or mass of an object/objects, all i saw was just orange lights suspended gracefully in the sky. so hypothetically if this was one huge craft it was possibly camouflaged with the nights sky. the only other aircraft lights i could see near by in the sky was lax traffic miles away in the horizon which is visible in azusa and the san gabriel valley. that is the only air traffic close by where planes would be flying low but azusa is too far from lax and the path the planes take to land at lax. i wish i would have taken a picture or video of these lights since it was so close to me and i was driving slow enough to capture it, but my phone camera was not working. so instead i called my boyfriend and was in hysterics telling him that i am seeing the most incredible thing in the sky but i can't tell what it was and i did my best in the moment explain to him what i was seeing. he was amazed and could tell i had just seen something not only amazing but indescribable. i have already found a video on youtube of another witness who saw what i saw, but they were a bit further from it. i have done research via the internet and have found that azusa is prone to ufo sightings. i have not contacted the city of azusa or the authorities about this event, but i might just to see if anyone else has reported the lights that i saw. i am a very open-minded but logical person, but this event is something i have never experienced before and it has really effected me. it has changed my perspective completely about ufo and ufo sightings, i don't think i could ever forget about it.

standing outside waiting on my husband to come out and looked up into the sky. at first i thought it might have been a military formation because the two objects were very close in tandem with each other, they were less than a thousand yards apart going across the sky. i thought it was kind of a little too tight a formation for even a military one, and i know commercial jets would not be flying in such a tight formation. as my husband joined me, i asked him to look at the two objects because i thought it kind of unusual. right about then the rear of the two objects broke off the chase and made a sharp left hand turn away from the other object heading west. as we passed through town heading back toward our house the object had a sharp reversal and was headed back east. i did not see if the object went back to his chase.
