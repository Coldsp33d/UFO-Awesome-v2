so many in fact i don't bother reporting them anymore. the only reason i'm reason i am in this instance is the incredible acceleration i witnessed tonight was a first.  \r\n\r\ngenerally, they just mozy by at more-or-less the same apparent size as commercial aircraft, but generally lower in altitude (20k-30k feet i would guess), somewhat slower (maybe 15%-20%) and absolutely no jet-engine sound associated with them regardless of relative distance. \r\n\r\nthey all look the same: three solid white lights at each of the three corners and a solid red strobe light at the center of the fuselage. with binoculars and enough backlight sometimes you can also make out the outlines of the vehicle ie., solid lines connecting all the vertices. the strobe illuminates the hull just enough to differentiate the shape as well.  \r\n\r\ntonight i noticed what looked like a dull-brown orb moving in the western sky - moving north-to-south - about 15 degrees off the horizon. i grabbed my binocs and took a look and sure enough it was a 3-pointed triangle. i watched it drift by for about 4-5 minutes with nothing too exciting happening, per usual - but as it got almost directly south of me (still watching in the binoculars), it literally shot almost straight up into the sky! it's appearance went from three distinguishable white lights, to a point of light, getting smaller-and-smaller as it ascended, to just gone, in under 5 seconds. \r\n\r\nit was less than 15 degrees off the horizon, having traveled considerably further away, and shot up in at least a 45 deg arc to maybe 25-30 degrees, and then simply vanished. it was easily the fastest thing i've ever seen in the sky, save for a shooting star.\r\n\r\nthere was no change in light intensity, or any flash or sound; just moving at a constant speed/direction then abruptly swooping up and gone in just a few seconds; 5 seconds is being generous in all reality - probably more like 3 seconds. \r\n\r\nunbelievable to see. it was obvious that it went out of the atmosphere and not below the horizon. it simply got smaller and smaller until it was no longer visible. it wasn't in the \"blink-of-an-eye\" fast, but nearly that fast. must be some crazy ride flying those things.

after a motorcyclist had an accident there. have been a few times before but never saw anything out of the ordinary. just to give you an idea for the area, it's on an island most of it is either native reserve or farm land and forest. the ghost road is in between a few farms. some trees line this street. usually we just park the car at one end of the road, walk to the end of it, then walk back. we were half way down walking the opposite direction of the car. my boyfriend (conveniently) was walking backwards talking to me. there is small forest off in the distance, i would say a km or 2 away. that's when i saw something shoot up out of the forest about 100 feet above the tree line. it was an ultraviolet colour and was in the shape of a diamond. as soon as i told my boyfriend to turn around, the best way i can describe it is it flattened or pancaked itself and disappeared. it made no sound and my boyfriend did not catch a glimpse of it. this all happened in a matter of seconds. when i first saw it shoot up out of the forest i thought it was a firework, but within a second of seeing it, my mind changed. when i saw it i almost fell to my knees. i really don't know what it was,

stars\" possible we were looking at perseid showers. we also were looking for satellites, a fairly new phenomenon at that time.   we noticed this bright light that suddenly appeared in nw part of the sky approx. 10 oclock with overhead being 12 oclock. we noticed it because it was much brighter than the surrounding stars/planets. it appeared to be hovering then zipped across the sky towards us then turned at what appeared to be a right angle at a very high rate of speed towards the west. it then stopped and hovered although it appeared to be decending. we were all discussing what this might be, the only thing we agreed on was we had never seen anything move like that. the object then started moving from west to north then seemed to spiral moving quite quickly and seemed like it was moving towards us. i remember being fascinated, then one of my friends said its coming down. i remember it sounded like he was terrified. no one else spoke, then the next thing i know the sun wakes me up around 0900 hrs. we all appeared to wake at the same time. normally we would be awake before first light. i woke up feeling like i had just got over the flu. i was very groggy normally i wake up instantly. i remembered the light and said hey you guys remember that light last night. that was weird, none of them would look at me. no one said anything they stopped and stared at the ground. i said no don't you remember that light we all saw it. they all denied that it happened and they all went home and it was never talked about again. my friends later would deny we ever even slept out
