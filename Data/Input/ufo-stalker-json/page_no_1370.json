age or in 1970 when he was 7 years of age.  he said his dad got him a 22 cal. rifle when he was about 3, and taught him to shoot and hunt.\r\n \r\nthe incident occurred in a desert area about 30 miles east of reno at about 10 am in the morning.  witness said he and his dad arrived at the location driving their volkswagen van.  the weather was described as a clear day with a blue sky and crisp, clean air.  witness said his dad stayed with the van to drink beer, as he always did, while witness would go hunting rabbits his 22 cal. rifle.  witness said a minute or so into the hunt, he shot a rabbit, retrieved it and continued to hunt. according to him, it was just a minute or two later that he saw another rabbit and started to take aim when something within his peripheral vision about 8 to 10 feet away off to his right side caught his eye.  he said he was startled and just turned his head slightly to the right and realized he was looking at a \"thing\" standing there, staring at him.  he described the \"thing\" as about his the same height as he was, which he estimated to be about 4 feet tall, very skinny with long arms, large head with large dark eyes, and was grayish in color.  he said he was immediately frightened but had kept his rifle pointed in the direction of the rabbit.  witness said he remembered keeping the \"thing\" within his peripheral vision and noticed that it started turning its head slightly to its right in the direction of the rabbit witness had intended to shoot.  however, the \"thing\" then turrned its head back looking at him and simultaneously began raising its right arm,held straight out.  witness said he became extremely frightened and thought the \"thing\" was about to do something to hurt him, so he swung his rifle in the direction of the \"thing\" and fired one shot into the upper right side of its chest and it fell to the ground.\r\n \r\nas quickly as it happened, witness said he dropped both his rifle and the rabbit he had shot earlier, and ran back to the parked van, crying and screaming for his dad.  he said as he got to the van, his dad, who may have been intoxicated from his beer drinking, began scolding him, wanting to know why he was crying and not hunting.  witness said he tried to explain to his dad that he had shot a\"thing\" and may have killed it.  his dad purportedly responded by telling him he was only supposed to shoot rabbits, not anything else, and began asking him what he had done with his rifle.  he said he told his dad what had happened as he continued to cry and pleaded with his dad to go back and see if they could help the \"thing\" he had shot.  however, he said his dad was adamant and \"drunk\",and ordered him to go back to get his rifle and the rabbit he had shot and to keep hunting.  witness said he did as he was told and went back, found his rifle and the rabbit he had shot earlier, but the \"thing\" was gone.  he said he looked around the area where it had been laying after he shot it to see if there was any blood but saw none.\r\n \r\nthe very next thing he remembers is that as he was standing there where he had shot the \"thing\"when he suddenly saw a craft hovering just above the ground an estimated 200 feet away.  he said he  could only  describe it as a cylinder or \"cigar\" shaped object, metallic looking and as long as a football field.\r\n \r\nthe next detail he remenbered was being in some type of a \"room\"with beams like frame work and what appeared to be a lot of dust.  he was frightened and crying, and the next he remembers is being in the back seat of the van, alone in the dark, crying for his dad who wasn't there.  he said he now believes \"they\" still had his dad.  the next that he remembers is he is with his dad in their van driving home in the dark.  he said he asked his dad why it was dark since they always left the hunting area in the afternoon so they could get home and  clean their rabbits before dark.  witness said he recalls his dad ignoring his questions and telling him he was going to clean the rabbits they had hunted that day when they got home even though it was dark.\r\n \r\nwitness said he is certain that he and his dad had both been abducted and somehow had been returned to their van.  he said that his dad never said anything to him about the event again and would never discuss that hunt again.\r\n \r\nhe said he never got over the  experience, has felt guilty all of his life for shooting what he now believes was an \"entity\" and has never forgiven himself.  witness said he has seen and felt the presence of something watching him ever since his experience and is now willing to undergo regressive hypnosis with the hope of finding out what did happen after he shot the \"entity\" and if there was some meaning to why it happened.\r\n \r\nwitness underwent medical examiniations by different doctors recently due to problems he began having with his throat and ears.  at least one of the doctors thought there was type of implant in one of his ears.  since he doesn't have health insurance, he couldn't pay for the procedure to remove it. \r\n \r\nwitness is convinced he has been taken many times, threreafter, and even believes he was in a craft which was just controlled by the placement of hands on the inside surface of the craft, there were no controls or anything tangible seen.\r\n \r\nabout the first week of november 2012, while on land north of his homr he said he saw creatures, and has visions and dreams constantly.\r\n \r\nwitness told me he has had a spot of gray hair which showed up right after his experience, and as a kid, people that saw him wanted to know how a boy his age could have gray hair.\r\n \r\nhe said there is much more he can tell us now and that he trusts me.

lights on either side of it. off to the side of those lights, and separated from them by about 20 feet,was a large bright green light. i drove directly under it and pulled into my driveway which was only about 500 feet past whatever it was. as soon as i pulled in my drive i got out of the car at the road. it was only 4 or 5 hundred feet in the air. it hovered about another 2 seconds and started moving southwest toward rittman. i watched it for about a minute then it just instantly started heading northwest. i watched it head in that direction for 2 more minutes or so before i lost sight of it. there was no sound at all. no blinking lights. i must admit i am a little freaked out by how close it was and not hearing anything at all. i thought for a moment many an rc helicopter because i fly them. that was until i saw it moving many miles away. also when it moved away the green light that was separated from the others was in the lead. they all stayed positioned to each other perfectly so i assume it was 1 thing not multiple. i wish it would of stayed there a little longer cause i was fumbling for my phone to get a pic or something. by the time i got it out it was already too far

so i decided to take a few photos. normally when i want to take a picture of something i snap off a bunch of photographs in a row. typically this gets me at least one of them that turns out really nice. i never heard or noticed anything during my picture taking. it wasn't until after i cropped and posted one of them on my facebook page in the morning on 3-29 that i noticed something that looked like a reflective glare above the sunrise. this prompted me to restore the sequence of photos that i took to see if this was apparent in all photos. at first going through the sequence nothing made itself apparent until i got aprox half way through them. i am attaching the last part of the sequence of photos that i took, 10 in all. which show this object or glare rising and changing position throughout the sequence. i am guessing that i took all of the last 13 pictures within a 30 sec time frame. i had no inclinations of anything odd at the time the pictures were taken. i am still not sure if these are just glare or not, but thought it worth someone taking a more educated look at.  since this site will only let me upload 10 pictures i am attaching the last 10 in the sequence. i would be happy to send the rest if requested, and i kept the whole sequence of 25 photos if wanted as well.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

unobstructed view of the sandia mountain range. i turned out the light and looked towards the mountains as i do every night and saw an object over the mountain range which is over 10,000 feet that had very bright red and green lights but the red lights were brilliant red and were actually beams of light in the shape of very long triangles. one at the top of the object pointing up and one at the bottom pointing down to the ground. both beams were 50-100 feet long and had very sharp points at the tip. the green lights must have been very small because i didn't notice them anymore. it moved back and forth over the mountain top then came down a little and started moving west over the houses in my direction so i immediately ran down the steps and out into the back yard which took about 15 seconds but it had disappeared. no sound, no planes, no helicopters. just silence. there is a tram north of this sighting but the object was farther south and looked nothing like the tram as it was moving around and flying over the mountain. there is also a restaurant and light towers up there but all were north of this sighting and they are stationary. i have seen lots of planes and helicopters in this area, even hot air balloons, but i have never seen anything with beams like that.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

it seemed to be approaching my location in suburban detroit. i immediately noticed a very unusual shaped object that seemed huge -- for a moment i thought a jet plane was crashing down toward me and i was alarmed to say the least. this was roughly triangular, with lights on 5 points of the vehicle. i kept watching, noting a white one that glowed in the (apparent) front, and on either side were two amber lights on each (apparent) wing. it seemed like a movie to see this monstrosity, then i realized it was not moving quickly at all and i glanced further out the window and saw a whole series of these light formations. some were triangular like the one overhead and others were small circular amber-colored smaller lights that flickered around the line of aerial curiosities. i was anchored to the floor it seemed, i couldn't take my eye off this remarkable sight...At the same time i was dumbstruck in awe at the string of these unprecedented airborne illuminated objects. i heard additional sounds that turned out to be real helicopters that suddenly swarmed overhead, i sensed these were \"our\" vehicles, reacting to the invaders. i was home alone, and turned on the tv to several cable channel news stations and no mention was made. the whole line of objects was so remarkable i couldn't believe that thousands of people must have heard this noise and/or seen these lights. i have never seen anything like this before and i've seen unexplained phenomena throughout my life. the next day i checked online and sure enough folks from the detroit/se michigan had phoned the tv and newspapers carried it too. i've not since heard the rumble nor seen any peculiar lights or airborne craft of inexplicable design configuration. this seemed to me to be as obvious as the sighting over phoenix awhile back, there was no effort to block visibility. if these loud bright objects represent the next-generation stealth aircraft, then we are in some deep fertilizer, friends. this was as stealthy as a roman candle display on the 4th of july!!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path

second time i have seen this type of object.. the last sighting was a couple weeks earlier and the object moved horizontally during that event). the object was very bright so drew my attention to it immediately (as did the previous event). i had my son come out and look. he brought binoculars and we both viewed it with them. i could hear no noise like aircraft or helicopter. we watched for about 3-4 minutes as it got higher in the sky, it looked as if it may be getting closer to us and we hoped for a better view to try to determine what it could be but it was lost in the cloud cover. my reaction was calm as i have seen closer objects in the past.. curious as to what it may be as this is the second time i have seen it. during this event it seemed to move slower than the first event but that could be the difference in travel direction (first one was horizontal this one vertical). would really like to know what it is i
