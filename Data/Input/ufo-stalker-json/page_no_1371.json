(i am  terrible at directions, new to the dallas area, and i was slightly rattled.)  i told her that i was traveling west on greenbriar heading towards kessler parkway--that i was now passing threw the intersection of kessler parkway and sylvan, just south of i-30, going to my friend's condo.  i told her, \"i am not nuts.  i am a school teacher.\"\r\n     i was overwhelmed and a little shook when i arrived at my friend's condo, and a little scared.  i wanted to know where it landed because the area where it descended appeared to be a neighborhood.  there was no place for something that large to land.  i met my friend at the gate of his condo where he approached my window to ask me a question, and i told him that i had just called the police to report that i had just seen a ufo aircraft.   \r\n     what i saw was not bouncing white lights, nor was it a white, oval shaped object jetting around from one place to another in the sky.  what i saw was an aircraft of some kind.  it appeared quite large.  there was a plane in the southwestern sky in the distance with a red light.  judging from the plane in the distance and the trees the aircraft hovered between, the aircraft seemed quite large.  i have no idea how large.  \r\n     it is very difficult to process something like this when something like this happens.  again, i was overwhelmed and scared when i arrived at my friend's condo:  i did not want to be left alone outside while i unloaded my car at my friend's condo.  i kept looking through the trees in the direction of steven's golf course waiting for the aircraft to ascend.  \r\n     (i told several teacher friends the next morning when i arrived on campus.  i don't care what they think:  i know what i saw.  whatever it was i have never seen anything like it.  i have never seen an aircraft descend straight down like that.)    \r\n     my friend and i drove back to my apartment so i could show him where i saw it.  we drove around in the area where i thought it went down, but there are homes there, and no place for such a thing to land.  i asked my friend if it could have landed at stevens golf course, but he said the area i was pointing to was west of stevens.  i went home to my friend's condo, and i kept asking him what i should do.  i wanted to call my brother-in-law who is an air traffic controller at michum airport, but it was too late.  i wanted to call someone at bell helicopter, or uta, or the news, or call the police back.  i watched the 9:00 news and the 10:00 o'clock news hoping someone had called in and reported seeing what i had seen.  mostly, i just wanted to know if anyone saw what i saw around 8:30 pm on april 1st, 2013.    \r\n     please let me know if someone else reported seeing something that resembles what i am reporting.","distance":"501 Feet -

dining room that faces east. the evening of october 27, 2011 had clear skies and it was almost dark at 8:20 pm. while i was walking by the picture window, i noticed something going on and off so i decided to look. it was a red, round light that suddenly was gone and 3 seconds or so reappears further away, then the light was gone again, followed by reappearing, but closer, it was the size of a basketball and was hanging in the ne skies, seemingly quite close. this happened about 4 four times or so; lights off, reappears in different location. \r\ni could not figure out what this could possibly be. because i have never seen anything like this (i have seen many airplanes and helicopters in the skies), i called my husband to check on this red light. while he was taking his time coming from the family room, i noticed at least 9 helicopters, flashing their lights (red, green, white, blue) following state route 105 that runs parallel to the portage river, about 1/2 mile from my house. some were above the tree tops, some were not. this was strange to see that many helicopters going the same direction sw to se and 2 or so from south to north, and so close to each other. \r\ni immediately thought that there is an emergency situation at the brush wellman, a company that is located about 1.5 miles se of my home and that has big us governmental nasa/defense contracts, or the davis bessie nuclear power plant, located about 15 miles ne from my home. i opened up the door next to the window that leads into the backyard, and at that point i seen the large red light go way up, not in a straight line, but more in a curve. then all the \"helicopters\" suddenly were white in color and followed the red light, they all went up in a curve, and were several miles up in the clear night sky. the former red light remained the largest and ended up in the center, surrounded by at least 2 dozen smaller globes. i then realized these were not helicopters! i watched for a few seconds and the orbs seem to become one large bright circle touching the big one that remained in the center. but then it seems as if they were playing, i.E. some were going in and out the circle, making erratic maneuvers. what a sight to see.\r\nmy husband and 13 year old granddaughter joined me and they thought it was great to see this display of white lights high up in the sky. i on the other hand, got suddenly scared and went into the house, and tried to talk them to come back in the house as well which they did not do. they stood outside for the longest time, while i was inside, feeling scared. after about 20 minutes or so, my husband and granddaughter came in, not because the orbs were gone, but it was too cold to be outside that long. we still talk about it quite a bit - i now have my regular watch behind the picture window every evening. my granddaughter and i are convinced that these were beings from other places in our cosmos. my husband already knew about ufos, he seen a ufo from close up when working outside in the railroad yard one evening in 1996, right above the tree tops, going over him, \"as big as a football field\".  \r\ni wonder if this event occurred because the day before my neighbors home was raided by many police, fbi & such, because of growing an illegal substance in the basement. there were about 15 cop cars, maybe more, parked in front of their house and driveway most of the day, with a lot of commotion. this event and activities are highly unusual in my neighborhood where it usually is quite. i wonder if the police radios caught the attention of aliens and they decided to check it out ...","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line

sounded a lot like what i saw, this happened over 28 years ago, and at the time when i mentioned it to anyone they thought i was crazy so i never mentioned it again, ive told my husband and kid the story and got the same reaction, last night i told them thats the same thing i saw. this is my story.....I was with some friends coming back from visiting another friend at in greenville pa. nothing special she just started college there and we went to see her and we were coming back route 18 then when we got on route 322 just out side of conneaut lake about 3:00am, i was in the back seat, just staring out the window when i notice lights, it looked like a big check mark, i looked at the speedometer to make sure my friend wasn't speeding thinking it was a police helicopter, but it didn't look like a helicopter, i now hear it described as boomerang, thats the best i can call it, i asked my friends if they where seeing it and they said, yes what is it, i tried to make out an exact shape but it was just to dark, it seemed to be tracking us off to our left just above the trees, all the way from conneaut lake heading east when we got almost to route 19 it shot straight ahead really fast then stopped and hovered over the mall we slowed down to see if  we could see the shape better, we still couldn't tell, as we got almost to the mall it shot really fast across in front of us and stopped and hovered over a church, ,there is a stop light in front of the mall and it was red we stopped and just watch this thing, no more than 50yards away, and i'm not sure if it landed or what, but all of a sudden there was a swarm of thousands of bright blinking lights, i'd never seen anything like it in my life and i wanted my friends to pull over so we could watch it for awhile to see what it was, but they said no way and just kept driving, i turned around in the seat and watched it as long as i could see it, i was so excited, i think we just saw a ufo, i told my friends. i told other people about it thinking they would think it pretty cool but all i got was laughed at and teased so i never mentioned it again, to this day i can't even remember the friends i was with,but i remember the thing i saw and it was just like what that lady in bucks county saw, a swarm of thousands of bright blinking lights, it was over 28 years ago i'm 48 years old now and the time and date may be off a bit and i've never seen anything like it sense, but i did see it, and i keep watching thinking maybe i'll see it again someday. i'm reluctant now to even mention what i saw, because of the reaction a got then and even now, so please do not mention my name, but i thought you should know that the swarm of bright blinking lights, it happened back in the 80's too.","distance":"21-100

flashing lights slowly hovering over homes here in copperas cove, tx. at first i thought it was a plane, but ive lived here since june 2010 and the planes that ive seen never fly so low, are loud, and never this shape with all those lights flashing in a circular direction. then i thought it was a helicopter, even though i know helicopters arent circular shaped however the propellers do go in a circular motion, i convinced myself that it could be that, so i listened for the sound and everything was silent. it was so weird. definitely wasnt a helicopter. so i called my husband to come quick because i wanted him to explain what i was seeing. at this point the object had moved west but my husband was able to observe it before our view would be obstructed by distant homes. after a few seconds of silence, my husband said, \"i think that was a ufo.\" my thought exactly but i didnt say it because i didnt want to sound dumb and/or influence his thoughts. my husband is in the military and assured himself as well as me, that it wasnt flares. he seemed confused. he also noticed that i was feeling nervous and that i kept going back to look out the window so he then said, \"maybe it was a uav\". so i started to second guess myself. i got on the internet researched uavs and let me tell you, i am more convinced now that we saw a ufo. uavs are a significantly smaller, do not have all the lights i saw, and not circular (disc) shaped. after reading into uavs, i googled ufo sightings in copperas cove, tx and one other person commented about it, but just said it was scary, and didnt give much information. i would like to know that we arent the only ones that saw this. hoping other people come forward. should have recorded

there was no other traffic out (not unusual)so when we saw this dark object hovering over the vacant land in front to the right of us, we asked each other to identify it and my husband turned on the road to the right (which is where we intended to go anyway) and very slowly drove up to the side of the vacant lot. we watched it through the front windshield until we were passing next to it and watched it through the side driver window all the while noting that there was no sound or lights.  it was a blackish gray metal looking disk that had some texture or attached coverings like ridges.  it seem like the grass moved slightly, but it was not more than maybe a good evening breeze would have done.  at the time, we were alarmed, but more curious than scared.  i was excited and wanted to find out what it was or if anyone else had seen it.  after it started moving straight up it then veered slightly to the east continuing upward and it must have started moving very fast because it went out of sight rather quickly once it go so high.  to estimate the size of the craft, the land it was hovering over was a vacant commercial lot, so in perspective, it was easy to estimate it had to be about 100 feet in diameter (at least).  it was actually so dull and dark it was like looking at a metal aircraft with gray black primer paint which caused detail on it hard to see but easy to see the shape contrast against the sky.  it didn't appear to have any lights on or in it.\r\n\r\nwe were only a few hundred feet from the grocery parking lot and went in and parked.  my husband stayed in the car and i hurried inside and just stood looking quickly around to see if anyone looked like they had seen it too.  no one (but me) seemed to be acting unusual so we hurried home to wait for the 10pm news to see if any reports would be on. there was nothing in the media at all and we didn't know who to report it too without being called crazy, so we didn't talk about it at all. we live a few miles away from a navy base and the airfield is very active, but since my husband was a navy flight engineer on an aircraft carrier, i think we would have had some idea what aircraft it could have been.  we

itsself,boom there they were at my 12 oclock low i estimate it at about 1000 feet maximum height from the ground.Three bright lights stationary dead ahead.Its dark and you have trees on both sides of the freeway.The lights were between the trees dead ahead.At first i thought it was planes coming in for a landing at tacoma narrows munincple airport,but as the freeway keeps winding every mile or so,the trees would block out the object[s]until and at the same time reveal other parts of the sky.When i saw the objects stationary again same intensity of light,[very very bright],you could see off to the right of them,there was a small plane with the red and green lights on each wingtip.Also you can see the commercial and or military planes to the left on thier regulur paths to seatac and mccord afb.I dont think they saw it but im 1000% sure the small aircraft did cuz he was very close to the objects.I lost sight of them on the next curve that was blocked by the trees ,also i was speeding towards the direction and i wasnt the only one ,someone in a soccer mom van flew right past me i was doing about 75 they musta been doing 90+ trying to see them again i assume.When it cleared up from the trees of course they were gone but the small plane was doing circles above the farmland down below.My feelings are that theyre here.Im mean they are here!This is actually my 4th or 5th sighting ,my second best.It was dark but they were low,stationary,and brightly lit,if it was 1 solid object ,i bs you not it had 2 have been a mile maybe in length.Triangle formation of lights i never seen before.Ima tell you about the other sightings i had .And fortunatly i had witnesses to my best sighting.Mccord afb,summer 2012,a stationary oroange {fireball} i guess best describes it,hard to describe something you dont know,anyways after a couple minutes,it shot out straight to the ground on the military base another but even smaller {fireball] and when it did that ,we rushed the car to get down to mccord afb to see ,but it was gone when we got there.My [family member] was shocked when i called her out because i saw another one about 2 weeks prior to that so ive been skywatching ever since then.I would like to believe theyre ours but the sighting i had prior to the afb one,i was smoking outside no not dope either i saw what looked like 2 satellites side by side ,i thought nothing of it at first but i never seen satelites side by side like that so i kept watching.I still think one was a satelite but the one on the left came to a dead stop,moved to the left,went back to its original stop point,moved to the right about equal distance,went back to its stop point,then it just went bright as hell ,then it appeared as if it went higher into space,or disappeared right there,i think it went up though because you could still see the brightness of the light deminishing.Man i wish i had a good camera. i would like to apolagize to all the people who been called crazy,i used to be the one calling everyone nutcases and for that,my story is being shared.At the time of my first sighting,i kept seeing [doyon government constuction trucks] all over,so i did some research and found out they specialize in underground facilities ,and they have 3 major outfits based outta alaska state.Im not an investigator of anykind.Just the thought of oanother race of beings staring down at us like earth is some kind of ant farm to them is scary thought.Ima just say it ,when you combine abductions,the cover up by our goverment,implants,makes me wonder are some of us being sacraficed,obviously you cant beat a force thats greatly more advanced than us,its probably best we play along until we aquire,something that can put us on a equal playing field.I dont think et is gonna go for that.Why do i think this is because you can find more abundant resources on any planet,except humans .I know its lot to absorb but ive been holding it in 4 awhile.Thanks for reading.Btw look op during these summer clear nights especially in june july thats when i had my best sightings.","distance":"Over One

relatively sunny wednesday afternoon. i had then walked up to my house and was just about to grab the door knob when a sudden almost electric feeling shot through my body and i just got a feeling that said \"look up now.\" surely enough as i slowly looked up over the house i heard a sudden \"wooshing noise coming towards my direction and after a second or so the object suddenly appeared over the house and stopped there at almost what seemed like lightning speed. spooked i moved back towards the sidewalk to get a better view of it. it was a huge object an oval and three circle lights in a triangle shape underneath like bright headlights and a domed cylindrical top part that was slightly away over the house and i didn't have a great perception but it had to have been the size of at least three cars i'll assume. it moved slowly towards the west direction from my house until i thought \"hey maybe they're friendly!\" and waved at it and shouted \"hey!\" it then suddenly stopped and shined a beam of light on me. it then started to move closer to me still slightly high in the air. ironically, i just so happened to have a colorless and colored camera with me for a project i was doing with taking pictures and used the camera to try to take some pictures of the object as it moved slowly towards me. however, common sense kicked in and i became frightened because the light was now shining down on me and i thought \" hey i might get abducted\" and tried to move away from the light although it followed me and then i thought \"hey if i make my camera look like a gun maybe it will move away?\" i did and after a second or two it stopped shining the light and moved away towards the east. as it did and moved toward the tree i quickly entered the house and alerted my mother inside that there was a ufo over the house! she didn't come out but i then took my camera out as it was a little higher now and eastward and was able to take two pictures of the object. the first one didn't come out right and the second picture is kind of blurry and i'm not sure if it was my finger print or not but after that it went behind the large tree outside my house and when i went to look it was gone.\r\n\r\na couple weeks later as i was watching video's online home alone around 7:00 at nighti suddenly heard a helicopter over the house and it got louder and louder and closer to the roof until it was literally shuttering the roofs rafters it was so close. i then ran into my room afraid that it might be some group searching for me like men in black or something and stayed in my room for about 5-10 minutes until it finally went away and about a couple hours later my family came home.","distance":"21-100

object and its actions and motions in detail.\r\nwhen the bird entered the room, through the window, a vortex opened in the middle of the ceiling. out of the vortex was a huge massive shadow of a winged structure. the wings spread across the bedroom ceiling. as the wings were flapping, tons of grey dust-like triangular flakes started to fall. as the dust flakes started to land on me, they turned very pretty platinum white flakes but they disappeared. i was screaming and the entity was holding me down and had my arms and hands pinned down spread across the bed. i told the entity that i am so scared that i am having a heart attack and my chest was solidly tight. but the entity said nothing but started this heavy wind gust down on me, as if it was trying to rid me of negativity and fear. i also told the entity that i have sinned and that i have problems with family and relationships. the entity took my advice and spread my legs and entered me with an appendage and pressing on my chest and pressing my babys head. as the entity was pressing on my chest with doctor like hands, all  i could see was the cherib-like angel (that was sitting on the left wing of the angel taking notes with an ancient stylus pen and ancient tablet. at the same time, many cheribs were attached to each of the wings and they were all talking to each other about me and problems of the world. at this point, i was relaxed and stated i saw that pen in a history book and the paper tablet looks like papapyrus cloth. when i said that, the head on the entity turned from the monk like hood to a lions switching and shaking the head as if it was battling an evil entity that came out of me. i started to stare with the impression of why these two entities are fighting over me. as i was staring also it elevated me in the air and pulled me into a pasture were there were thousands of sheep and beyond the horizon, i saw a man with his back turned staring onto the horizon sunset with the sheep and i in back of him. as i was walking through the herds of sheep there was a disfigured sheep that looked as if it suffered radiation because it had many eyes and the head was larger than the rest of the herd.As i looked at one of the eyes, it had my reflection in it, as if it had been watching me for many years.\r\nthen i floated back in my body and the entity stated \"fear not, danger ahead\". it was staring at me,for 5-10 minutes after the statement and then folded the vortex like a thin flat inch 70inch flat screen tv and the huge bird like human monk-like animal spirit shrunk like a robin bird and flew out the window. i was yelling please take me i don't want to be here anymore. the little bird flew out the window without acknowledging what i said.","distance":"20 Feet or
