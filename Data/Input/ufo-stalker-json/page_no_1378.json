began to look and saw star like light in the sky, there were about three all dancing around each other flying up and across the sky. they would change direction instantly and then speed up and shoot across the sky. they were all over the sky almost like a swarm of locus but lights. they would shoot off up into space and then we would see more. if you looked at the horizon west, there were many of these lights which would then rise into the sky dance around and shoot up into space. the night was a full moon, the clouds were so thick and pink, that if they crossed under the moon it would block the moon out completely. the clouds also seemed like they were hiding these crafts. the ufos would come out of these clouds and go back in. it seemed like they almost had the ability to control the clouds, splitting them and then making them come back together. a group of these ufos would also come together and then the light would disappear but you could still see an invisible, cloak like look which was in a triangle type shape which would distort the sky and it would then take off. we were so amazed by this we started to call everyone we knew to look. every person saw the same thing we did! they were amazed. the whole thing lasted like 3 hours. we decided to drive closer around 12:15 to the everglades to see if we could get a better look. when we arrived, my fiance pointed out which looked like a plane and said \"there it is look\". it was traveling from east to west, maybe about 1mi up. i thought it was a plane but she told me to keep watching it. it was going pretty fast, then all of the sudden it stopped in mid air. it had a red/orange glow. it hovered almost right above us for about 15 seconds when it took off straight up into space! the most amazing thing i have ever seen in my life. we have at least 5 other people in different locations throughout  the city who saw the same thing.\r\ni tried to take pictures and video with my iphone and nikon, but the clouds and lights were too thick and the light was too dim for the camera to pick it up. i hope someone else got it.","distance":"Over One

looked out the window of her car. i first noticed these lights and thought it was just the big dipper. as i kept looking i realized they were too big of lights to be that. i kept my eye on them and pulled over in a place clear from trees it was at that time i realized there was about 8-12 big orbs in a single line equally distant. my girlfriend and i were shocked seeing these mysterious lights i took out my phone and attempted to record the phenomenon but the orbs wouldn't appear on my screen. so i pressed the home button and looked back up and almost all of them suddenly disappeared. for another 3 minutes i watched the last of them dissolve into the sky. i noticed after the first group of them dissapeared there was a plane there. it was very strange but also very cool i contemplated with my girlfriend saying maybe the government is testing new ships but it seemed to be bizzare for them to have that many in a line equally distant. also we considered the meteor shower that happened this week but we ruled that out pretty quick considering the objects were moving up. this sighting opened me up to the thought what else is here on earth with

believe it was wintertime, but not positive. as i turned right (north) onto spaulding road near kettering, oh, i noticed a formation of 5 to 7 white lights off to my 10 o'clock position. the lights puzzled me, as they were in a chevron looking formation, and not moving. at first i thought i may be seeing reflections from behind my car, but noticing nothing behind me, i rolled down my driver's window and the lights were still there in the distance, and just hovering. at the time of my sighting, the road on which i traveled was in a bare state-run farm field. my view was unobstructed for about a mile. i slowed down to about 15 mph and continued to view the lights for about 3 minutes until my view was obstructed by trees and residencial development. the lights were about 40-45 degrees elevation from ground level and appeared to be more than a mile from me. the overall size was enormous, but i couldn't determine the distance from me as it was dark outside. they appeared to be at least a mile away and possibly 2 miles. i never reported the sighting figuring that it had to have been seen my hundreds, and i therefore didn't need to report it. i wish now that i reported it then, as my recollection as to the date it happened and exact number of lights fail me. i have included two maps to show you where i was at the time, and the direction in which i saw the lights. upon seeing the phoenix lights of 1997 on a tv program, i could swear that i was viewing exactly what i saw in the dayton area, in relative size, elevation, and approximate distance. i have enclosed 2 maps showing the location and destination where the sighting occurred. i would like to know if this occurance was reported, and if so, what it was that i saw. i am an air force veteran, and at the time of the sighting, i knew of nothing that the military had in its inventory that would have explained what i saw.

(my left.) the other ship was closer and near the southern end of my sea view. (my right.) i assumed it was moving southward, and that the two ships had already passed in the night. i focused my attention on the left ship, which had more lights than the ship on the right. it gradually moved, northward, taking about 30 sec to its move behind the trees, its lights twinkling thru them for a bit. this was a familiar sight, having watched many cruise ships pass at night during the preceding 5 months. i shifted my attention to the ship on the right, and noted that it was indeed moving very slowly southward, already partially obscured by the bamboo stand that marks the rightmost limit of the sea panorama.\r\ni had been observing for about two minutes by this time. \r\nas i gazed directly at the remaining ship, i thought of the days��� events, associated memories, etc, and the beauty of the cruise ships.\r\nwithout warning, no noise or other change in the environment, i observed the ship suddenly slide out of site just behind the bamboo stand, stopping with its lights twinkling thru the bamboo. this took about ��� of a second. i snapped to intent alertness, and moved to another window in hope to regain a clear view or the object. no luck. twinkling thru the bamboo,the object resumed its cruise-ship-like slow, even progress to the south. during the next 20 seconds, i performed several internal and external process checks to determine that i was awake, alert, sane, and that my time sense and physical body were intact and normally operating. i expected to find dizziness, fatigue or dream like feelings, instead, i remained a high-functioning observer. my heart rate increased as i began to collect and record environmental data. i had a distinct impression that the object had dodged behind the bushes to hide from me. also wanted to hop in the car and chase it, but i did not. \r\n\r\nfor the rest of the evening i frequently looked in that direction, and had a difficult time accepting the mystery. the next day i immediately was drawn to gaze at that spot upon awakening.\r\n\r\nfinding this an amazing and durable memory, i mentioned it to a friend that day, thus eliciting a separate sighting of a similar object from him. report of his sighting follows.\r\n\r\nnote- mufon report forms do not handle sea based sightings very well, and do not include speed changes without course change.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":46394,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":19.9061662,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03242013-0023","longitude":-155.5799818,"occurred":1363314780000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Hawaii","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1364193851000,"summary":"Anomalous speed changes of object resembling a cruise ship's lights apparently on sea or between observer and sea at night","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"HST","timeZoneName":"HST","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/46394_submitter_file1__slippershipsketch.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"96710","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":10,"locationName":"Umauma, Hawaii","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:6729"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Dublin","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Left work shortly after 2pm sunday, 3/24 going home to granbury,tx. from stephenville. i take the back roads instead of hiway 377, the commonly used route because of heavy traffic on 377, for safety reasons. i was on cr305 close to the erath/hood county line. a very rural area and sparsely populated. almost no traffic. about 1420hrs a very bright silver light to the south caught my eye. it appeared round but was so bright it was hard to tell. i appeared to be about a mile away, at 5000' above ground, stationary. i stopped my car and watched it for about one minute then it shot away almost directly away from me to the south so i lost sight in less than a second. i have been a licensed pilot for 45 years and this was no known aircraft. this was a sunny clear day so the  brightmess was really remarkable. i do not believe it was a reflection, again because of the level of brightness so that the light appeared to be eminating fron the object. i was very interested and curious, i was not frightened. \r\n/","distance":"501 Feet -

full of cars and up ahead we noticed what appeared to be a balloon floating over the highway.  it was solid black and didn't have a single light on it and there was a plane in the air behind it, which made it stand out even more to me.  we watched it slowly decend and hover right above a car in the left hand lane, farther up the highway, we completely expected it to get blown back up in the air by the wind of the passing cars, but it didn't.  it didn't flutter or spin or anything like a balloon, it just hovered and appeared to be motionless.  we then observed it move above the adjacent car on the right and proceed to rise and ascend back into the air in straight line, nothing like a balloon in the wind.   it didn't register to us what we were looking at untill we drove right underneath it and had a chance to observe it from about 15ft away.  it wasn't any type of balloon i have ever seen and it wasn't made of a material that i recognized.  maybe it could have been a dark plastic or dark metal, but i couldn't tell.  i experienced a brief moment of second guessing myself untill my girlfriend with a very frightened look in her eye yelled \"what was that?!\"     we then both realised we just witnessed something very very strange. \r\n\r\nthis whole experience happened within a few minutes and it has left us confused and concerned.  mostly because it was a distraction and came dangerously close to cars traveling over 60 mph.  if this was a type of drone it was being operated in very dangerous manner and if it's something else, well i don't know what to say.
