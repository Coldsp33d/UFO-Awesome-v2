(if you google tri-bead you will see what i am speaking of). i was surprised to even see a hole, or light in the middle of the ufo, just like the hole in the middle of a tri-bead. i only saw the ufo for a few seconds. maybe it had been there longer and i caught the end of the sighting. maybe it knew i was looking for something and appeared for me just long enough for me to be in awe. this was over the lake, just touching cloud cover. the tri-bead shaped ufo seemed to be on a slant. like if you took a tri bead and turned it so you could see the bead from the side view rather than above. then slightly turned it so that you could see the side of the tri-bead but also view some of the top of the bead as well. it moved at a 135 degree angle in the sky. it was an odd movement, like it was floating but moving fast, but not too fast. the movement reminded me of a balloon taken in the wind. like a gust of wind taking a balloon, but balloons float. so a floating movement if that makes sense. the ufo then disappeared right before going behind a cloud. this confused me at first because i swear i saw it fade very fast right before going behind the cloud. then i questioned myself, \"maybe it disappeared behind the cloud?\". soon enough i realized it had not. it was a very misty cloud, translucent. if the dark object had moved behind it i would have definitely seen the silhouette. i also would have seen the object come out of the other side of the cloud. the cloud was probably only the height of two of the ufos at most, and it would not have taken long at all for the object to reappear out the top of the cloud (after entering the bottom). after viewing a boeing type plane near the same distance away before the sighting, i have to say the ufo was at least the size of two boeing planes, maybe 2 1/2 or 3 even. it was large enough that i was able to tell the color, size and fact that it was not of this world in just the short time i witnessed the event.I tried to find a pic of the perfect tri-bead to show how it was black, yet reflective and also at the same angle the ufo was in the sky. i also added a drawing, not so good, but i tried.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet -

checking out the sky whenever we are outside or driving in the car. the blinking lights caught his eye. its pretty common to see ufo's at this time of night, if you're looking for them (we do) he watched it for a few seconds, then he said it shot out something that looked like a bright white light. which ended up being another ufo, it dropped a little then flew off towards the east. that's when he came in and got me. i went out with my phone to get pictures. but decided on a video instead.\r\nwhen i first saw the ufo it was east flying towards the south southwest. i immediately noticed the lights blinking, it seemed pretty far away so it looked almost like a disco ball of lights white, green and red. once it ascended over me i zoomed in on the video and you could clearly see the triangular shape, the 3 flashing white lights on the corners and front center and the blinking red light underneath, the backside has a row of white blinking lights as well.  at that point i only noticed the white and red lights. \r\nit seemed to be going the same speed from the time i started recording till i stopped recording. it flew in a straight path and was completely silent! \r\n my family and i had an awesome sighting in the past year or so and worked with joe palermo @ mufon. he said for future sightings try getting a video, so that's what i did.\r\nthe video is a little shaky

each end.  assumed it to be a plane but the motion was extremely slow.  no visible wings, no contrail, no sound, no rotors.  no discernible markings anywhere.  no running lights.  no blinking lights.  though perhaps it was an old huey helicopter with the rotors at each end, but the shape wasn't quite  right and there was no evidence rotors were at work.  object probably lit by rising sun, highly reflective.  moved as slow as a helicopter but no ground thumping roar.  we have military helicopters flying around here frequently and their noise footprint is always loud and rumbling, unmistakable.  object moved slowly to the east as i observed it first in clear sky, then moving behind trees, they clearly visible.  it turned north heading just east of medina city and accelerated at a rapid pace, during which the shape changed to a flat \"u\" shape.  i watched as it went out of sight over roof tops.  at no time were any wings visible.  it seemed to have a tail but nothing like i have seen before, rather organic in appearance rather than the angular shape of a plane's stabilizer.  the view through binoculars was very clear.  no thought to video it for some reason.

us. he was working his car replacing his breaks. we were chatting for a while. he finished putting his breaks on the car and was lowering the jack, when the vehicle hit the ground i leaned over the hood of the vehicle and was kind of trying to wrap up our conversation when there was this weird moment where we both watched a regular airplane fly over. the airplane made a noise which got my attention.\r\n\r\nthat is when i saw the object. \r\n\r\ni said to the neighbor, you see that in the sky and i pointed. he was like yes. i then made a joke like is that planet x as i did not think he knew what i was talking about. at this point the object seemed like a circle like but a little no so perfect circle. it was really shinny and seemed to be reflecting the sun as the sun was setting.\r\n\r\ni was like what is that. he said it might be a weather balloon.\r\n\r\ni didnt think so, and remembered exactly where my camera was as i just got back from a trip. i ran back to the house and got the camera. when i got back outside i couldnt see it so i just started to take pictures of where i thought i saw it.\r\n\r\ntried to take pictures of in relation to the ground. the object was north but as for as the degrees i am not sure. if one was really interested they can look at the pictures and get an exact i guess.\r\n\r\nby the time i got the camera the object was not as bright and not as big. i could hardly see it and then i picked it up. i had a hard time zooming in on the object but got a few good pictures. \r\n\r\nthe event only lasted a few minutes, i would say something like 3-10 minutes not sure.  i do know that after we could no longer see it i asked the neighbor what time it was. he pulled up his phone and it was 7.33pm. if i were to guess we noticed it ~7.25pm\r\n\r\nwe kept talking. i know he is a little religious so i did not press on him to much. a few minutes later two helicopters came in from the south. i was telling him that i have heard stories about helicopters after ufo sightings but thought those were military and it was clear that first helicopter that came up form the south was small and not really a military helicopter that would hold any type of weight. the neighbor said they are looking for someone. of which it seemed like they were but it looked like they were looking for something on the ground not the air. \r\n\r\nthe helicopter passed us and was heading somewhat north where we saw the object and then turned west towards the gulf of mexico where a second helicopter met up. the second helicopter had a light on it and by this time it was starting to get dark both of the helicopters then started to travel north in a strange none linear path. we live near the pinellas trail and i do not think the helicopters were searching or flying that trail as it is kind of straight. i would say that the helicopters were in between the trail and coast moving north in a non linear path.\r\n\r\ni personally could not tell if the helicopters were related to the object in the sky. it did not seem like it but it did seem like they were looking for something. the timing was strange.  the airplane that we saw earlier was a typical airplane like a 747 commercial plane that held tourists which is common in our skys here.\r\n\r\nwhen everything die down, i checked the camera. the pictures that i zoomed in of which i attached convinced me that what i saw was either a weather balloon or something else. i am more leaning towards the something else.\r\n\r\nlater i started to zoom in on the pictures i took where i originally did not see the object and eventually found them.   \r\n\r\ni have attached all of the pictures that i have taken in this event. i saved the originals of which are the numbered pictures.Jpg and also made copies of the original where i marked with photoshop an arrow of where you can zoom in and see the object if one wants.\r\n\r\ni personally do not think this object is from our planet but can not rule out the fact that it could look like a weather balloon under some conditions type of conditions but i do not think so.\r\n\r\ni know i saw something but what it is i do not. \r\nit was way to early to be a star in the sky in my opinion and the object only got darker and ended up going behind clouds i think.  i know in the beginning it was very bright and shinny.I wish i had a picture of it the first time i saw it. \r\n\r\ni have filed a report with this website before on a object i saw but the investigator told me that it was most likely sirius as it was in that direction at the time i saw it back then.  i had video of that even back then.\r\n\r\nwhat i saw today i do not know but it was not sirius and i took pictures to prove it.\r\ni do not know if it is man made or not but i saw something and i am not afraid to say that. \r\n\r\ni am college educated. i was not drunk or am i seeking any fame. just a guy that saw something. i know there has been other much more exciting experiences and close encounters that are a better story then mine but today i saw something in the sky north of me and i was not the only one. \r\n\r\nlastly on the pictures i uploaded that have the file name [###marked with arrow.Jpg] were done in a very old version of photoshop. i did this on copies of the original file of which i am also uploading. the original files are not altered and no i did not photoshop this object into pictures, i have better things to do with my life then that these days, hell it has already taken me an hour to write this report and upload everything.\r\n\r\nplease review the pictures and you decide what it is for yourself.\r\n\r\nregards,\r\nchris termeer\r\n\r\nps... i also have a few more pictures if you want just email me where i can send them. the system only lets me upload 10 pictures. i have 14 pictures in

colaboración a un científico de río gallegos quien me asesoró sobre equipamiento y métodos para observar fenómenos inusuales en el área donde trabajo.\r\nel día de hoy 21/9 un compañero que venía al cambio de turno vio hacia el sur unos 10 km antes de llegar a punta loyola un helicóptero blanco que se desplazaba muy bajo a unos 150 metros de la ruta y con rumbo sudeste.\r\ncuando llegó a la oficina me relató esto, eran las 03:10 de la madrugada, a las 03:30 recibimos una llamada por radio de uno de los transportistas de servicios petroleros que volvía por la ruta costera que desde punta loyola bordea el mar rumbo al sur, en la cual estaba a unos 15 km de nosotros.\r\nel dijo ver un helicóptero aterrizado entre la ruta y el mar, sin luces, de color blanco totalmente y muy grande con 4 hileras de ventanas, como venía manejando un camión petrolero con químicos no pudo parar pero lo vio a solo 10 metros a su derecha del camino contra el mar.\r\nsalimos entonces de punta loyola con un compañero y portando un dispositivo infrarrojo de visión nocturna nocx5 profesional y mientras el manejaba yo observaba a la distancia con el dispositivo desde la parte alta de la camioneta subido al techo vidriado retráctil.\r\ndivisé el helicóptero a la distancia y nos fuimos acercando rápidamente hasta llegar casi a los 100 metros de donde estaba, le pedí apague las luces completamente del vehículo y lo detenga.\r\nen ese momento veo pasar de mi derecha a mi izquierda cruzando la ruta y en dirección al helicóptero una figura de estatura media, delgada y que a la luz del visor aparecía con dos detalles llamativos, uno un cuello más largo que lo normal y dos con los brazos que llegaban hasta sus rodillas.\r\nesta entidad se subió al helicóptero y este despegó inmediatamente rumbo al este, es decir hacia el mar.\r\nalcancé a tomar varias imágenes con la cámara adaptada al visor nocturno, las que esta tarde entregue para que sean analizadas en río gallegos.\r\nrevisamos el terreno con linternas y con el visor nocturno pero no encontramos huellas de pisadas aunque sí el terreno deprimido en el lugar donde el helicóptero tenía apoyadas sus ruedas, aclaro que no tenía patines sino ruedas, de lo cual tomé imágenes y también entregué para su análisis en río gallegos.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

Springs","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Unusual lights/activity seen at 9 pm sept 20, 2017 (duration 2-3 hrs.)\r\n\r\nmy wife was heading to bed, so i took the dog out into the backyard for potty, as usual and perfectly normal day/night. i immediately noticed disco lights in the sky to the nw, over the air force academy (afa) in colorado springs. i went to grab my wife to confirm that i am positively seeing this. lights were about a mile off the ground. she confirmed that it was flashing lights and of the colors blue, red, green, violet and white. she described it as saucer-shaped and harmoniously flashing, to something like a song. i thought of a tiny \"disco ball\".\r\n\r\nas we are watching the first object over afa, it's now getting lower in the sky and almost out of view, due to the neighbor’s rooftop behind us. it was descending, straight down, and extremely slow. i then looked around in the sky toward the n-ne direction, directly over the penrose hospital from our back deck. the back of our house faces almost directly n-nw. i then noticed an object in the flight path for cos airport, perfectly turning in from the east, as other aircraft do, heading south for landing. powers blvd is a perfect fight path into the cos airport so i just assumed this object was following the lights from the road, as seen from above.\r\n\r\nit is now around 9:30 pm, the disco ball over afa cannot be seen now. there is rarely any traffic going to the cos airport at this time of night. i didn't at first think anything of it, but when 'the now second’ object appeared to turn directly into the usual landing path i see used every day, it appeared to have at least three very large, larger than normal white lights, no red or green as all aircraft flown in us are required to have. they were very bright lights in almost a triangle shape. as we focused on that object, and it went to the south, out of my view because the houses were in the way again, my wife went to the front of the house and confirmed that it was not an airplane and then it left from her view behind more houses.\r\n\r\nshe then returned out back to join me on the deck and where we saw this object 'flying-in', at about one fist held up to the sky, from another rooftop, was an absolutely identical flashing disco ball, just like the first one to the nw over afa, a few minutes ago. this has to be twenty or more miles away from first seen object over afa and this one is now closer to us physically but same size, same strobe light effect with the colored lights. i was flabbergasted. my wife was amazed and happy to have seen, but had to sleep for work. i stayed up as long as i could. no feeling of fear or anything malicious, just beautiful and almost like this is just a normal occurrence, but it truly was not.\r\n\r\n**i do have to add this: in the videos i am sending, you will see aircraft flying near first sighting, to give perspective on the actual event. not sure if they were just passing or trying to get a better view. the first video has two planes shown flying near the first object over afa. all total on planes observed, were maybe nine different planes. remember that it would have taken a plane about twenty or more minutes to get from one of the objects (nw), to the other (ne). (see google map attached) the first object in the nw, there were three planes seen at approximately the same altitude. one above or almost in the same horizontal plane and a couple different ones just flying near. i’d say the planes were less than one half mile away from the object. the second and eventually third object ‘disco ball’ in the ne sky had at least six different planes flying by it, but not in a low landing path, extremely high (over a mile) in the sky too. one plane even turned due east and went around the object, at a slightly lower altitude. **\r\n\r\nit is now after 10pm. i have now been in and out of the house probably ten times. i was grabbing binoculars and trying to find a camera or video camera that was charged, so i could see this object better, but nothing was charged. i only have a couple of videos that have the sound of us talking and they were taken with an iphone6. pics are useless, but visible. please accept my apologies for the language too, i was just amazed and i don’t know how to edit that out. choose from the following videos. (mufon_01 explicit.Mov, mufon_02 explicit.Mov, mufon_01 afa before too low to see.Mov, mufon_01 photo w-flash.Jpg and mufon_02 photo w-no flash.Jpg).\r\n\r\nto finalize this report, it is morning now and i am just still trying to figure this one out, looking at life differently. this was one of the most unusual sights i have ever seen in my almost 48 years on earth.\r\n\r\ni also just scrolled through mufon reports prior to posting this one. there is another report about thirty miles away, as the crow flies from here, in divide colorado, that describes exactly what we saw here in the springs, same date. (report- 86811). the descriptions of the objects i saw ‘flying into the airport’ down here, before the second ‘disco ball’ were exactly like he has described. similar to the blue angels, a very tight, military type flight pattern, while they were banking or turning south.\r\n\r\ni almost forgot... luckily i did a sound recording of exactly what i was observing. the afa ‘disco light’ could be seen as i walk from inside of house, toward the back deck. that light was gone now. i opened the door and looked to the right, where the second of the original lights were seen and there in the n-ne sky, sure as anything, possibly a third ‘disco ball’ was observed one fist length above and one fist length to the south of second ne object. so, the second (first ne) object is now less brilliant, by probably 50% or more, and the “third” new object is now just as bright as the very first seen pronounced ‘disco’ light. for how i lost sight of the objects, i didn't lose site but of just the one over the afa, that lower down toward earth. i did look before i went to bed and the objects in the ne sky were not there anymore, around three hours later.\r\n\r\ntldr;\r\n\r\n**mufon investigator - please edit content as you deem appropriate - i have recorded my words and have tried to think about this, but so much seemed to go on last night, that i cannot quite fit all of this report into a solid occurrence of what my wife and i observed. this was absolutely not iss floating over or any other satellite, balloons, fruitful rainbows or anything else that some may suggest. i have phone apps for all of those sky 'trackers', and this was an unusually real and rare event for us. all of the objects i have mentioned, did not rotate with the earth cycle, they rotated with us as the earth is moving, with us viewing from within. so they remained at the exact spot for the total length of sighting. i even used the houses as indicators.**\r\n\r\nthank you – keep up the great work on mufon – the world needs this info publicly shared :)\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"03:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":86826,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.8358816,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09212017-0012","longitude":-104.81834339999999,"occurred":1505941200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1506008072000,"summary":"Multiple colors and 'disco ball' objects seen - hovered in sky, different locations, for over two hours.","tags":["photo","video","sound","triangle","landing"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":1509266544486,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/86826_submitter_file1__Mufon01AFAbeforetoolowtosee.MOV","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/86826_submitter_file2__Mufon02Explicit.MOV"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"80923","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Colorado Springs, Colorado","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:18872"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed","city":"South Bend","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Okay so like i was j chillin at home and this dudebro landed on my feckin lawn and he came in and was like \"whaaaaduppppp???\" and he was süper rude like the first thing he did was change the thermostat like 5 degrees higher.
