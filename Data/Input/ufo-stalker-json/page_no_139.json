reading this experience of mine) exactly what i saw that night and how strange of an occurrence it was. i understand that it's quite lengthy and my paragraphs might be large and uneven, but i seriously need to get this story out there as weird things have been happening around my house at night ever since. here it goes.\r\n\r\n\r\n     i was playing a show at the infamous and long standing venue called \"churchills pub\" with my metal band. perhaps you've heard of the place? i play bass guitar. anywho, it was 1 in the morning when i decided to leave and somehow i ended up on the sawgrass expressway, i was a little new to driving at the time so i guess that's how, however before i proceed with my story, i'd like to mention that me and a couple of friends had been seeing ufo's around my city and out above the everglades since we live so close to it. they still remember seeing them. and i remember the exact date of july4th 2015 where we saw a fleet that was massive and coordinated/intelligent. however, after that day i began to understand that weird things are and were happening around my area and in the everglades out west. behind the city i live in. weird things with *little* explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n     anyways back to my story. i was driving back kind of half weirded/sketched out after what me and my friends had been seeing and i had just got off of i-75 for sawgrass expressway. i had just barely entered the broward county area when i saw the ufo's again. the same orange and red shining/pulsating lights were off to my right as i went over a bridge for one of the exit's and they were what looked to be about, or atleast, 3 miles out. very far off in the distance. i remember my radio was acting up from what i remember and just as soon as i went to fiddle with it and fix it they were above my car. yes, from the time it took to look down and fix it then look back up at the road they were above my car. i looked up and there, above my car about 30 feet in the air, were two huge alien aircraft hovering/floating above my car with there red and orange lights reflecting off my dashboard.\r\n\r\n     i remember looking up at them in utter awe and amazement. i will describe the hull of the ship/design and exterior in this paragraph so i urge you to imagine. they were 10 feet above the center median lights, which i'd like to mention there are no center median lights on the express way so i believe that i was taken somewhere, i am seeking regression therapy for a possible case of \"transformed reality\". anywho, i remember that the hull, or what looked to be like armor, of the ships were colored with a dark-colored black and bronze metal and coated with a very thick looking gloss. imagine a laminated piece of paper but 100 times over. the black and bronze meant that it was some sort of metal or perhaps compound because the only known metal to survive high intensity heat from the atmosphere (assuming they came from another world which i believe they did) is tungsten which is used in military aircraft. so whatever it was made of, made literally no sense. the two ships had 3 parts. the underhull, which looked like a cargo bay that was diamond shaped. the light that pulsated was above that on what looked like a flat surface. then you had the bridge with black windows. possible that an alien was looking back at me?. now for the design of the ship. bare with me here because this is seriously insane. the design of the ship was truly something from another world and i don't think any ufo reports out there match what i saw. i may have been the first to see such a thing.\r\n\r\n     the design like pattern, be it if it was a pattern at all, looked very similar to a 3-dimensional \"sri yantra\" ,if you don't know what that is then please google it as it will give you an understanding of what it looked like, the ancient spiritual consciousness symbol. yet at the same time, the more i looked at it the more it made no sense at all. it had hundreds of angles etched all around it, and i can not find a shape in the human geometric system that looked even *similar* to those ships. the sri yantra is the only thing that comes even a quarter close to what it looked like. the design was clearly not from this world. there is no way.\r\n\r\n     furthermore, i'd like to speak more about the surrounding environment. as i've mentioned before, center median lights are none existent on the expressway but on that night there were lights on both sides for as far as you can see. i went back the following day just to make sure. there are none. i'd also like to mention that there was a car behind me about 40 yards back. when i passed by the aircrafts and went over the bridge i finally mustered the courage after being frightened from what i saw, i looked in the rear view window and that car was gone. he didn't get off the exit for as we both went past it and over the bridge. i must've been taken somewhere.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s), Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Stationary,Path then

not sure that was related. anyways i board the bus and the bus driver is stopping off at plenty of locations and we arrive to one where there's little to no light around it, no streetlamps, no houses or buildings, no nothing. the only thing illuminating the scene was the dim light inside the bus and the headlights. the bus driver opened the doors and nobody budges, but as the bus driver began to close the doors, we heard these really heavy footsteps come out of nowhere. then i heard the most god-awful sound i have ever heard. it wasn't quite screaming, it wasn't singing, but it sounded angry. the bus driver began to open the doors again for the thing to board, but as soon as it came into eyesight, nobody wanted that....That thing....To board this bus. the driver shut the doors as quickly as he could and this creature became infuriated. it was wearing women's clothing, an orange shirt and an orange at with some shorts (it's been hot here). but that thing was not like any women i've ever seen. i don't even know how to describe it. it could have the power to shapeshift, if that's a thing. this thing, it was a she, or at least wanted to appear so, began pounding on the bus doors, howling it's angry, screaming song. it went on for a long time. the bus driver was clearly in shock and confused and downright scared, as he should be. hell, i was scared too! i don't think any of us knew what to do. and at the same time, we weren't sure if this thing would follow us? if we did let the creature in, would it harm us? kill us even? would it chase after us if we didn't? if we called the police, and it left, would they even believe us? it wasn't any kind of cryptid like bigfoot or the chupacabra. without a doubt, it was an extra terrestrial lifeform. it is an experience i will not

saturday september 16, 2017, i was driving back to the city from a fishing trip with my father when i saw 3 columns containing 2 ufos each, hovering on the west side of the road, at the corner of hwy 27 and hwy 9 in schomberg, ontario.  it was dark out already at approximately 7:30pm.  at first, my father thought the lights might be part of towers, until they started to move around.  i quickly pulled over and got my cell phone camera out.  the objects began dancing around before i could get out of the car, and then they unfortunately flew away high above us and disappeared over the parking lot we were in.  luckily, 4 more started to fly towards us 2 at a time, and hovered around for a few minutes.  i was able to get some digital video footage.  what we saw in person was glowing orange lights.  what we see in the video footage is white dots.  however, if you zoom in on the video, you can clearly see flashing lights of red and blue.  at the same time i snapped a few photos.  you can

another 5 minutes and 1 more showed up just passing over us from the south west.  that was the last one.  in total we saw 6 orange glowing craft at first in 3 columns of 2 each, and then 5 others.  4

and flying my phantom drone. we were a couple miles down the road from the local salsbury recreation area by local highway f70. as i was looking in the south and flying my drone, my friend noticed this star like light that started moving towards me. being a pretty bright night from the moon, i didn't notice it right away. as i started bringing my drone back towards me, i noticed that the light started heading in my direction. as i got closer to my landing area it was so close and low to the ground that i was getting a little freaked out. when first noticed there was like a faint jetlike sound. with that being said there is a local airport about 5-8 miles southwest of the sighting. being around 4 am and the fact that as it went over our heads directly, it was only 200-400 ft, give or take a few feet, i knew that wasn't normal for this area and as it passed over our heads there was no sounds at all. as it followed my drone it stayed in a direct path right towards me. i landed a few minutes before the object reached us. as it got close to us, it seemed to slow down and just kinda hover for a few minutes and then started heading northwest towards the iowa city area. as it got further away and reached the cedar river banks it slowed to a complete halt and sat above the tree line for a bit. it would move from southwest to northeast over the trees changing altitudes. it almost looked like it was getting ready to land but then after about 5 minutes or so moving above the trees, it finally decided just fade away like it was never there. when the craft flew over us, it was clear as day from the naked eye. it was triangle in shape and had a light on each point as well as some flashing or strobing lights on the bottom of the craft. the craft would hover then shoot up or to the sides for a quick jump and the go back to hovering. the direction was eratic and not like you would see from any plane or jet at 4 am in the middle of nowhere. i'm kind of a skeptic but not so much anymore. this sighting is like nothing i've ever seen before in my life. we've seen other lights in the sky as well over port louisa wildlife refuge but that's another story. my friend and i both were in shock and awe. that's all we talked about for weeks and i even posted a video of it on youtube but was edited some to show more clarity. i put all of this behind me until i seen a video on youtube recently about the illinois invasion and now here i am writing you and wanting to share my story with you as well. hope to hear back from you soon. thanks and have a good

to come back from bio break. there was one light bulb 60w lit, otherwise in darkness, sky was clear, no breeze. there is no haze, pollution, or structural interference with view of the sky, the stars are always clear and numerous in this area. when the dog returned, i let it in the house but turned off the exterior light and i went back outside to the deck to continue observing. \r\n2. i always look at the stars at night, my residence has a wide unobstructed view of the sky. i noticed irregular movement of what i thought was a star at first. \r\n3. i thought it was a star  until i observed the irregular movement and random light pulse\r\n4. the irregular light twinkling appeared to go from white to reddish, and the light seemed to waver in place, sometimes in a circular motion, sometimes in acute angles, occasionally large leaps in a straight line (field of vision maybe 1cm with arm extended, which would translate into a great distance given its altitude, but i'm not a mathematician). \r\nover the course of several sightings within one week at approximately the same time range (21h30 to 23h30 est), the light(s) generally flickered, had unpredictable movements -circular within a defined range, or path then acute jumps to different trajectory and return to straight line, or hovering with satellite light flickers migrating to and from what appeared to be a large solid shape (possibly triangular or boomerang), or an impossibly fast straight line which could not be accomplished by any human-made projectile that i am aware of... also, in each case, no accompanying noise, however i believed this could be due to the altitude. \r\n5. feelings: \"wtf is that???\" i remained in place on each occasion, repositioned myself to view the anomaly from different angles, tried using one vs both eyes, and went through a mental checklist of any plausible human-made explanation. mentally, i could not associate the observations with satellites, iss, planes or other aircraft. i felt curious, fascinated, and somewhat apprehensive. i wondered if \"they\" saw me there, or knew if i was watching. that thought drove me indoors -twice while the phenomenon was ongoing, but once after the fast-moving object raced out of my field of view. \r\ni tried researching online to find logical explanations, but ultimately could not accept the sightings as satellites, satellite flares, aircraft such as planes/choppers/balloons,  or iss. \r\nthe phenomenon seems to be increasing in frequency and variety over the past year (when i first noticed these strange moving lights in the sky).","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

corner in our community i saw this light in the sky. i thought. wow thats a bright star. then i saw the flashing and thought. wait. stars dont flash that bright of red blue and white. then i lined myself up with a stationary object to make sure it wasnt a plane. it never moved in about 5 mintues. soi kept walking while watching it. i noticed it still hadnt moved in relation to stars around it but the intensity of the flashes made me think non star non organic. checked a star chart and capella is the closest one if that wasnt it. not quite sure. but a little concerned.","distance":"Over One
