listened near the tree but i heard nothing.I wondered what it was i had heard before sor i spoke up and said i know your in there.I sat at a picnic table about 5 ft. from the tree as i looked the tree over slowly i was not going to believe what i was about to see.There in a open branch spot about 2 ft. from the ground i saw this orange hairless head with two black diamond cut eyes looking right at me.It had no ears nose or mouth.About a 2 or 3 second stare and i went wow what are you?And it was gone.But i got a real good look at it up close.I still get goosebumps thinking about it.","distance":"20 Feet or

aerial object coming towards my direction about 300 ft away. i was just observing the sky and noticed and thought it was just a airplane. as it flew directly over my head and continued past my position in a south/west direction. (the object had no sound what-so-ever and that's what caught my attention the most.)i observed the object fly past me for another 100 ft and it appeared to start circling back around to my position, at this point i ran 5 feet into my home and told my mothers boyfriend to run and follow me. as we ran out of the door and to the street it was about 30 ft above us; headed in a north/east direction. we ran approximately 200 feet and it abruptly turned in a north direction above a little forest treeline and that's when we lost sight of it. we continued north for about another 200 ft and we arrived at the edge of a cornfield. we had lost sight of the object. we studied the area for about 5 minutes maybe less and decided to start walking home. we walked about 10 paces and as i turned around this object which was more of a luminous ball of red and white pulsating light was hovering about 15 feet above the ground and directly above the only standing tree in the cornfield.  we observed the object pulsating vividly red and seemed to grow a little bigger than that of it when it turned white. the object moved very slowly and without sound towards the west of its hovering position. the area in which it stopped moving is about half a mile past state road 26 almost directly above us31. at this point the object pulsates a few more times then becomes a brilliant ball of red light and it seemed to grow in diameter. it continued to grow more brilliant red and bigger in diameter and then just blinked out of existence. in 2008 or 7 kokomo, indiana  had a mysterious loud boom and and was observed by dozens of people including myself as i sat at my computer next to a window. i observed a brilliant light just before the explosion. ufo hunters had came to town and investigated the mysterious explosion. (i believe the episode was named heartland explosion.) the heartland explosion incident took place almost in the same geographical location as my sighting but almost 10 years apart from each other. after the fact and time had gone by as i was reflecting back on my close encounter, i have come to a conclusion that maybe the object had landed on the ground and that is why we failed to see the object because we were looking in the sky for it. i have always felt like this object meant for my to witness it, and had i been looking on the ground i may have been able to approach and make contact as it was grounded; but that's just a theory. i remember everything very clearly and can take an investigator exactly over the same directions that i have stated here today. i would also, if possible like to examine the ground that i believe that the object landed. i am still in contact with my mothers ex-boyfriend and have asked him about this incident as recently as within the last year of this post. he tried to say that he could not recollect all what had transpired that night but clearly can state at least that we had ran and followed something that night. this night was so vivid to me that if asked to do so i could paint a scene of this object hovering over this lone tree in the cornfield. i would really like to get this out in the public and see if anybody else who may have witnessed this same event. this is the most amazing event that has ever happened to me and is also the reason that i one hundred percent believe that we are being visited by otherworldly and or extra-dimensional entities.

the back yard and the orange glow of the huge, massive rectangle moving slowing over the neighbor's tall pines was happening!  the homes adjacent to our back area are above those on my street,  due to a hill. we shared a fence at least 50 ' above our yard. the rectangle appeared to have extra bright orange glow to it's outline, like ribbing on a mattress. it was immense, and it moved over the homes up there and  it slowly turned to the south west over the next block of homes. it slowly moved in a ne direction over the lights of the casinos in reno's downtown. our dog barked, but didn't look up. i raced to the front door and watched it as it headed away ne. then it disappeared suddenly. poof! no mention in papers or tv of this incident. i looked online, but didn't find anything.\r\n\r\ni was excited and delighted to have experienced this event. my son (29 yrs) and i saw many lights zig-zagging in the night sky as we sat by an apache rites of passage fire pit on a mesa outside of santa fe, nm, august 1992. watched the lights for about 3 hours. sandia laboratory in az might have been working and researching with these objects.\r\nthus, began my passion and deep interest in ufo's. our friend said she had been abducted when young and pregnant in moraga, ca in 1973. the baby was taken. thus, i embrace ufo's.\r\n\r\nreno, nv, 7-4-99, 6 adults  watched a humongous, wide white streak of light (like exhaust) with something like a ball-shape in front of it, racing across the southern sky around 5pm. a july 4th gathering on one of the top hills above reno on a deck. spectacular view and we all shouted as this event occurred. this massive \"ball and streak thing\" zoomed into a large grouping of hills above southern reno area, maybe carson city, gardnerville area.  no explosion. no tv or newspaper info. that night or on the following day. \r\n[name removed/cms/rjl]","distance":"501 Feet - 1

springs, co. after a long day of outside activities we returned to the resort for dinner. afterwards we went to the outside patio to sit at the fire pit and talk about our day. at first i didn’t notice anything strange but my friend pointed out a weird light in the sky that just hovered. when i looked to where he was pointing i pulled out my iphone and began recording it. shortly after a 2nd orb materialized above the 1st. once they were both visible they simultaneously got brighter and slightly larger. at the time i was confused as to what i was looking at. there was a lake between the orbs and myself and the lights were reflecting off the water. the lower light suddenly disappeared and another orb appeared above the remaining one. at one point there were 3 visible orbs that from my angle appeared to be in a relatively straight line. i wondered if maybe they were flares but every orb held it’s place in the sky with no apparent descent or change. i tried at various times to zoom in but it would not hold focus. this went on for over 2min so i felt i was neglecting my group. i stopped the recording and returned to the fire pit, which was about 30’ away. when i turned back around all of the orbs were gone. i still don’t know what i saw but during the incident the server came out and my friend asked if he knew what it was. his reply was, “i’ve been here for 10 yrs and have never seen anything like it”, which adds to the mystery. there were other vacations making some noise in the pool but we’re no airplanes in the sky and other than those talking it was silent.

and some local kind hearted folks feed the and provide plastic containers for shelter.When i found what i thought would be a suitible spot to set camp i set mt bag down and walked a few steps to a

three sets of pinkish orange glowing objects with slight movement.I first assumed the glowing objects were the reflection of threee cats eyes . after watching the objects further ( approximitly 30

were wearing a very low reflective off white or gray coverall.After about two minutes all three subjects turned there heads toward me .Thinking they might be animal control workers not wanting to frighten them i stood up and said how ya\"ll doing ,with no vocal response all three begun moving towards me instantly closing the 30 ft that seperated us slowly again i spoke saying what are you guys

do you see that?'' we saw, floating (hovering) above us in the blue sky, a huge white cylinder shape object. since this would be my third sighting (during my lifetime), i immediately knew it was a ufo. my husband doesn't believe in ufos although he had previously seen the video i had taken of a ufo many years ago.  but this one, on august 5th was special.  it seemed so close to us, it was totally silent, no gaz emission, but it felt to me to be a heavy object as it was so big. we had time to slowly drink a whole glass of lemonade before it became hidden to us by the tree tops. we had a chance to really have a good long look at it before and we just couldn't believe how perfectly snow white color as the sun was shining on it. we did not see any wings, or windows, or engine or propeller; there was nothing on it, under it, behind it, in front of it. i remember losing my sense of hearing for less than a minute or so, as if i had become totally deaf. as i watched it, i felt such peace, totally fully peaceful and very very happy. i wanted to smile but i couldn't. it seemed i was frozen into that one feeling of combined happiness and peace almost indescribable.. and that feeling stayed within me until the object was invisible to me because of the tree line. i asked my husband how he felt. he felt the same as before the sighting, no different. 45 minutes later, a couple who lived at our house for the summer, sat on the front porch and ran in the house to tell us to come see the ufos in the sky above the trees! we sat there for more than 20 minutes watching the same cylinder shape object appearing on the south side, then hovering-then path and disappearing as if it had entered an invisible wall in the sky while another appeared on the south and did the same thing, disappeared and another and another always doing the same thing.I asked my husband if now he believed, now that 2 more people were seeing it.  but at no time did we think to film it and that made me so sad.  our guests said that they had been watching them for a long time before telling us to come and see them.  they said they were too mesmerized by them for a while. they did not have the feelings or emotions that i felt during the sighting. our guest said that he was only thinking ''take me, take me' while he was watching them.  we discussed about what we had seen in plain sight, in a perfectly blue sky.  my husband was trying to discredit it by saying there was the greenwood air force base only 30 or 40 minutes away from us, so it was probably an experiment of some kind.  i used to work at the base 8 months prior, i was sure there was nothing like this ufo that could be built there. no way! it was more like a pilot training base to me.  a couple of days (or latere) after this, i reported my sighting on a nova scotia website for sightings and never heard back from them. yesterday, march 18th, 2018 my husband and i were watching some documentaries on ufo and we both jumped with joy when we recognize the exact one we had seen the year before.  we copied it this time not to lose it and saved it on my desktop.  i had tried to send you a report a few months ago but didn't have time to finish completing it as i was looking for my video.  if you want me to send you the video i had taken in taiwan years ago with my camcorder (vhs), please let me know.  while i was working at the canadian space agency in st-hubert, quebec years ago, i had taken this video to have specialists from the agency view it. the only comments i received was 'they could not say if it was or was not a ufo). i was very disappointed but i am sure that what i filmed that night was a ufo as nothing could move at that high speed and change directions, 45 degrees, swirl movement and change trajectory in a heart beat. thank you for taking the time to read this. much appreciated.  yes, i believe.  below i include a photo but it's one i took the youtube - it is identical to the ones we saw. i hope that's okay.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":90874,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.84262657173094,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-03192018-0012","longitude":-65.27629231849787,"occurred":1501891200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nova Scotia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1521466827000,"summary":"An unidentified object was hovering above us in the cloudless blue sky - it hovering so slowly that we could see it perfectly. it was a huge cylinder, all white and the sun was shining on it; it seemed bright shiny metallic white.

going to catch my brother at the car-pool at the gaillac exit of the a68 highway. he comes from his school at albi by bus at 6:22 pm. i was 5 minutes late and when he goes up, he shares with me an observation that troubled him when waiting for me. a light in the sky made very fast movements : up-down-up-down several times, with a difference in height of about 50 meters, with 1-2 seconds for each path. he wonders if it's an airplane, or a radio-controlled aircraft, but he says it can not fly that way (too fast especially since there are no phases of deceleration and acceleration, the switches from high to low / low to high are almost instantaneous according to him). in jest i said to him \"you have witnessed a ufo brother!\" but in the hours that followed, i was less jester.\r\n\r\nattached file 1 : in blue, the position of my brother, in red the area where he saw the phenomenon.\r\n\r\n6.30 pm : we go home. at the bridge before leclerc (a french walmart), we see the object in the sky on the right. my brother indicates it to me, i try to look somehow while driving... i confirm a luminous object that moves. i think it's an airplane. we keep driving forward and it passes as on top of us to join our left side. the lights of the object vary slightly and gradually in intensity periodically : about every second, they decrease a little in intensity, then become more luminous etc., but they do not blink.\r\n\r\nattached file 2 : we see it getting away from us, then we head back home. the attached videos n°6 and n°7 are shot on this road, at position 4 (in blue) and forth.\r\n\r\nsecond part\r\n7:35 pm : we are going to eat at the restaurant. we leave lisle-sur-tarn. on the lisle-sur-tarn / gaillac road (d988), before les fédiès on our right at 2 o'clock we see an object emitting a bright light in the sky that moves relatively fast towards us, about 20 meters high. it will fly right over us. my mother, driving, sees it first. my brother, behind, sees it at the same time than me. but i, being at the passenger seat in front, i can lean forward to see it as it flies over us. there, i clearly see 3 warm white lights that do not blink, and nothing else. two are perpendicular to the direction of travel and one behind, hence forming a triangle. we do not hear no additional noise to the car noise, while the object clearly passes over us and at very low altitude, to maybe 20 meters (at night it was difficult to judge, we just saw 3 lights, but if the object had a dimension of 5-10 meters, then it was flying at 20 meters). between the moment where i saw it and the moment it passed behind us, there was between 5 and 10 seconds. at first i thought it was a plane since we were right next to the airfield but i opened my eyes wide, trying to check for flashing red and green lights (sign of a plane or helicopter) but there was none. there were only 3 continuous lights and being part of the same object (or 3 small flying objects in perfect formation). and if that had been a plane, hence at a distance of 20 meters, it would have made noise. i have already been flown over while driving by an aircraft from this airfield at a similar altitude, when it took off (on the road behind the aerodrome) and the noise characteristic of this kind of plane is usually clearly audible, even while driving with closed windows. there, nothing. and we did not even have the radio on.\r\n\r\nattached file 3 : 3 lights fly over us following this scheme.\r\n\r\nwe continue our road as we talk about what just happened. we make the connection with what we saw earlier with my brother. but it continues.\r\n\r\n7:40 pm : at the roundabout of leclerc with my brother while my mother drives, we inspect around to see if we see anything. on the right we see the same constant pulsating glow that moves this time in our direction, at a distance of 500 meters or a little more (position 1, see attached file 4). we take the long road (d968) until the first roundabout (position 2), turn left and it is on this road (d13), until the next roundabout, that i take the 3rd video (attached file n°8). i open the window, my mother drives quite slowly and there are 2 cars behind us, one of which doubles us at a moment, we can see it in the video. the object is on our right side and then passes over us to join our left side. concretely, this last \"sequence\" lasted about 1 minute (between the two roundabouts, from (3) to (4)). when it was on our right, it was about 500 meters far again and then it got closer quite quickly towards us where there, it was crystal clear, it was only 50 meters away, flying at an altitude of 20-30 meters to the left. i had the open window to film, head almost out of the car, and i did not hear any airplane noise. when it passed at our left side, i took a last look through the front-left window of the car and then left-back and judging by its movement i had the impression that it was spinning around us ... at that moment, i saw that it had a powerful light at the front, and a little one (or several, at this time we weren't under it so we didn't know how many lights it had) less powerful  at the back but it's this one that allowed me to see some part of the object. i can not explain well but there was something between the two lights, it was not a flat area (\"un aplat\" in french, like in a painting where a part is uniformly painted), it was a complex texture i feel. then we lost sight of it and when we arrived at our destination 2 minutes later, we looked at the sky but there was nothing except the stars.\r\n\r\nattached file 4 : explicative map of the previous paragraph, with annotations 1 to 4 (as usual, in blue our position, in red the phenomenon's position)\r\n\r\nattached file 5 : detailed view of the end of this second part (beware : the numbers do not match the previous paragraph, but each number is still linked to the same number of the other colour)\r\n\r\nlater by talking to his friends on facebook, my brother tells me that our cousin has noticed a brief internet break around 6:30 pm, when the object was observed above of leclerc. he lives in a radius of less than 1 km from this place. in the evening we are at a restaurant with a former airline pilot who lives in the area and he asserts that gaillac aerodrome does not fly night-time airplanes.\r\ni realize that all the events happened around the airfield but as i said : no noise, no flickering, three triangle lights, three witnesses ...\r\n\r\nnote : video n°6 only lasts 2 seconds because i accidentally tapped the stop button after the beginning. i re-encoded video n°8 because i started the recording in a hurry in vertical position and even if i filmed horizontally after that, the file was still vertical. also i cut the first 2 seconds of the video where my mother tells \"it's a flying saucer !!!\" i hope you'll understand...","distance":"20 Feet or

is a translation of my report to the geipan, the french ufo report center. i wrote this testimony in the evening, just after the restaurant, because i was aware that i had to write right away as long as it was still fresh in my memory. i only send it to you today because i discovered mufon today and geipan does not answer me]\r\n\r\n27/11/17, in the evening.\r\n\r\nfirst part\r\n6:27 pm : i'm going to catch my brother at the car-pool at the gaillac exit of the a68 highway. he comes from his school at albi by bus at 6:22 pm. i was 5 minutes late and when he goes up, he shares with me an observation that troubled him when waiting for me. a light in the sky made very fast movements : up-down-up-down several times, with a difference in height of about 50 meters, with 1-2 seconds for each path. he wonders if it's an airplane, or a radio-controlled aircraft, but he says it can not fly that way (too fast especially since there are no phases of deceleration and acceleration, the switches from high to low / low to high are almost instantaneous according to him). in jest i said to him \"you have witnessed a ufo brother!\" but in the hours that followed, i was less jester.\r\n\r\nattached file 1 : in blue, the position of my brother, in red the area where he saw the phenomenon.\r\n\r\n6.30 pm : we go home. at the bridge before leclerc (a french walmart), we see the object in the sky on the right. my brother indicates it to me, i try to look somehow while driving... i confirm a luminous object that moves. i think it's an airplane. we keep driving forward and it passes as on top of us to join our left side. the lights of the object vary slightly and gradually in intensity periodically : about every second, they decrease a little in intensity, then become more luminous etc., but they do not blink.\r\n\r\nattached file 2 : we see it getting away from us, then we head back home. the attached videos n°6 and n°7 are shot on this road, at position 4 (in blue) and forth.\r\n\r\nsecond part\r\n7:35 pm : we are going to eat at the restaurant. we leave lisle-sur-tarn. on the lisle-sur-tarn / gaillac road (d988), before les fédiès on our right at 2 o'clock we see an object emitting a bright light in the sky that moves relatively fast towards us, about 20 meters high. it will fly right over us. my mother, driving, sees it first. my brother, behind, sees it at the same time than me. but i, being at the passenger seat in front, i can lean forward to see it as it flies over us. there, i clearly see 3 warm white lights that do not blink, and nothing else. two are perpendicular to the direction of travel and one behind, hence forming a triangle. we do not hear no additional noise to the car noise, while the object clearly passes over us and at very low altitude, to maybe 20 meters (at night it was difficult to judge, we just saw 3 lights, but if the object had a dimension of 5-10 meters, then it was flying at 20 meters). between the moment where i saw it and the moment it passed behind us, there was between 5 and 10 seconds. at first i thought it was a plane since we were right next to the airfield but i opened my eyes wide, trying to check for flashing red and green lights (sign of a plane or helicopter) but there was none. there were only 3 continuous lights and being part of the same object (or 3 small flying objects in perfect formation). and if that had been a plane, hence at a distance of 20 meters, it would have made noise. i have already been flown over while driving by an aircraft from this airfield at a similar altitude, when it took off (on the road behind the aerodrome) and the noise characteristic of this kind of plane is usually clearly audible, even while driving with closed windows. there, nothing. and we did not even have the radio on.\r\n\r\nattached file 3 : 3 lights fly over us following this scheme.\r\n\r\nwe continue our road as we talk about what just happened. we make the connection with what we saw earlier with my brother. but it continues.\r\n\r\n7:40 pm : at the roundabout of leclerc with my brother while my mother drives, we inspect around to see if we see anything. on the right we see the same constant pulsating glow that moves this time in our direction, at a distance of 500 meters or a little more (position 1, see attached file 4). we take the long road (d968) until the first roundabout (position 2), turn left and it is on this road (d13), until the next roundabout, that i take the 3rd video (attached file n°8). i open the window, my mother drives quite slowly and there are 2 cars behind us, one of which doubles us at a moment, we can see it in the video. the object is on our right side and then passes over us to join our left side. concretely, this last \"sequence\" lasted about 1 minute (between the two roundabouts, from (3) to (4)). when it was on our right, it was about 500 meters far again and then it got closer quite quickly towards us where there, it was crystal clear, it was only 50 meters away, flying at an altitude of 20-30 meters to the left. i had the open window to film, head almost out of the car, and i did not hear any airplane noise. when it passed at our left side, i took a last look through the front-left window of the car and then left-back and judging by its movement i had the impression that it was spinning around us ... at that moment, i saw that it had a powerful light at the front, and a little one (or several, at this time we weren't under it so we didn't know how many lights it had) less powerful  at the back but it's this one that allowed me to see some part of the object. i can not explain well but there was something between the two lights, it was not a flat area (\"un aplat\" in french, like in a painting where a part is uniformly painted), it was a complex texture i feel. then we lost sight of it and when we arrived at our destination 2 minutes later, we looked at the sky but there was nothing except the stars.\r\n\r\nattached file 4 : explicative map of the previous paragraph, with annotations 1 to 4 (as usual, in blue our position, in red the phenomenon's position)\r\n\r\nattached file 5 : detailed view of the end of this second part (beware : the numbers do not match the previous paragraph, but each number is still linked to the same number of the other colour)\r\n\r\nlater by talking to his friends on facebook, my brother tells me that our cousin has noticed a brief internet break around 6:30 pm, when the object was observed above of leclerc. he lives in a radius of less than 1 km from this place. in the evening we are at a restaurant with a former airline pilot who lives in the area and he asserts that gaillac aerodrome does not fly night-time airplanes.\r\ni realize that all the events happened around the airfield but as i said : no noise, no flickering, three triangle lights, three witnesses ...\r\n\r\nnote : video n°6 only lasts 2 seconds because i accidentally tapped the stop button after the beginning. i re-encoded video n°8 because i started the recording in a hurry in vertical position and even if i filmed horizontally after that, the file was still vertical. also i cut the first 2 seconds of the video where my mother tells \"it's a flying saucer !!!\" i hope you'll understand...","distance":"20 Feet or
