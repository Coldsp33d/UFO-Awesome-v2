yelled to me to look at the strange object in the sky.  i grabbed my cell phone and went upstairs.  we went to the deck in our backyard and she pointed out an object to the northeast in the sky.  my first impressions were that it was changing colors and appeared to have multiple lights stacked in a vertical line.\r\n\r\ni suggested we get binoculars to try to get a better look at the object.  i used a pair of 8-16x magnification binoculars; my mother used a set of old navy ship binoculars (magnification unknown).  my mother was the first to find the object in the sky and stated the object was moving in seemingly random directions for very short distances.  she also noted it was changing shape and left a \"tail\" as it moved.  i was able to find the object in my binoculars also and made the same observation.  we watched the object for a period of time.\r\n\r\nwe deduced it was not a star because of its movements and shape changes.  the object was much brighter than the surrounding stars.  we also assumed it was not a meteor because it did not follow a linear path.  a plane was also ruled out for the same reason as a meteor.\r\n\r\nafter a period of observation with binoculars i decided to try to video tape the object with my cell phone (samsung galaxy s6).  i was able to do so and attached one of three videos i took.  i also took 13 photos, one of which was attached.  i tried to file this report last night, but the mufon server because non-responsive (probably because of the size of the attachments. the attached video is 7 minutes long.  i have 2 other videos that are about 22 minutes each (22+22+7 = 51 total minutes of video).\r\n\r\nduring the event, i texted my sister and 2 brothers.  my brother decided to drive over and observe the object.  he arrived around 12:25 a.M. and left around 1:34 a.M.  he observed the object the entire time.  my mother and i both went into the house before my brother arrived. i came out to talk to him briefly before retiring to bed.\r\n\r\nwe have seen ufos on 2 other occasions from the same location with a number of witnesses. the previous sightings were of a clearly visible disc object (seen twice).  during one sighting, the disc was escorted by 2 other crafts, with an additional object moving towards the group of three as if to intersect the travel path.  \r\n\r\nhere is a link to the additional pictures and videos.  this is my google drive.  https://drive.Google.Com/open?Id=0bxdzryiolewnalu4r1hbwunosm8  i also included some daytime photos for reference.  \r\n\r\ni am a current member of mufon and i

north.  it looked to short to be an airliner and to round and featureless to be a small airplane.  the sun was just coming up over the mountains and the object was to my west.  it was highly reflective.  so i went outside to get a better look.  then as i had access to the entire sky i looked up and began to count numerous highly reflective objects in the sky all hovering in place.  when i looked again for the object that was moving, it either had disappeared or stopped.  there was an object roughly in the area where i had lost sight of it when i looked up at the others.\r\n\r\nthat lower object was closer and remained for a much longer period.\r\n\r\nit is possible they were balloons. but all 13 or perhaps more that i counted were all at different altitudes and not one of them was drifting.\r\n\r\nhigher clouds moved in over their location, so the upper winds were active\r\n\r\nit is hard to judge the altitudes not knowing their actual size and they were over the bay a little more than a mile away.  somewhere between 2 and 4 thousand  feet when i first saw them.\r\n\r\nthere were a few that seemed to fade in and out a few times.  but being at a distance and with other white clouds near by i could not be sure it was not my eyes re-focusing on them that made them appear after looking away for a minute.\r\n\r\ni did shot a video on my iphone 6s.  but unless someone has sophisticated editing software, the brightness of the sun on the clouds seems to have prohibited the camera from capturing the objects.  my wife was also witness to what i saw and counted the same number of objects as i did.\r\n\r\ni observed the object for 30 minutes until they became smaller and smaller and disappeared.  it appeared as if they were ascending but never any lateral movement.\r\n\r\ni am happy to be wrong and shown that these were only balloons acting in an unusual manner.  but until i can discover there was zero wind up to at least 4000 feet that morning, i have to conclude that these objects warrant further investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

was lit from behind so i saw the shadow and outline. time seemed to standstill. i was afraid but i covered my head and eventually i went back to sleep. in the morning i could find no evidence of what happened and i did not mention it because i was  afraid and thought that maybe it was just a dream. a few years later i was in my bedroom sleeping when i was awoken by a figure at the end of my bed. i sensed that this was the same figure that i had seen a few years earlier. this time i could not move. from the second event, i often found myself waking up outside of my bedroom. i sometimes found myself in my car, in the driveway listening to music and i once myself at a local beach in my car, even though i'm sure i went to bed in my bedroom that night. during this time, i often had weird sensations in my body and extremities and also strange mental sensations. i often found myself daydreaming in school or wherever i was and looking at myself as if through another person's eyes from across the room. if i closed my eyes, i always saw a huge, spaceship like structure in the distance with blinding red pulsating lights. strange things like this happened to me until i was 27 years old. this is also the year that i moved to japan and since i've been living in japan i have not had any of these events that i'm aware of. i just want these facts to be recorded as i'm not sure how

jobs corps center in ferry county, of washington state. approximately 7 miles from the canadian border. or, 160 miles north of spokane, washington. while 2 friends of mine and myself were setting back against a snow bank having a conversation, i noticed a movement in the east. the same slow dull color of off-white to white as any other stars. but this was moving. as i mentioned this my friends were looking and one noticed another star-like orb coming from the west. and finally, we see one coming from the north. no sound. they just look like all the other stars. had we not been sitting outside and watching, they would not have been noticeable. eventually, they came together to canada. forming one slightly larger star-like orbs. after approximately 15 minutes they separated and retraced the directions from whence they had come. no noise, trails, bright lights. just 3 small star-like, dull white glowing orbs that looked like any distant star. other than the fact that they just performed an act that was to my mind... impossible. by considering the distances they traveled and the location of the rendezvous, i would guess that they were close to the edge of our atmosphere. the point of the rendezvous would have had them several hundred miles over canada. the other two guys were pretty level headed and agreed that we had witnessed something our current technologies were not capable of doing. as obvious and open as this event was, the population in that part of washington state is very low. but something told me then, and i still believe, this was not an isolated incident. what better place to move about the sky without fear of being spotted? of course, we see the ufo objects moving all over population areas now. getting us ready for the big announcement that they are real? i doubt the world will hatter over the obvious. i hope this is of some help. should you wish to contact me, i'll be able to give you any details that i may have not already given. peace to you and

the santa cruz mountains) along el camino real, mountain view, ca, in the early evening of early summer 1988. the sky condition was clear with a bright afterglow from the sun that had just set behind the mountains. \r\n\r\nsuddenly, a glowing object passed in front of and elevated just above the mountain range from our left (se) to our right (nw). it appeared to be a fireball with a trail of flames and gray smoke swirling directly and strictly behind the fireball. the smoke and flame trail did not pass beyond the width of the fireball. we heard no noise and felt no heat from it. it moved about as fast as a jet liner landing at an airport, and about that high and far away from our vantage point. it did not swerve or vary from a straight-line path as it disappeared over the horizon to our right. we saw no evidence of a crash landing. it just passed in front of us and was gone. the event took less than 20 seconds or so. \r\n\r\na very few minutes after it disappeared, a gray-colored helicopter with the word navy on its tail section flew out from behind us, circled in front of us for a minute or two, then flew back from where it had come. our assumption was that they saw it, too, and were investigating. since the navy’s moffet field is located close by in the general direction behind us, i assume it came from there. \r\n\r\ni am reporting this now at this late date since i did not know of mufon’s exitance at the time of the event. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

called to me to look at something in the sky.  i went outside and stood on our deck with my mother.  she pointed out the object to me.  it was ne from our position.  it was a bright light in the sky.  it was a clear night and the object appeared significantly brighter than stars in the sky.  the object appeared to be still and i first noticed it appeared to be more than 1 light stacked together.  \r\n\r\ni went inside to retrieve binoculars.  i used a pair of 8-16x binoculars.  my other used a pair of old navy ship binoculars (unsure of magnification.  it took me a few minutes to locate the object through the binoculars; my mother quickly found the object.  when we both located the object we agreed that it was changing shapes and colors and it was rapidly moving erratically in a limited area of the sky.  the movements were in all directions and seemed random.  the object appeared to change shapes constantly.  it also changed colors - white, red, blue, green.  \r\n\r\ni laid down the binoculars and filmed the object on my cell phone.  i have three videos totaling about 50 minutes of the object along with 12 still photos.  \r\n\r\nmy mother returned inside.  during the event i was texting my three siblings.  my brother drove to my house to see the object.  he arrived around 12:25 and stayed until 1:34 a.M.  i went inside before he left, around 12:15.  \r\n\r\nthis is the third sighting of objects from our house.  we have seen a total of six objects.  our first sighting was of a disc-shaped craft at a close distance (it was close enough i felt i could shoot if with a hunting rifle).  our second sighting was of the apparently same disc-shaped craft, along with 2 smaller escort crafts at a longer distance.  a fourth object was traveling a different flight path to intersect with the other crafts.  both of these sightings also had multiple witnesses.  \r\n\r\ni am a mufon member and helped john ventre late last year upgrade some of his presentations.  because of the size of the file attachments, here is a link to the google drive where the videos and photos are housed.  \r\n\r\nhttps://drive.Google.Com/open?Id=0bxdzryiolewnalu4r1hbwunosm8","distance":"501 Feet - 1

marcha, todos adultos y todos profesionales.\r\nexactamente a las 6 pm la ruta se iluminó completamente por un objeto grande de color blanco intenso que no emitía destellos sino que aparecía iluminado desde su interior tal como los focos leds, tenía apariencia sólida y calculamos que medía entre 8 y 10 m de diámetro.\r\natravesó la ruta y el valle entre las dos barrancas en segundos volando lentamente casi al ras de la parte alta de las barrancas que calculamos tienen una altura de unos 50 a 70 m.\r\neste objeto tenía una forma de esfera y no presentaba irregularidades en su superficie y pasó casi directamente sobre nosotros, cuando esto ocurrió el sistema eléctrico y el motor de la camionera fallaron aunque no se detuvieron.\r\nal momento, tal vez a los 15 segundo, pasó en la mismo
