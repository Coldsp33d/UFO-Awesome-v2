seen the object we got really nervous and starting scrambling looking for cameras and video camera. video camera was dead. i then went back to the driveway to see it go across the sky. my wife then went to the back porch to see it come across the houses and headed to the west. i then moved to the back porch to observe. we both just stared at object in amazement of what we were witnessing. the

returning the porch looking for the object but to no avail. roughly 20 minutes later a helicopter was heard in the the distance hovering over the similiar area. the helicopter was easily recognizable with its swishing noise and flashing lights. the object it we saw was blaze orange and made no sound. we have never seen anything like it. it was not a plane or helicopter or anything like

in my back yard. shortly after we started the fire i noticed an anomalous object on the western horizon. i would say that the object was definitely elongated, or shaped like a cigar. if you were sitting down and you held an aspirin capsule at arms length it would be a good size reference for this object. it was a lime green color and it was glowing with a high luminosity. it made no sound and it did not move.  it 'hovered' in the same spot for nearly 3 and a half hours , and everyone saw it. the only reason that we 'lost sight of it' was because it started raining and we had to go inside. the object was miles and miles away but i believe that it must have been massive considering the elongated shape was clearly visible and because of how bright it was glowing. i live next to the city so i can hardly ever see stars or other celestial objects anyway and this was a cloudy night. there were no other stars out tonight. i thought it could have been a comet but the object just was just to solid. there was no tail or streak and it was way to low on the horizon. all i could do was stare at it. i couldn't say anything to the people around me for a moment. someone finally asked me what i was looking at and i was able to use reference points to show them what i was seeing. they saw it and nobody else could really come up with an explanation either. im left baffled by this and i really don't know what to think right now. i know what i saw, and i know what i didn't see.  what are we supposed to do about this?","distance":"Over One

at this point it was much higher in the sky. and appeared to be dancing from left to right and spinning.  i went out to the shed and got my daughters telescope.  when i brought it inside it fogged up

outside to see it as well  to the naked eye it was weird ..... but through the telescope it was obviously not a plane or a star it looked like a rip in time. spinning and flashing and pulsating  sort

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On the night of october 27, 2010, i was sleeping on a fouton on the floor of the bedroom in my apartment when i suddenly awoke and opened my eyes. lying on my right side, i could view the wall which was about two feet in front of me just beyond the open bedroom door. another foot down the wall was the only window in the room. behind me, a wall mirror was propped against the wall just to the left of the fouton. blinking lights from a source outside were reflected perfectly from outside the window at just the right angle to reflect onto the mirror propped against the wall behind me, and then reflected across the fouton to the wall in front of me as i lay on my right side. i glanced up at the window and saw an aircraft hovering motionless in the sky perfectly positioned for me to see it clearly from my position on the floor. it had many blinking lights of red, blue, white, and possibly yellow, similar to those of a police or emergency vehicle during a stop. from my position on the bed on the floor looking upward, the craft appeared to be in the shape of a boomerang. there were round balls of colored lights equidistant across both wings which appeared to blink randomly. there was no sound that i could hear. the window was closed. i had never seen a craft like this before, but thought it might be an alien craft. just then, i felt the presence of three or four beings in my bedroom. i continued to lay on the fouton with my head on the pillow. i could feel their energy but not see them. clearly, i could distinguish the sense of three beings and possibly a fourth one.  then, as if in my mind���s eye, i saw the image of a grey et and telepathically heard, ���we don���t want to scare you���.  before i could process this statement to respond, the grey lifted his spindly arm and with an arc of his arm and like the flick of a switch, i was out cold, asleep. i had not looked at the clock (which was on the night stand behind me) when i first awoke and saw the lights. nor did i look at the clock when i again opened my eyes to find myself still lying in bed. so, i don���t know the exact time of the visitation or how long it lasted. i felt as if i needed to urinate. so, i got up. as i stood up in the dark room, i could not see them with my eyes but could feel the energy of at least three beings and possibly a fourth. their energy felt a bit more diffused than when i was lying down. i could feel them watching me, observing. i walked across the hall to the bathroom, urinated, and returned to my bed. i sensed that they had me arise to use the bathroom just to observe me to see if i could go about this common routine. i felt as if they were scientists watching, whispering comments about my ability to carry out this routine task. i mumbled to myself as i returned to bed, annoyed that i didn���t know what was going on. yet i was compliant in completing the routine. as i put my head on the pillow, lying on my right side as i was before, i felt very sleepy, unable to keep my eyes open. i struggled to keep my eyes open but they would close on me and i would force them open and they would close again, as if i was drugged. finally, i succumbed to the extreme drowsiness, allowing my eyes to close and i went back to sleep. i don���t know how much time lapsed. for a brief moment, i reopened my eyes and gazed at the window where i saw a small grey et peering in the closed window at me. he was standing on the balcony just outside of the bedroom window. i would estimate him to be about three feet tall. his large head was typical of the greys seen in pictures. his large expressionless solid black eyes stared at me. his nose looked like a couple of small holes with an almost nonexistent mouth. he cocked his head to the left side in an inquisitive sort of way. his movements and the expression on his face appeared rather mechanical, as if devoid of emotion or any sort of deep thought. his affect and head movement was more robotic than organic. i wanted to keep looking and see what would happen next, but an overwhelming sense of sleepiness overcame me and i closed my eyes. my curiosity compelled me to force my eyes open one more time. the grey was gone from the balcony and i felt no energetic presence of any other beings in my apartment. i immediately saw a white orb of light dart from the apartment building up towards the boomerang-shaped craft that remained hovering in the sky. the light joined the end of the wing closest to me, appearing consistent as the other lights along the wings. instantly, the ship darted upwards to the left (from my perspective), disappearing from my view through the window. still struggling with a feeling of overwhelming fatigue, and despite my attempts to keep my eyes open, my eyes closed and i immediately returned to sleep. i slept through the night until the alarm clock woke me in the morning to get ready for work. i stood up from the fouton and looked around the bedroom. everything appeared normal. i slowly walked into the bathroom, glanced down the hallway and into the livingroom. nothing appeared any different from when i went to bed the night before. i had no obvious changes to my body and otherwise felt like normal. i have no sense of time about the incident, that is, what time it occurred in the night or how long it lasted. so, it may have occurred before midnight on october 27, 2010 or in the early morning of october 28, 2010. as i got ready for work, i kept wondering where the craft and greys came from, why they visited me in particular, and what they did when i was asleep. i continue to wonder and would love to find the answers.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Hovering then

were having a conversation at the lobby desk of the apartments i live at in los angeles. the security guard wanted to take a quick smoke break so i accompanied him just out front of the lobby on the sidwalk. as we were smoking 2 bright lights in the sky appeared out of nowhere. apparently me and the security guard were looking in the same part of the sky because as soon as the orb like lights appeared me and the guard turned our heads towards one another in disbelief and immediately turned our gazes back to the two bright objects. when they appeared it seemed as though they may have been traveling at a good amount of speed and came to an abrupt, slight stop, then began to travel as a fighter jet and his wingman do, in the direction of santa monica. whatever the two bright objects were (bright like fire) didnt hang around but maybe 40 seconds tops. the two objects accelerated at an amazingly high rate of speed and appeared to have just vanashed.  i was able to snap a picture from my cellphone before they went to wherever they were going.\r\n\r\n       about 13 to 15 hours later on january 1st 2012 i was at a bus stop in hollywood.  was a beautiful sunny day. as i was waiting for the bus i noticed a floating eyesore advertisement (blimp). as i was watching the blimp maneuver, i caught a glimpse of two objects that were reflecting sunlight (i believe) and appeared to be silver. these two bright silvery craft appeared to be at a considerably high altitude and traveling close together and in the same direction as the two objects from the night before. when i noticed them they were traveling extremely fast but was also in for a shock. the lead craft looked as though it was gaining speed and the one on the left was lagging behind. but that was not the case. the craft to the left slowed all the way down to what i can only describe as a complete stop. once stopped it did not lose altitude.  the craft to the left looked as though it slowed down to the point of a stop and hover but when it came to the stop/hover, it accelerated towards the stopped craft faster than iv seen any object, thing, vehicle move in all my life or imagination.  once the lead craft reached the stopped craft, the lead one appeared to come alarmingly close to the stopped one, circled all around it, than accelerated back in the direction they were traveling. once the lead craft got to about the distance that it had first switched directions, craft number 2 (laggy) accelerated at a very high rate of speed. all this happened within something like 30 seconds give or take. i was in such a state of disbelief that i had forgot my cellphone was in my hand. when i realized this i immediately pointed it at the event. i blindly hit the camera button nit knowing i had actually hit the camcorder button until i started seeing my phone was catching this event on video!  the point at which i did record this was when the lagging craft was catching up with the lead craft. i dont think my cellphone picked up the lead craft as i was a little too slow and they were extremely high above. thats all i have.

sure i can handle it.  they have responded to many requests they have told me that they live in the pavo's solar system.  i confirmed this under hypnosis with my therapist.\r\n\r\ni asked them to create a storm over appleton wisconsin on december 20th and i would be waiting for them at the linden l at 2pm and midnight on that date.  the day before the winter advisory warning was 2pm through midnight appleton wisconsin got hit with one storm all winter on that date with a foot of snow.  my dispatch computer where i get my orders called me at exactly 12 midnight to the second.  this is not possible and now have a record of that.   i posted this event on youtube several weeks before and planning it much longer.  no one knew how to contact me,  it was not a coincidence it had to be them.\r\n\r\nthey answered everyone of suggestions i have a rock i can't explain and they told me where they lived.  i have many more requests that they fulfilled for me.  i also have pictures of a mining company where they landed that also can't be explained.\r\n\r\ni know this isn't exactly what you want.  i am willing to show my evidence talk to you on the phone as long as it takes to convince you i'm not crazy or come see you.  i am not interested in you funding this situation but i need protection when i go back to vegas to finally know the truth.  i am willing to surrender my camera that has all my video on it and you can take it apart to see why it was damaged.\r\n\r\ni admit that there is a possible chance that this is my imagination or i am creating these events to take place however i have them all very well documented and in advance.\r\n\r\ni have to go back on my own to find out.  i am terrified to do it since each time i've gone they have altered my thoughts.  i have to do it with or with out your help even if it means my death or disappearance.  i want to do it alone and have to do it alone i just what someone to know what i'm doing and to track me when i go.\r\n\r\ni know it's not exactly what you are looking for but it's very real and worth your time to explore with me.  thank you please contact me and you will understand that this is real.  \r\n\r\ni know this is real and that they do exist please watch how much i believe on you tube at or with the title how i communicate to my alien friends,\r\n\r\nthank you to find the truth you have to put out the effort like i am doing,\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n    ","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path then

whitish light - like the flash of a camera.  it happened for about 6 seconds or so, but i do not think it was a meteor- these lights were unbelievably radiant and long lasting. i've seen meteors before - this in my opinion - was not one.  \r\n\r\nmy wife panicked and went upstairs to make sure the kids were ok. i stayed outside and 3 woman who happened to be walking by - i stopped and asked them if they had just seen that blue light in the sky. they had - and were in shock just as we were. we looked up to see if it would reappear but it was gone. it definetly wasn't any kind of plane - as i'm currently a student pilot and know about planes. and i don't think it was a meteor - cause aside from the way it looked -  cause nothing could go that fast, that low, without making noise. \r\n\r\ni'm still shocked today, and neither my wife or i got a good night's rest cause of it. of course i didn't get any pictures, as this was the last thing i expected to see last light and also it

could, but it was silent and moving very quickly.  when the object was to my north it faded into a tree line and i could not scope it back out.. at this time i looked back east and saw a commercial airline heading in similar direction so i compared the height and speed.  the object had to be at least a 1-2 miles high, and moving in the area of 400-600mph, possible a little more.  it had no characteristics of the airplane.  it was just a orb/spherical object moving  se to nw, silent, and fast. it was a dull grey/white metallic color. not shiny, but it slightly reflected the sun, in a
