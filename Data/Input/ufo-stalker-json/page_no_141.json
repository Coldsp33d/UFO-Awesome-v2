forest adjacent the taylor river.  the event began at exactly 03:19 and continued until dawn.  during this time an orb of light circled my tent, split into at least two separate orbs, re-combined while hovering over my tent, and rose into the aspens as daylight broke.  the passage of time from the appearance until dawn (roughly 06:30 mountain time) felt as though it had been accelerated.  in other words, my biological clock did not account for the 3+ hours that passed during the event.  i did not fall asleep during the event.  the lights came within arm's reach of my tent door, but did not enter the tent/rainfly vestibule.\r\n\r\nfull account:\r\n\r\nnotes:  \r\n\r\n1. i made camp that night with a rain fly over my tent.  \r\n2. all that can be perceived on the inside of the tent is diffused light and shadows.  \r\n3. the tent was an rei halfdome 2 with the orange rainfly.  \r\n4. when approaching the campground from the south, it's accessed via a right turn off the road.\r\n5. my campsite was the penultimate site on the strip/loop (to the right upon entering the campground), the most isolated, and the furthest into the forest.\r\n\r\ni was awakened by light diffusing through my tent fly.  at first, i believed this was the result of a very bright moonrise or the breaking of dawn.  i turned on my gps device to check the time (phone was charging on motorcycle); the time displayed was 03:19.  it was far too early for dawn, and moonlight isn't this bright.  \r\n\r\nslightly alarmed, i reclined with my eyes open and began to rationalize what the source of the light might be.  i told myself i believed the light to be that of a nfs ranger performing nightly rounds.  as i watched the light move in a circular pattern around my tent (estimated some 20 yards away, i noted a few things:\r\n\r\n1. the light moved slowly and steadily as though hovering on a stationary plain.\r\n2. the light didn't move like a flashlight or headlamp operated by a human — the motion was too smooth, too perfect.\r\n3. there were no footsteps associated with the light's movement.\r\n4. there was no other sound associated with the light's movement.\r\n5. the light was a cool blue/white — white at the center with a blue aura.\r\n\r\nunable to sleep, i watched as this light split/manifested a twin.  they continued to circle my tent (between foot and hip level), occasionally approaching from behind and from the side before withdrawing and continuing their silent \"march.\"  at one point, one of the lights came close enough my tent that its brilliance shone up underneath the fly.\r\n\r\nthis was the first and only direct observation of their radiance without obfuscation by the tent fly.  \r\n\r\nat this point, there was no more kidding myself: these things were real, wholly other, and i was terrified.  my only recourse was to pray silently while watching the event unfold.  i uttered no sound, sat motionless and upright in my sleeping bag, and watched as the energies moved about.  \r\n\r\nnear the end of the event, one of the floating lights hovered directly above my tent and remained there for some time.  as day broke, it moved off/ascended into the aspens, re-combined with the other, and dimmed until it was no longer visible.  un-nerved, exhausted, yet unable to return to sleep, i arose, took care of the morning necessities, and began preparing breakfast.  \r\n\r\ni felt a deep need to discuss what i experienced.  when a fellow camper (some 50-70 yards away) began stirring, i approached him.  i must have appeared visibly shaken because the look on his face was that of concern.  \r\n\r\nwithout volunteering anything specific, i simply asked him if he slept well and if he noticed anything during the dark hours.  his response was validating, but disturbing.  he said, \"i saw lights near your tent . . . but didn't think much of it.\"  \r\n\r\nat that time, i told him everything.  his conclusion was that i was being \"scanned,\" but i can't know that for sure.  he clearly believed in the other-ness of my experience.  \r\n\r\npersonal conclusions:\r\n\r\n1. these weren't solid objects because as the two interacted, they would've cast shadows of each other.\r\n2. these objects originated from the wooded areas behind my tent because they cast distinct tree-trunk shadows while on initial approach.\r\n3. these objects were utterly silent and so couldn't have been drones in the recreational sense.\r\n4. these objects moved with such slow, methodical refinement that they couldn't have been drones in the recreational sense, nor could they have been mounted on humans (e.G., a flashlight or headlamp).\r\n5. these objects were definitely interested in me.  the focus of their movement was my location and that didn't change throughout the entire encounter.\r\n6. my prayers had no effect on their movement or position.  in fact, as i prayed for them to leave, they drew nearer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"20

veteran of 20 years military service and my wife were about to go inside after lighting fireworks for the kids. it was windy and we were in front of the garage and when    i started to pick up the trash i noticed 4 lights in the sky behind the mountains by tramway.\r\n\r\nwhen i noticed the lights they some were moving around slow and some were just hovering. we could not see all of the lights due to them being over the mountain. some of the lights started moving fast and some slow or still hovering. i remember reading a post on mufon on the same date of ufos in the sky in new mexico. \r\n\r\nat first i thought it was a search light but it wasn't.\r\n\r\nthey formed the shape of a line like coming down the mountain.  the one that was on the lead turned its light off and the second one took the lead and the fourth one lit up.  then you had all four lights on.  \r\nthen they formed into a square and formed back into line.  \r\n\r\nwe weren't able to tell the full shape due to the bright lights.\r\n\r\ni ran into the house and grabbed my camera but unfortunately they moved and i could see even less of them and due to the fact that i would have to have had climbed on my roof to see them i was only able to get two shots. and because of the movement i wasn't able to get good focus on them.\r\nthe worst part is that i have a bright street light just in front of me so i wasn't able to get the shots that i would have liked. \r\nso no video, but please look closely at the two pictures.\r\n

saturday, september 1, 2017, on our farm, we had what we believe were altostratus clouds overhead around noon, but it was mostly clear, hot sunny day...  they typically range in altitude between 6000 and 20000 feet (thats nearly 4 miles up). the wife and i were doing our normal yard work.  i was driving my small tractor across an open space, and happened to look up, saw this white dot in the sky which was not something i normally see.  \r\n\r\nthis object was in and out of the clouds. it was like a traditional shaped parachute with nothing hanging from it...  we watched it for a few minutes then i went and got the camera, our binoculars, and later my small telescope.  it was not any aircraft that i am familiar with, (i am a plane buff of sorts) nor was it a hot air balloon which we thought of also, it was not descending or ascending at all, drifting slowly eastward, no visible payload of any kind, and these three struts that went from a central hub to three points on the edges of the circle.  with the telescope you could see that these were horizontal, not hanging down beneath the dome.  we watched this \"float\" over our farm property for almost 30 minutes, after which it disappeared above the clouds, drifting eastward.  \r\n\r\ni have noted that someone in a community in quebec also saw something very similar on the same day and have reported it here on mufon, just later in the afternoon or early evening, i am convinced they are describing the same object. they said they saw the struts like a peace sign, i would say  you could trace an equilateral triangle over the ends of the lines, so not quite like a peace sign.  i have pictures and shaky video, which i am sharing.\r\n\r\nwe are about 250km west from those folks in quebec, on the north side of algonquin park, in a nearly parallel latitude.  we also observed normal commercial aircraft in the same general airspace several times during the experience.  they did not appear to react to the object, no change of course, etc.\r\n\r\nwe figured this is some sort of high altitude weather device, have reached out to environment canada and are awaiting a response.  we were a little excited about the experience, especially today, noting that someone else saw it too.  we are semi-skeptical about ufos, but not ruling it out.","distance":"Over One

second day disappeared. did not see anything in this guy or in the area immediately after. it was as if it had never been there. it completely vanished it did not fade away or disintegrate. it was as if it just disappeared as if zapped away. the speed in which this ufo traveled was very very fast we could barely keep up with it and it appeared out of nowhere. when it first appeared it went up and then down and then up and then down. then immediately zipped from west to east so fast it was almost like a flash and it was very bright. have never seen anything like it, and i have never seen anything before as far as ufos go. so glad my boyfriend witnessed this also, we both just were in complete shock. we both cannot figure out what we saw. we don't know what it was but we know what it wasn't, it definitely wasn't a flare, an airplane, a jet, a helicopter, a drone or a shooting star, or a firework, or a reflection or street lights, car lights, swamp gas lol, whether this was natural

crossing of s eads street and 20th street s (38.855640, -77.053176) between two large buildings. at approximately 00:56 est we observed a large fireball or flash rapidly move east to west between in the northern horizon. note we were facing north as we observed the object moving east to west. if facing north from out vantage point it would have been at a 45 degree angle in the sky and close enough to where it looked as if it flew over the george washington memorial highway, approximately .4 to .5 miles from our location. note, this is in the flight path of the dca ronald reagan national airport, however checking flight records there were no arrival or departure flights during the time period of the sighting. furthermore, this would have been directly over the air port and we would suspect it would be normal to not see aircraft from our vantage point as this was in direct path of the airport and craft would be taking off and landing from fields of view not within our sight path. also the object was so bright it illuminated the buildings and ground that were around us, where a plane light would have not provided sufficient illumination. no noise was heard coming from the object either, it was a very quiet night, even for the relatively busy area we were in, and no air craft noise or anything else affiliated with the craft could be heard. using basic trigonometry with estimations for the angle of object (tangent) and perceived distance (adjacent) i would estimate the object was approximately 4,000 feet in the air (2,500 * tan(45) = height). in summary, i observed an unusually bright large blue/green rapidly moving fireball in the northern horizon above the george washington memorial highway/dca reagan airport moving east to west at approximately 4,000 feet. i believe an obvious explanation for the sighting would likely include a fireball meteor event, however after observing multiple examples from youtube of meteors and fireballs each of these have a significant trail and are very high in the sky and rapidly fizzle out. this object was not fizzling out and was cruising along with a minimal haze or trail (i hesitate to say there was a trail) behind the object and was very low. i do realize the southern taurids meteor shower is technical active during the time period of the sighting, but it is not at it's height of activity until october. i was
