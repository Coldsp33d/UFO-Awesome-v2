look into the night sky, as i usually do to observe the stars and look for satellites, or burning space deprie/meteors.  when i just happened to observe; very very faintly, the outline of a very large \"v\" (triangular) shaped object gliding across the southern part of the skyline in calgary. it appeared to be cloaked and hidden with \"no lights\". was dark in colour and was barely visible. but due to the glow of the cities street lights, it lit up the underbelly by silhouetting their shape out in the sky above. if i had to take my eyes off the object, i believe that i would not be able to find it again in the sky. it was that well camouflaged.  i was very excited and said jokingly to myself \"\"i can see you bastards\"\" i called out to my wife to come out to show her, but she laughed it off like she had better things to be doing. typical... this craft made no sound at all and glided across the sky in a matter of maybe two minutes. at an altitude of approx 10'000 feet or higher. it came from the very east, across the southern part of the sky to the west.  the craft then headed from a bearing of 270 deg. to a bearing of approx 220 deg. ssw until it was out of sight. i know this is an old sighting but i feel it may still have merit or meaning to some, and that this object was flying over a major city at in alberta, canada. at night with absolutely no lights and silent. across the entire night sky ....  sadly i would not have been able to record this as it was far too dark and the object faint. i would need special equipment to have been able to capture this. and again was not expecting this and was not really prepared. all i could was observe...","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

thought to be an airplane reflecting light. the object was moving towards me , and as it came closer i noted that it was spinning and shaped like a boomerang. the object would intermittently reflect light as it spun. it appeared to have a reflective side and a dull side. the dull side appeared to have an off white color. there were no clouds in the sky and the sun was shining. i pulled over at the next available area, and began filming the object as best i could. by this time, no more than 2 - 3 minutes after my initial sighting, the object had moved much farther away, but was still visible with the naked eye. it was still reflecting light, which made it easier to locate by eye. as it disappeared from my field of vision, i stopped recording. \r\n\r\nupon returning home, i began to review the footage i had captured. in the video, i zoomed in to get a better look at the object. it is difficult to make out the shape and motion of the object, but at maximum zoom, you can make out the boomerang shape, the circular motion, and the intermittent flashing. i then proceeded to adjust the filter of the video in an attempt to get a better image of the object , and was astonished to find a circular formation of approximately 10-14 white orbs in the direction that the boomerang object was headed. i can only approximate the number of orbs due to the varying luminosity on video. i did not notice the formation of orbs with my naked eye, and they were only an incedental finding upon review of the footage i had captured.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

had just dropped off my son's girlfriend and was leaving her house. i got to the stop sign and was looking left, no cars, looked right, no cars, i looked back to the left and noticed a dark object floating at my 11:00 position. i sat at the stop sign a minute, kind of dazed and wondering what the heck was i looking at. the object was dark and i could only make out the outline of it's shape when i saw the red lights on either side (left and right) blink. it looked like a football field size and was really low to the ground. i also noticed a white light blinking on the top and bottom of what i was seeing. i was thinking that whatever it was would surely crash so i turned onto the route and continued to watch it. i turned off the radio in the car and rolled down the windows, i couldn't hear any engines. nothing. i was on a \"country\" road so there were not other cars at the time to interfere sound or sight wise. i pulled over and watched it slowly float towards the south-west and i still could not hear any noise coming from it. i had to get home so i started to drive again but i kept looking over at it (it was to my left side). i was totally mesmerized. i could not figure out what i was looking at. i thought maybe a glider? but at night and so incredibly large?? i thought it was bigger than a small plane (like a 6 passenger craft) but i thought it was smaller than the size of a 747. i was completely captivated by this object and i continued to look over at the craft as i was driving. i was so \"drawn\" to look at it. i cannot explain how strange i felt looking at it but i didn't want to look away. i did not even think to try and record a video or take a picture with my cell phone but i am not sure anything would show up except the blinking red lights or white lights. i thought this might be a military aircraft of some sort? i got home and immediately told my teenage boys and they said \"cool, probably a plane\". no i don't think a plane would be silent when that low to the ground. i saw my mom the next day and told her that i have no idea what it might be and she suggested a blimp possibly. i think that might be what it was but it was just so much larger than any blimp i have ever seen. i tried google for images of blimps but none look like what i observed. anyway, i have seen satellite's glide across their arc above my backyard, i love to stargaze; i get a text message anytime the international space station is going to be visible to my area so i can go wave hello; i love meteor showers and i am fascinated by space. i truly believe that we are not alone in the vast expanse that is out there...I cannot say if i saw an alien craft. i definitely saw something awesome that i cannot identify. i really thought long and hard about should i reach out to report this...I guess i don't really want anyone to get back to me with \"oh that is a new weather balloon\". i guess i like the idea that i witnessed something amazing and unexplained. thank you

august-september as the crops were down, and the morning air was 50-60 degrees f. no wind. i remember being a bit uncomfortable in shorts. saturday. i was riding my bike down 1050 n heading west toward us 31 on a return journey. i noticed what looked exactly like a blimp in everyway minus undercarriage, rudders, or logos. so, only the \"balloon\" part of a blimp. it was massive, chrome, reflected light with a bright glare coming from its right side, it was, seemingly, directly above my neighbor's home on the corner of old us 31 and 1050 n about 1500 ground feet away. can't judge the altitude, could have been collasal up high or large down lower. the ends were facing sw to ne from \"left to right.\" the sky was completely clear blue, not even sparse little clouds. the moon was still visible. i watched the object with fascination, drinking it in thinking it was a blimp, as i had never seen a blimp before. i watched it for what felt like forever to see it move so i could make a guess as to where it may be heading, but sat motionless. i never saw the thing move an inch. the glare only changed in respect to my movement, if that makes sense. i took my eyes off the object for a few moments (less than a minute) as i was approaching my home. when i looked back, the object had completely vanished. i did not hear a noise, i did not see it in the horizon, i did not see it vanish. i took no turns and i was surrounded by open, empty indiana fields with nothing that could obstruct my view. again, no clouds (do blimps go high enough for clouds?). living another 10 years at this home, i never saw a real blimp or this blimp-like object again. nor am i aware of a reason why a blimp would be in textbook \"nowhere, indiana,\" or, if it was a blimp, how it could disappear from view so quickly when it was close enough for me to see some details in the metal of the craft. it is also worth mentioning that i would have noticed the object when i departed home and i was only allowed less than a mile down the road so i should have seen the craft's approach, if it was a blimp. talking with my him years later, my father reported seeing the same object (though he described it as cigar shaped) much closer outside our same house. unclear when he saw it; he's passed now. he was able to see window-like holes and described \"circut board\" like inlays in the metal work. unfortunately, i have no pictures, but look up the \"goodyear blimp\" and remove all passenger carriage, rudders, and logos. that's the best description of this object. at a proxity of a blimp above a major sporting event. finally, to add a less tangible element to the story, it was highly irregular for me to get up that early on a saturday, my parents hadn't been up yet, i was generally restless, and wanted to get out of the house. it was an odd morning mentally, this, combined with seeing the object, has created a very vivid flashbulb memory of this morning.

strange object. it seemed to be pretty far up in the sky,  but still close enough to see multicolored lights flashing in a pattern around the object.  it appeared to be disc/saucer shaped by the light pattern.   it sped  across the sky too quickly to be an airplane, changing directions abruptly. then it would stop and hover.  when it hovered, the colored lights would stop and a large bright white light would shine out. it did not create a beam, just a bright light in the sky.  this bright light would standstill for maybe 10 to 20 seconds, then it would turn off and the flashing colored lights would come on and it would zip across the sky in various directions.  this whole event lasted somewhere between 5-10 minutes. it just disappeared or zipped away.   \r\n  i called down at the police

around the same time. i counted about 7 helicopters in the silver lake area. i jumped on the 101 hollywood freeway and transitioned onto the 110 north freeway.At this point i could see all the helicopters behind me hovering around the hollywood area. as i approached the area around dodger stadium i looked up and saw these bright lights flashing green blue and red . it was in the shape of a huge cone. i kept looking at it thinking maybe it was something to do with an event at the stadium. the only problem was there was no events going on and the light were not on the hill. as i drove by it i found myself under it. the lights were about 75 feet off the ground. they seem to be floating by themselves, no object. i could see the night sky. then they just turned off.Nothing took off or made a noise. they were clearly over the freeway.Not on the hill. there is a few videos on youtube and a few pictures on facebook floating around. i can get links and send them to you if needed. the lights also happened on 9/11 around the same time according to these video sources.The video shows the lights in a circle like if they are farris wheel. when i saw them they were in the shape of a cone. when i drove under them they were in a shape of a cone as well. i will attach a picture someone took. this is what i saw. i shouldve taken video and pictures but when you finally see one all i could think was oh lord, they are real and just let it all sink in. no one is covering this. there is hundreds of witnesses.
