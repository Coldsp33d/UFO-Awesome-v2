confused. i get out of the car to check around the street to see if a car drove by, or if anyone was around with a flashlight or anything, because thats what i thought it couldve been, but it seemed as though someone or something didnt want me to see it. mind you its 4:30, so i go inside and replay the video to just make sure if i was just hallucinating or something. the object literally appeared in the middle of my back left window, shining and looking like it was either hovering across the car or descending to the ground, but after it left sight of my window and camera it disappeared, youd have to see for yourself. im just curious to see what it actually is, i searched around the car after it happened and i saw nothing. i just have one question and that would be to please inform me about any research that gets done. i'd honestly love to be a part of the process so if that isn't possible i would like to get informed theough everything please. i hope you guys find out or know what

have been looking forward to looking up the night sky to see if i could catch any unusual activity. we went for a walk and our dog took us to his favorite spot, a beach down the road. i thought it was genius of him. it was perfect. like clockwork, shortly after we laid down on the sand and i started looking at the sky, i saw without a doubt, something in the heavens that could only be explained as something strait out of science fiction. \r\n\r\na satellite looking (star looking) object that was pulsating brightly was chasing away another vehicle that was reddish brown and faint. the pulsating vehicle was ejecting a beam at intervals that looked like a dashed line in a curve towards the fleeing vehicle but not directly at it. it looked like it was shooting across the other vehicles bow. there were 2-3 ejected dashed line beams that were strangely identical to one another. the direction of both vehicles was not in a straight line and were completely un-ordinary. after approximately 10 seconds of this pursuit at the location of the glowing reddish-brown object, a streak of light appeared to shoot downward and the reddish-brown object was gone. after the reddish-brown object disappeared, the pulsating star looking object stopped pulsating and changed trajectory slowly. i lost sight of this star looking object shortly after that. \r\n\r\nthis was in space. the objects looked to be in orbit like satellites.\r\n\r\nwas this an extra-terrestrial civilization chasing away another? does earth have et's protecting us from other civilizations whom may violate our

resort and spa in weston, florida.  at appoximately 7:00 p.M. eastern time, we were notified of a tornado warning for our area, as we were going through a heavy outer band of the storm.\r\n\r\ni stepped onto our balcony to search the skies for threatening weather.  looking to the north, i saw a lower cloud deck, approximately 500 feet and an upper cloud deck at approximately 2000 feet, both moving a slightly different speeds.  winds were gusting over 60 mph at the time.\r\n\r\nthen coming from behind a cloud, i noticed a black boomerang shaped object that was between the upper and lower cloud decks, moving in a straight line from south to north.  it's speed seemed constant and not consistent with the speed of the clouds.   at the time all local airports were closed, and hurricane hunter airplanes are not allowed to fly over populated areas during a storm, and it was much lower than any aircraft that would have been flying over.\r\n\r\nthe was the first time i had ever seen something i could not explain in the skies in the light of day, i had occasionally seen strange lights in the skies in my life, but this was during the light of the evening and so clear that it gave me a chill.\r\n\r\ni continued to watch the object for approximately 45 seconds to a minute when it was overcome by moving clouds and i lost sight of it.","distance":"Over One
