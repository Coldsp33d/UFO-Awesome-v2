States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was at my old house (i just moved three days ago) setting up my cameras and tripod facing south in the sky. i was preparing for my fifth skywatch that evening of september 4th, 2017 at 12:34 am. since i was have been seeing this blinking orb (what looked like to my naked eyes) i got my best camera with a night time setting to capture the object. \r\n\r\ni first noticed the object four nights ago. it has been moving and hovering around the same section in the sky for the past few nights and i finally got the chance to see what it was. \r\n\r\nat first, i thought this object was a star, but it was moving too quickly and blinking/flashing rapidly. until i finally got a closer look.\r\n\r\nall it was doing was stopping at times, then moving to the right. it was not a straight line either. it would occasionally, as it moved to the right, move a little upward or downward. it did this for two hours straight, i recorded it for 33 minutes with my cannon camera. \r\n\r\ni felt no fear. if anything i was rather excited to see this. i was filled with shock and awe looking at it move across the screen of the camera. at times i could feel my body vibrating and burning from the inside. a warm feeling throughout the whole body. a bit of adrenaline, heart racing. \r\n\r\ni even actually lost sight of the object when i started to grow paranoid being outside by myself with no other people. i did not know why, but after i felt this i packed my gear and headed inside to view the results. i write times and such in a record in my skywatch sessions. i will paste my written session below. \r\n\r\nday five of skywatching. \r\ntimes set during skywatch - 12 am  through 1 am \r\nfriday, september 4th, 2017\r\nlocation - colorado springs my backyard\r\n\r\n12:34 am\r\ngoing out now. i'm bored and cannot sleep. i was outside earlier and spotted a big blue, moving orb above my house. might as well do a skywatch tonight.\r\n\r\n12:39 am\r\njust set up, spotted blinky in the same sections of the sky the previous night. i'm naming the orb blinky.\r\n\r\n12:58 am\r\nfilmed blinky. it moved behind the tree though. it's in the usual spot, circling the sky miles away from my house. maybe just one mile. the burning feeling is back. everything went silent. i can hear the street cleaners. or this wubbing noise. freaked me out for a second there. it's pretty loud. feeling allot of adrenaline pumping through me. i feel dizzy, hearts racing for some odd reason. i'm not afraid though that's the thing. i hear this machine hum in the sky above me.\r\n\r\nsomeone said \"film\" and it was not me. i feel calm suddenly after that voice.\r\n\r\nblinky moved from behind the tree.\r\n\r\n1:14 am.\r\nfilming again, but i switched cameras. my video camera can pick up many flashing lights after i zoomed in in my video editor. all i do is crop it and i see the flashing lights. i cannot wait to see the picture/video results later.\r\n\r\n3 minutes in of recording.\r\n\r\nwe have some visible to my human eyes blinking flashing again. hmm...\r\n\r\n1:41 am\r\nstill stalking blinky. i got good footage of them. still moving. i'm going to head inside now.\r\n\r\n1:49 am\r\ni'm inside now. i feel pretty joyful tonite. let's take a gander at the results. ","distance":"21-100

and a feeling of gently swaying sensation left to right as i lay in bed. i could feel the swaying pressure going from left to right side of body switching from left to right ears like i was floating on a big wave ever so gently. slight head fog this is the best i can describe the feeling. it was a feeling of slight pressure building in my head like when your driving up to the mountains and your ears start to feel clogged from the high altitude. i got up cause i wanted to see the sunrise as i often do. i could see the sun rise in the east and the moon was high in the south western sky. it was clear sky with some chem trails here and there but mostly very clear. i was filming the sunrise swtiching back and forth from the sunrise to the moon. then i started taking pictures of the moon as some birds were flying by i got some great shots of the birds flying near the moon. when i got into my vehicle to drive home i felt like i was in a slight drunk like state but did not consume alcohol, very slightly light headed and very slightly dizzy but not enough to stumble or stagger when walking to my vehicle but had to force myself to be extra alert when driving. i noticed the object in my picture once i downloaded it into my computer. i thought it was a bird, then a plane or something so i zoomed in and it does not look like anything i ever saw before. appears to be black on color with what looks to be a light of hole in middle but more to the right than the left of the object. i removed the color from the picture played around with the contrast, highlights, exposure etc and there is an object under the moon between the 5 & 6 o'clock position. it could be a drone i just never seen a drone like tis before. i though it would be interesting to share. the object was not noticeable when i was taking pictures i saw nothing when i was looking in the direction of the moon. i did feel a slight drugged like feeling a light headed like slight cloggyness in head area werd feeling. i am trying my best to describe the feeling. maybe its the atmosphere and climatic changes, and magnetic field or gravitational pull that's doing something to make me feel this way. who knows anaylize picture maybe its something maybe not. thanks","distance":"Over One

looked like it was made of etheric yet brilliant transparent white light, and it was very complex in structure.  it reminded me of an upside down chandelier the size of a football, and it was undulating fluidly and gracefully in four dimensions (at least), all the while maintaining a very formidable material and architectural integrity.  in other words, it danced organically with a structural logic that was incredibly complex.  though i had no background in geometry nor interest in multi-dumensionality at the time, i understood then that what i was seeing existed in four or more dimensions.\r\n\r\ni was scared and turned on my bedroom lights, thinking it would go away like a bad dream.  it didn't.  it still emitted the same light and moved alongside the wall at the same pace.\r\n\r\nsomehow i knew without thinking that its size appearance was small and big at the same time.  it looked small.  i also knew that it was also big as a football field, or maybe even a city block.  and inside it was occupied by beings who were observing me as well, like a tour bus.  they were intelligent and seemed clinically dispassionate.  they might have been forty or a hundred beings aboard this light vehicle.  i actually didn't see who was occupying the ufo.  i sensed them in a knowing way, like telepathy or exact and precise intuition.\r\n\r\nthough i was frightened by what seemed like their cold objectivity, i didn't feel threatened.  if i recall, this visit was accompanied by a high pitched hum, almost beyond normal everyday human hearing.\r\n\r\nafter i turned the bedroom light on and watched it continue its slow path, i think i ducked under the covers as it came close to the corner of my bedroom.  i think i was still a child or preteen when this happened.  i thought about running to my parents room, but that would mean nearly going under them, and i was too scared and transfixed to do that.\r\n\r\nthe ufo was one of the most beautiful (and perhaps spiritual) things i've ever seen in my life.  unfortunately i can't draw it.  it was too complex and beautiful, and i still haven't seen anything like it.  maybe it's more like a mathematical formula or quantum equation or cosmic symphony instrument.\r\n\r\ni recently watched the restored anniversary version of close encounters of the third kind, and i felt like crying.  because i was reminded that space, even here on earth, is probably densely inhabited by many unseen beings and things.  we're just too arrogant most of the time to acknowledge that we are just part of a whole.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface, Other, Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
