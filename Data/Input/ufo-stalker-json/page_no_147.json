henderson, nv. i was facing south, looking onto the horizon of the city of boulder, nv. my camera has a slight elevation, and could see with the range of elevation from o degrees to about 65 degrees.\r\n\r\ni never saw the object until i was editing my photographs. the object is a triangle shape and appears to have a head light. the craft is all lit up in ultra violet color. the craft blended well with the black clouds. i do wear glasses, but mainly for driving, so i didn't spot it. i was not wearing them photographing these images. \r\n\r\n\r\ni will show both original photo and than lighten photos. plus a close up photo and the next photo in line. \r\n\r\ni shoot a lot of night work, so i know how airplanes leave a trace when the shutter is open for long periods of time. my settings were as follows. using a dslr sony a350, iso 100, manual focus,  f8, 300mm lens, and a 25 second  long time exposure and a sturdy tripod used. i used the same time exposure for most of my images. none others showed this image. this object left no trails of light as most airplanes would. \r\n\r\ni really don't understand even getting a image on film unless this object was hoovering, or darted in and out of the clouds. but even at that idea, it would have to hold its location for it to appear on my image sensor. the craft appears to have no forward motion. although a light appears to be shinning from its nose. of if the ultra violet light was on and off, that would explain, me not detecting it. or if the ultra violet light was only one for a brief second. i have no idea how long a ultra violet light would take to get on sensor in a camera. how fast does ultra violet light waves run compared to a lightening strike. \r\n\r\nstrong note, the las vegas airport is west of my location, about 3.5 miles. and yes there was traffic in the area. but all left a light travel trail trace on my other images. this ufo left none. \r\n\r\ni feel like each time i am going out, and shooting jets, or orbs, or lightening storms, some how i capture some thing else. on may 15, 2017, i capture 10 images of of a solid bright light, having downward direction coming from out of cloud bank. while photographing jet aircraft. here is the link. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=tx4xtjz39h0\r\n\r\nfor general information, 75 percent of the aircraft landed,, and i was waiting for the rest to return. so i kept a good eye, heading south, on las vegas blvd, at gate 6 of las vegas motor speedway. when i noticed this object come out from behind the clouds. it was hard to pick up, in my view finder but i just shot 10 images in a row and got lucky.  i have reported it on this site as well.\r\n\r\nmy last remarks, this may sound stupid. but if this is a ufo, are the aliens, watching me as i watch them? this is very rare to capture two events in less than 4 months. if that is a airplane,, great some one tell me what it is.. i am open. \r\n","distance":"Over One

too dark. i was standing in front of my new house in a saburban neiborhood while i was doing this. \r\n\r\ni was putting my dirty window rags in this trashbag i had out next to the car on the sidewalk, and i looked up north east of my location to see three regular airplains flying by, but then there was a forth one... the forth one was...Different from the others.  \r\n\r\nat first i thought this golden glowing object was merely another airplane passing by since i am now living near an airport. but i was wrong. \r\n\r\nthe object was disk shapped, the golden lights were at the bottom in a disk shaped curve. there was an extra golden orb flashing on the left side of the object. it was slowly moving, slower than the other three plains flying around it at a distance. it was pretty low, around tree top height. i spotted this around a block away across the road going down the neiborhood above one of the houses. it stopped for a moment. i grew curious, now seeing that this was not a normal aircraft on earth. i spoke to it out load, for some reason i felt that this was listening and wathcing me as creepy as it sounds.\r\n\r\n\"alright b-ch, i see you and i am not afraid. if you are paranormal then prove it!\"\r\n\r\nall of the sudden, it moved to the left instead of the right! then it moved back the the right and comenced to move side to side at a fast rate. \r\n\r\ni was feeling pumped, stimulated and exited. there was no fear in what i was seeing at all. looking at it was familiar for some reason. with exitment i ran inside my house to get my mom since she has also seen ufo's many times. after i told her (which lasted five seconds) i ran back out before her and it was gone! just disapeared without a trace. it made me sad, i wanted to take a picture but of course i had no camera to do so.

stop sign and i saw what i thought was a balloon next to the sun. since my galaxy 6s has a pro mode, and i am a photographer, i set the aperture for infinity, iso at 50 and shutter speed at 1/24,000 of a sec, no flash and took the picture.\r\nwhat you see in the picture is exactly what i saw when i took it. i only noticed the black triangle after i got home and was looking at the shot....The \"balloon\" turned out to be a possible planet when i blew it up in size...The sun appears to be reflecting off of a white v shaped mass (i have seen it one time since and it was from a yt video, but it matches what i shot exactly), land masses and possibly oceans...\r\nthe fuscia seems to be common trait with the tr-3b whenever they fire up the drive...This is primarily based on what i have seen on yt, so i take that with a grain of salt.\r\ni have taken several shots since then, and if i use a red filter i get a reddish ball behind the sun now, and it is moving like it's in orbit by the way it is advancing.\r\nwould love some answers to what i shot...\r\nthank

at that time, the object slowly started accelerating upward and then disappeared all of a sudden . the object hovered roughly around 10,000 feet, or maybe a little less. basically, it was the same altitude that a small aircraft would fly , i did use my compass on my cell phone to roughly get its position for the back to my house from where i was standing, and it was 83 degrees east , as the object tried to maintain a fixed position is still wobbled slightly back and forth trying to do so , i tried taking several photographs of the object with my cell phone and one photograph when i go to enlarge it on my cell phone. it almost looks like there are three windows on the craft and a slight outline of the craft . this is not the first time that i spotted this craft in the air. there were three other occasions that i spotted the same object over a three-month period , the first time i got up in the middle of night to go to the bathroom and i spotted the object out in the distance from my bedroom window , and because it was far away . i just thought it was a star or maybe a satellite, reflecting in the night sky and then about a week and a half later i spotted the same object, but this time it kept changing colors, radically back and forth. so at that time i had no idea what to make of it ? and ever since then when i get up at night to use the bathroom. i keep looking out the window to see if i can spot the same object again , and about three weeks later it was there again, but it was still too far away to see exactly what was and then on september 7, 2017, which was early this morning. the object was in the sky. once again but this time it was real low and was very close, so i got my shoes on and when outside to take some photographs of it, and to watch it and then at 5:03 am when i just started breaking dawn is started moving away at a slow acceleration and then all of a sudden it just took off and there is nothing that i know of that could accelerate like with this object did , in that split-second it reminded me of what you see in a star trek movie when the enterprise takes off. this is the only way i can explain the sudden acceleration of this object . i am hoping that this object comes back again . thank you","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"01:18:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

all the time we are looking and talking about it which was about 3 minutes i just had this feeling it was there to seem it had its place, but it really wasn't a part of that building. my son walked into the apartment and i went to find my binoculars that i always keeps close by . not more than 30 seconds to a minute had passed \" i didn't see my binoculars which i usually have 10 feet from my balcony and went back out to study that orb although  disappointed i couldn't readily find my binoculars to get a much better look and that orb had  just vanished. i yelled to my son the orb was gone and he looked and said wow, it is gone. i said that i believe in ufo's and life outside our planet and went on to say that white orb was one of the reasons why i am a believer. the thought of ufo's and life outside our planet doesn't scare me at all . i , like many others , just want to be able to explain the unexplainable. the very next night around 12 to 1am , i had my blinds wide open and i was looking out at the n.W sky and i see this beautiful blue light beam for about 3-5 seconds. i don't know why , but i could tell it was at an angle and just knew it was beamed from sky to ground not ground to air !!! i've seen white search lights used in the city before for special occasions but this light was an off shoot of blue and was beautiful but again, the beam was sky to ground and lasted no more than 5 seconds. i told my son who was in another part of the apartment and he just laughed. i explained how fast but awesome the beam was and how it came and went and said it seemed like what we are told happens when a soul is raptured. i wanted to tell someone who  specializes in such matters but didn't know who to share this with . i can remember in detail a year later the areas and experience like it were yesterday. i'm glad i heard about you so i could share this !

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"\r\nhurricane harvey was occurring the evening of august 25th, 2017. the power was off, the winds were hitting the west side of our house, we were hot due to no air conditioning, so we opened our living room windows and front door, east side of our house...There was no rain or high winds coming inside from this east side. all we could do was sit and ride out the hurricane...We sat and watched the neighbors pecan tree bending and whipping in the high winds and gust.  around 1:30am or so, as we sat in the dark of our living room watching the storm increase in intensity, all the sudden i heard a very deep hum. i started to say 'what is that deep humming noise?' at that same moment, appearing before my eyes was an object descending down to the middle of our vacant street. it appeared almost as wide as the street as best i could tell being dark and storming outside. in spite of the tremendous winds and rain roaring outside, i heard this hum. i thought at first i was seeing a tow truck or something, but that made no sense for it was the wrong shape and lighting. this object appeared round, flattish, one red light on top which turned into multiple red lights, an led glowing white type light that encircled the entire circumference of this craft. as the craft descended to ground level, it slowly began moving to our right. as it moved right, the white circumference light appeared to starburst like, glow into a flash, it's a bit hard to describe...A brilliant flash. i immediately began looking thru our front door expecting to see something. i saw the leading[?] edge of this thing as it flashed a brilliant white light, then i saw what looked like sparklers set off....A roman candle/firework type display. i guess as this thing was disappearing in the manner it left, it shot out sparks. the sparks were rectangle, brilliant white edged in brilliant gold and curly cued.  all i could think at this point was 'those sparks are on the far side and near side of that utility pole, i hope it doesn't catch fire'.  funny, since it was storming outside. the sparks appeared to shoot up and away from the brilliant white light then gently fall, twisting as they fell....Like very delicate confetti...It was quite beautiful! i truly believe this was an emission of some type as this thing disappeared. this craft simply disappeared before our eyes almost as fast as it appeared. the craft did not appear to be affected in any way by the high hurricane force winds and high wind gust occurring. i have seen several things 'unexplained' during my 60 years of life. in my back yard too, about 21 or 22 years ago, my husband witnessed this also. i have always been skeptical of people saying they see multi-color lights on these things, though being a believer myself. but i now believe in the multi light theory too, because this thing had what appeared one red light on top then it multiplied into several red lights. there was nothing in that street after the intense flash, no vehicle of any kind. i sat bewildered, as my husband. my brain was desperately trying to grab what i was seeing and make sense of it...But it couldn't, because it's not something i recognized. we have no trees in our front yard, our view was unencumbered. as fearful as i was sitting through this horrible hurricane, i remained intrigued by what we had just witnessed. my husband did not see the detail i did. he was not looking in that direction at that moment, and it did not last long.  but he did indeed see the flash of the circle light. thank you for reading this. it is true.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"A good friend of mine and i in falls church va were giving a christmas party at his house and he and i stepped outside to get some fresh air.  i happened to look at my watch as i was coming into the back yard and noticed that it was a few minutes to midnight.  it was christmas eve, 1989. both of us were in his back yard alone and for no particular reason i looked above to glance at the stars, looking somewhat north, and immediately saw a large craft over our heads very close. it seemed to be approximately no more than 40 feet long, but that was an estimate and very low to the ground because we could see details. it was very close to us.  it moved quite slowly at what seemed to be a walking pace, and did not make a sound. it came from the east and moved towards the west towards route 66 in falls church va which goes into washington dc.  falls church is only a few miles from washington dc in northern virginia. the craft was white / silver in color.  at the end of it, was a large black hole in the fuselage but there was no smoke or flames.  on the far outside edges of the hole were 4 very bright white lights.  the shape of the fuselage narrowed to a blunt point in the front and the 4 lights were so bright that they illuminated the bottom of the craft almost fully up to the front of the blunt nose which was largely dark.  the sky was very light because his house is right next to route 66 where there are highway lights that tend to light up the sky so we could see the craft very well.  on either side of the fuselage were 2 wings of the same white / silver color which were almost perfect isosceles triangles and large compared to the size of the main body. there were no markings or other color at all. no signs of lines, rivets, or any irregular shapes on the entire craft as if it were all one solid piece. as the craft moved slowly towards route 66, it banked to the right slightly and began to move to the right still going over the highway and eventually the sight of it was lost behind trees in his back yard. before we lost sight of it, we could see more plainly that there was a top fin that came to the back of the fuselage where the large hole was which we did not notice before.  the wings on the side came up almost to the front of the blunt nose.  during the entire episode which probably lasted no more than 4 minutes because of how slowly it moved, we were in a near panic state and i was repeatedly asking my friend questions about why there was no sound etc. and all he could do was rely \"i don't know\".  we were very scared and had no idea what we were looking at. there was a surreal atmosphere to it all as if we were not really seeing this and it couldn't be happening.  just after it disappeared from view a couple of our friends came out and we literally blubbered for lack of a better word, our experiences to them and they said it was probably an experimental craft and laughed it off. falls church virginia is a heavily populated area in northern virginia near arlington va where arlington cemetery is and only a few miles from washington dc and we could not imagine why an experimental craft that could move that slowly and silently would be flown only perhaps 100 to 150 feet off the ground in a suburb of washington dc.  we gave up trying to convince them and the next day i called national airport, dulles airport, and andrews air force base and told them what we saw and they all said nothing had been reported by anyone else. to this day my good friend george does not like to talk about it and it disturbed me so much that i tried to put it out of my mind for many years but i could not forget it so that is why i waited so long to report it.  i did not like to even think about it for years. thank you for the opportunity to report this.  it has weighed heavily on my mind for a long time.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Path with directional

lights do not appear in a photo taken a few minutes afterwards. it appears to be 3 distinct clusters in the sky and 2 lights flying together just under the mountain ridge. he was outside so, they are not reflections in a window and we could not find any sources of light on the ground that may have caused some weird reaction with the camera lens. wish i had more information to give but i am
