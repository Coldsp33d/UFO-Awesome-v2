treetops.\r\n\r\ni was very excited  when i saw it and knew it could not possibly be a plane or jet. it was so huge and moved so very slowly and at such a low altitude.\r\n\r\ni was undecided as to what to do next. should i hurry up to higher ground and try to see it some more? or perhaps turn around and reverse my direction in order to have a view  of the craft over presque isle and above the lake?\r\n\r\nwhat i did instead was drive to my home and call the police to report the sighting. the officer did not make me feel silly and took the information. my assumption was that since the very large ufo moved right over marquette, that they would have hundreds of calls from residents who also saw it. but no one else reported seeing a ufo that evening. i guess i might have been the only person who did observe the ufo.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Straight-line

 bright again, not extremely bright as in its peak potential and it seemed as if multi lights came into the play, seemed like red, blue, white, yellow etc, going around in circles.  it did this for about another 5 min and it descended below the tree line.  i never seen it bolt up or anything.  during the time that all this was happening, i was really curious and nervous because i had no

constellations. so staring out my bedroom window into the night sky was not new to me. i was sitting at my bedroom window. i had the room as dark as it could be so that the stars would show more brightly. my window is about 20 feet from the neighbors backyard fence. on the other side of their fence are their trees. i could hear a single cricket chirping and that was the only sound i remember hearing. around 1 to 1:15 am i seen an object traveling from east to west in the sky. i noticed it because i had been watching the stars and they don't move and i rarely see birds or bats flying around our house at night. the object was not as high in the sky as the neighbors treetops. it did not glow or give off any sound. it looked like two solid used-penny colored spheres no bigger then large grapefruits. one was slightly ahead of the other. they looked attached in their center with a white cylinder shaped tube only about 2 inches in diameter. the white cylinder tube did not glow but somehow looked as though it was hollow. it only took about 5 seconds to enter and leave my view but it will always remain in my mind. i could only see about 20 feet to the east of my window and about 30 feet toward the west until the nights darkness hid everything. i then jumped up away from my window, walked out of my bedroom into the hallway then into the living room all the time my thoughts were spinning around in my head. i was thinking, did i really just see that, circlular objects don't fly, we aren't alone and what's going to happen next? i felt afraid and excited at the same time. i wish i had someone to tell so that i would know i wasn't going crazy but then again they would probably think i was crazy. i then tried to collect my thoughts. i thought i better write this down so
