and seek in her parents��� home when her mother told us we were making to much noise and that we had to go outside to play.  so we ran out the front door, to the drive way where we had been drawing with chalk.  we must have sat there at least an hour because about now the drive was full of pictures we had made, and we were nearly sitting on the street drawing.  \r\n\r\na shadow came over us and the drive way, so we looked at each other and then looked up. what we saw was; a large nearly car sized, teardrop, metallic, reflective, solid/but fluid like object hovering on feet above our head.  it wasn���t scary just confusing, curiosity was high, and i actually felt comforted.  like it wanted us to touch it, the bottom seemed to pulse like when you shake a glass of water and it gets ripples.  we both stood up, and i am sure my mouth was wide open, i had chalk in my hand that i dropped.  as i dropped the chalk the object went straight up in the air now it was just above the trees and it was no longer pulsing. \r\n\r\nnava and i looked at each other and the object turned with the smaller side of the tear drop pointing like se, then we looked back up at it.  and it took off moving faster, with the blue sky wrapping around it and the white clouds in the sky the reflection made it nearly invisible.  we could just make out the metallic outline as it flew behind a cloud.  and nava said ���where���d it go?��� and then it reappeared only for a moment above the cloud like it was looking back at us. then it did a turn to the south and was off again. \r\n\r\nwe then began screaming, me at the top of my lungs and nava for her mom.  her parents, her mom and dad came out and asked ���what���s wrong what���s wrong.���  which i could barely hear over my own screaming, nava was crying and pointing to the sky.  and finally it was like i just stopped and said it flew over there and we tried desperately to explain what we had just saw.  \r\n\r\nher mother said ���i think you all have played enough today��� and her dad told me to go right home.  and i took off running home i didn���t even wipe the chalk from my hands and i ran in the door and was telling my mom in a panic what had happened and what we had saw.  she had me go was my hands and sit in the living room.  i could hear her calling nava���s parents.  mom came back in the room and said that nava���s dad said they might be testing weather balloons or something at the university and that we shouldn���t worry about it.   \r\n\r\nnava and i played together after that but things were different it���s like we wanted to talk about it and what had happened but couldn���t.  things just felt weird between us and we both became or like loners, studying more, practicing instruments, and more serious children.   \r\n \r\n----\r\n&#8195;\r\n1. where were you and what were you doing at the time? \r\n\tplaying with sidewalk chalk at a friend���s home.\r\n \r\n2. what made you first notice the object?\r\n\ta shadow was casted across us on a pretty clear day.\r\n \r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\r\n        i didn���t really think about the object other then i wanted to touch it and was curious.  it wasn���t threatening or scary.  i actually felt confused, comforted, and curious.\r\n \r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions in detail.\r\n        teardrop, metallic, reflective, smooth, (solid yet fluid like), no visible lights or hard body shape. just a smooth tear form.  it seemed like the point of the tear was the front and it got thicker and rounder in the back.  it seems like they could see us but we couldn���t really see them through the pulsing bottom.  also the front of the tear drop seemed to be more liquid and clear like.  \r\n \r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after  sighting the object.\r\n\twhile it was there: we had no fear, calm, curious, shocked, and confused.\r\n        when it left: really confused, shocked, and scared just because we couldn���t explain it and make anyone understand.\r\n \r\n6. how did you lose sight of the object?\r\n        first lost sight because it seemed to fly under a cloud and then up through it.  it then peeked out above the cloud.\r\n        second time we lost sight because of the trees and houses across the street.  \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

dye ������, and the funny thing, even that a few days after the event i actually told some one about what i saw, it took a while for me to actually accept that i did see a ufo..\r\ni guess it was so natural that it did not register as a sighting, and only tonight, several months after the occurrence that i came up with the idea to report it.\r\ni���m french canadian from qu���bec so my wording might lead to questioning..Or laughing.. ;)\r\n\r\nso��� first i must say that i have been a remote model airplane pilot for about 23 years, i recently move back from ontario to quebec. as you might guess the sighting occurred at my flying field, the club name is amidair.. as my type of flying ������������ a mix of 3d and precision������������ require steady concentration i prefer to fly alone, so i usually get to the field very��� early 05:45 get set up and usually do several flight in a row before the crowd gets there.  \r\n\r\nthat morning the sky had several patches of gray clouds and i was doing my usual bag of tricks with my plane, and after i did a rolling circle i notice that some thing was occupying a previous empty spot in the shy at around 2 o���clock, honestly, i must admit that i had the feeling of being watch.. i also had the feeling that it was closer to me then the other clouds, we all know that doing a distance evaluation of object in the sky is very difficult since there is no point of reference, as a remote rc pilot like me, it���s some thing you learn the hard way as you think that your plane is in front of the three just to see it disappear in the back of it.. \r\n\r\nso, i���m flying my plane and with time my brain send me a few red flag so i get really interested and i want to take a good look at it so i go in an easy flying mode, doing some long and slow climbing that give me a few good five second to stare at it. the more i look at it the greater my interest grew and the harder it was to fly my plane..\r\n\r\nthe shape was very surreal, basically it had a center point with 3 long point sticking out, if i remember well one was at 12 o���clock one at 4 oc and one at 8 oc. the surreal part was that it was camouflage like the other cloud with a wad of cloud around the spike and center mass so i never saw any metal or hard surfaces just a 3 spoke cloud��� now i remember thinking ������ that���s the proof.. 3 point clouds don���t exist.. so i kept flying in a survival mode so i could keep my eyes on it up to the time that it did start ������ i guess������ to move away from me, i say i guess��� because with the same outside look, it just shrink smaller and smaller. so if it was going away from me it must have done it in a very.. straight line with me, if it did, that denote some intelligence that it knew that i was looking at it and try to confuse me by not having a lateral movement, i looked at it until it totally disappear then i scan the sky for a moving object, i do think that i saw some thing reflecting the sun doing a small curve but i���m not sure.. \r\n\r\nafter that, while i was still flying my remote plane, 2 big 747 did a very��� low fly by right over my head, it seam that they where coming from a take off from the mirabel airport that is fairly close to my flying field..  they both appear in front of me at a good distance going left to right did a long u turn, came over my head, they where so low that i got uncomfortable flying my plane.. the first pass was right over my flying field the second was a bit wider to my back.. i���ve been a member of this club for a few years now, we see our fare share of plane passing over our field on approach to mirabel airport, we have what i call the fedex express that come in like a clock in the morning, we also see a special 4 engine plane with a turbine engine, strap to the right or the cockpit , for engine testing purposes i guess, but never i saw a 747 or two for the matter at such a low altitude.. what crossed my mind for the 747 is that the government is doing some monitoring on ufo, that seems to have.. from what i can read, a weakness for airport traffic..\r\n\r\nso there you go.. i now can dye happy because i finally saw one���too bad it took me so long to realize it.. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

street to a party 5 houses down. there were approximately 15-16 people in the backyard of the party all were friends of mine from high school. after approx. 20 mnutes something caught my attention in the corner of my eye, as i looked to see what it was i saw 5 points of lights that looked like stars traveling in formation low in the northern horizon traveling slowly from east to west. the lights were observed by my friends also. suddenly the 'stars' stopped in mid flight, zig-zagged, then abruptly changed direction and flew upward and disappeared in an instant. we all fell silent and not sure what to say for a few minutes. we all asked one another if everyone saw the same thing. the rest of the night as we tried to joke about it everyone was quieter than usual and kept shaking our heads in

was no sound, no emission and the lights were steady (not twinkling). they moved to the west in a straight line at about airplane speed, and when they passed directly overhead, they would disappear.

(i'm not a morning person) i've tried finding a picture similar to what i saw, but haven't been able to find one.  on first glance, it looked like a small fire in the sky, below the thin, low, partial cloud cover.  when i really looked at it, it appeared to be three (possibly 4-5) orangeish lights stacked on top of each other that were pulsating.  they were way too large to be stars or commercial aircraft.  it looked as though they shone through a haze.  i ran inside and grabbed my cell phone to take a video, but it's not great.  the object was far enough away that you can't really see the detail or shape that i saw with my naked eye.  i took a few clips, sorry for the crappy footage, i didn't have time to run in and grab my tripod.  since this thing seemed to be hanging around, i dashed back inside to get my daughter to come look.  as soon as we made it back outside, it was gone.  simply vanished into thin air.  needless to say, she thinks i'm nuts now (she's 11).  the thing never moved while i was observing it, it just sat there pulsating light.  this isn't the first one i've seen.  the first was on a road trip from midland to lake lbj in high school, a large orange orb that followed my car and then zig-zagged off into the sky.  \r\n\r\nthen, i saw another last week  on february 21st, during the day on my drive to work.  i turned on to the street heading towards my office building, and saw a small silver disk glinting in the sunlight.  my guess is it was a couple thousand feet up.  it was moving very slowly to the northwest, then poof!  it vanished into thin air.  no video on this one, it happened too fast.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":45926,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":31.99413913184837,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02262013-0019","longitude":-102.15932778637526,"occurred":1361283600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Bullet,   Missile,   Cigar,   Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1361927613000,"summary":"Flaming, hovering ufo","tags":["ufo","hovering"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/45926_submitter_file1__VIDEO0014.3gp","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/45926_submitter_file2__VIDEO0013.3gp","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/45926_submitter_file3__VIDEO0012.3gp"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"79707","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":7,"locationName":"Midland, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:7774"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Lisbon","country":"Portugal","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Lisbon, february, 2013; 19:40\r\n\r\ni was walking towards north direction talking on the phone with a friend from faro (algarve), when i saw a bright white light moving in the sky (the same intensity of brightness as venus). orion was on the sky zenit and the object pass south of the constelation in a straight line 285��� direction. i told my friend and he came out and saw it too. i live very close to the place where the airplanes make the turn to land therefore i know very well  identify the pattern of a plane flight and its brightness.During the sighting 3 planes were seen contemporaneously. we were talking about the (r)evolution ongoing on the planet with the disclosure of some bad actions regarding religion, politics and banking... when he asked, if i do believe on it... they arrived...  me and my friend talked about it while they passed...","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":45925,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.7252993,"location":null,"logNumber":"PT-02262013-0018","longitude":-9.1500364,"occurred":1361936400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Lisbon District","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Blimp","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1361927440000,"summary":"Orion was on the sky zenit and the object pass south of the constelation in a straight line 285º direction.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Europe/Lisbon","timeZoneName":"Europe/Lisbon","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"1800","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Lisbon, Lisbon District","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:7775"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Carson","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We were having a gathering that night and we were all outside relaxing by a fire when i seen this object with 3 lights shaped like a triangle move through a cloud. i quickly had my friends look up and 3 other people seen the object move in the sky so i know i wasn't crazy. ,the lights were i say to be 10 times bigger then the airplane lights that were up in the sky that night. this also only moved 1 way really fast and then dissapeared over wilmington ca after going through a cloud almost invisible looking.  it could of been 1 object with 3 lights or 3 objects moving together in a traingle form. we kept looking up all night to see if maybe it was a big party light they use sometimes but this was over a area that would never have a light in the sky. we only seen it one time so im sure it wasn't party light. also it went through the only cloud that was at the time above us. maybe to hide itself.

in a clear night sky above and just in front me. the formation took up the small section of sky that was visible to me between the buildings either side of the lane.                  \r\ni estimated that the lights were at cloud height. \r\nthe lights were slightly larger than stars and at first that���s what i took them to be, it was only when i stopped walking to observe them that i realized they were moving in a westerly direction. i watched the lights move forward at a slow pace for 10 seconds. then they suddenly accelerated forwards at an incredible speed and disappeared into the horizon.\r\ni ran after the lights to see if i could catch a glimpse of them but they were gone. i was alone at the time of the incident. there were no people walking by and no traffic noise, the lights were silent and no noise was audible when they accelerated.\r\nthe next day at mid morning, i went back to wigton place to photograph the area and sky where i had seen the formation. at 2am, 18th february 2013, i returned to the lane to see if i had confused what i had saw with the constellations visible between the buildings.\r\ni could see orion���s belt and other constellations but none that were similar to the formation of the night before. i remembered that i had not seen any stars when the lights were above me which leads me to believe that the lights may have represented the

noticed the whole sky was lit up with 50+ orange orbs!!( i've seen the orange orbs before but only 1-3 at a time) my first thought was that they were embers from a fire, but quickly realized they were all rising up from one spot northwest of the house a couple miles away, out over the ocean, and they all were traveling south with different flight paths and at different altitudes~ some were stopping and hovering then speeding up to catch others and maneuvering around each other, while others kept steady straight paths. also some would get real bright then dim out then would light up again. i quickly took out my cell phone and tried to record what i was seeing and filmed for about 47 seconds but didn't think i was picking up anything, so i raced to the bedroom and woke up my wife( she believes, but has never seen )and excitingly told her \"come quick~ you gotta see this!! she was startled by my emergency, and asked me whats going on? i told her everything's ok~ but you gotta see this!! i coaxed her out of bed and to the front door and pointed to the sky and said \"look at that~ what the hell are those?!!\" at this point there were about 20 or so still coming towards us and as they got directly to the west of our position, the closest to us, they would fade out and disappear from sight. not one could be seen once it was past the west parallel or southwest of us. she just stood there not really saying anything while i pointed out where they were coming from and some of the crazy maneuvers they were doing. we watched as one by one they would cross the west parallel and fade out until the last one was gone... the only way i can really compare what i saw is to the video of the clusters taken in daytime in south america and mexico...","distance":"501 Feet - 1

them. they are a normal thing at later times of the night and i know they aren't aircraft due to my experience in the aviation field. i was outside smoking a cig and saw a bright light chaging different colors hovering for about 15 minutes in the same spot. i know it wasn't an airplane as it was with out a doubt hovering and the lights were in no way regulation for civilian or military. towards the end of the event i heard some rustling in the leaves in the school yard that is directly behind my house and a man stepped out dressing in all black. i couldn't see his face due to lack of light but he was just staring at me not moving. i went inside and locked the doors as this was very disturbing. as i went to close the blinds i looked out again and he was not longer there as i had my cell phone in my hand to call the cops. i don't know if this was coincidence or connected but it was pretty unnerving and sent a crazy chill down my spine.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the horizon. at first he thought they were flares. but, they did not descend and they had no trails of smoke. instead, they ascended in different directions. he came and got me to witness this and i saw what looked like a flock of red lights, at least 20, like a firework but they were ascending and traveled south, pretty much over our house. they made no sound, and had pulsating red lights and eventually as they got more overhead the lights twinkled out. they were moving fairly fast, not just floating. once the red light went out on one of them, i saw a silhouette in the moonlight of a sphere shape, kinda brown in color.  the two of us stood there in disbelief because we could not think of one logical explanation for what we were seeing. we were stunned enough that neither one of us wanted to miss anything so neither one of us grabbed the camera!! we feel pretty stupid about that now. finally, they all just faded away into the south sky.
