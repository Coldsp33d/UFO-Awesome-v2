light.   the objects moved slowly at the same altitude and speed.   one followed the other.   distance between was probably 100 feet (approximate), far too close for most airplanes.   they were as big as passenger airliners which we can hear when they go over our house.   these were perfectly silent and moving slowly.   the distance between the 2 vehicles never varied nor did their altitude.   it was like what you would see if one car were pulling another with a rigid tether between them.   looking through a monocular i could see three lights in tri-corner positions on both ufo's.     i would say that we observed them travel from south to north with only one slight veering to the west and then back to a direct south north direction for a distance of 12 miles.   we have open vistas.   there were other aircraft in the area as usual on normal flight patterns.   most are west to east or east to west.  these craft just flew beyond our area of vision.   i read an entry on another sight that also occurred tonight about an hour earlier than ours that sounded similar to this one but from rockingham nc which is approx. 2 hours south east from here.   we observed this from our deck, then our front porch and then from the north side of our house in the yard.  my husband had just walked outside to look at the stars and moon.   the night sky was so clear and beautiful.   we are star gazers.   we are so familiar with aircraft because we live on a regular flight path and noticed immediately that these were different.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

lights. they were flying slowly in an odd formation. the lights were larger than aircraft lights. they also did not have the same color as airplane lights. the sighting occurred in murfreesboro,tn at approximately 6:55pm on a clear cloudless night on feb. 24th 2013. other cars in the area seemed to slow down and observe the lights as well. they were totally silent as i lowered my car window to make certain they were not known aircraft. i observed them in awe as they looked strange with no blinking directional light and totally silent. they went from four light to three to two and finally i saw the last one slowly fade like on a dimmer switch. i actually followed the direction they were flying in the event they became visible again but i never saw them after a short detour on my way home to find them. i am reporting this in case others do the same and confirm my sighting.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

was a full moon out and no clouds. i was on richmond rd in rockingham, nc. this is a well lit residentual area. i could see some light just over the trees and as i watched them they seemed to be moving very slow much slower than a c130 transport planes that we often see in the area. it was almost like it was gliding or hoovering. as the area opened up some and there was less trees i could clearly see that there was 2 of the objects. 1 behind the other. i pulled into the parking lot of roberdel baptist church to try and get a picture of them. as i pulled in and parked i turned my truck off and i already had my window down and these objects made no sound. the objects then banked to their right and i could not get a picture of them. i started my truck up and tried to follow them to try and get a better spot to view them. as i crossed the stoplight which is less than 500 yds from where i pulled in to park i noticed that they had picked up speed and were moving faster. by the time i got another 1-2 miles down the road they were far enough away from me that i could not follow them. i had already called home and told my wife to look outside and see if she could see anything but she could not. right after they banked to the right i had noticed what seemed to be an airplane coming towards them. when i got home i told my wife what i had seen and she said it was probably something military , but not 5 minutes later after she said that, 2 big airplanes (c130 i guess) came flying over just above treetop level going in the same direction that the 2 objects were going. they were low enough to vibrate the house. i went outside and noticed a lot of planes in the sky(small blinking lights). it is now 7:15pm and i have to go and pick my daughter up from church. i tell her about it and as we are coming home she tells me that she sees some lights also. i could not see them because they were too far to the right side to look at and drive safely. when we get home we get out and notice 4 blinking lights that are in the shape of a square almost like helicopters in formation but no sound but at the distance they were i thought i would have heard something. they were flying from north to south. time is about 7:45pm.\r\n\r\ni have never had an experience like this before because i can usually explain it away, but what got me on this was that there was no sound from the 2  boomerang objects and when they banked i could make out lines on one of them and then all the plane traffic in the area after that.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

you look to the right side of pics you can see some through the trees.I yell  to my fianc��� to grab every cell or camera and film it which she did. a few of the orbs looked like the merge together or crossed paths!!! the re aligned.The as they were passing us a strange downpoor of rain haerd rain came down just in our area!!!! as some police or firetrucks started flying by the street toward that direction. we didnt get a good look since we were lookin up trying to figure out what was going on .. abby ran in the house. then my fiances camera with new batteries died/shut off shortly after we started filming! about 4 orbs into filming. then she brung her cell camera out and started taking photo and said it was blurring and nothing showed up on her cell. we do have a video and a few pics on her camera..One of the strangest things i have ever seen! the was viewable from jensen beach to port saint lucie. i felt mesmerized at what we were witnessing...  picture the color of a orange street

az.  i was speaking on the cell phone with my fiance and was stopped at the signal waiting for it to turn green.  i looked out the window to the left because i could hear the 2 black helicopters hovering over the reserve base on mcdowell.  i looked up above the helicopters and saw the glowing red-orange spherical object moving very slowly.  it reminded me of satellite movement but it was much lower in the horizon; but it was much higher in the horizon than the normal landing plane flight path of sky harbor airport that is right next to this base.  i watched it as i told my fiance that i was watching a ufo, waiting to see the blue and white lights that accompany the red light in a plane; but they never appeared.  i watched it for about 2-3 minutes as it pulsated in brightness and moved slowly in a erratic pattern.  i watched until i looked at the signal.  i looked back and it was gone.  the black helicopters remained there.  i got off the phone, and we live north of the base and my fiance went outside to look at the helicopters.  he confirmed later that they remained there.  they were even there when i got home about 20 minutes later.\r\ni was excited to have seen something i couldn't explain but wondered if it was base related or if it was something unknown to them that they were closely monitoring.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
