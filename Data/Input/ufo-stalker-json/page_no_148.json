train was veering to the left and as it did, i noticed beautiful yet ominous cloud formation. trees were obstructing the view while in the turn. after about 30 seconds of anticipation, i saw what looked like a very long funnel, pretty much uniform from top of the sky and stopping at a thunderhead. i slid down in my seat to try to capture the length in my lens. the 2nd pic seemed to have too much sun so for the 3rd i excluded it. the strange display quickly went out of my eyeline behind me to the left. today i showed the pics to a friend and saw many things upon magnification. i don't want to be leading but i see a possible heli to the left, orbs, at leart 1 craft, a flattened square type portal, the funnel is twisting + ... but i'm using a cell and atablet to view these. i took the pics be use i had never seen anything close to this. it can't be contrails to me because the funnel is 90Â° and pentrating..Endless at the top, stopping abruptly at the thunderhead. where the funnel reaches the thunderhead, i see an angled flattened square, illuminated. also the exterior of the funnel is... strange and twisted with objects..?\r\nplease tell me what u see. no filters on my pics. negative exposure proved to be interesting. i feel a lil crazy but after all the inspection my devices will allow, i feel certain i've seen something that was not meant to be seen.\r\nthanks\r\ndmn","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,

minerÃ­a y petrÃ³leo; el dÃ­a 01/9/17 salimos de casa junto con una amiga de la familia a las 3 am por la rn 3 hacia el norte, hicimos unos 107 km hasta el empalme de la rp 75 que va hacia el noroeste y tomamos esta ruta, hicimos por ella como 110 km hasta llegar al empalme con la rp 12 despuÃ©s de transitar el verdadero desierto patagÃ³nico en una de las zonas mas Ã¡ridas y desoladas de la provincia de santa cruz.\r\nestas rutas se juntan en la gran curva llamada \"de moyano\" por la localidad abandona de gobernador moyano mas adelante, antes una pujante poblaciÃ³n en medio de la meseta.\r\nhicimos varias paradas en el trayecto para sacer fotografÃ­as y tomar unos mates y estirar las piernas.\r\nseguimos para el norte por la rp 12 unos 60 km hasta una curva denominada \"laguna redonda\" en la que hay un camino vecinal que va hacia el oeste y pasa por una estancia abandonada, se sube una cuesta empinada con la camioneta y se llega a una laguna de unos 500 metros de diÃ¡metro arriba en la meseta, allÃ­ nos quedamos a almorzar y ya eran las 09:30 am, estuvimos en la laguna cerca de 1 hora.\r\nsiempre cuando salimos asÃ­ de viaje llevamos todas nuestras cÃ¡maras y dispositivos porque sabemos que en los profundo de la patagonia siempre es un placer sacar fotografÃ­as del paisaje, los animales y los lugares escondidos a los que casi nadie llega por lo aislado de los mismos.\r\nllevamos cÃ¡mara digital nikon d5, filmadora digital sony pxw-fs7k y binoculares sony dev uhd 4k que no son pesados y son mucho mejores que teleobjetivos de cÃ¡mara porque se ve con los dos ojos y se puede sacar fotos y filmar al mismo tiempo que se estÃ¡ mirando.\r\ncomo a las 10:38 am escuchamos al norte todavÃ­a estando sobre le meseta, el ruido de un helicÃ³ptero lejano, pasados algunos minutos mÃ¡s fuerte y despuÃ©s un poco mÃ¡s y divisamos en la altura tal vez a 1 km de distancia y a 45Âº en el cielo un helicÃ³ptero totalmente blanco que se movÃ­a de este a oeste como dando un gran cÃ­rculo, detrÃ¡s de Ã©l otro mÃ¡s que iba un poco mas bajo y lo seguÃ­a a una buena distancia.\r\nlos dos helicÃ³pteros eran blancos, muy estilizados y algo que nos llamÃ³ la atenciÃ³n fue que no tenÃ­an patines o ruedas sino que lo Ãºnico que se veÃ­a era el fuselaje por debajo, estuvimos buscando y se parecÃ­an mucho a los helicÃ³pteros bell 525 pero tenÃ­an domos, antenas y otras cosas que no coinciden pero si coincidÃ­an esas aletas en la parte baja.\r\nninguno de los 2 helicÃ³pteros tenÃ­an seÃ±ales ni marcas, ni nÃºmeros, nada, eran totalmente blancos incluso las ventanas se veÃ­an de ese color.\r\nnos quedamos mirando y grabando todo y como a las 11:00 am mi esposo mirando con los binoculares vio otra aeronave un poco mÃ¡s alto y mas lejos que venÃ­a detrÃ¡s de los helicÃ³pteros, tal vez como a 60Âº en el cielo y a unos 2 o 3 km; este era un aviÃ³n de alas muy finas y muy largas, estuvimos buscando que podÃ­a ser y estamos seguros que era igual al global hawk, tambiÃ©n era totalmente blanco, sin marcas y tenÃ­a las aletas de atrÃ¡s en v exactamente, igual que la trompa abultada para arriba y el motor como rectangular arriba y atrÃ¡s.\r\ncomo a las 11:20 am empezamos a bajar de la meseta de nuevo para la rp 12 y cuando llegamos ahÃ­ volvimos a ver estos 3 aparatos pero para el sudeste volando para el este, como dije parecÃ­a que daban un gran cÃ­rculo.\r\nseguimos por la rp 12 para el norte y nos llevÃ³ caso 2 horas hacer los 15 km hasta llegar a las sierra blancas porque paramos un montÃ³n de veces para ver si divisÃ¡bamos las aeronaves de nuevo; de hecho las volvimos a ver 2 veces mÃ¡s, una hacia el noroeste con direcciÃ³n al oeste y otra hacia el sur y se dirigÃ­an hacia el este.\r\nnos quedamos en sierras blancas bastante tiempo hasta que los vimos por Ãºltima vez hacia el suroeste e iban para el sur a eso de las 15:00 pm.\r\ndespuÃ©s hicimos 85 km mas y llegamos a pico truncado, pasamos el dÃ­a allÃ­ y al dÃ­a siguiente bajamos de nuevo para puerto san juliÃ¡n pero por la rn 3, no volvimos a ver las aeronaves.\r\nel dÃ­a 02/9/17 a la noche apenas llegamos a casa llamamos a un especialista en estos temas extraÃ±os de la ciudad de rÃ­o gallegos quien nos recomendÃ³ no bajar las imÃ¡genes a la computadora y guardas las tarjetas de memoria por separado fuera de los equipos, nos dijo que enviarÃ­a a un colaborador para buscar las tarjetas y que llegarÃ­a a la madrugada.\r\nocurriÃ³ esto a eso de 01:00 am del 04/9/17 cuando llegaron varias personas y entregamos las tarjetas para analizar las imÃ¡genes despuÃ©s de firmar un documento de propiedad intelectual del contenido.\r\nnos pidieron no usar los equipos y los pusieron dentro de unas bolsas como de celofÃ¡n rojo con una vÃ¡lvula que las sellÃ³ al vacÃ­o despuÃ©s de sacarles las baterÃ­as y las dejaron en casa en un contenedor como una valija de fotÃ³grafo.\r\nle preguntamos si podÃ­amos publicar lo que vimos aquÃ­ y nos dijeron que era nuestra elecciÃ³n y eso estamos haciendo porque supimos que algo ocurriÃ³ con un trabajador petrolero que vio luces a la noche hace como 10 dÃ­as en un pozo petrolero Â¿y si esto estÃ¡ relacionado?.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"04:40:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

skies were clear as we overflew the wyoming, nebraska, colorado area. as we were flying northwest at 36000 feet we noticed a strange light off into the distance to our right at about a 3 o'clock position and much lower than us but it seemed to be above the ground and moving slightly towards the north. the light was orangish in color and at random times started pulsating intense bursts of red and green random flashes that were the same colors as red and green lasers. the red and green pulsing would last a few seconds and then stop and start up again. this lasted a couple of minutes and then it stopped and we didn't see the object after that.  as an airline pilot i see a lot of lights in the sky but this was nothing like i've seen before in my 25 years of flying and 14000 flight hours.  it wasn't another airplane or helicopter and definitely not a natural phenomenon. not sure what it was but my best guess would be either an actual extraterrestrial craft or a man made

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I left a friends house, headed home, driving the same route i always drive at about 2ish in the morning. not driving fast because this is a backroad and deer are always out, my window was down and i had music playing but not too loud. as i was driving the sky flashed as if lightning flashed in the distance. what caught my attention to it was there were no clouds, it was a very clear night, i could see the milky way as there was no moon and very very little light pollution except for my headlights. what was odd about the light/flash was that it was bluish in color and seemed to flash over the top of my truck. the only thing i can equate it to is when someone is welding, the light that it gives off is not like a lightning flash or other sorts of light fixtures. it flashed for about 3 or 4 flashs, fast but long enough to look up and still see it going on through the windshield. this light lit up the whole sky, like i said, like lightning would have. there was no sound like a rumble of thunder that should have followed if it had been lightning. as i looked up from over the top of my truck, the object appeared, from my perspective sitting in the drivers seat, it moved from the rearview mirror to the steering wheel the diappeared over the trees. the direction would have been northeast to southwest. it did not move fast, about 30 mph or so. slower than me, i was probably going about 40 mph. it was on a straight flight path. when i first saw it, i didn't have a clue as to what i was seeing. it was triangled shaped, an acute triangle, there were about 6 or 7 lights on my side of the object, the lights on the other side i could barely see but were not as prominent. i draw, so i know perspective quite well, so i could tell tge shape pretty good. there were no lights on the back side of the object. the lights lit it just enough to see the object was a dark color but flat colored. it kinda freaked me out a bit, i told myself on the rest of the ride home that it was probably military, i like sci-fi but i am skeptical at such things because people jump to conclusions much too quick. by the time i got home i had come to somewhat of a conclusion that a: there are no airbases near the area i saw the object, the closest airport is about 15-20 miles away as a crow flies and it's a very small county airport that usually only has single engine planes flying out of it. sometimes double prop planes. b: there was no sound after the light flash i observed and from the point that i saw the flash, i had driven 20 miles and there were still no signs of clouds anywhere. all the stars were out. c: the object was moving rather slow, more slower than, if not the same speed, perspective wise, as a single engine plane flying low but still seemed slower than what i've seen before with a plane. d: the shape of the object could have been the shape of a stealth fighter but seemed thicker and longer. where the lights were, it seemed to be inset but overlapped by the top and bottom of the hull. i know this is going to sound stupid but i'm trying to equate to something so that you can visualize it in your head, it had the shape of a star destroyer from star wars with lights on the sides. e: it seemed thin but not flat and i could not see if anything was on top, like a canopy or tail fons from the perspective i saw it. it flew over the road ahead of me. the were some trees to my right but not many, it was fenced in pasture to the right with small trees, if any, on the fence line but on my left were tall pine trees. as i watched the object disappear over the trees, i would sight it again as the trees thinned and then i lost it for good as i could no longer see past the trees. it was not that high above me, maybe 100 yards and disappeared about 100-150 yards infront of me. like i said, it was angled that way. nw to se. your asking how i felt thinking about it all the way home? i kinda scared the crap outta me, not knowing what i just saw. military aircraft to me is very cool, i love seeing that kind of stuff but seeing that light before hand and then seeing an aircraft of some sort appearing right after the light? that was freaky. i wish i would have filmed it but it happened so fast but seemed like i watched it for 10 mins. but it

look at the condition of rail tracks on our property. i drove over in my truck and after looking at what i went to look at, i started driving back to the main facility. on my way i observed something on a box trailer that caught my curiosity so i stopped and got out. at that point i inspected the trailer, went back to my truck and just looked around at all of the facilities. it was a beautiful time of day and i was enjoying the weather taking it all in. i looked up and saw what i thought was a star. i didn't think anything of it and continued looking around. i looked up again and noticed that the \"star\" was not in the same place it had previously been...So i continued watching it. i thought my eyes were playing a trick on me because the object was certainly moving from ne to sw at a slow rate, then the object disappeared and reappeared a short distance away instantaneously. i continued to observe the movements and it went in a diagonal, zig-zag pattern...Disappearing and reappearing rapidly. i continued watching for a while before figuring out that i needed to get into my truck to grab my phone in order to document what was going on. i took video of the object but was unable to film the quick movements. i filmed for about 5+ minutes and then wanted to call a coworker out to witness to object...Just so i wouldn't look crazy to others who i may show the video to. he came out and we both continued observing the object for about 10 minutes. i went back in to the facility to my office and locked everything up to go home. as i headed home, 15-20 miles wnw of where i work, i was able to observe the object until i got to my driveway. the entire time i was driving, the object was losing its brightness... maybe due to the sun going down, or its angle compared to the suns position. i decided to upload the video to youtube just in case something happened to my phone.\r\n\r\nthis is my statement of what i saw and it is 100% true. it was almost a year ago and i remember it like it was yesterday. i have no clue what it was that i saw, but it was an object in the sky, it wasn't falling and as far as i am concerned it is unknown! view video for your own opinion.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with
