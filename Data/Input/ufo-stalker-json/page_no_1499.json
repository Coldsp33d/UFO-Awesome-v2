this is either a late night cargo flight to milwaukee or a red-eye flight.  i then observed a non pulsating light in front of the object in the same trajectory of flight.  that got me confused and excited as i thought wow this actually might be a military exercise of some sort.  the red strobe object was in trail and after about 30 seconds of observation i heard a distant roaring sound that's familiar to me as an f-16.  they fly daily from truax field here in madison, home of the national guards 115th fighter wing.  they often fly directly overhead at low altitude, and most residents here are familiar with their distinct sound.  then the steady light object in the lead made an abrupt 90 degree turn straight down at a speed that made my heart skip a beat.  the decent took about 2 seconds and i lost sight of it beyond the tree line.  my conservative estimation is that it dropped more than ten thousand feet in those 2 seconds.  the strobe object in trail turned down to follow it, but was nowhere near as fast.  i'm making this report because no possible estimation of the speed of decent can convince me this was a conventional aircraft or even a drone.  immediately after i lost visual on both objects i saw a third bluish non strobe star like object directly over where the first two objects descended.  it seemed to me that it appeared from very high altitude.  it hovered in the sky and then slowly dropped down behind the tree line.  there was no noise.  if it was a drone being tested at night there wouldn't have been a fighter in trail, nor would the non strobe object be illuminated at all.  my only logical explanation is that i saw a commercial aircraft and also a satellite.  at the moment i lost sight of the satellite a meteor came down at 90 degrees directly over it.  this seems impossibly unlikely.

this is not the first time i think i have this object recorded. in the middle of january i was having my roof replaced so i would go on the deck and take pics of them working. this time though i was using the movie function on the camera and had it on a tripod,i did not notice this one till i reviewed the couple minutes of footage.For about ten seconds it shows a very bright object moving between clouds decending. this time i was shocked to see it so well. even thogh inthink if i was not looking through the camera i might have missed it entirely. for a couple of seconds it was in view,it moved like it was folding in on it self,also it moved very fast like zig zagging. as far as what i thought it maybe if you ever seen pics of the smaller so called energy orbs that you would get by taking pics in a cemetery. been then i thought it would have to be the size of a 50 \" tv. i have to say i was very excited and pleased that it showed itself to me, becouse it was cold and i would almost bet no one else in the valley was out taking pics. finaly as how i lost sight of it from all the pics you could tell it rised higher in the sky and phased out. i just kept snapping until i couldn't see it any more. thanks for listening ,and by chance you would like all thirty pics to see it how i did send an email and i would be happy to send all of them. pretty amazing !\r\n","distance":"Over One

looked at them there were two both stood facing me one motionless and the other one leaning back into a strait stance ,was leaning just enough into my periphrial vision that i would see them.They were exactly like the small greys you see like in the roswell accident .This wasn't a terrifying experience .But i also realized just recently after 20 years since the sighting ,that when i went up there to commit suicide it was early,about noon when i ten seconds away from commiting suicide and saw the greys and left it was 11:30pm and there was a full moon thats how i remember seeing them was in the well lit moonlight .It took years for me to actually accept what i saw with my own eyes...And there is not doubt whatsoever 100 % absolutely positively beyond any doubt ...That i saw them 2..Twenty feet away from me ,i even had a loaded gun and couldve shot at them and probibly hit them i had a 357 magnum loaded with the trigger pulled back and ready to fire,when i noticed that i was not alone it simply voided the suicide and i left ,which i thank them for really.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"10:28:15","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s),

seem to signal me with specific patterns of formation and light signals, usually white brillant flashes but also a red lazer seems to lock with my eyes. im overcome with emotions foriegn to me and feel as if they are trying to tell me things. on a nightly basis i feel summoned outside, so i take a cigarette and sit outside and usually one appears out of nowhere and seems to flash light directly at me. over this week they have flashed beams at my residence which seem to not emit a trial but appear directly by me. i have tried to signal back with a lighter and a led flashlight and they flash specific sequences seemingly in reply. i would dismiss these as regular craft but the movements are not within our current technology as far as i know, i do not believe a human could withstand the sharp angle movements.Last night two of the crafts absorbed into one another and then dropped something out of the newly formed unidentified object. on other occasions i would go for walks and remember taking note of the constelation orion to show my girlfriend right over head, we walked about 50 and both were cold so we returned home, i had apparently lost over an hour of time and only thought to check once i noticed that orion was now on the horizon when it was almost directly overhead moments before. its difficult scribing my events because of the constant headaches. i only chose to write this after me and my girlfriend started getting odd bruises and markings that we couldnt figure out how we got. she then said that we should check on symptoms of alien abduction which led me here. i believe that if i were ask questions by someone with more knowledge of these abnormalities i would be able to articulate it better, i have not been sleeping and feel a bit confused in trying to express this. also at odd intervals of the night i feel summoned to go outside and they once again appear, this has been happening over a week straight now. my girlfriend has seen them with me everytime. and when she was alone would not see them unless i walked outside and and thought about them. its an uneasy feeling and have multiple physical problems since these more recent experiences, including but not limited to odd pains in specific parts of my body accompanied by bruising and raised and dented skin among other things. im searching for answers. once again this has been on going my entire life since i can remember. i have a better memory than anyone of my friends or family and find it extremely odd that i have large periods of my life missing from my memory as a child and now more recently as an adult i have been taking more notice to these instances, when as a child i brushed all of it off as nightmares or some sort of acute ptsd.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
