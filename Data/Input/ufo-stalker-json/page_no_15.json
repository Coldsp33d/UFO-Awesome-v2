south and my eyes were drawn to the moving lights. i pulled over, at roughly 491 w garfield ave. coldwater mi 49036, fumbled my phone around and managed to snap 1 clear photo. i saw 4 lights in total and the photo captured 3 of them in formation and the fourth was out of frame on the lower left.\r\n\r\nsighting 2 - @~6:15 am on 3.15.18 i was heading eastbound on garfield rd. to work. i was looking for activity due to the first sighting. surprisingly there they were again in and in larger numbers, roughly 11, and in the same area. i pulled in the same location as sighting #1. facing south i was prepared with my phone an managed to record 3 seperate videos. video 1 they are flying around in formation. video 2 they were moving rapdily around each other, slowing down then fast again, then moved around making different formations. i only recoginized one, it appeared to be the little dipper. video 3 after that they all came together and formed a v pattern and slowly headed north, until they reached garfield rd. then they sharply turned west and flew slowly above the road until they turned sharply again now heading south, flew slowly in that direction until they were out of sight. \r\n\r\nsighting 3  @~6:15 am on 3.17.18 i was heading eastbound on garfield rd. to see if i could observe further activity. when i arrived at the same location as sighting 1 & 2 i waited and snapped a couple photos of a suspected star, and a video of some lights in a flying v and changing shape. upon further review this may be a flock of birds but the spped seems to fast so i am not sure, but hopeful your team can find something if it is there.\r\n\r\ni felt rattled and wondering what i just saw. i am still trying to figure out what it is and am hoping you may be able to

those. so i yelled into the house to my family to come and see. my 15 year old son came out and we watched the object hover, pulsate, grow very dim then intensely bright, change color and zip all over

blue with several white puffy clouds.   i was looking at the clouds when i noticed what i thought was a few pieces of small clouds moving fast in a v shape.  then i noticed they were not clouds and moving very smoothly in a v shaped formation.  i made out 6 semi triangular vehicles that resembled nothing i can compare it to. not like other ufo triangles i've seen described.  they had white bodies and what appeared to be black wings.  they were moving very, very fast and smoothly, unlike anything i've ever witnessed, with no sound at all.  they were very high up in the sky.  they glided together and moved perfectly together, extremely close to one another in the v shape but then they moved in a crooked line and back to the v shape, very smoothly and with perfect synchrony.  they flew directly overhead of us, made a turn and disappeared near the sun.  absolutely no sound, exhaust or movement besides the gliding. as they turned they were in a crooked line again and one of them changed shape by appearing to open, extend, rotate or adjust its wing, very hard to explain.  the way they were gliding was amazing. i lost sight when they got near the sun and they completely vanished.  i looked at the sky for another few minutes with no sign at all of them.  \r\n\r\ni was wearing sunglasses and only saw white and black.  my boyfriend who also witnessed them saw gold/ white vehicle body and black wings and sparkles when they disappeared.  he was not wearing sunglasses. \r\n\r\ni felt very calm and a strange sense of excitement and  happy energy while witnessing it.  i feel it still as i write this and feel extremely lucky for some reason.  i was not scared. \r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Had been observing pleiades cluster through telescope (i am an amateur astronomer). i was taking a break from observing for a minute. i looked up at the sky (i believe i was considering what to point the telescope at next.) there seemed to be a black object moving against the background of stars. it was difficult to see, but it appeared to have a round outline. there seemed to be something like a crescent / semi-circular arc of cloudy white vapor near the forward edge of the object. the vapor was faintly illuminated. it was very difficult to judge size or distance to the object.\r\n  i think my first thought was that the object was a cloud, but it was moving too fast, moving against what little wind there was, and had too regular a shape. i assumed that if i kept watching it, i'd be able to figure out what it was.\r\n  it was moving too fast for me to train my telescope on it. (went from about 75 degrees above the horizon to about 15 degrees above the horizon in about 60 seconds.)\r\n  the object appeared black or possibly transparent. almost like a lens that was distorting the images of the stars behind it. \r\n  the object appeared to hold a steady course and speed towards the north-west, moving much like a jet aircraft as far as i could tell. i moved my position by about ten feet while watching it to try to get a clearer view (there was one small, leafless tree obscuring). \r\n  i lost sight of the object when a car drove through the neighborhood and the car headlights (pointed almost straight at me) made it very difficult to see anything else. after the car left, i was not longer able to see the object which had been nearing the point where it would have been obscured by nearby houses and trees in any case.\r\n  i saw a jet airliner a few moments later. the jet followed a path approximately perpendicular to that of the 'object' and about 35 degrees above the western horizon. i saw no indication that the jet was aware of the other object.\r\n the sight of the jet did give me a good reference for comparison. the object had seemed to move at approximately the same angular speed as the jet. if i assume that the object was moving at the same speed and at the same altitude (which i know is a lot to assume), then it would have been immense: a diameter at least 3 times the length of the 727 that passed through about 60 seconds later.\r\nthe sky was clear with excellent visibility. there were no clouds. the temperature was around 40 fahrenheit.\r\n  i would speculate that the object might have been some kind of stealth aircraft...Possibly a b2? it was very difficult to judge exact shape and size: basically i observed a black object against a black background. my impression was that the object was very large and basically circular, but i suppose it is possible that it could have been 'wing-shaped.' also, the object made no discernible sound (most air-traffic in this area is audible), and the \"crescent of white vapor\" at the leading edge was puzzling. also, there were no conventional aircraft lights of any kind on the object. we are only 20 miles from a major airport and 5 miles from a small airport. there is considerable air traffic at that hour of the night. it seems very odd that even a military aircraft would operate without running lights of any kind in this area. if the object was a b2, then it should have been close enough for engine noise to be easily discernible. i heard nothing.\r\n  after going into my house for a few minutes, i came back out to investigate several possible causes for what i saw (some kind of reflection? my own breath condensing somehow? some kind of spot light? a flock of birds somehow reflecting city lights? a drone? a blimp? a balloon?) none of these explanations seems to fit what i saw. it was too regular in outline for a flock of birds or a cloud. it was moving too fast for some of the other explanations, and it did not make any sound. also, a drone or other small object should have shown a much smaller angular size as it moved away from me. this object seemed to grow only slightly smaller as it moved towards the horizon, which would seem to indicate that it was at a considerable distance from me even when it was almost overhead.\r\n  i was calm both during and after the incident. even though it is st. patrick's day, i have not consumed any alcohol in over 24 hours. my major reaction was to think, \"i'm sure i can figure this out if i just think long enough.\" however, i have grown increasingly certain that no conventional explanation (that i can think of) completely fits what i observed. i wanted to post this while the memory is still fresh in my mind.\r\n  to me the identity of object remains unknown.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

becoming very heavy to breath, as if the air around me had been compressed. as i looked around to see that i wasnt imagining this, i saw infront of me about 50yards away apart of the space in front of

felt a cold hard surface, but before i could take a longer observation the whole thing whizzed up into the sky, the air that seemed to be compressed, whoosed up after the object as if the air was been sucked away. i felt very uneasy afterwards for a long time, and i still rarely go back over that field. i have never spoke about this before now, as i never realized that mufon existed. i did try to

each other , not behind each other. i can't belive what i am seeing. i'm trying to figure out what they are.\r\n\r\nthen another group is suddenly there and mingles with the others then they also line up in a straight line. something comes out of the 3rd light, from the first group, that almost looked like a shooting star. it was fast left a slight trail and just quickly vanished. then they quickly seem to get in a v shape. appears to be kinda low and slow now. about as high as the airliners coming in landing nearby or lower. \r\n \r\ni can tell it / they are going to go right over head soon. so i run to get my daughter. i figured she is 15 and would be believed as a witness. someone else had to see this so i didn't sound crazy. so since it wasn't going very fast i took the chance. we run back out and it is almost right over head. as we look at it you can see there is more to it than just lights. it made no sound. it was definately something or things there. not birds or balloons,helicoptors or a jet. my daughter gets scared and runs inside after about 20 seconds. i had to watch it. it almost looked like that they were either one thing or so close together it looked like one solid thing. then another one of those shooting star things flys off from the front of it. \r\nas soon as that happened it suddenly sped up the lights in front start to disappear and then it just was gone.\r\n\r\ni am stunned. can't workout what i just saw. i rush inside to hear what my daughter saw. she is sitting on the couch in a blanket shaking and scared. she said she thought it was low and one solid object with the lights either in or on it. it made no noise and  was not birds. i had to ask her if that could have been what we saw. she said there was no way it was birds.\r\ni go back outside of course and start looking up again because i am trying to stay calm. she asks me to come back in and shows me on here phone what she thought it looked like. it was one of those v shaped \"ufo's\". she said that is close to what she saw. again i am stunned. it is not like her to go look something up. but what we saw, something so not normal, she wanted an answer. i don't have one for her. then she says why don't you report it.  i can't believe what we saw. and she is right, i should. and to see if you can tell us it wasn't what we think it was.\r\n","distance":"101-500
