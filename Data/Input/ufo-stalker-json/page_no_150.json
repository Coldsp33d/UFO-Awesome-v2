things on the ground. all of the sudden, i got pulled into an underwater tunnel. when i emerged, i assure you, i was not in a dream anymore.\r\nwhen i surfaced, i felt cold, i was in water. my clothes were wet, i was panting but fully in control of my actions. there was a wooden dock in front of me, probably 5ft x 600?Ft. it was dark wood, unlike earth. it was porous and had a strange texture much like if a sponge was citified and very hard.\r\nit was an ocean world. as far as the eye can see in any direction it was water. on the horizon i saw 2 suns. one was large and one was dark orange and to the top right corner of the other.\r\ni was helped up on to the dock by what i believe was a gray alien. the 'eyes' were concave, with no eyeballs, eyebrows, or lashes. only skin covered them. the 'nose' was just 2 small thin slits, about the thickness of a pennie. and there was no mouth, also covered in skin.\r\ntheir skin was abrasive, and a light shade of gray, however, covering their skin were dark gray trapezoids of skin, much like birth marks but all over and about the size of a babies hand. this includes on the face.\r\nthe one that pulled me up acknowledged me, but instead of talking, he would lean his head close to mine. when he did this my head and brain felt warm/hot, and i would just have an understanding of what it was trying to communicate. i knew he was telling me to look behind me, and i did. \r\nwhat i saw were about 40 'dingy' boats of people coming to the dock, just like me.\r\n\r\nit dawned on me then. this was definitely real, because i got chills. i was fully aware of everything, i was making thoughts and connecting them, and nothing was happening against my will. everything i wanted to do i could. i felt the air, i smelt the air. and what really stood out, was i had a taste on my tongue.\r\ni believe people including myself were being sedated, and put under a strong hallucinogenic, to make us see boats instead of spacecraft.\r\ni believe this entity targeted me, because i fell off a dingy and swam to the dock myself, because when i looked up i saw a great ship docked maybe 300 yards from me. it was a grand sail boat, but instead of sails, i was long antennae, that were intricately connected with blinking parts. i was quickly directed otherwise.\r\nhe was walking with me along the dock, that connected to others. 2 others came to me and walked behind me. they stopped at a certain part of the dock and the main one looked at me. i can't remember everything he was communicating to me, but it had to do with the stars, and the suns. he knew i was overwhelmed and was not grasping it, so he took another approach. he taught me how their race greets one another, before i was departed back to earth. he took his right hand, palm towards his chest, and went from straight arm to bent to touch his palm to his chest. then he came out about 10 inches, and closed his hand, touched his chest again, and then reached out toward me slowly opening the hand. \r\nthey then escorted me quickly into what was once a ship was not a large scale dome building. it was yellowish in color with guards holding gold cylinders objects as some form of defense.\r\ni was getting tired, and was brought through about 4 different passages and hallways until i ended up in a room with 3 of them. they were all sitting in chairs reading books from a bookshelf around a bed. i laid in the bed, and i was trying so hard to know how they were communicating. i was wishing that i would be able to feel that warm feeling one last time, to get the overwhelming understanding one more time.\r\nwhen i fell asleep, i fell into another dream, just how you would at home. this dream was so different i almost don't remember it. \r\nwhen i was waking up i was in a small space pod, rocketing towards earth. i spent about 5 human seconds in the pod before i landed. when i was awake now in my bed, i was in an entirely different position with no covers on me. i was in sleep paralysis for about 15 seconds before i was able to get up.\r\ni was so intrigued about the experience i ran to my laptop and wrote everything down explicitly. an hour later my laptops circuit board fried completely, and my composition was lost forever.\r\nit has been two years since then, and i still remember every feel, eerie vision, and what was being communicated. i feel like i need to reach out to people and explain this because people need to know.","distance":"101-500

clothing. at some point i ended up on the front walkway by myself for a couple of minutes and it was at this time that something in the sky caught my eye. it was higher than the tree line, but not that vertically distant. it was whitish and somewhat see through and oblong shaped. it contracted as it moved through the sky from the southeast to the northwest. its movements reminded me of a jellyfish except it contracted laterally. i just stared at it and had no fear but thought it was seriously out of the ordinary and that i had never seen anything like that before, or since for that matter. it came from over the houses on my side of the street and i lost sight as it contracted/moved off in the distant in a straight line north/northwest (toward silver spring md/chevy chase md) over the houses across the street. i donât recall telling anyone until i was an adult, not out of fear, i donât think i thought a great deal of it at the time.

d'observation : formentera, balÃ£Â©ares. 12 aout 2017, puis 48 aprÃ£Â¨s, puis 24h aprÃ£Â¨s.\r\nj'ai toujours observÃ£Â© les Ã£Â©toiles, les Ã£Â©toiles filantes, les avions et les satellites sachant distinguer et diffÃ£Â©rencier ces derniers.\r\n\r\nj'ai observÃ£Â©, Ã£Â  partir de 23h05 (heure locale) et pendant une quinzaine de minutes : \r\n- un flash, \r\n- apparaissant de temps en temps, de faÃ£Â§on irrÃ£Â©guliÃ£Â¨re,\r\n- avec une intensitÃ£Â© variable : de faible Ã£Â  beaucoup plus puissante, \r\n- se dÃ£Â©plaÃ£Â§ant de faÃ£Â§on rÃ£Â©guliÃ£Â¨re dans son Ã£Â©volution mais sans aucune certitude sur un changement ou une absence de changement de direction. \r\n\r\nau regard de la dimension de la source de lumiÃ£Â¨re qui m'a semblÃ£Â© supÃ£Â©rieure aux reflets Ã£Â©mis par un satellite (progressif/dÃ£Â©gressif) et Ã£Â  l'intensitÃ£Â© du flash, je ne suis pas convaincu qu'il puisse s'agir d'un satellite. \r\n\r\na certains moments, sans une rÃ£Â©gularitÃ£Â© que j'aurais pu identifier, le flash Ã£Â©tait trÃ£Â¨s fort et se distinguait largement d'un satellite que j'ai pu observer au mÃ£Âªme moment sur une autre zone. \r\n\r\nj'ai essayÃ£Â© regrouper un maximum d'informations Ã£Â  destination de personnes plus calÃ£Â©es en la matiÃ£Â¨re, qui sauraient expliquer cette observation :\r\n\r\n- j'ai pris 2 photos, mais je ne pense pas qu'il soit possible d'en tirer que chose : \r\nappareil fixe (nikon df, sur pied. focale 70-200 2.8, calÃ£Â©e Ã£Â  105. iso : 4000. temps de pose : 8 secondes. raw).\r\nil y a 20 sec d'Ã£Â©cart entre les photos 1 et 2. \r\nje ne pense pas qu'il soit possible de se fier Ã£Â  la forme, le flash Ã£Â©voluant dans une direction, et le temps de pose ayant Ã£Â©tÃ£Â© de 8 secondes : il me semble que la forme de \"cigare\" est necessairement due au tps de pose. \r\n- j'ai fait des impressions d'Ã£Â©crans d'applications iphone intÃ£Â©grant mon orientation, ma position gps, les constellations,  etc.\r\nj'ai Ã£Â©videmment pensÃ£Â© Ã£Â  l'iss (station spatiale internationale). j'ai donc tÃ£Â©lÃ£Â©chargÃ£Â© 2 applications \"iss finder et iss spotter. \r\nde ce que j'ai compris de ces appli, l'iss n'aurait effectivement pas Ã£Â©tÃ£Â© loin ce jour lÃ£Â .\r\n48h plus tard, j'ai effectuÃ£Â© la mÃ£Âªme observation, dans la mÃ£Âªme zone. globalement la direction m'a semblÃ£Â© Ã£Âªtre lÃ£Â©gÃ£Â¨rement diffÃ£Â©rente. \r\nj'ai consultÃ£Â© ces 2 application pour vÃ£Â©rifier la position de l'iss qui est alors apparue comme Ã£Â©tant vers new york. il ne s'agit donc pas de l'iss.\r\na mon sens, la rÃ£Â©gularitÃ£Â© dans l'apparition, dans la vitesse d'Ã£Â©volution, laisseraient penser Ã£Â  un satellite, mais l'irrÃ£Â©gularitÃ£Â© de l'Ã£Â©mission des flash et leur puissance laisseraient penser le contraire. \r\nsur une echelle de 1 Ã£Â  10 avec une luminositÃ£Â© de 1 pour le reflet du soleil sur un satellite, la luminositÃ£Â© par flash serait pr moi Ã£Â  10. aisÃ£Â©ment 10 x plus

vehÃ­culo en la ruta y mi acompaÃ±ante de chofer viÃ³ unas luces que venÃ­an del este del lado del mar y volando muy bajo pero bastante lejos y penso que eran barcos en el mar aunque Ã©ste estÃ¡ a mÃ¡s de 20 km de la ruta.\r\ncomo a los 2 minutos las luces se habÃ­an acercado mucho mÃ¡s, eran blancas y muy brillantes y venÃ­an muy juntas pero no en formaciÃ³n directamente hacia la ruta.\r\npor la velocidad con que ibamos nosotros a 90 km/h y las luces en un momento pensÃ© que nos iban a chocar aunque venÃ­an mÃ¡s alto que una trafic, asÃ­ que parÃ© a costado del camino y en un instante las luces cruzaron la ruta a unos 30 metros de altura muy rÃ¡pido y haciendo un ruido apagado, se iluminÃ³ todo el campo mientras pasaban como quien alumbra con una luz muy potente desde arriba para abajo.\r\nnos cruzaron por delante como a 150 metros adelante nuestro y las vimos irse para el oeste en lÃ­nea recta a la mayorÃ­a, algunas luces subieron despues de cruzar la ruta y se fueron para al suroeste.\r\napenas medio minuto despuÃ©s que pasaron las luces escuchamos un ruido apagado y pasÃ³ casi por arriba nuestro un helicÃ³ptero totalmente blanco muy rÃ¡pido que parecÃ­a seguir a las luces, entonces nos bajamos de la trafic y lo seguimos con la vista como si iba perdiendo en la noche y las luces mucho mas allÃ¡.\r\nmi acompaÃ±ante de chofer mi seÃ±alÃ³ para arriba y vimos pasar tambien pero mas arriba tal vez como a 300 metros una silueta como de un aviÃ³n pero era muy fino y con las alas muy finas y largas, y no tenÃ­a luces asÃ­ que no sabemos lo que era pero iba siguiendo a las luces y al helicÃ³ptero.\r\nnos quedamos como 5 minutos y seguimos viaje para llegar a horario.\r\nse habÃ­an despertado un par de pasajeros pero no vienos las luces ni lo otro, pero nosotros vimos todo muy bien.\r\nmi acompaÃ±ante tratÃ³ de hacer un video con el celular pero no se ve nada, solo unas luces movidas y el resto oscuridad.","distance":"101-500

recording trash drop-offs. sucks, but what can you do, right?)\r\n\r\nwell, i was sitting at the courtyard 4 loading dock, facing outward toward courtyard 4. i was watching the clouds to see what the weather would be like that day, when a small craft approximately 15 feet wide and 25 feet long made a left-hand arc which started when i first saw it over the central plant cooling towers (at the domestic parking garage), making a left-hand arc over the roadway and courtyard 4, ending when it went over the building directly overhead of courtyard 4. it couldn't have been more than 20 feet above the itb (international terminal) roof.\r\n\r\nthe craft was nearly black and uniform in color, with a slightly lighter colored canopy that was far too small for any person to fit. it had no lights, and no markings.\r\n\r\nat the front of the craft, it looked like a regular airplane fuselage, but it didn't have wings. it had short \"wing stubs\" on each side of the fuselage at the front, those sections were only ~4 feet long each. at the ends, they wrapped downward to form vertical \"pods\" ~4 feet in height and ~2 feet wide each. in  the center-front of the craft was a similar pod, ~3 feet in height.\r\n\r\nat the rear of the craft were two additional vertical pods, one on each side with shorter ~2 foot \"wing stubs\". these pods were ~3 feet in height and ~2 feet wide. all the pods were rounded on the bottom.\r\n\r\nthe craft made a jet sound, but not very loud. i heard the doppler-shifted jet sound for ~15 seconds after the craft was out of sight.\r\n\r\nmy first thought upon seeing it was \"what the @*!& is that?\", then i looked around at the people smoking cigarettes (the smoking pad used to be at the courtyard 4 loading dock, but they moved it around the corner outside recently) to see if anyone else had seen it... apparently none had, then i thought \"how did that thing fly with no wings?\"\r\n\r\nmy next thought was to call control and ask if there were any drones flying in the area... but then i thought, \"that thing didn't have any markings or lights, and it was flying in an active airport airspace... and it didn't have any wings... i'm not touching that with a 10 foot pole.\"\r\n\r\ni'd draw the thing, but i lack any artistic ability whatsoever. i've searched online for drones that match, but found nothing even close.","distance":"21-100
