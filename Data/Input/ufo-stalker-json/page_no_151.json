in my parents dining room. it was dark outside and i had the lights dimmed. something told me to look outside, i'm not sure if i actually heard a voice or if i just had an extremely strong feeling. when i looked out the window, i saw a dark and slim figure standing about 10 ft away from the house. i thought someone was just walking through my yard, until the creature opened its eyes. its eyes were piercing red and almost looked like they were glowing. because of this, i have an extreme fear of looking into dark spaces or looking out windows when it's dark outside.\r\n\r\n2. a few years after my first experience, i had a terrifying vision while i was asleep. i saw my grandfather, who was vacationing in florida at the time, laying face down on a tile floor and surrounded by blood. there was a tall figure in a long black cloak with a hood standing next to my grandfathers body that had the same red eyes as i saw before. i then woke up from my dream to see the same hooded figure standing in a corner in my bedroom which then suddenly disappeared. i ran to my parents room screaming and told them the story after they woke up. my mother had to convince my father to call the hotel that his father was staying in to have someone check on my grandfather. the employee put my father on hold to go to the room my grandfather was staying in. a few minutes later, the employee picked up the phone and frantically told my father that my grandfather was in the bathroom when he fell and hit his head which caused a lot of bleeding and also knocked him out. when they found him, he was lying face down on the tile floor surrounded by blood. when they got him to the hospital, they determined that he had a stroke. to brighten the story a little, he did survive. \r\n\r\n3. i was driving home from work one night at around 10pm. i turned onto my parents street (which didn't have any lights so it was pitch black) when i saw an object running towards the street. i slammed on my brakes and watched as a dark green, scaly creature with bight red eyes ran in front of my car and into the woods. that was the last time i saw a creature like that.","distance":"20 Feet or

my wife, daughter and son retire to bed. night before the eclipse. my oldest son and i decided it was a cool night with a light breeze. no bugs. stars were phenomenal. we set up chairs facing west northwest. beautiful unobstructed view of the stars. a hint of the milky way. no clouds. fire dying out to glowing coals. sitting and talking about the perseids we saw two weeks ago up in wisconsin hoping we could catch a few shooting stars. we catch a few faint ones and then set up our iphones on the nightcap app. within the app there is a shooting star setting. it takes a five second open aperture shot on loop. it keeps clicking off shots until you stop it or it hits 290 shots. then it computes how many to save that had light events or movements. you have to position your phone against a stable object to keep any stars from blurring. it takes ok shots of meteors  but they stand out against the points of light that are planets and stars . so my son and i are talking. we start to see a few faint meteors followed by a few real fire balls. a good show seeing 1 or 2 about every 20 minutes or so. then we see the strangest thing. a meteor shoot up from the horizon. never seen that before. but figuring the earth is round, sure. about three minutes later ( the whole time the iphone clicking away) we see a almost horizontal fireball shoot across the sky. but instead of a straight trajectory it shoots in a strange curved almost \"u\" shape. but instead of the common burn out on most meteors it just blinks out. we give each other a high five excited we both saw it. it was very bright. high altitude. faster then anything i have ever seen in the night sky. but unusual in its trajectory. we talk about it. stay out till 1 am and collect our phones and go to bed. as i'm laying in bed i see i caught a series from one fireball. i note the first three captures at 12:01. progressive fireball. \r\n\r\nagain. there was no other light source near us to reflect anything. this was all high altitude. and we never noticed the object. however we were getting up and moving around and there were moments we were not staring at the sky. \r\n\r\ni tried zooming on the object. unable to identify. and although it was pitch black except for the stars i can't explain it. if you notice. the stars in the background are crisp. if it were an image of a blurred star all of the stars would be blurred. \r\nthe biggest hangup was the speed at which the previous \" meteor\" was traveling and it's obvious altitude. and how it traveled in almost a cursive u course. how bright it was and the way it's \" tail\" hung in the sky as if it were almost drawn with a white glowing pen\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),

i see an object hovering what looks to be about 20 feet over the top of full grown oak trees. this area of the interstate is wooded and has no homes or landscaped properties. i pulled out my iphone 7 in time to snag a picture of the object from the front windshield over my car. as i passed the object i looked back to get another glimpse of it, but it vanished before i could do so (and let me tell you, i was looking hard). i was the only person in my car. there were a few cars in front of and behind me, but unfortunately i wasn't acquainted with any of them. i was driving 75 mph and could only get one picture without putting other drivers in danger by not paying attention at the wheel. \r\n     i've been living here for 26 years, driving up and down that same stretch of interstate,  and have never seen anything like it in my life. nor has my father, brother, sister, brother in law, multiple farmers, pilots and just about everybody i know. nobody can give me a good explanation of what it might be. it's not balloons because they weren't moving in the wind, and they weren't rising or falling. there was no string or rope attached to it anchoring it in place. pieces of the object on its right superior, right  inferior, and dorsal side. i'm a realist and i don't jump to conclusions by making guesses as to what it could be. i don't attribute coincidental or improbable events to superstitions. this post is my attempt to see if anybody else has seen objects like this or knows what it may be. it's driving me crazy that nobody knows what it is!
