{"content":[{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Beech Mountain","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On tuesday august 29th i stepped outside an early morning and looked up over the mountain ridge because there was a very bright light shining. it was so bright that it made me squint my eyes and look away. so i looked again to try and distinguish what kind of bright light would be in that area of the mountain. \r\n\r\ni noticed that there was also a smaller light next to it. the smaller light was stationary at first but then it began flashing it's light like a pulsation. i thought it was another \"not of this world\" things. i became a little unnerved because both lights were directly in front of me shining down over the ridge towards my condominium -and when it begin pulsating i felt that the smaller light sensed my presence outdoors. as i watched contemplating i felt that the pulsating light was a form of morse code. i also felt that it was a \"sensing\" tool. then i noticed there was a aura haze of light stretching wide behind the two lights. also a little further down the mountain ridge another auric light fanned out over the ridge and into the sky ... and further down the ridge another aura of light shaped like a dome. all of the auras we're  hazy lit up and stretched wide along the ridge.\r\n\r\nas i looked back to the large bright light it then appeared to gently brighten and dim while the smaller bright light continued its random pulsing of light but now blue and green lights were pulsing with the light.\r\n i then recalled just before the solar eclipse in that same location - i had witnessed three lights hovering in the sky shaped into a wide triangle pattern. at that time those lights were bright white and then began pulsating a rotation of red blue and green. two other previous  sightings did the same thing but those moved and we're only two lights.\r\n\r\n i realize that it was another strange event (and we have many here), but then i felt that whatever \"it\" was  did sense my presence outside i decided to go back inside to bed (and i did quickly) haha i figured i would check the location for the next couple of days to see if the lights we're still present. if so, i would chalk it up to something weird but natural. however, on both occasions, i checked at the same time and other times and for 3 days after the sightings and saw nothing of like again.\r\n\r\ni have had, and witnessed, along with other residents, multiple experiences and unexplained light sightings in this specific area of the mountain. the mountain area is on the 37th parallel loop so i am not surprised i just wanted to report and give confirmation to others who may be seeing mysterious things in this area.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":86376,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.2109584,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08312017-0006","longitude":-81.8890031,"occurred":1503964800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North

06, 2017, right outside my front door of my apartment. i stepped outside to have my last cigarette for the evening before going to bed. i first spotted the lightly glowing orb in the sky about 10 feet high from the horizon to the southwest direction from me. i ran in the apartment and grabbed my alcatel firce 5 cell phone. i took a couple of pictures and a short video. if i would have known how strange it would turn out to look i would have taken a longer video. at first view, it looks like a full moon with a moth in the shot. however, that discounts what i saw up in the sky. also the moon was on the other side of the roofline of my apartment to the east of where i was standing. the faintlybglowing orb contuted in my direction until it reached the large bright, multicolored object. i couldn't believe the speed and right angle turned it was making. anyway, after a few seconds of filming, i thought it's probably nothing that odd and went inside. i then looked at the pictures and video and was amazed at what my cell phone had captured. i then texted my sister and aunt a copy of the pictures. after trying all night, i never did figure out how to text a copy of the video.\r\nsince then, i have watched the video countless times and still can't understand what i'm seeing. i have pressed play, then as quick as i can, press pause, in an effort to get a frame by frame shot. once paused, i take a screenshot of the paused image of the video. i don't have a computer or tablet or anything. i just bought a printer and have figured out i can print pictures directly

high school i spotted a strange formation in the sky that i found odd. they were in the air ssw of me at about a 30 degree to 45 degree angle in the air, just above the treeline for observation. i do not know their altitude or distance from me but they appeared to have been over the minnesota river at least 3 miles or so away. i have worked in the past for an airlines and a major airport as well as air shows so i have seen many different aircraft in the air and in formations. this formation, and the objects just did not look quite normal. i first spotted them around 14:12. the sky was partly cloudy and the object were well below any cloud cover there may be. \r\n\r\nat first i thought that it might be a two aircraft but the the flight movement just did not look quite correct and as they moved i notice what could be a larger aircraft was four object in a row. i was just about to blow it off as a group of birds, maybe geese when i noticed that the formation is not one birds, or even aircraft fly in. it looked like this:\r\n\r\n      *\r\n\r\n      * \r\n           *        /\\\r\n      *             || direction of flight\r\n                    ||\r\n      *\r\n\r\nthe formation did change to where the one off object switched sides mirroring the original formation.\r\n\r\nthey appeared to make some odd movement to the right then one by one they pulsed a white light flash then appeared to disappear. these objects as stated were well below any cloud cover.\r\n\r\nthe best description i can give of these 5 objects are that they were black orbs that appeared to have maybe 2 antenna(?) like objects protruding from on top, like this:\r\n     \r\n\r\n        \\ /\r\n         o\r\n\r\nbut much shorter than the attempt of an image i tried to do.\r\n\r\nthe sighting lasted about 2 minutes to 3 at most. the flash flair and disappearance happened when i was just south of pioneer trail and audubon road. there were no other objects in the sky that i could observe, aircraft or fowl. i was looking around to see if there were any other objects but the sky was clear except the objects i was witnessing to.\r\n\r\ni am a skeptic when it comes to alien encounter stories, but am open minded enough to know that there are strange things in the universe. how i feel about this after? i want to know if anyone else saw this. these objects reminded me of the stories of the phoenix lights, russian lights and other encounters people have seen like those, except these were dark orbs only flashing a light before they disappeared.\r\n\r\nplease, if any others saw this i would like to know.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

when i noticed that there was a strange looking flying craft with bright lights 2  that  really stood out but the whole craft was very lit up.,it was coming from my south side from across a pasture. i quickly grabbed my cell phone and started recording on video.The craft comes across the pasture then gets in front of me and is flying directly above the road in front of me as i'm recording it. i am driving and taping at the same time. we go like this for awhile when i then notice there are 2 star size lights or orbs that are falling from the craft. a few seconds after this i actually go under the craft and i look up through my sun roof and can see the bottom of it, it appeared to be square, and lit underneath, it's hard to recall but seemed to have maybe pink and blue lighting??? i didn't get that on video because i was driving . very shortly after that i found a driveway to pull into so that i could get out and see this thing. after i pulled into the driveway which was now in front of the craft i grabbed my cell and tried to get more video, i could see the craft, it was hovering in a clearing in the direction i just came from it was lit up and unusual looking. you can at this point hear the sound of it on my video but  you can't see it. it then goes straight back in the direction we had just came from, i heard some people across the street talking and i went over to ask if they saw it, it was a ways back behind their house, but they were under their carport at the time and didn't see it, but one of the men said that they heard something.Then i went on to work.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other, Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with

restaurant behind our home viewing the eclipse.  i started recording the sun hoping it would get darker than it actually did.  we did get to see some stars but the glare from the sun was still bright.  but never the less i still recorded it for about 3 min until it was over.  there was one cloud not very large but it made it's way in front of the sun.  we were afraid it would affect viewing.  i was watching through my phone.  i did not notice anything at the time of filming just taking in the experience but a few day's later when i reviewed the footage i watched it a few times did not really notice anything i paused it to go se what my dog was barking at and when i came back to finish up i noticed an odd square shadow protruding 3 dimensionally through the cloud so i watched it over a few times and what i saw was and dark shadow that seemed to rotate about 25 degree's to one side protrude for a few seconds through the cloud and the leading edge appeared to stick out from behind the cloud.  it was not normal in the motion so i took screen shots and zoomed in on it as well.  i have seen a ufo about 10yrs ago and reported it and remembered at work today that you all had this form that we could submit.  good thing is this time i have photo's and video.  it could be shadows made by the eclipse but i have never seen shadows form into perfect cubes before.  i wish i would have recorded more. there was also a phenomena of weird streaks going across the ground about once every few seconds.  you can hear us talking about it on the video.  we all had this weird feeling that i chalked up to something primordial from our natural reaction to seeing this.  everything was so calm no wind no noise it was an amazing experience.  i really hope you find this interesting.  and i hope i have something here. in the video if you will focus on the grey triangle shadow just below the sun in the cloud and watch it seems to turn on it's side and to the right of the cloud you can see it peek out.","distance":"Over One

casually looking up into the night sky at stars towards the south when something caught my eye moving from the north. my immediate reaction was that it was a flock of geese. when i looked directly at them i realized the \"flock\" was three lights in an equilateral triangle shaped formation moving overhead. the lights were not point lights like i would expect from an airplane or helicopter but fuzzy without defined edges more similar to what would be expected from lights moving through fog or clouds. as it continued to move quickly from directly overhead to the south it began to fade out and then faded back but not as bright and then faded out again, completely disappearing. the entire event only lasted about 5 seconds and the object was completely silent. the size of the object was approximately the size of three fingers width as viewed from an outstretched arm. the 3 lights were each approximately the size of a pencil eraser held from an outstretched arm. \r\n\r\nother things i had considered these lights to be were satellites, possibly flaring but the object were moving too fast across the sky and the lights much much too large and finally. i also considered that they could be balloons but the shape was an equilateral triangle which would be hard to maintain as well as the lights being fuzzy and fading out so quickly and there wasn't any wind. i considered spotlights but the sky was clear that evening, no clouds. also, although fuzzy, the lights were perfectly round so the spotlight would have had to have been directly underneath pointed straight up otherwise the shapes would have been increasingly elliptical as it moved. there wasn't a spot beam to trace from the ground up to the lights. i considered aircraft but there wasn't any sound. the lights did not blink and they were not point lights. \r\n\r\ni did not see a solid object but because the lights formed an equilateral triangle and moved in unison it seemed like a single solid object. if so, either it was transparent or the surface reflection was identical to the background night sky. there were stars that evening but as the lights passed overhead they washed out background starlight so i was unable to determine whether it was a solid object or three objects.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,
