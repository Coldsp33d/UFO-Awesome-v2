australia near the township of kingaroy with one other person. we observed many unusual orb like object darting across the sky which started our intregue with the night sky last night.  some were meteorites yet others were different altogether. i was standing facing north next to another individual when a strange feeling came over me that caused me to look back over my right shoulder and upward to the south east direction. i noted a large high altitude object that moved incredibly slow.  unless you watched it it looked stationary but using line of sight and landmarks determined the object to be moving from the north in a southerly direction.  we watched it for a little over 10 mins as it headed south past power lines, edge of roof of house, and over the bunya mountain region.  earlier we had commercial jets head north west to north queensland yet this object was much higher and much much larger than those planes we had seen earlier. my colleague also watched this massive object move so slowly until it disappeared in the south to the east of the bunya mountains. i was amazed and could not speak during the event out of shock and excitement at what we saw.  this was larger than a city and can only be described as a massive mother ship in a typical cigar design. we saw the object disappear into the southern horizon around 2:26am.  i have never seen anything like it before and for hours after all i could say was \"fu$k wow\".  i just couldnt say anything else out of shock.  the massive cigar object had a bright light at either end and between was the dark shape of the body of the 'vehicle' (if thats the right word to use).  we have talked about it all day today and just cant get it off our minds.  we continue to stay watching the night sky until 4am.  we saw one other object which repeatedly came out of nowhere with massive bright light and then a swift darting back and forth to the same locations.  this final event was just prior to 4am.

about 4 ft wide and 3-4 feet high at ground level. soft but brilliant glow. i looked up at sky (thinking it could be moon light) when i looked back down the light slowly diminished into the ground at the base of 2-3 trees with trunks close together. it maintained it's dome shape while sinking into the ground. the light was very bright white with a sort of blue overtone (like those high speed car head lights).\r\n\r\nright after the light disappeared underground, a super bright white beam shown through my back fence and traveled along the fence line until it was just about in front of the trees where the dome shaped light disappeared. at that point, the beam light disappeared as well. my fence is not solid, theres a plank in front and then a plank in back and so on. sort of slatted. i thought perhaps a car was backing out of it's driveway and reflected onto the fence, but i'm in the end unit of 6 townhouses and there's no break for light to shine from the front.  the light beam appeared to be about 10 inches in length and moved slowly the length of the fence line (about24 feet).\r\n\r\nat first i thought it came from above (the dome shaped light) and looked for the moon. when i was convinced there was nothing above to generate the light i fixated on, it and it immediately began to \"withdraw\" into the ground. it disappeared slowly - but maintained an even rate of descent. the edge of the light dome remained \"fuzzy\" until it disappeared. i remember saying out loud \"what the hell is that?\" \r\n\r\nwhen the vertical beamed light shown on the fence line and traveled from one end of my fence line to the other i became quite nervous. it moved almost as slow at the dome light withdrew. i glanced at the back of my house expecting to see a continuation of the beam reflected, but there was no light on the house or on the lawn. the beam through the fence was only about 2 feet off the ground level.\r\n\r\nonce the beam disappeared my heart was racing - i could hear nothing at all...But went back inside the house. i did notice when i first went out on the deck how incredibly silent it was out there. normally i'd hear night noises (critters etc) - but

the west was flying extremely high but, what captivated my attention was that a star seemed like it was inside our atmosphere and even as low as a cloud would appear..So i asked my wife, \"do you see that\"...So she starting noticing the same thing that i was, and was super amazed at the glowing object that looked like it was a diamond shaped chrome object that was shining so bright as if it had its own light illuminating from itself that it was amazing! we watched for at least 2 mins and my wife decided to get out her camera phone and as she was about to record it, it disappeared as if it teleported or something...Simply amazing! i'm definetely a firm believer that other beings exist outside of this world...And the technology they have is simply unbelievable to our kind that it baffled us that we actually seen this!\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

at the clock right away and saw that it said 3:02 pm mtn  i watched the object for a few seconds then lost it in the sun. i drove back a bit to see if i could see it from where i first saw it but had not luck so i drove forward again and spotted it again further west. only watched it for a few more seconds and then it was gone.   the object was traveling sw when i first noticed it. as i said it was metallic in color and reflected the sun.  from where i saw it, it appeared to be cigar/ pencil shape.  i do not know how far off it was  but if i was to hold a silver pen up to my face that would be about what i saw.  i have tried to contact the local airport and have not gotten hold of anyone. i have also called the sheriffs office and no one else had reported anything at the time. the object was just below the sun.  later in the day i watched a prop plane and a jet take off. they both made sound even after i could not see them anymore. this object made no sound.","distance":"Over One

over lone star lake, we saw straight ahead an red orange glow in the sky just above the clouds. this was a huge glow. our first thought was a house fire or something of the sort. so we immediately turned off the highway and drove towards the light, only the further we drove west to it the farther west it would get from us. about 15 min later it just whooshed up and away into the clouds.\r\n\r\nwe were baffled by the experience and i still would like to know what it was over jenkins, texas.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
