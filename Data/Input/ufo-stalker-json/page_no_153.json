maui, hawaii. while driving south on south kihei road between kamaole beach park 2 and 3 mid-afternoon, i saw a ufo.\r\n\r\ni first heard a loud crackling noise like green wood exploding in a fire with a simultaneous heavy odor of charcoal or oil burning. in a few seconds i felt heat, like standing close to a fire-pit. then through the top right-hand front windshield i saw a meteor or volcanic rock, round, ball-like, a gnarled blackish body about the size of a small car, all submerged in a furious fire of red (close to the body),then yellow and bluish of constant spurts, leaving a trail of flames about the length of the body itself with a long, dense,oil-gray trail.\r\n\r\nit was flying steadily straight and level, as if controlled. my van was going about 35, and the object's speed was slightly more, about 40mph. it was just above the palm trees on the road, and i could see the fronds wilt from the heat as the object passed over them. the height would have been between 50 to a hundred feet.\r\n\r\nthe ufo continued down the line of palm trees along the road curving to the right along the park with the seashore close by. it never varied in speed or direction, and continued to sound a raucous popping/crackling, sounds so close together it was like a 'roar'. it continued also emitting a profusion of bright eruptions of flames from constant small explosions on the exterior of the black ball, so dense that the body was generally obscured, while leaving from that bright tail of flame a dense smelly oily black/gray trail (black then changing into gray as it dissipated).\r\n\r\ni watched for approximately a minute while driving (i checked my watch) as it continued out of sight.When i stopped i noticed the heat on the side of my van and the greasiness on my face and the van. there was still a gagging  effluence in the air.\r\n\r\nwhat most impressed me was the torrid nature of the object as it did not seem a 'vehicle' with the controlled ease of the flight.\r\n\r\ni opened the newspaper the next day expecting commentary to find nothing. i never reported it as it was so unusual as to not fit into any category of a 'standard' ufo. my hawaiian friends said it was not an unknown phenomenon and probably a disembodied 'kahuna' checking the aina.\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100

music and trying to go to sleep. i don't know what made me notice it- one moment i was just lying there, the next my gaze was glued to the object. it was rather far away from me, and high in the sky- but big. around two or three times the size of what venus looks like in the night sky. it moved in a steady and somewhat fast line, going down towards the horizon. it looked just like a normal star, but huge and moving. the oddest part, though, was the emotional response it elicited from me. i tend to be a very emotionally reserved person- i hardly ever cry or express any other extremes. however, at the sight of this white light in the sky i felt both awe and panic. i even teared up- i have no idea why. my mind was frozen for a moment in panic as it moved down to the horizon, but once it was nearly gone i started racing through thoughts, trying to figure out what it was.\r\ni know it wasn't just a trick of light on the window- there were no lights on in my room, and at one point a large tree blocked the view of it. i considered airplane and missile as well, though there was no impact and the light wasn't blinking- i mention impact because it looked like it would hit the earth eventually with its trajectory, though i have no way to confirm this. it couldn't have been a meteor, either- it had no tail, and was much too big and slow to be a shooting star, not to mention there's too much light pollution in my area to even see a shooting star. it wasn't exceptionally fast or slow- though it was faster than it was slower. i don't believe it was a satellite either, as it wasn't a sudden flash but a steady, consistent light.\r\nafter getting over the initial shock, a new feeling dawned on me- i was scared. i had this feeling that i wasn't supposed to see that. i texted my friends about it, and something i repeated over and over in my attempt to articulate how it made me feel was, \"it was wrong. it was very very wrong. i wasn't supposed to see that. whatever that was, it was wrong.\" i stared at the spot i'd seen it go in hopes of it reappearing, but it never did as far as i know.\r\nthe photo attached is from earlier in the year, but of the same location and

the camera spotted a very fast object passing behind the aircraft. assuming a bird was ruining my photo, didn’t care more about it. when downloading the images to the computer, and after choosing the best one (and cropped to have a better view) i spotted a dark spot. then a recall the assumed bird and zoom it. that's when i found that it was not a bird at all (i have caught a lot of them and they look like this). also appears not to be a drone, because of shape and size but specially because i used hi speed shutter 1/2000 and no propeller is visible, not even blurred.\r\nhis motion was very fast and passed behind the airplane in a fraction in straight line from east to west (aprox.), over southern sky.\r\nwhat it is i do not know? that's why i am reporting it.\r\nwill be happy to get

had recorded video of an event involving a ufo and a grey alien with his iphone, and had sent him the video by iphone.  the caller described the video:  the friend had been sitting in a restaurant outdoors near a body of water.  a flying disc is in view over the water; jets (which may be f-16s) occasionally buzz this craft.  the camera [briefly] focuses on an approaching waiter.  suddenly a “grey alien” [whose head and hands appear to be an off-white] about three feet tall, dressed in all black clothes, appears [standing in a bocce ball court] adjacent to the restaurant area.  a waiter walks up to the alien, who is seen to blink his eyes at a couple of points.  the alien puts his fingertips on the forehead of the waiter, as if performing a mind meld.  the waiter walks away and makes a phone call.  the caller’s friend asked the waiter what the alien said.  the waiter translated for him:  “many animals in the world.  we are all animals.”  the camera pans back towards where the alien was standing, who has disappeared.  a wall forms the boundary of the bocce ball court; the caller said it was too high for the alien to have jumped over.  at the end of the video, the craft approaches the restaurant, and everyone runs for cover.  some strange sounds are heard in the video, as well as garbled music.  i asked the caller for just his first name, which he supplied.  he said he wants no publicity, nor does his friend.  he agreed to send the video to the mufon assistant state director, who has an iphone, and he did so.","distance":"21-100

 through a small wisp of cloud. at first the only lights were crimson red and there were two of them. then the red lights went out and smaller green and blue lights  began to flash back-and-forth. then the blue and green lights went out and out red lights came back. in between these times they would go out for short periods of time. when no lights were visible  i could see a definitive structure against the back ground of the sky.  after it came through the cloud it shot straight up like a bullet to about 500 feet then drifted south slowly toward us, untill  it was nearly right above us.  it was then i saw the definite shape of a triangle. it then hovered still for about 10 minutes,  before drifting slowly in a north west direction.  when it reached the distance where i almost couldn't see the outline anymore of it, all lights went out for a short period, then a very intense white blue light enveloped the whole craft, then got even more intense, before winking out and disappearing completely as if it  warped through a portal, disappearing completely. the time spent reviewing the craft was around 15 minutes. not even 10 minutes later, two black military helicopters  appeared out of nowhere and seemed to circle the area for a short time. then they seemed to return to wherever they came from. they were unsuccessful in making contact with the craft. when it initially shot upwards, the fluidity of that motion was unlike any maneuver i've ever witnessed from any other aircraft.  one might say it is a impossible maneuver given that it was very still, then suddenly ascended  at a rapid rate.  the cell phone seemed to be affected and made it difficult to film. but we did manage to get two short videos, and i uploaded them to my youtube account.  my name on my youtube channel is \"jesse bauer\".  my profile picture is a picture of me playing guitar.  i add this information because my phone no longer has the video on it it only exists on youtube.  they are titled ufos over old forge part one and part two.  two of our cell phones were unable to maintain filming the craft, that is why the videos aren't the best. but it does show there was something in the sky. the videos mysteriously disappeared off of my phone and a friends phone the next day. approximately 20 people in all witnessed the event. some neighbors were visibly shaken from witnessing the event.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:13:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other, Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

lumineuse dans le ciel, la boule ã©tait environ 2 mm de diamã¨tre. ã‡a semblait ãªtre trã¨s trã¨s loin. \r\n\r\ncette boule se dã©plaã§ait de haut en bas et de gauche ã  droite, alã©atoirement. je dirais que les dã©placements se faisaient dans un rayon de 3 cm carrã©. \r\n\r\ncela m'a grandement intriguã©. je me suis levã©e pour aller aux toilettes et chercher mon cellulaire dans la maison. et je suis retournã© ã  l'extã©rieur filmer le phã©nomã¨ne. je me sentais calme, seulement intriguã©e. je n'avais pas peur.\r\n\r\nmon fils s'est alors rã©veillã© et il m'a demandã© ce qu'il se passait. je lui ai dit qu'il y avait une boule blanche dans le ciel qui bougeait. il a regardã© avec moi la boule. il ã©tait tout aussi intriguã© que moi. \r\n\r\nj'ai filmã© ã  2 reprises. la premiã¨re fois, j'ai filmã© avec le zoom de mon cellulaire. mais je ne voyais pas grand chose. alors, j'ai filmã© sans zoom. j'ai pensã© aller rã©veiller mon chum pour lui montrer, mais il ã©tait tard et j'avais froid. alors, je me suis recouchã©e. l'objet ã©tait encore dans le ciel lorsque je me suis recouchã©e. \r\n\r\nce n'est que le lendemain matin que j'ai parlã© de l'ã©vã©nement ã  mon beau-pã¨re. je lui ai montrã© les vidã©os, mais on ne voyait pas grand chose. et je n'ai pas pensã© zoomer les vidã©os pour mieux voir.\r\n\r\nce n'est que le soir, lorsque mon conjoint est rentrã© ã  la maison, que je lui ai parlã© de l'ã©vã©nement. et que nous avons regardã© la vidã©o. j'ai alors pensã© zoomer la vidã©o sur mon cellulaire. et c'est lã  que j'ai vu le cercle qui tournait sur lui mãªme. et c'est lã  que j'ai rã©alisã© que ce que j'avais vu n'ã©tait pas quelque chose de â«normalâ». ã‡a me ressemblait pas ã  un avion, ni un hã©licoptã¨re, ni un mã©tã©orite, ni une ã©toile filante. \r\n\r\nbref, c'est ã  partir des vidã©os zoomã©es que j'ai rã©alisã© que j'avais ã©tã© tã©moin de quelque chose de vraiment bizarre. et j'ai alors regrettã© de ne pas avoir rã©veillã© mon conjoint.
