to teach the next day. my dog was sat next to me on the sofa until he got up quickly and barked franticly at the window before running to the front door, as if he had seen something. i got up and checked and saw nothing. my tv and radio connection also did any internet connection that we had. while taking a look at the plugs and the cables my girlfriend came down complaining that she could hear a rumbling noise from out of the bathroom window that lasted for about 30 seconds. we started to see an extremely bright, clouded light out side the window that lit up our garden, we both ran down to the back door and looked out, the dog still hysterically barking outside. i saw a weirdly shaped dark object that seemed to be hovering in a stationary in one place over the top of the street. our garden was no longer lit so it was obvious that it had ascended higher into the sky. at this point we made our way outside and watched it for about and tried to contact a friend down the street on the phone but it wasn't working. i haven't seen or heard of any kind of aircraft like it in my life as i used to be in the air force. soon after it seemed to ascend higher into the sky, and suddenly shot into nowhere. i never took my eye of the object however it seemed to have disappeared at a shocking speed.\n\nwe headed back indoors and i quickly drew what i had seen, within the hour our phone started to work again and we received calls from two people down the street who had seen the same thing. we realised that our dog was no where around the house and could not find him in the gardens. we walked the streets most of the night trying to find him. about 4 pm the next day he was found outside the door. he was not the same as he normally was and seemed depressed and made no noise and had a mark above his tale where it looks like his fur had been burned, like he ran past a flame and with left with painful raw skin. no one in our small street said that they had seen him out last night. and no sightings of fire. i have never seen anything like this and the sighting terrified my girlfriend and myself. for the last day, i feel different as my voice seems higher as well as i feel that being shocked at the time, mentally effected me, my girlfriend and other people down the street, its upsetting as we have no answers.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,  Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional

from the right to left, then hovering for 45 minutes more then made its way slowly back to the right, then began to descend downward at an angle. i thought it was strange from the beginning because once it abruptly moved; 5 minutes later a plane appeared. it seemed to cross right underneath it. within this time, i showed my dad. he said it was strange and looked through the binoculars as well, but the cold weather pushed his curiousity away. so i moved inside the sliding door, proped my elbows on the bar and pushed the binoculars against the window to secure the object in eyesite. when i noticed it was descending slowly then i was really convinced i wasnt just seeing things. ive seen two sitings before here in marrietta and both late at night. but oddly enough it seems to be in the same direction. also somewhat near the airforce base. which convinces me further that it is some type of aircraft. over the years ufo's have become a huge interest of mine but often i try to create scientific explainations. although, sometimes i just cant seem to rule out the possibility. once descended, it then dissappeared. the show began around 130, and ended at 245. next thing i know im sitting here on the couch typing this story. im grateful for what ive witnessed, but there seems to be some hot spot around here. as i watched it.. i really, truley, realized that it was descending after hovering for so long, and all the colors that flashed with it i was baffeled. ive questioned the other sites but this one made the book.

was just about to disappear behind the roof of a house when i continued my gaze higher to look at the night sky as it was a exceptionally clear night. i didn't initially see the objects in motion until they crossed my vision. i did't see them approaching until almost in front of me but they became clearer and brighter as they got right above me, almost like the reason i didn't see them right away was because of the flatter angle to my right.As they moved from west to east what initially looked like a shadow moving from right to left became clearer right overhead and in a direct line of sight. two triangular shaped objects, identical in size with rounded corners, moved in formation at what could best be described as a leisurely pace. given the approximate altitude they didn't seem to be more than 1200 feet off the ground and moving faster than a small plane. two things stand out though, they're positions in relation to each other did not vary considering how close they were to each other and they made no sound and that really made an impression on me. as they moved from right to left,they faded from my view almost within 500 line feet and i can only guess that as their departing angle increased they faded from view. i knew right away as to what i had just seen and went inside to tell my wife. going back outside to see if something like that were to happen again would be like finding the proverbial needle in the haystack. i already had found the needle and it was in my hand.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

birds or balloons. there was a slight breeze blowing so if they were balloons then they would have deviated from their posistion. also i find it difficult to beleive that 2 birds spaced about 20 yards apart could both hover with no spreading or flapping of wings. later as i was driving back to my station, i passed some balloons tethered above a shopping center a few miles east. these balloons were obvious balloons and only reached to treetop level, whereas the objects sighted earlier had no tether and were at least 1000 feet up.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

i can only speculate. if it was an aircraft it was moving to slow to achieve aerodynamic lift and i could not hear any noise. \r\n\r\nafter the lights were gone i continued scanning the sky to see if they would reappear somewhere else. after a few minutes i spotted two orange lights hovering near a brightly lit drilling rig 5-10 miles to the west. these two moved independently of each other moving slowly in opposite directions. they were visible for about 15 seconds and were also somewhat dimmer. a few more minutes passed and i observed a single orange light hovering above the rig for around 10 seconds. \r\n\r\nfinally after 20 minutes of continued observation i saw a dim orange light at what seemed to be a far distance(20+miles)climbing in elevation of a few thousand feet at 20-30��� from my viewpoint before it faded out.\r\n\r\nthe lights seemed to be followed by two aircraft but i can't be certain. the planes appeared to be on a sw intercept course with one at low elevation and the other high. there is an airforce base nearby and their course came from that direction. the planes made a about a 50 mile loop and returned in the direction they came. not sure if their presence was related. \r\n\r\ni have seen similar lights before so i was sure that these were the same lights. i was pretty freaked out with the hair on my next standing up, it's not something i can explain. could be natural, man made, or of a higher intelligence. a truck driver asked if i \"had seen any ufo's\" about an hour earlier. i wonder if he saw the same thing.
