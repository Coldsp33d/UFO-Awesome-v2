w. interchange ramp i pulled over to observe the object as something appeared \"wrong\" with what i was seeing.The object appeared about as large as say a dc-9 jet, but upon further observation i discovered the object displayed no wings nor did it have a vertical tail section.The object was a brilliant, \"clean\" white with no apparent projections from its body.It moved more slowly than what is typically seen from planes approaching the local airport for landing.It flew in an apparent straight line with no visible or apparent altitude changes.After watching it for a few minutes the crafts' aspect began to narrow as it apparently maneuvered to a more westerly path.As the object turned to where it would be seen only from behind, it could no longer be seen-it just disappeared.To confirm my own suspicions, i drove several miles west down i-69 to attempt to regain visual contact with the object but never saw it again.I believe it was originally flying slowly enough that i could have regained visual contact with it, assuming it maintained a similar speed and made no radical course changes.Interestingly, i don't think any of the other motorists driving by that day noticed anything strange about the object.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

(maybe 10 miles away) once it rose to a certain distance, another one followed behind it. when those two rose to a distance they became just a reddish color, then they began traveling west, another one (3rd) rose from the tree line, rising straight up then following the two proceeding ones.I was just watching in shock thinking i wish i had my camera.When the first one had passed overhead at a far distance, the 2nd one wasn't too far behind.I watched them both head west toward orion, then they disappeared completely, when they should have been somewhat visible.I saw the 4th one rise from behind the tree line (like the 3 before them) it was also an orange/reddish color, almost glowing with it until getting to a certain distance into the atmosphere, im not sure? they just became a red color once they started traveling west.While i watched all 4 of them rise, i didn't notice a sound around me at all. but it was when the 4th one rose that i ran into my house to get my phone to film them.When i came back out the 3rd one was already disappearing into thin air as it got closer to the orion constellation as well. the video i took of the 4th one, it is in the middle of the screen for the most part. it a red dot but it's visible.At some points it disappears, but shows back up. there are some street lights in the video as well, but its taken of the 4th one as it starts heading west, above and then as far west as i could see it on the camera screen.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":45657,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.956675,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02102013-0016","longitude":-82.4485676,"occurred":1360482300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1360544235000,"summary":"Four starlike objects rose one after another from behind eastern tree lined horizon, then rose straight up into air, then traveled west.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/45657_submitter_file1__VID20130209233157.3gp"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Tampa, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:8429"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Arcadia","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Went outside about 3:30 when i noticed a white disc shape emerge from a cloud and fly south.  six miles then disaster \r\nno\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:01:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":45656,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.725364,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02102013-0015","longitude":-97.3609679,"occurred":1360539000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oklahoma","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1360544153000,"summary":"Object came out of a cloud themoved east about six mile then disappeared into thin air","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"73007","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Arcadia, Oklahoma","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:8430"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"San Antonio","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving on february 4, 2013 at approximately 7:15pm on i10 and dezavala road in san antonio, texas when another witness in the backseat of my car observed round orange/yellow orbs of light, approximately 40 blinking off and on randomly. all the lights together making a diamond shape in the sky approximately one and a half football fields in length. i know this because we also observed a small plane underneath it and two small planes beside it as the orbs of light were turning off/on randomly. the third witness on passenger side also observed the lights in disbelief. at first i thought something was falling from the sky, then i noticed the lights were hovering above. we attempted to film this ufo with our phones, but after several attempts, we were unable to film. as the orbs of light rapidly started to turn off, we were only able to get a small amount of pictures of these orbs.  the pictures do not do it justice. we only got the end of the disappearing orbs. the total time we observed this was approximately 40 seconds before it dissappeared before our eyes. i still don't know what this was, just that we don't understand it and we have never seen anything like this before.  if anyone knows of anything new going on with military experimenting with aircrafts that they have not yet told the citizens of us, i think it's time they fessed up. we need an explanation as to what we saw in the sky. i feel everyone has a right to know, that is why i am sharing my story. there were several cars driving by, there has to be other people who witnessed this phenomenon. \r\n\r\np.S. after we viewed the pictures we also observed the lights were actually floating right above the parking lot right in front of us, although we didn't see them when we were actually there.....Super strange.
