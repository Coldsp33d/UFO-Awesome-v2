to take a small break out in the middle of nowhere. the location is 5 miles north of jarnel, az. on hwy 89. it was a little past 11:00 pm. we somehow started talking about ufo. i mentioned to my son, 12 years old at the time that i think most ufo sightings are military related or non- military related vehicles possibly from the future like a time machine. i told my son that some day time travel could be possible. he asked if i could prove time travel. i said maybe, do you want to try it. well it's oct. 8 1994 11:26pm we are 5 miles north of jarnel on hwy 89 waiting for a time machine. we both said if anything happens we will remember this date and time. oh my god what is that my son yells out. i turn my head and it comes right up to us, approx. 100' from us. a small vehicle 50' off the ground looking right at us. we could see two people in the craft, they were looking at us. sheldon looked at me at jumped into the car and shut the door. i stood still and took it all in. after about 5 seconds i waved and they waved back. i looked back at my son and he smiled. when i turned back to look at the craft it was backing up i waved again and they waved too. the craft turned, picked up speed and altitude and within a matter of seconds was out of sight. i got in the car looked at my son and he said that was me dad, from the future. you did it you proved time travel to me. we drove off in a daze. we stopped at the nearest payphone and called home. i told my wife, what just happened and we would be home soon. when we got home my son was still shaken by the event and told his mom and his sister that he came back from the future in a time machine that dad builds. we have a plaque on the wall with the date time and place. i have some ideas that might speed up the development of time travel. we are also considering an attemp at producing a movie. if you find our story interesting and would like to get more details, let me know.

 it stopped!!  i had to blink my eyes because i thought that i was seeing things.  but sure enough the bright object had just stopped and then just when i got my brain around that fact the object accelerated straight down in the blink of an eye in what i would estimate to be 5 ��� 10 miles judging from its��� distance.\r\n\r\nas soon as it reached a lower altitude it immediately changed direction and shot diagonally (make a v) up to what appeared to be its��� original elevation in about two (2) seconds and continued on its easterly cruise at a speed relative to the speed before it stopped and dropped.\r\n\r\nmy jaw hit the hood of the truck and i stammered for my brother to come over to where i was.  i said man you gotta see this! \r\n\r\nright after i called out to my brother it performed the same exact maneuver again, stopped, dropped 5-10 miles and then shot back up at an angle to the original altitude all in a matter of 5 seconds.  amazing!!\r\n\r\nmy brother came over to my side and i pointed out the object in the sky to him and told him to watch.  again, the same maneuver was executed.  we were both dumb struck.  in my mind and our opinion this was no plane, nor tele-communications satellite, nor space station, nor swamp gas, nor car headlight reflecting off the swamp gas.  this was a high speed vehicle (lets use the term ufo) performing some amazing maneuvers in the northern maine july sky.  awesome!\r\n\r\nthis activity continued for a couple more maneuvers (think w shaped) and then the object which, although getting closer to yet still many miles away from decided to maintain a steady course with a slight incline towards our left.  in other words the object appeared to be heading towards us yet turning towards outerspace.\r\n\r\nwe continued to watch this object (white light) for approximately 25-30 minutes as it seemingly flew straight out into space and disappeared.\r\n\r\nthe entire show lasted for approximately 30 minutes.  unlike a satellite which scream across the sky in a matter of several seconds\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":40863,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.7544176,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07162012-0016","longitude":-68.7943795,"occurred":1058943600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maine","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1342502556000,"summary":"Zig zagging white light in northern maine","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":3281,"locationName":"Millinocket Lake, Maine","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:8711"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Union","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Filed by asd for the witness, who wishes to remain anonymous: \r\n\r\nthe witness, who was an assistant fire chief at the time, was prompted to contact mufon after seeing a tv program on the illinois sightings in theyhear 2000. he stated that he was returning from a house fire in st. clair, missouri at approximately 3:00 am and was on i-44 highway approaching union, missouri when he heard law enforcement on the county police band radio discussing an unidentified object.  the dispatcher said ���oh it's this roswell stuff again.��� and that police were chasing the object.  \r\n\r\nas the witness approached 50 hwy and 47 hwy he saw a large triangular craft with lights pointing down over the wal-mart that was traveling at approximately 25-30 mph.  the witness said that the very bright lights on the object pointed downward, but did not light up the ground, seeming to stop approximately 100' feet up.  the craft was approximately 500' above the ground. \r\n\r\nthe witness joined up with an officer from union, missouri and an officer from the county, and the three of them followed the object in their separate cars for approximately one hour as the object headed towards washington, missouri, north of the original position.  the object was always in front of them or above them. at one point, the county officer attempted to tilt his dash cam up in order to get pictures, but it would not move into the needed position. \r\n\r\nnone of the men had a camera with them. the object stopped and hovered several times and moved very slowly.  they were unable to use the radio for communication while the craft was above them. after an hour, the officers needed to turn back to get back to other calls, so this witness left as well. by this time, the object had moved into an area se of washington, mo over farmland where there were no roads, and it was impossible to follow.  \r\n__________________________________\r\n\r\nthe witness surmises that the object from illinois continued into missouri and officers picked up its trail after it crossed the state line.

dropping supplies to ships. that was my first thought.I eliminated that,as there where no flashing red light,or movement.Plus i couldn't see a ship. maybe a oil derrick ? no, not unless they built it in a day. it wasn't any find of a ship or boat,as there was zero reflection on the water. the longer i looked, the more confused i got. i could barely see the horizon as there was fog that night.Once i could see the line i could tell the light wasn't sitting on the ocean,but was above. i kept waiting for it to move,and one time it jerked a little but remained it place.\r\n i would describe the light as a huge bright square.I could only see the front but it looked like it was dived evenly into four lights. like a 4 on dice..Each light put out the same white color,but  randomly fluttered. i wouldn't call it blinking.I finally had to get home so i don't know what happened with it. i have a young family member who said she saw the same thing a few nights later. her's were flying,& there was 8.That was in san clementa, at 1130 pm. i tried to use my cell phone for a picture,no luck.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

there is less  auto traffic.We were at an park near our house and noticed we could see all the way up the valley. it was a very clear night and we must have been on high ground. we could also see the cargo jets on .The final approch to mather field (formally mather a.F.B.). it was so clear we could see about seven jets , starting from one passing directly over our heads ,2 ,3,4,then 5 at the end of the valley banking to the right ,6 dessending  then the 7th touching down. actual \"air traffic \" very cool. then bam! as if the crafts cloking device suddenly failed we can see this craft so close i can see the panles and what looked like some markings like on military planes. take a pack of cigarettes turn it sideways and hold it at arms lenghth from you . that's the size . ok, strange but there are possible explainations. except for the fact that it was motionless - not hovering, but motionless. it's difficult to convey how odd it looks for somthing to be truly airborne and motionless. when it leaves, part of the craft stays until the forward portion gets to a certain point, then at the speed of light-its gone!\r\n  about  week later i saw a program about scientist attempting to find absolute zero. on the way there they proved the einstine bolles condensate. they used a gas that was so dense it slows light to the speed of a bicycle. to demonstrate the shot a

noticed out the front window a bright glowing orange object, just above the tree line.  the object appeared rather close and maybe the size of a dime.  i pointed it out and asked my sister if she saw it.  she saw it too, and i hurriedly ran outside while directing her to get her camera.  as i went outside it was slowly moving northeast and gaining altitude.  at first i thought it was a chinese paper lantern.  i realized this was not the case as it was moving side to side without gaining altitude, and would stop moving side to side whilst it was ascending.  it was moving far too fast to be a paper lantern, as well.  also, while it was moving side to side, it was glowing a dull, pulsing red-orange, and i could make out an overall disc shape to the object.  when it was ascending it was glowing a brighter yellow-orange, and the shape of the object was harder to make out.  i was really excited, and quickly moving down the street away from the tree line to keep track of it.  by the time my sister made it outside with the camera, it had already moved a considerable distance away, to the point where it became a star-like object and disappeared.  directly thereafter, we noticed 4 airplanes moving in the same direction, and they were travelling at a much lesser speed.  after covering most of the distance, 3 of the planes turned around and headed back in the direction they came.  my sister didn't get the camera in time, but saw enough to confirm that it was indeed a ufo, and actually was the first to notice the 3 additional planes in the vicinity.  we were both very excited, as we have both had ufo sightings, but never together.  it felt like confirmation, and totally was in line with the other ufo's we have sighted individually in the past several years.","distance":"501

standing on my porch. they appeared to be stars, but didn���t behave like any stars i have seen. they are visible at night, during the day, and currently visible right now as of 14jul12. i first took notice when i was looked up at the stars and was tracking what i thought was a satellite because it was moving fairly quickly through the sky. it changed directions, stopped, and the shot across the sky like a shooting star! i said to myself, \" i must be going crazy because no way in hell that just happened right before my eyes\". so i went inside to forget about what i say, but moments later i felt compelled to go back outside (like my mind was telling me to go back and look up), so i did. i noticed not one, but at least 6 objects during week 1. some were off doing their own thing while others grouped up and paired up forming shapes like diamonds, squares, v-patterns, and circles right in front of my eyes. they often separated going on what appears to be predetermined flight patterns after forming a shape. at times, they would pair up and chase another object. another thing i noticed is that when a single object approaches another object, they both start circling one another in an s-pattern, and then one would follow the other. week 2, the numbers doubled and then tripled. currently there are hundreds of these objects.\r\n\r\nsome core details i observed comprises these objects outshined the sun and are even visible through the clouds (at night and during the day). today, they appear to be flying around in a predetermined flight route as they make a large grid. they move slowly then progressively speed up leaving a tail like a comet. they also stop and then shoot across the sky like a shooting star then stop on a dime. from what i can make out, they have a preset vicinity for which they are staying in.\r\n\r\nnaturally i began filtering through possible explanation as to what these objects may be. my first thought was they may be satellites, but due to their intelligent and elegant maneuverability and flight patterns, i quickly dismissed this idea. another idea i explored, they may be some new kind of aircraft, but based on my observations and the fact these objects are extremely far away (i say low orbit) and computing the speed and maneuvers this object were displaying, our anatomy as human beings does not permit such a thing. i dismissed this idea extremely quickly. another thought that crossed my mind, perhaps they are meteors or some other type of similar object, but based on how intelligent, and apparent predetermined flight patterns and such, i had to throw this last idea out. i never seen a meteor shoot across the sky, stop, move at various different speeds, change directions in a uniformed fashion or in sharp turns, group with one or more other meteorites, etcetera��� i had to dismiss this idea.\r\n\r\nupdate (i begin typing this yesterday 14jul15): \r\ntoday (15jul12), one object descended enough that i can honestly say it was long disc shaped. this object was shinning and reflecting the sun light (if that makes sense) at the same time. to be more accurate, the bottom of this object shinned like a star (like it was emitting or generating light) while the top of this object reflected light. i know the sun light was reflecting off of this object because you can visibly see the light move across the object as it propelled. it appeared to have a dark area located approximately near the rear of the object. i tracked this object as it made it's way through the blue sky over my home, but it progressively sped up and ultimately ascended so fast i dropped my drink i had in my hand. i noticed approximately three other objects converging on this one before this event occurred. furthermore, there was no sound from this object nor was there visible \"exhaust\" or fumes coming from this object. \r\n\r\nin my honest assessment, i think these objects are fighting one another. my friend and i noticed 2 objects chasing each other, and then a bright light, and then nothing... only one object remained. why is that significant is because in my observations, these objects do not disappear. they may become brighter (descend) or become dimmer (ascend), but they are always visible.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"12:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional
