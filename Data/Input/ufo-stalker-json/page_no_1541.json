sighting, what appeared to be 2 black helicopters with red lights arrived to escort craft. it moved slowly through sky approximately 300 feet above us. the craft was massive, about size of football field. it moved from southeast to northwest. it then rapidly descended and appeared to land when it reached a private airfield that is called skyline ranch. \r\n\r\nat first, we wondered if it were a plane, but it was completely silent. then we thought it may be 9helicopters flying in tight formation, but we discarded that theory when the two black helicopters arrived and we could determine the difference. it followed the same flight pattern as many of the planes around here, but was definitely not a plane as it was simply too massive.\r\n\r\nthe dogs were visibly upset and wanted to be indoors, and now we are wondering why we can't find any other reports of the object. feelings before and after exist of frustration that no one else saw it or reported. we are a little consumed by trying to find out what it was.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

yelled at my brother to look, he first said its a helicopter light then soon light brighttened orange and diamond like, then began to dim to pinpoint and disappeared within 2 secs. i was astonished and wasn't even thinking of hooking up my night vision to my dvr but i did observe the orb, the light was not flashing, pulsating and when it disappeared i could not see it in my night vision monocular and it did not seem far away so it completely disappeared. the sighting lasted approximately 30 seconds from east to west in straight path. this was no re entry meteor  or satellite as was too slow, unless this can occur. i know the night sky especially from my own balcony, have owned a few telescopes and this is a first for me as it was 2 nights ago...My brother a complete skeptic was baffled...What is going on this week!!!??? about 10 mins after the disappearance a high flying helicopter circled the area 3 times even taking the same flight path of the object. this helicopter was not making a terrestrial  search as he was too high... anybody else see this object directly over false creek passing over granville and burrard bridge before disappearing...Answers

july 8, 2012 at 4:00 am i observed 2 unfamiliar bright lights. one was an extremely bright white and the other was red.  i said to myself \"these lights do not belong here!\" because i'm familiar with the night sky. after driving several minutes i decided to stop as i wanted to get a better look.  the known lights in the sky (venus and or jupiter and a reddish light) were stationary and the newly observed lights to the north (left) were slightly moving.  i wanted to make sure i wasn't seeing things so i parked on the freeway onramp (see diagram #2)after driving through the rest area outside of barstow. the truck is still running at this point with 'sirius' radio on. i grabbed my brand new \"smart phone\" that i had never used for photography (so was unfamiliar with it's functionality) and began to take a still photo.  what i didn't know was the camera had switched to video mode so my first shot is a video of a red ring of lights. my initial target was the bright white light but then the red light merged with the bright white light becoming a ring of red lights. i tried to focus on these lights but they were moving.  this video is 15 seconds in length only because when i hit the shutter again thinking i was taking a second photo thereby stopping the video.  it's possible i had zoomed in.  i then realized what i had done.  i was standing on the top step outside of the drivers door.  \r\ni got down to the ground and walked around the front of the truck to right side and out into the field 50+feet away from the truck.  as i'm standing there i focused on the bright white light and took the first of 4 still photos.  when i took the 2nd pic the light got larger and changed to red-orange.  as i got ready to take the 3rd shot suddenly the light shot straight at me increasing in brightness and size.  i then hit the shutter.  i was able to get 1 more shot before the light disappeared.  at this point, i was truly afraid for my life.  poof! it was gone.\r\nsee

we didn't hear any sounds. we had an excellent view on open waters. we've been houseboating for many years and never seen anything like this.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":40809,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":46.1516685,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-07142012-0030","longitude":-80.3876436,"occurred":1342328460000,"potentialRelations":[40814],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1342334904000,"summary":"Orange glowing light ball above the lake","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"French River, Ontario","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:8880"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Plainfield","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was watching tv in my family room, my daughter was upstairs and said she heard a weird humming sound, i heard it too but  it was probably from washer in basement, i said i was going to check the perimeter which is a running joke in our family anytime anyone thinks they hear or see something outside, anyway i went out and looked up and right over my house there was a red object glowing brighter then dimmer. i watched for a long enough time to see there were no navigation lights blinking, so i ran into the house and grabbed my binoculars, went back outside which took about  ten seconds, my wife was reading and asked me what i was doing and i said there was something over the house, i went back and was watching and i could slowly start to actually see the structure, and at the same time the light was dimming until it completely blinked out and i could clearly see the whole shape of the object, completely round and black, my wife came out and i told her where to look without putting down the binoculars, when she said she could see it i looked with my eyes and could see it too, i then kept looking with my binoculars until it disappeared over some houses it never made a sound that i could hear. i was amazed to actually be able to see the structure so clearly, mind blowing! total time was about two minutes","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":40808,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.551972053055266,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07142012-0029","longitude":-88.21009189112101,"occurred":1342325400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1342334452000,"summary":"Red  glowing bright/dim object over my house got my binoculars and watched as the light slowly dimmed then blinked out saw a black round object","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"60586","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Plainfield, Illinois","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:8881"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover), Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Quakertown","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Several of us were sitting on the patio when i looked up in the sky and seen a light appear over the hill. it appeared to be a helicopter because of the blinking bright lights so i watched it and them another appeared behind it. i told the people i was with that it was strange for a helicopter to be in our area when all of a sudden another light appeared. we could not tell the shape of the objects because of the bright light but they looked like helicopters but there was no sound and then 4 more appeared. they flew up into the sky and disappeared as soon as they went into a light cloud. there was approximately 9 flying objects that flew in a upward angled path. we all sat there trying to figure out what we had just seen but could not come up with an explanation. they flew almost in a formation like pattern. if they were helicopters we would have heard some type of sound because they were close enough to our location. the sky had some over cast but the sky was clear above the cloud were they all disappeared. we kept waiting for the to reappear but they didn't.
