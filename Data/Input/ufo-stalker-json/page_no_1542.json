sky day. i had seen unconventional aircraft in the general area in sept 2011 on two occasions (case study 40801 & 40802) so i definitely made sure to check the sky on a routine basis in case i might see unconventional craft in the area again. when i looked up, i saw what appeared to be 10 silvery white objects flying in formation. they were too high in altitude for me to see their shape clearly, but the general shape would be that of a fat, almost crescent shaped,chevron.\r\ni assumed they were seagulls. i decided to watch them longer and i noticed there was no wing strokes or any means of propulsion that i normally observed when viewing flying seagull and egrets frequently in the area.  then 3 of the objects became entirely stationary and hovered, while two of the other objects reversed direction, and then took up position by two of the other unidentified objects they had been flying in front of. \r\ni then saw one of the other objects reverse and fly directly at one of the objects that was flying behind it but they did not collide, and instead the object that had reversed passed under the other object and continued in its reversed direction.  i realized one of them must have been of course at a slightly lower altitude to successfully complete that very, very unusual maneuver. the reversed object then reversed direction again and proceeded to head in its original direction heading towards the east. i will add that the reversal of direction was entirely effortless and the objects that i had seen reverse direction could do so without having to make a wide arc like a normal aircraft.\r\nthe 10 objects proceeded to fly in a eastern direction, very close in their flight path to where i had the two other sightings in the area in sept 2011. these definitely were not conventionally known aircraft, though they certainly could be drones or some other type of covert terrestrial craft.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then

clear day with a blue sky and no visible clouds.  as i walked to my car, i looked up and saw what i assumed were just two small, silvery-white planes heading from the west towards the east. then i saw them change direction rather randomly several times. \r\nboth of the craft were able to hover and then move to left or right easily, unlike anything i have ever seen. seeing their unconventional abilities, i took out my cellphone and took a picture of them but they were too far away, and on the picture they only showed up as two very small silver blurs.\r\nafter viewing them for about 2 to 3 minutes approximately, a commercial airline passed over them, and it was at a higher altitude then the two  unidentified crafts.  i noticed that the two crafts where much smaller than the plane, each being only about a third as big as the commercial plane.  after approximately 1 to 2 more minutes of watching them do unconventional changes in direction, they both proceeded to head due east, and they flew directly over my head. i was then able to clearly confirm that they were both entirely solid, silvery white in color, perfectly crescent shaped craft that looked like they were made out of metal, and they seemed to be flying slightly faster than the typical small plane i have seen from time to time in the same area. they were definitely not conventional craft, but perhaps military drones or other such terrestrial craft that is still covert, or perhaps they are alien in origin.

as i am extremely familiar with the area. it was dark as it seemed to have cloud cover as you can tell by the town lights. i was driving south bound and just drove over a hill where i noticed a strange light in the sky just to the right of me. immediately i thought to myself \"there's no cell tower there? what is that?\"... i slowed down to look at this light which didn't seem that high over the treeline that it was hovering. it appeared to be maybe 200 ft over the tree lines. as i was driving a little closer to the light, it looked to me to have 2 colors. the top of the light was reddish/orange and the bottom was more of a whitish light. almost as if two in one. but the light was strange in the fact that the light was more of a candle light warmth color. as i'm slowly driving past watching this light (and it's still to the right of me). i noticed another car just sitting watching this thing as well. i continued to drive slowly then decide to turn around to continue to watch this thing so i turned into a driveway area within 10 sec.. turned around and now the light had moved westward about 2000 ft. i thought to myself, \"that light couldn't have been that far away in the distance.\" the light hovered there for a while, then i noticed the suv that was parked decided to take off from watching it pretty quickly. i could tell it was a woman as she drove past me and

lights and power off watching the lights of planes from the south 5 miles away move along the horizon and disappear to the eastern horizon. all planes had flashing indicator lights and produced sound except for one which was by itself and approached much closer at about 1-2 miles toward the horizon. the object moved very slowly at about 20-30 miles per hour and had a bright fixed headlight like a searchlight, but made no sound, had no blinking indicator lights and had no visible outline even as it approached 500 feet maximum from our position. when the object was directly in front still at 500 feet maximum and above a field at altitude of no more than 200 feet, i jokingly told my cousin \"watch this\" and flashed my headlights which were off . within 1-2 seconds of flashing my headlights the object which had no visible lights except the spotlight suddenly illuminated us with a staggered row of colored lights. after 5 seconds the lights completely turned off and the object which was almost completely in a hover, changed course and moved slowly and silently away from us and toward the treeline. there were no other lights from the object and it slowly disappeared into the night without a sound. \r\n\r\nadditionally my friend who had stayed in a cabin on the opposite side of the hill years before had been awakened one night by lights outside the cabin with tremendous shaking of the structure. he who was a brave and courageous individual whom i never saw afraid said he was mortally terrified as he hid in a ball from the object and event taking place. \r\n\r\nthank you for

known road that i drive everyday. by this time, it was darker than normal possibly due to cloud cover. i was driving over a hill and over to my right view, i noticed a reddish light/orb hovering in the sky within 500 feet from my car. it just just above tree top. it caught my eye immediately and i thought to myself \"they didn't put a cell phone tower there.. what the heck is that?\" it was approx that height of a smaller tower. but as i got closer to the light, it stayed hovering, still, no movement. i started to slow my car down to approx 10mph and while looking at it closer, i noticed a reddish type of light that had a different look to it almost as if a candlelight warmth glow. but underneath the red light appeared to have a white glowing light. almost as if they were the same light.. top side red, underneath white. as i'm driving slowly, south bound, i noticed an  suv parked on a side road watching this light as well. she was parked facing east and the light was to her left side. i drive about 100 ft and turn around to face north bound to watch this light.. during that 10 sec of me turning around, the light moved about 2000 ft due west from the original hovering spot. i'm watching this light and notice the person in the suv sped off quickly. i wave to stop her to talk about the sighting but she drives off and she looked to be upset. my eyes turn back to this light and within a fraction of a second, the light took off at the most unimaginable speed that i have ever seen. it looked to have taken off northwest. i sped home, upset, chills with an uneased

turned towards the east and saw a large orange ball rise over the tree lines. it pulsated. it had no additional lights. it was just a large circle, much larger, brighter, more orange than any traditional aircraft. we killed the boats engine to listen and it was silent. it crossed south to north in front of us and every adult on the boat was confused by it's lack of identifying lights, shapes or sounds. it went fairly slow for something that seemed lower, like the height of a helicopter. the light appeared to grow brighter ad then weaker. then it disappeared right in the middle of the sky. like someone turned the light out. it flickered out. entire duration 3 to 4 minutes. it was too close and too big to be

at first thought it was an overpass but quickly observed it moving directly toward me. i asked my wife \"what is that\" and when it was about 20 feet in front of me it made an almost 90 degree turn to my left and went toward a plowed field. i asked my wife to follow it but she said it had disapeared. for a few minutes i thought it was an airplane. then i realized there was absolutely no
