metropolitan area.  on 18 may 2012, i was at the fort washington park in fort washington, m.D. and i observed a ufo hovering in the distance.  i could not identify the hovering object as a model aircraft and its movements did not dictate that it was a model airplane.  \r\n\r\nthe object is capable of hovering for lengthy periods of time and is engulfed within a light that obscures the actual vessel from ground based observation.  this object has been observed on multiple occasions and mimics the planet venus' position within the sky.  after some research, this type of activity has been recorded.  yemme discussed similar observations made by united states military observers within the book \"ufo - evaluating the evidence\" describing a accident when a military aircraft collided with an unknown object in midair.\r\n \r\n\"at the time of the sighting, venus was in a position which coincided with that of the ufo.  the planet's angular distance from the sun was rather small, but it was still bright enough to be seen by day.  it is possible that venus was the cause of this sighting and was observed by some of the witnesses on the ground.\" (51)\r\n\r\nthe unidentified object within this video will shift its position very slightly and in the background you can hear an airplane flying overhead.  i attempted to zoom in with my camcorder but was not able to obtain a clear view of the object emanating the light.  i am always in awe to observe these objects.\r\n\r\nafter observing the object, i departed the location for home.  i seek assistance to document other ufo activity within the area.  please feel free to have this video analyzed for authenticity.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

live in downtown toronto and usually there's too much pollution to see the stars but it was a clear, cloudless night last night (wed. july 11, 2012).  at approximately 10:45 p.M. i went outside to take out the garbage and water the lawn.  i was standing on my ground-level patio looking up at the distant stars (i've done so for years) just to take in the night sky but i also try and see if i can spot anything way up high, whether i'm in the city or out in the countryside where the night sky is amazing.  i belive that i've seen satellites in the past and have also seen some interesting lights that appear to be way too high up for planes but nothing extraordinary enough that was worth reporting.\r\n\r\nanyway, last night, because of the great night sky in the city, i was looking up for about ten minutes, when i saw something nearby overhead - i caught it in my periphery to my right (i was facing east) and quickly looked at it (i wrote down this observation last night along with a crude sketch but i didn't bring it with me to work today, if you want to see it, email me and i'll scan it and send it to you).  at first it appeared to be two dull, white lights moving and blinking / pulsating in unison (i.E. if you were to say a plane's lights were equivalent to a 100 watt bulb, then these lights were 25 watts by comparison).  it came from a s-e direction a few hundred feet above a nearby apartment building, moving in a n-w direction.  when i focused my attention to the lights, i could see the sky between them but they appeared to be joined by some type of invisible wing because the space in between them was hazy, like what the road looks like when it's really hot outside with the waves of heat.  so it struck me as a single object - a straight wing - that was cloaked, yet there were two dull white lights pulsating, or blinking, in unison!  bizarre, and that's why i'm reporting this to you, and am not doing so in a casual manner.  as i mentioned in the short description, my gut feeling tells me that this was more of a military object rather than a ufo (i didn't sense anything otherworldly - not sure if you do under these circumstances.)  regardless, it was of a technology that i didn't think we were capable of yet - especially in canada.  and its direction and elevation made me think that it was headed towards a nearby military base. \r\n\r\nthis object was completely silent and it was all over in 2-3 seconds (i noted 1.5 seconds in the observation report i wrote last night).  i lost sight of it when it went over my neighbour's triplex roof.\r\n\r\nthere's a fairly busy flight path over our house from planes arriving and departing from pearson int'l.  in a closer vicinity to my house is the downsview military base which has an airport. the base has been drastically reduced in size over the years and i believe that dehavilland currently has an operation running out of that base, although the military still has a small presence (parts of the base has even been transformed into canada's first urban national park and there are even concerts held there).  and when i drive by there, all signs point to a military base that is now being run by a skeleton staff.  however, i do see a number of new planes circling above my house at night and i get the sense that dehavilland are testing new models - they are usually much more quiet and sleek than the planes coming from / going to pearson.  \r\n\r\nthere were a number of planes taking off from pearson last night but this object was low to the ground in comparison.  and a few minutes after i saw this object, a small plane circled overhead quite low in the same general vicinity - this struck me as odd because you don't usually see small cesna-type planes flying around the city at that time of night.  i think it was red and white.  even though it was night and the sky was clear, there's still a great level of light pollution, so i had good visibility.\r\n\r\nthe object that i saw last night was definitely something physical but it happened so fast and it was dead silent.  yet i felt compelled to write it down last night and again this morning on this site.  i felt strongly enough about its anomolous nature that i just had to report it to you (in case anyone else in my vicinity spotted it by chance).  \r\n\r\nwhat's really odd is that i think if i hadn't of written the account down last night and woken up my wife to tell her about it (she thought that she was dreaming last night when i told her), then i would have doubted myself about this sighting when i woke up this morning.  i'm still somewhat doubtful of what i saw but i have to fight that urge because there really was something physical, silent and nearly invisible that passed just above me last night.  my first thought after i'd lost sight was that it was an unmanned drone but i don't think they're cloaked (i've seen photos of uavs).  and i also thought the lights were a couple of rc toys moving together but with the haziness of the invisible wing connecting the two lights, i knew they weren't rc toys.","distance":"101-500

direction where the object came into view. i thought it was a shooting star about to hit the ground near us, but i didn't tell my friend, thinking it would be gone before he could turn around. but it didn't land or burn out, and i actually knew it wasn't what i had first thought, and that a shooting star was just the logical thing for me to think. it was so close and so bright that my friend saw it in the corner of his eye and turned immediately. we both kept saying, \"what is it? what is it?\" it had all the characteristics of a bubble, seeming to change shape a little, as a bubble would, almost round, slightly oblong. in the middle was an extremely bright gaseous-looking fire. around the fire was a glow, and around the glow was a duller glow which filled in the remaining shape of the bubble. it came from the ne and was traveling sw, and seemed to be about 3 feet in diameter, and traveling approximately 20 mph. it first came into view after passing over the house clearing the roof. it seemed to be at least 80 feet from the ground because it was not hitting houses or trees. it also appeared to be approaching in a downward direction, maybe down to 60 feet, then leveling out. i said to run into the street to get a clear view away from trees. we had a fairly clear view anyway because it was so bright that it shined through the tree branches, similar to the light in a kerosene lamp, only much larger. we watched it move in a very deliberate manner, as if it knew where it was going, without hitting anything. it didn't burn out at all or change speed while we could see it. i think i saw it about a minute, and my friend saw it longer, because i ran into the house to get a camera and car keys so we could follow it. too late. no photo. we could not find it after driving around for about 10 minutes. it was too fast and houses were in the way before we even got out of the driveway. i reported it to the police. there was a shift change and they did not yet know if any other reports had come in before mine. the officer believed me, saying he'd seen things also, that could not be explained. i'm glad i was with someone. i'd like to see it again. however, when i saw a \"flying saucer\" many years earlier, hovering just above, or landed on the next door neighbor's house, i was so shocked that i never wanted to see anything like that again. being with another witness

pretty clear view from my balcony of the area between the border of queens and manhattan, and good views of the manhattan skyline.  i often see plans that appear to be heading towards la guardia airport for a landing, and these plans are always flying in the same direction...Sort of along the east river in a northeasterly direction towards la guardia airport.\r\n\r\ntonight i thought it odd that a plane appeared to be flying at a 90 degree angle to that of most planes.  instead of flying in a northeasterly direction it was flying more east.  i watched as it flew just south of my apartment building continuing east and deeper over queens.  i wondered 'could this be a ufo?!'.So i decided to bend down towards the ground and look upward as the plane was flying closer to my building.  while it looked plane like, i thought the lights were odd....I seemed to see lights in four perfect corners....Whereas usually with a plane i think you see the wing lights (and the wings are naturally spread out wider than the rest of the plane) and then i think you might see flashing lights maybe at the nose and the tail?  but with this object, all the lights seemed to be solid...No flashing lights..And again, it was the fact that the four lights were each in a corner of what appeared to be shaped like a perfect square.\r\n\r\nmaybe it was just my imagination but that coupled with the unusual flight direction got me wondering.....

and the sky was still light because it was early september and still summer weather. we were on a backroad in the residential area and when we turned a corner to head into the back parking lot area of the supermarket, we were entirely shocked to see a glowing, red-orange, oval-egg shaped, solid object hovering in a stationary position, approximately 8 stories above the ground. my mom was intrigued and she drove the car closer to the object, so we were almost right under it but far enough away so we could still see it through the front windshield, and she put the car in park but left the engine running. our dog put his head out the window and he looked up and saw the object and began to bark incessantly while staring at it. the object was solid, and it seemed to be made of a light silver white metal in appearance, but it glowed with a deep orange red hue that changed its intensity and color distribution over the object, almost as if the hue was a product of high heat, or some type of propulsion by product. the orange red hue did not give off any glare whatsoever. the object was spinning at a moderately slow pace, in a clockwise direction. we observed it for about 3 to 5 minutes and it did not move up or down, but hovered and kept on spinning at the same pace. then my mom and i saw in the distance, in the area past and behind the object, and at a higher altitude,  two black helicopters flying towards the object at a fast pace. they quickly were over the object and decended to the objects altitude and each helicopter took up a position on each side of the object and facing the object. each helicopter had its side door open, and in each helicotper a male in dark military looking \"fatiques\" went to the open door and used spotlight to shed light on the object.  the object had not moved from its position during the entire time the helicopters moved in on it, but when the spotlights fell on it, it began to spin faster and glow more intensely in the red orange hue.  within 1 minute approximately, the object accelerated upward incredibly quickly and entirely vanished, seemingly because it accelerated even more quickly out of range. the helicopters were left with the beams of light still shinning where the object had been, and then they both took off very quickly, one going upwards in the direction the object had gone, and one back in the direction they had come from.

lights running along the ridge on a hillside behind our house to the south. the lights appeared at first, to be a couple of fire trucks running the hillside chasing a fire or something (the lights were heading west away from me at that time). as i watched i started to listen for engine noise, \"nothing\" i heard nothing, no motor vehicle sound, jet noise, humming -  nothing. i continued watching the lights wondering what these trucks were doing up there how come i couldn't hear them and at that time of night. \r\nthe lights then came to the end of the hillside and continued into the skyline now heading west, northwest. i started yelling for my wife to come look at them, but she was brushing her teeth in the master bathroom which has some windows facing the skyline in which the lights were now moving. i ran in and had my wife look out the window. she saw the lights moving across the horizon which now seemed to be moving more northerly. the lights continued across the valley towards the hillside to the north of us. we then moved to the front of the house, which faces north and stepped outside on the front walkway and saw that the lights started moving east, northeast. at that time my wife went to grab her camera and tried to video the lights, but she had forgotten to put a memory card in the camera, so she didn't get any pictures or video. i then tried to take a video with my phone but it was very dark and i couldn't see anything thru my phone. the lights continued till they went behind the hillside directly north of us. a few seconds later re-appearing a long distance away, due north of the hilltop and high in the sky. the lights then started ascending till they were completely out of sight. just moments after they were no longer visible i noticed a satellite or something move across the sky moving from the wsw towards ene. we were both speechless and left wondering what we had seen. the lights appeared to be connected and about 900 ft apart. feeling like i needed to come to a conclusion regarding what we had seen several days later i went online o find anything similar to what we saw and found that similar lights to these have been seen all over the country and in other countries as well. pretty interesting, but..... on july 7th i took my wife and another out to dinner and as we were telling our friend about what we had seen i looked at my gallery in my phone and noticed that i had recorded a video the night of the sighting and i decided to see if i had got any video of the lights and not just black like i thought. turns out i did! the video is shaky and short but it did happen to catch the lights and i even zoomed in for a moment. not a high quality video but it is what it is and what ever it was we saw was real and big.\r\nwhether or not it was from out of this world or just something that the government is flying around, we will probably never know but just wanted to share what we had seen.","distance":"501

path. moving along the coastline but about a mile past the breakers, it was directly out to sea from us when we noticed it. we watched it move south, fade, grow bright and move north beyond us, it did not ascend or decend,but moved parallel to the coast.  a pale orange beam shone from it faintly and passed over the beach.It would repeat this for several passes then it moved north and do the same thing after  about an hour and a half, we watched it fade from view. we noticed it again about 15 minutes later down by  ocean shores doing the same s to n, while shining its faint orange beam on the shore, fade grow bright. it continued to do this until we left the beach at about 3:45 am i took picturesz with my cellphone. we noticed it at approximately 1 am, while we were taking down our tarp/ canopy beach shelter. we saw a car���s headlights  stop down the beach and pause as if they also saw it. a nearby truck parked perpendicular to the waterturned its headlights on, and a light flickered off in the camper up the beach. there was easily 4 or 5 people illuminated by moonlight stopped, about a mile down the beach and pointing out to sea. iwe had noticed earlier (about 8 or 9 pm) in the evening 4-5 red lights floating around, moving like fireflies, after a little online research from my beach chair we decided they were probably chinese lanterns,\r\n\r\nwhat we thought at the time of the event: we spent several minutes discussing what we could be seeing, the following is what we came up with.:\r\nat first glance, we thought it was a fishing vessel on fire and watched for a moment, we had seen fvs earlier that evening and could see that this was to large and bright, and moving to fast and to distinctly to be a fishing vessel, especially one on fire.\r\n we then speculated  it could be a coast guard search helicopter, if someone had gone out swimming or missing earlier in the day, there would be a coast guard response. but we didn���t hear any chopper blades or engine noises, although my boyfriend heard  a ���distant, high piched squeal��� , the only real reason we thought it was a coast guard helicopter was because the ���searchlight��� was  the beam of orange light that illuminated an area the size of a beach ball���on the beach, the light was over a  mile away and out to sea and covering a distance of almost 30 miles in less than a minute pointing its light on the beach, moving at speeds that would be impractical for search vehicles.\r\nthere has been a noticeable amount of military air movement (chinooks, armed helicopters, etc) a few miles inland over the last several months, and there are naval bases on the beach further north, so my initial assumption was a military exersize, but then why would the military be active in such a way on the most popular beach day of the year when literally thousands of people were on that beach just a few hours earlier and dozens still were, their campfires dotted the beach for miles.  \r\nto us it seemed the ���beam��� emanating from the light was scanning the beach almost mapping it per se because of the movement of the light ( in a past job i used a scanner all day every day, the movement of the source light  reminded me of, the parts of a copier or scanner just beneath the glass) whatever it was it was obviously there, doing something, and not being interfered with and everyone on the beach knew they saw it. \r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

the sky caught my eye.\r\n\r\ni should note at this point that fireworks were still being shot at the time, however, i can say with 100 percent certainty this was not a firework.\r\n\r\nit was a spherical, orange glowing orb floating across the horizon. the best way i can describe it is like a large, translucent bag with convoluted flames contained inside. size/distance away is hard to judge, but it seemed like it was very high up(guess 1 mile or more). size from my point of view would be comparable to the moon. \r\n\r\nthe ball traveled in a straight line toward the northeast, until it was no longer visible behind the treeline. it crossed the horizon in about 20 seconds (appeared to be moving slow for it's perceived size, if that makes sense- kind of like watching a very high airplane move across the sky.\r\n\r\nthere was no sound, winds were calm from what i remember.\r\n\r\ni first thought it was paper from a firework on fire, then realizing it was too far up, thought it may have been a shuttle launch. however, it had no trail, and the shape was orb-like from my perspective. it was very bizarre, to say the least. i have seen many meteors, and this, i don't believe was one. i have never seen anything like it in my lifetime, and it is hard for me to describe in words.\r\n\r\nthanks for you
