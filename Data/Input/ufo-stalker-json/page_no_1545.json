the moon through the trees to the east of our location. after less than a minute i noticed it was moving and was not the moon. we moved about 30 feet to a clear view and noticed what appeared to be an orange flare like light. at first i thought maybe it was fireworks. we suddenly realized they were moving through the sky heading north. we followed the lights through the sky. most of the duration they were flashing white lights, but at times would flare like light. it was hard to tell if the flare light and the flashing lights were the same object. they mave have been separate objects. after a minute or so the flashing lights continued north, we no longer could see the flare like lights. we watched the flashing objects continue north until they were too far north and no longer visible. at no time did we hear anynoise!. we went inside and posted on facebook to see if anyone else had seen them. there were responses by people who did see them as well. one in alanson area. approx 10 minutes after seeing the objects i called 911 to see if they had calls about lights in sky. i know the dispatcher and he said they had many calls from petoskey east to cheboygan and petoske north to harbor springs. 911 would have many documented calls as to the same lights. many calls stated the same \"flare like\" or \"sparks\". the callers indicated to 911 that they did not make noise. the only craft i could think of that would be similiar is military craft dropping flares, such as anti heat seeker missle flares. why would they do this at night, over n. michigan?","distance":"Over One

20. when we reached lebanon, ny we turned the corner onto a long stretch of road. there were no other vehicles on the road driving at the time, only a parked rv on the side of the road with all the lights off. the rv was parked about 1/2 mile from where we witnessed the event. \r\n\r\nalong this road is lebanon valley speedway which could be seen, but was closed for the evening and dark. other than the street lights by the crossing area. these lights are located about 1/2 mile futher down the road from where we witnessed the phenomenom.\r\n\r\nwe noticed up in the sky on the opposite side of the road from the speedway, four red/orange orbs hovering above the treeline. they were in a formation of a square, two on top, two below. i could not estimate the distance and height due to the darkness, but they were definately low.\r\n\r\nthe sky was clear and no clouds could be seen. there was no sound, no blinking lights, and nothing to suggest a conventional aircraft or radio tower. my first thoughts were they were either flares or fireworks.\r\n\r\nas we watched the phenomenon, two of the objects suddenly started drifting toward the south, the other two remained stationary.\r\n\r\nas we eventually turned the corner at the end of the road, we lost site of the objects due to trees. i wanted to turn around, but again rationalized that they were perhaps flares or some sort of fireworks. \r\n\r\nafter pondering what i saw over a few days, i decided to search the internet just to see if there were any other sightings, with the understanding that there are lot of fake reports. however, it appears that there were sightings of these crafts all over ny state as well as all over the world on the same date (june 30, 2012) and all around the same time frame.(10:00pm) which because of the coincidence is the only reason i have filed this report.\r\n\r\ni cannot explain what it was, and i am not a ufo buff, but i can tell you what it wasn't. it wasn't an airplane, and it wasn't helicopters. they were too large to be chinese laterns or balloons, and i've never seen fireworks that release large orbs in a square formation and just hover in the sky with no smoke trail.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

commercial pilot license. it was at night around 11pm. i had the plane at a high angle of attack and low power because i was practicing slow flight. my d.G and vor demonstrated false headings all of a sudden and it concerned me.I am ifr rated and had a visual line of sight to the airport so i banked left to return and land assuming something was wrong with my instruments.I was heading on a 45 degree angle directly to the airport at around 3500 feet. i dipped my right wing to scan for traffic because the c-172 is a high wing aircraft.At the time i had accumulated around 200 hrs of night time flight.\r\n\r\nthats when i saw what i can best decribe as a moving star flying at my same descent rate and airspeed at my 3 oclock about 1500 to 2000 feet above me.Initially i thought it had to be some relection from my instruments making a light appear in my window,but the object was clearly there and moving against the still background of stars. i then noticed that my dg was rolling back and forth and that my vor was pointing in the direction of the moving star. i made a right bank and ignored my instruments and made a left bank using situational awareness to gain runway alignment.I noticed when i banked that my vor would still aim at the object.On descent i saw the object shoot up at a high velocity out of sight.I then clicked to light up the ils lights for landing and at this point was very concerned.\r\n\r\non final approach at around 500 feet, the object suddenly shot straight down and appeared at the end of the runway hovering at around 600 to 700 feet.I could not fathom what it was and assumed it was a helicopter or some experimental? i prepared to reconfigure for a touch and go when the object flew in an instant to about 50 to 100 feet directly infront of me in a blink of an eye, and then proceeded to maintain my airspeed and descent rate? it was very bright,around 12-20 feet in diameter,sort of orangy yellow orb.I could feel heat from it.I am -ex airforce and i worked on the flight line and have seen all types of aircraft take off and land. whatever it was , it was not an airplane, it had no fuselage, no wings, ect.I was concerned because the light was so bright that i could not see the runway clearly.It then shot strait up out of site and i landed soon after. when i tied the plane up with my hands shaking my buddy rob, who is also a pilot, ran out and told me he saw the orb also.He said the orb shot at me and circled around my aircraft from top to bottom and then trailed me at a distance of about 50 feet on final desecent and shot straight up at a high velocity and disappeared right before wheels down.I never reported the incident, we just assumed noone would believe us anyway, and rob feared losing his job as a flight instructor for being deemed a nut case.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

scene that we were witnessing. while waiting for the deputies to arrive, we estimated that the object was at least 400-600 feet in diameter. we then observed smaller lights traveling towards the

looked up at it and as i did i happened to notice a strange orange light in the sky beyond it. i told my friend to check it out, and after about a second he agreed that the light was a strange color. it was almost the same shade of orange as a street light. the lights were flashing in some kind of pattern, but it remained too blurry for us to actually focus on the sequence. we really had no doubt that we were seeing an 'unidentified flying object.'\r\n\r\nthe craft descended from the north eastern sky for about ten seconds, appeared to hover in what we think was the vicinity of bob hope airport. it then jiggled a little bit, kind of moving randomly in different directions but never very far. after that, it made a sharp movement eastward and made two more sharp turns that resulted in shape like 2 sides of a triangle. it then hovered for a few more seconds, then accelerated in a northern direction as well as upward at about a 45 degree  angle, and eventually faded away. \r\n\r\nwe were watching this object so intently that we could not tear ourselves away to grab a video camera. he even said 'get a camera! get a camera!' but i knew my cell phone camera would likely not catch what we were seeing and i did not want to miss it. i also considered that the balcony we were on has a screen on it and that would mess with the focus on the camera. afterwards, we went to turn on the news because we felt that somebody else obviously saw this, but we saw nothing. we called a few friends to tell them what happened. today, we looked up sightings in los angeles and found all these reports about similar colored objects in the last 10 days, so we felt compelled to add a report. \r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

2012, my wife and i also saw two different objects in the corner of the first floor of our house.  \r\n\r\n\tat approximately 7 am that day, our dog barked and she went to bring him outside.  when she went downstairs, she saw a glowing ��� orb with a dome top and flat bottom.  it was approximately 2 ft in width and 1.5 ft in height.  the object had two vertical lights inside which blinked green pulsating light.  facing the object, on our left side, bottom part, the object emitted bursts of very bright white light, some long and some short.  the object was located near a corner wall and appeared to be floating about 5 feet off the ground.  \r\n\r\n\tmy wife started to pray and started to telepathically talk with the object.  my wife thought it was some kind of heavenly angel.  the object seemed to respond by emitting the white bursts and more blinking of the green lights.  she was grabbing our dog at the time, and our dog had just had a stroke and was walking in a paralyzed fashion--  limping to one side real bad and falling down as she walked.  my wife asked if her dog can be cured.  the lights then began to blink a lot.\r\n\r\n\tafter 15 minutes of observing and communicating with this object, she started to yell for me to come downstairs.  i ignored her cause it was saturday morning and i did not sleep well the night before and wanted to sleep.  after 5 minutes of her yelling she came up and finally told me what she had seen.  i first went to the bathroom and then downstairs.  i was very skeptical.  \r\n\r\n\twhen i got downstairs, we did not see the orb but a small cylinder shaped object which i am calling a plasma cylinder.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tthe object did not appear to have edges but seemed like a fluid object with constant movement inside and on the edges of the object.  inside were multi-colored lights similar to plasma.  each color was not unique and separate like a rainbow but more meshed like colored water and the water colors are constantly mixing.  it seemed to be full of energy with colors floating stationary in the air.  the plasma object appeared to be about 1 ft in length and 6��� in height.  it was about 5 feet off the ground near the same corner wall that the orb was previously seen.  the object then went directly through our wall to go outside.  i only saw the ���plasma cylinder��� object for about 2 minutes before it disappeared through our wall.  \r\n\r\n\tattach is a picture of the ��� domed orb and the plasma cylinder.  we are also attaching a picture of our corner wall.  please note that the orb/plasma object appeared between the left wall and the flower picture.\r\n\r\n\tour corner wall is on the western corner of our house.  at 7 am that corner is dark because light does not enter that corner.  we have also closed drapes on the western window as well and that part was dark because the sun was just rising on the east side.  we know what we saw and it was not an illusion.\r\n\r\n\talso note that we were going to put our dog to sleep in a few days before this incident--  she could barely move and was walking sideways and constantly falling down.  after the orb left, our dog did not appear to have any symptoms of the stroke--  she was walking perfectly fine.  she is still sick but she now walks fine.  we were freaked out by this.  many of our friends saw the difference in her walk and we told them what had happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nmay 6, 2012:  approximately  8-10  orange orbs \r\n\t              and 2 black helicopters\r\n\r\n\ton saturday, may 6, from approximately 9-9:20 pm, i and about 6 other witnesses saw approximately 8-10 orange orbs in apopka, florida.  the witnesses were myself, my wife���s brother, my wife���s father, 2 other adults, and a teenager.  \r\n\r\n\twe were attending the high school graduating ceremony of my wife���s nephew who was graduating from forest lake academy in apopka, florida.  the lengthy graduation ceremony was almost finishing and i wanted to get some air and stepped outside of the auditorium.  we were located on a small hill about 300 feet north of state road 436 just west of state road 434.  thus, the orbs were very close, about 300 feet away, and the visibility was excellent.  \r\n\r\n\tall of the witnesses began to see bright yellow orbs rising from approximately the interchange of road 436 and 434 from about tree level.  we could not see them coming from the ground but appeared to ���pop out��� at the tree level.  they appeared to travel in a westerly direction along road 436 just south of it.  the orbs appeared about every 1-2 minutes.   most were uniform in direction and most went west and upwards slowly, i would guess at 10-20 mph.  some began to float straight up and others moved faster (30-40 mph) than others.  \r\n\r\n\tthe orbs then became distant and disappeared.  this lasted from approximately 9 pm to about 9:20 pm.  about 10 minutes later, two black helicopters came zooming in at a fast rate.  they stopped on top of route 436 just south of bear lake road (about ��� mile from where we were).  they stayed there about 10-15 minutes and then left.  the orbs had disappeared when they arrived.  \r\n\r\n\torb description:  difficult to describe but they appeared to be the size of a small volkswagen in the air.  they were round in shape, bright orange color.  light was self contained in object and not emitted outwards.  i thought they might have been chinese lanterns but i have never seen a chinese lantern before.  but now after all of our recent sightings, i am having a second opinion.  \r\n\r\n\tattached is a map of forest lake academy and location of orb movements.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\njuly 8, 2012:  large craft\r\n\r\n\ton july 8, 2012, at approximately 3:30 am, my wife saw a huge craft, about the size of a football field, maybe double that size, about 1/2 mile from our house.  we live in the killian area of miami and our best estimate is that the craft was near or above the miami zoo.  \r\n\r\n\tour dog is very sick and throwing up and she went to open the door in front of our house so the dog can go to the bathroom.  when she looked up, in a south-westerly direction, she saw the craft at approximately a 45 degree angle.  \r\n\r\n\tattached is a drawing of the craft made by my wife.  it was shaped like a cylinder but with pointed edges on both sides which appeared triangular shaped on each end.   the right and left sides, inside the triangle portion of the edges, had two large bands of extremely bright multi-colored lights on each side.  the middle part of the craft appeared very light whitish or grey colored.  \r\n\r\n\tthe craft made an extremely loud noise, much more powerful than if an airplane was standing directly above us.  the object remained stationary for about 5 minutes and then it disappeared. \r\n\r\n\twe have attached a drawing of the object, a map showing the location of our house and the location of the miami zoo area, and a weather chart indicating that the visibility was 10 miles, and that there were scattered clouds at 3:30 am that night.  my wife said that she saw many stars in the sky that night and thus she had excellent visibility.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nsummary\r\n\r\n\tprevious to these events, my wife and i have never seen ufos or other similar objects in our life.  \r\n\r\n\tshe is not bothered by this because she is very religious thinks that they were a messenger from god.  i, on the other hand, have been freaked out.  i started doing research on the subject, have joined mufon, ordered about 30 ufo books, listen daily to coast to coast, etc, etc.  i never even knew that these radio programs or ufo organizations existed.   i am now consumed by the subject.  i need to find some answers and some closure because my wife says that i became obsessed with this issue.  \r\n\r\n\tfinally, i am an attorney with the irs in miami, fl and my wife was trained as a physical therapist and is a stay-at-home mom.  we live in a very nice upper middle class neighborhood in the killian area of miami, florida.  we have lead normal dull lives until recently.  should you need assistance, you can contact me at my home address and cell number.  thank you.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the lights were definitely out of place and interesting, and seemed to hover for 3 or 4 minutes in the same place (one a little higher and to the right of the other), and then both slowly descended below the distant horizon at what seemed to be a synchronized descent. if there were any sound, i would've thought it was 2 helicopters searching for something, but there was no sound, and two helicopters wouldn't be a common occurence either (and we didn't see any news stories referencing any searches).\r\n\r\nwe tried to break out my son's telescope to get a closer look, but we're not
