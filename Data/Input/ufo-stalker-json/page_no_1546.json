(2100 hrs) cst.  the deck faces west. this occurred over griffith/schererville, indiana.\r\nat 9:30 p.M., (2130 hrs), i was facing northwest, and turned to look at the grill, which was a few feet behind and to the left of me. a very bright light in the southwest sky caught my eye. i got up to check it out, as there were branches in the way.  i told my boyfriend to come look at the ufo, which he did. \r\nin the sky, at about 10:00, was a large bright light in the southwest that seemed to be moving, more like drifting, then hovering, while it changed colors from \"stop-light\" red, to orange, to  yellow-gold, then orange again, and eventually back to red. the light flickered as it changed color, however, the lights were not following a set sequence, nor were there any aviation lights, such as strobes. \r\nthe light had moved from southwest to east for perhaps a minute, then hung in the sky, simply hovering while it put on it's light show. it was beautiful to look at, as the colors were so vivid. the  movement was far too slow to be a plane, and there was absolutely no sound, nor was there any plume or visual interference (heat mirage effect/mist etc.).\r\nwe watched it til it disappeared behind some clouds, moving southeast. \r\nat first, my boyfriend thought it was a plane, til he watched it for a few minutes, then he remarked with surprise, that it could be a ufo.  as for myself, i was thrilled and awed. it's too bad it disappeared behind the clouds, as i was hoping it would come closer.  \r\nwe went back to sit down and eat and then we heard a jet moving from southeast, presumably by the sound, to northeast. while there are several small airports in the area, and we often see and hear passenger jets, as well as choppers, and light planes, this sounded more like a fighter, but it did not change course towards where the light had been.\r\nit is important to note that besides there not being a sequential pattern to the light color changes, that the actual display time of each color change was variable and random as well.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path

to me and the people got out and were staring up at the saucer as i was and the officer turned and watched too. everyone around was looking up at it as it hovered, then panels of windows appeared around the center of the disc and human form persons were looking out. this lasted about 20 to 30 seconds and then the panels became opoaque again and then the saucer moved westward at an astonishing speed without sound and did a 90 degree turn south and went out of sight in that direction. a few seconds later it returned to the same spot it had left and came to a hover again. it only hovered there about 15 seconds more before it moved west at a high rate of speed and suddenly went straight up and disappeared at an astonishing rare of speed. then an f-86 jet fighter left the nearby air force base and went westward as if to look for the object. the air force meteorologists said it was a reflection of light from one of the shiny new b-47's at the base shining on a cloud of moisture above the town. it was clear as a bell that morning and not a cloud of anything in the sky. nothing was ever mentioned about it again. my father was in the us air force at the time and in 1959 revealed to me that he was in the crew of the first airplane to arrive on the scene of the roswell crash and gave me details on the clean-up there and that he was the one that gave the weather balloon to the commander of carswell afb and helped him concoct the story the government wanted to cover it up. my father told me not to tell anyone of the story while he was still alive because he knew of several officers that were there let out some facts and they each met mysterious deaths shortly afterward. the bulk of the surviving ship was taken away on board a flat bed truck with a tarp covering it, in the dark of night. there were bodies recovered and the last one died before they left the scene. they were packed in crates with dry ice to preserve them and were taken in a plane, but he did not reveal where the planes' destination was.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Window(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path

next to our road to my northeast. i pulled out my cell phone from my pocket to look at the time, that way i would know what time it was when i first noticed the object just in case it turns out to be an unknown object. i watched the light closely, at first it seemed stationary, but after about a minute it gradually started to move in a southwesterly direction. i went to my truck to grab my camera but i forgot that i brought it inside with me earlier. i turned on the camera on my cell phone and zoomed in as close as i could. i couldn't see the object on the screen, but i went ahead and took a picture of it anyway for further research on here. as it got directly in line with the moon (just above the moon) i could see a red blinking light underneath as well as a bright white light on the front, the back there was another white light, as it got to my southeast i noticed another white light, where i could see the lights were in a triangular formation. there was no sound that i could hear other than the traffic noise since i live less than a quarter mile from highway 41 and a csx railroad crossing. at 1:18 am 10 minutes after i first noticed the object, it moved to my south and disappeared in a bank of clouds, and never regained visual on it. i took a total of 8 photo's of this thing, neither of them turned out, but i am hoping further research might reveal what this object really was for sure. i will need to figure out how to upload photo's to this site with my cell phone because it's a replacement for my other one that i broke about a month ago.","distance":"Over One

appearance did not alter at all we were not scared of it but were more curious of what it was. we watched it for several minutes and then were distracted by more fireworks. when we looked back it was gone. a couple of minutes latter another orb appeared to our left. it looked excatly the same and appeared to be following the same flight pattern. we watched this one for a while till it slowly faded away. \r\n     on july 4th my sister and her husband were observing fireworks when they noticed a orange orb flying through the sky. after observing it for many minutes it faded out. several minutes

from the ground it will look smaller. so after that, we freaked out. we were talking about it as even more planes flew by, and we kept seeing those things , they looked like stars, and kept fading

went across the highway over our car (west side) than hovered off the highway i lost the object after we passed exit 3 on 691 east. we deduced that it was not a meteorite (that was my very first

my place. we both had 10x50 binoculars mounted on tripods. we were sky watching. \r\nat about 10:30 pm, i spot a glow round sphere moving north. it is moving away from us. it just seemed to appear....It glowed bright orange. it seemed to be accelerating. it went for about a mile northward and dimmed and disappeared. it was probably about 4,000 feet in altitude. it was about 4 or 5 miles away from us.\r\nthe second one came alone about 10:42 pm. it was almost straight above us when we saw it. it was moving very slow when we first saw it. it had a slight orange white glow to it. it was up higher than the first one. this one was at about 8,000 ft in attitude. within seconds of me getting it in view with my binoculars....... it speed up and continued to speed up for a few moments. it wasn't an instantly fast acceleration, but it got up to a very fast rate within a short distance. it was impressive. then it seemed to maintain this speed. it disappeared over the horizon. we saw this object for over a minute, but less than two minutes. this object moved in a straight line path and went north northeast. \r\nneither of these objects had any blinking light, no ffa marker lights. they glowed brightly, a solid steady light. no sound was heard. \r\nwe have both seen these types of objects a few times and some were much closer than the two we observed on this night.

observing the color of the clouds reflecting the sun. i am always watching the sky because of the multiple ufo sightings i've had in my lifetime. while looking straight up i noticed a very bright, reflective object with a black band in its mid-section traveling from north to south directly over our house. it was below the clouds at this time (there were different levels of clouds at this time). at first glance i thought it was a jet liner but then realized that it was to low and did not have wings (that were visible). it didn't match up at all with the thousands of jet planes i've seen while watching the skies. i heard no noise being produced. it kept a fixed speed as far as i could tell and never changed course while in my view. at this time i was excited as this was the most detailed ufo sighting by me. its outline was crisp and the black band was pitch black and the bright white surface i compare to a military luminary flare (i'm an army veteran). my 18 year old daughter came home at this moment and i called her outside and she witnessed about the last 15 seconds of its appearance until it disappeared into thick clouds. i estimate it disappeared into the clouds about 30-40 degrees above the southern horizon. just 1-2 hours before the sighting i had watched the video of the ufo with the black band over germany. i immediately grabbed my laptop and showed my daughter the video i had just watched and we were both in agreeance that what we had witnessed was very similar to the internet video. i've found other videos today which are very similar to what we seen. sadly, i do not own a photo or video camera to document my sightings but they are so common to me now that i kind of expect to see one on a semi regular basis.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

was my parents' wedding anniversary. my brother and i had gone out so they could have a meal together at home. the road to my friend's house curved upwards, south and east and then levelled out facing east. as i reached the top of the hill and looked own the street i could see 3 red lights in the sky. they were spread out and appeared to be some distance away. the sky was completely clear and the lights were totally stationary. i pointed them out to my brother. i knocked on my friend's door and told him to come outside. his brother also came out. while we were looking at these lights they very rapidly changed formation, moving in an anti-clockwise direction from my perspective. having moved very quickly they stopped immediately and then remained stationary for 2-3 minutes. the lights were not flickering and there was nothing else in the sky. we were all very excited by this. the lights continued to change positions, sometimes extremely quickly and other times more slowly. their proximity to each other was not regular and they formed larger or smaller triangular shapes. to the best of my knowledge, the land in that direction was largely agricultural. we watched this for about half an hour until we (unbelievably now!) got a bit bored of watching it. i seem to remember seeing a small article in the local newspaper the following week, reporting on a sighting by a policemen of a red light in the sky over a village to the east of stevenage.\r\n\r\ni was only 11 but these were not aircraft. i didn't bother telling any adults given that it was halloween. all 4 of us saw it. i don't know if the others remember it.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

plane's lights, i waited in vain for it to pass by. i heard no engine and saw no light for a few minutes, then the light passed over a nearby tree. \r\n\r\nthe light was approximately 20 feet across

further away, approximately 200 feet from me. the light covered the entire treetop, and appeared to be about 20 feet in diameter as it passed over the tree as if looking for something. \r\n\r\nit disappeared again and then lit up a different tree on a side street further away, before it vanished for good. i sat there confused as to what i had seen because there was no helicopter or plane sound at all. \r\n\r\ni still wonder what cast that light?\r\n\r\ni researched this sighting online, and found a similar sighting from august 2010 in nearby duryea, pa., affecting a woman in her car.
