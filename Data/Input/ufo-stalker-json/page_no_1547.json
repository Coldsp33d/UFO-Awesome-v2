a.M., after my last and final break of the night i decided to go into our garage and grab a soda before heading in for the night,(garage is about 15-20 feet from our back door and this is where i sit to gaze, perfect vantage point for rising moon and orions belt)after coming back out from the garage and locking the door behind me i flicked the garage light off and something bright caught my attention through my peripherals, i looked up and there was a star-like light, very high in the night sky, jetting overhead, now, i live fairly close to an airport, so i know exactly what a plane looks, and sounds like, i can hear them coming for miles in advance, this was 3 in the morning and absolute silence. i ran inside and looked up any recent meteor showers or comets and none were supposed to happen until the 28th and 29th of this month, still a few weeks away by the way. then curiously i looked into what they would look like maybe this was a stray( i know wishful thinking) and the website said if it was a comet or meteor it would have a very clear tail and would odbviously be a comet/meteor. no trail/tail/emissions or anything. now that was the only one that i saw that night. the following night i was very eager to get back out and see if i couldnt spot another with just dumb luck or what have you, that night, july 6th 2012, from approx. 12 midnight to around 330 a.M. me and my 18 year old sister witnessed a total of 3 together, same shape, same brightness,speed, everything. the 3 werent together and were at different times, coming from different locations, but ineveitably traveling towardds the same area of the sky(big dipper region). now, the following night, july 7th 2012 is when i became absolutely convinced these objects were not comets/meteors. my sister also became very intrigued and joined me outside for a couple hours. after seeing about 3 or 4 more doing the exact same things as all the others the previous nights, my sister says, \"oh my god, joe look at that!\" i got up and looked where she was looking and i saw two star-like objects, obviously very high in the sky, seperated by small space but not seperate crafts, it was very clearly a cigar shaped craft/object. that being the 5th object that night i witnessed a total of 4 more. finally, last night, july 8th, 2012, i witnessed 4 more. this time it was a family event! 18 year old sister, 28 year old sister, 33 year old brother in law, 10 year old niece, and myself all witnessed a distant, star-like object jetting across the sky completely silent, only this time, once it got to a certain point in the sky, it stopped, effortlessly, and began to get so bright that my sisters thought whatever it was had exploded! after about 10-15 seconds of tremendous brightness, it dimmed back down and continued traveling in the same direction. this is only over the span of 4 nights but you better believe ill be back out there every night im able to and i strongly believe ill be seeing many more. from july 5th 2012 to july 8th 2012 i witnessed 15 total crafts/objects and this is just the beginning. ufo's or whatever you wanna call 'em, love the nw! i didnt know where else to post this but i had to get it out, i really really hope more people in portland have been seeing this and come forward, its time to open our eyes and stop denying what these are, instead of trying to dismiss 'em, accept it for what it is. thanks guys!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

eventually the orange light disappeared and in it's place was 2 navigational lights perhaps, blinking white and red quite rapidly. then it continued on with that same bizarre side to side motion.  we

i remember it so clearly.  my dad & i were driving back from brinkley ar late at night on interstate 40 toward little rock.  it was around 8:45 or 9pm.  my dad looked out in the night sky and said, \"hey, look at that bright star!\"  we drove a little bit further he looked again & said, \"it must be a shooting star. make a wish.\" it caught his eye again because usually a shooting star will go out eventually. but this one didn't. i asked my dad, \"what do you thik it could be?\"  he said maybe it's a search helicopter. it seemed to be moving in a zig zag pattern. so we kept on driving down the road & the light kept getting stronger and closer. and eventhough we were moving too it seemed to be moving with us.  we kept watch on it and when it came really close my dad pulled off the road onto the shoulder. we stayed in the truck until it was about to fly over us then we both got out.  about the time it was flying over i looked over at the road to see the other drivers. i wanted to see if anyone else was seeing what we were seeing.  when i looked over at the other cars most everyone was stopped even in the middle of the interstate. even some big rig trucks were stoped.  all looking up at what we were looking at.  i looked back up and it started to fly over us. it was so big i couldn't even describe it's size. it was huge. it had a pointed nose, wings and fire coming out the back. the fire was like that of a space ship. it was the same shape too, round and tube like.  the ship was a flat black with no reflection on it. it looked like a stealth bomer.  the wierdest thing i remember about it, ther was no sound. it was calm and quiet. you would think a ship that size and with rocket like fule coming out of the back of it it would be extremely loud. but it wasn't. it seemed to move very slow as if it were gliding though the air. we had pulled over right by a row of power lines and it just continued to decend slowly over those power lines until it was out of sight. i was never scared and almost in a calm state. i should have been in a panic, but no i was accepting of what was happening & wathcing it disappear. we got back in the truck talked about it for a minute then drove away. it didn't seem like anyone on the interstate that night said anything to each other or even paid attention to each other. we all just calmly accepted it and went on our way. when we arrived home my mother was watching the news and we began to tell her about what had happened.  i don't think at first she believed us until they started to do a news segment on it. we all listened and the news reported that it was a fragment of a satelite that was falling to earth. they also said it landed in romance ar. and that was all that was ever reported about it that i know of.

so we ran down the stairs and through the sliding glass doors that were already open. that probably took us 10-15 seconds to do. their backyard was on the lake shore, so we stood next to the water and watched it in a standstill position across the 5 mile lake, and way up in the sky. it was so small that it looked like an over-sized star. no more could you see the red and blue lights. it sat stationary for about 4-5 minutes, when it moved straight up quite slowly for another minute; and then zoomed to the northwest until it disappeared. this action took less than 4 seconds. there was never a sound made by the object. we immediately called the police station and they blew us off, saying it was a weather balloon and so did our parents. i moved to southern fla. after that, and all was forgotten until a friend turned me on to tapes of other ufo sightings. i would like to be hypnotized to see how accurate my memory is, to which i think i haven't left anything out, or to see if we were in fact, abducted. i've heard that some people that have seen them, were abducted, but don't remember. oh, and none of us had a clue what it was, because we hadn't heard of ufo's. our parents had, but they didn't believe they existed.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":40604,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.0697475,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07082012-0021","longitude":-81.7851606,"occurred":-109616400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1341783991000,"summary":"4 14 year-olds observed a bright light through a bedroom window . upon curiosity, opened shutters to see a round ball of blinding light that had red and blue flashing lights around the middle of the object. after time, it went up over the house, and  to t","tags":["lights","flash"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":16798,"locationName":"Auburndale, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:9707"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Belton","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving my son to his fathers house while he was looking out the window to watch some of the fireworks that people were shooting off. most of them were only just above the tree line and he was disappointed that we couldnt go over and see them closer. all of a sudden he yells out that he sees a ufo. of course, as a parent i count it to a childs over active imagination and tell him its probably just a cool firework. he stands his ground and contines telling me it wasnt fireworks. all of a sudden he yells out again that another one has joined the first one and they are flying in the sky. because im driving i cant look out the window to where he is pointing and still think its probably fireworks. the next day i check the reports of the last couple days and notice there is one from a man in belton that sees exactly what my son was describing. pretty fascinated that he actually did see a ufo i contact ks mufon who urges me to make a report on it. i think its pretty cool that after all the sightings i have had my son has had one himself now.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":40603,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.8206227,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07082012-0020","longitude":-94.5288682,"occurred":1341117000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cross,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1341781691000,"summary":"Orange glowing x like ufos spotted off 71 hwy in belton mo","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":7,"locationName":"Belton, Missouri","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:9708"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover), Unknown","city":"Valdosta","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Outside taking still shots of a rainbow with my camera (cybershot).  i never noticed the object with the naked eye but later when i came in to upload pics i happened to notice the orb. i thought the object could have been preciptation but as you can tell there was not a drop of rain around us and the wind was pretty calm at the time.  the object was just in one frame of the shots that i took. bright white orb. the object never appeared to the naked eye.  could have been just precip but the storm died before arriving at airport and developed on the north side of town after completely dying out before arriving at airport.
