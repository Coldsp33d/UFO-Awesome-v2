of it. i was stunned, and watched it fly slow, about 50 or 60 mph, across my property. it made no sound what so ever. and it was totally black. my thoughts were that it was so low and could be seen so easily, who ever or what ever they were, they weren't trying to hide. i know what aircraft are and look like. i am world traveled and have seen all types of military and commercial aircraft. this was

another one exactly like the first one.  i was indoors looking out a bay window but heard no sound.  i was estatic and overwhelmed. excited.  all my life i wanted to be a witness to such an event. and, it happened.\r\ni told my friend about it who was taking a shower at the time but he didn't  believe me because he did not see them but as god as my witness, i saw them with my own two

several others were here celebrating the 4th & happened to notice the full moon, one deciding to take some pictures with his fairly expensive camera. nothing incredible showed up at first glance, but then the photographer decided to zoom in & started getting different sized red, white, & blue lights appearing in the digital photographs, which were not apparently visible through the camera scope alone, nor to the naked eye. he showed a few others his pics, & upon seeing them i ran to get my telescope. it is not much for a tele mind ya, but i couldn't see the objects with it either. we took turns looking through the tele as the photographer continued taking pictures, almost all of which captureded these mysterious lights, but in different locations each time, as if they were moving. i messed with the digital images on my pc some, magnifying some pictures to try & gain a better understanding of exactly what we may be looking at.. but retained the originals as well as their filenames when saving magnified images. i'm not in a good situation financially at the moment, so mailing or 'ups'-ing may not be the best means for me at this time, but i have all the pictures both on my pc & on flashdrive here, if there is some way i can email or otherwise post them(?) also, only lately have i begun 'looking up' quite so much, as recent sightings while out with freinds have been recurring to the point it's almost impossible not to notice.. awhile after dusk on june 10 2012, while finishing up a game of 21 (basketball) at the lawrence township recreation park in clearfield pa, one of the 5 adults & 5 children there at the time (i think it was amber, my fiance') made a comment to the effect of \"wow, wtf is that?!\" & pointed to an extremely bright light in the sky. all of the adults & all but 1 of the children took immediate notice of the almost unnaturally bright light seemingly hovering motionlessly overhead, & in as little time as it took for me to think \"whoa that can't be venus because it just passed in front of the sun a few days ago & isn't out this early in the night this time of year\" the object suddenly decreased significantly in luminousity, then accellerated towards what i believe to be a south-eastern-ish direction. it continued it's direction of travel for several seconds while the light faded & brightened several times before apparently vanishing into thin air. about a week later, while saying our so-longs & such, a younger brother of one of the witnesses to the first sighting was preparing to leave my place when i noticed a very similar bright white light in the southern sky traveling at a fairly quick rate of speed in an eastern direction. i pointed it out to my freind, and he 'kept an eye on it' as i ran to get my telescope. but, of course, by the time i returned with it, according to my friend, it had also just disappeared. neither of the first 2 encounters were photographed, unfortunately, & those incedents may or may not be related in any way, but seeing as these are the first we've managed to actually photograph i would love for someone who has seen much more than i could hope to have a look and see what they think of it all.. thanks for your time!

the sky.  at first i thought that it was a firework that was going up into the sky about to go off, however, it stayed in the orb like state and started to move west to east over the top of some homes in the area. i had my camera that takes hd video and filmed the object. then it gradually turned and went back west and then disappeared over the oquirrh mountains. i live near an airport that has both civilian and military aircraft and it did not look like an aircraft that we have seen before. as it was all red and orange and was a sphere shape . where on an airplane there is a blue/green light on one wing and a red light on the other and one in the middle.It was not flying in the normal flight path from north to south or south to north. it was moving east to west across the flight path. there were airplanes in the area looking at the fireworks in the area flying north to south at around the same elevation. they do this every year to watch the fireworks. this was much bigger then a helicopter or an airplane and it was a solid sphere shaped object. we could not figure out what this could be, as we have lived here for 13 plus years and are very familiar with all kinds of aircraft flying over our home. after watching the video that we took of it we couldn't come up with an answer to what this was. the area over the oquirrh mountains has many sightings of strange objects and has also been featured on many tv shows for issues like this.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path

the fireworks, as well as lighting off a couple of bottle rockets. i looked up in the sky during a period where there were no firework explosions going off. it was eerily quiet. there was a red object in the sky. i told my dad, \"look at that, that's not a helicopter,  or a plane, or a firework.\" we observed it for a few minutes, and when i got my phone out to take a picture, my phone died. i had just charged it that morning. as we watched, it slowly moved towards us, then hooked to the south. immediately afterword, it got dimmer and dimmer until it just disappeared. my dad then went to the store, and while he was gone, i looked north, towards the golf course. i saw two objects that looked like exact replicas of the first object. as i watched, they flashed slightly, then were gone. as soon as my dad got back, i saw another one of these objects to the east, the same direction as the first one. as it got closer, it slowly got dimmer, then it increased in brightness momentarily, then was gone. the next day, my mom was told by one of her coworkers that him and his wife had observed the final object just as we had. the only difference is that they saw one go towards the ground and possibly land to the west. when they tried to take a picture, their camera was malfunctioning, not allowing them to snap an image of the craft. none of us could hear any sound

north on bell rd., i was distracted by a triangular formation of 3 blue-white lights on my left that were particularly low on the horizon(about 15 degrees).  confused at their unusual color and formation, i slowed down to about 20 mph in order to look for any flashing avaition indicators and could find none evident during the incident. since there was not enough shoulder i was unable to stop and get out.\r\ncoming from out of the west, and travelling a straight line path from 10 o'clock to 4 o'clock it became obvious as they passed over the road that they were glowing spheres and not any lights associated with any normal avaiton lights associated with conventional aircraft. they did not appear to be part of a single craft but it was too dark behind the spheres bo be sure.  after about 20 seconds they had moved too far east of my position to see while i was still driving the car. unfortunately i did not get out of the car to continue further observation and they passed overhead and out of sight.  i estimate their size at around 30-50ft in diameter, spaced about 150-200ft apart, at an elevation of approximately 1000-1500ft, with a speed no greater than 150-200mph. \r\ni have seen

interesting. then noticed a larger object like an orange fireball moving at the same speed a plane or helicopter would move about 45 degrees above horizon; maybe twice the size of how a low-flying plane would look. freaked me out at first; i wanted to turn around and go back inside, but had to get a better look. object continued on a straight trajectory from north to south and became fainter and fainter, not so much like it was going farther away, but more like it was burning out. it ultimately became as small as the orange stars by the moon. i had no idea what it was, but after it had faded speculated that it could have been a meteorite (never seen one of those, either; just \"shooting stars\"). i was just awed at the sight, as in \"holy crap\" awed.\r\n\r\nwent back inside and
