States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"In the late 70's and early 80's i belonged to the unitarian universalist church of harford county (vp)in the state of maryland. this part of the state contains aberdeen proving grounds and many of the physicists, mathematicians and engineers who worked there attended this church. after service coffee talk was always interesting and i quickly learned how some scientist erected walls against controversial fields of investigation because of the perceived and real risk of damaging their standing and jobs.\r\nhaving set the stage i would now like to tell you of my experience on a tuesday evening in february of 1981 that i think you will find of interest as applies to the rendlesham incident. sorry i cannot think of the exact date after so much time. i have filed a report of this incident with mr. nick pope a few months ago.\r\non that evening i had just dropped off my father at his home after taking him to a physical therapist. he lived in baltimore and i in the northern county of harford. around 9:15 p.M. i turned off the main 695 highway onto cromwell bridge road traveling in a northeast direction. i followed this road until it ended at glen arm road and turn left in a more northerly direction. this is a rural area that provided a short cut to my home in bel air maryland. glen arm runs through a wooded valley and as i approached a wider valley that was cleared for agriculture my attention was grabbed by a brilliant white light shimmering off to my right. this light was whiter and brighter than any object i had ever seen. it looked as though a star had been plucked from the sky. this object appeared to be slowly following the ridge line on the opposite side of the valley. the top of this ridge carried harford road where i would turn left and follow into bel air maryland. i realized i would enter the hilly wooded area to the top of the ridge and could loose sight of the object so i picked up speed. at the top i turned left on harford road and very briefly saw a twinkle of this white object before loosing it to the winding road and overhanging trees. the night was cold and very clear. my heart sank as i could not spot the object. after a mile or so i approached mountain road. about a 300 ft. from the intersection and on the right side of the road there was a narrow line of trees that marked property lines and the location of a hog farm. the trees were totally leafless and i noticed multicolored lights on the opposite side of the trees and hovering at the top but not above them. they were red, green and blue and flashing. i had no idea what it was except possibly the high voltage tower on the other side of the tree line in a plowed corn field. when i got to the other side and next to the empty plowed field i looked to my right and hovering above the high voltage tower (small towers) were a series of flashing multi colored lights in what looked like diamond pattern. horizontally it was as long as a small car but i could not see any shape. apprehensively i exited my car and started walking through this dry plowed field. i kept looking up and down as footing was dicey. the object made no sound. i got to about 150 feet from the object and stopped to take a close look. my head was racing trying to figure out what i was seeing. it made no sense. it was clearly hovering above the tower. the towers themselves have no lights, i discovered, as they are not tall enough to require them. it appeared to look like an elongated diamond shape according to the light which seemed to denote junctions of the form. it was wider than it was tall and about the width of a small car and perhaps 4-5 feet high. every possibility was racing through my mind and was leaving my mind making my comfort zone shrink more and more. it was not a helicopter as there was no wind or noise and it took me a while, moving around, to get an angle at which i could see what was between the lights via star light reflections. the surface of the object was black and looked like polished obsidian or glass and it looked like, in part, a faceted stone as i could not make out the exact form on the bottom due to the lack of star light. it was that black. i could hear a low humming sound but thought it might be the tower. finally my fear had surpassed my curiosity and, i'm sad to say, i awkwardly ran back to my car and sped home. \r\narriving home i was excited to say the least and told the story to my wife after which i called the local newspaper to see if they have had any reports of strange objects. by this time it was about 10 pm and there was one person on the desk. i asked him if he had any such reports and he replied “funny you ask that because i just got off the phone with some people in edgewood who said they saw a bright white light hovering over a high voltage line and all the lights in the area went out”.\r\nthe next day i contacted the head of mufon who was also the areas helicopter traffic reporter'. he asked me if i had lost time and we talked for a while about it and other sightings in the area over the years but he never came out to interview me.\r\ni drew a line drawing of the object and shared my experience and drawing with a physicist friend of mine, rick saucea, who was one of the few upon which i could confide without being poo pooed. we were both excited about this sighting and went to a mufon meeting which, for the both of us, was not a serious event and mainly inhabited by very imaginative confused people. i make no inference to other groups but only my own experience there. some years went by and i got a call from rick who wanted me to see something. he brought me a video of a show on the sci fi channel hosted by one of the cast of star trek. sorry i forget the name of both the show and the host. it consisted of interviews and recreations of the events at rendlesham air base. i was staggered as too how much their sighting mirrored my own.The film effect of the craft was about exactly what i saw. he said the air around the craft was electric and it looked like polished stone, i believe, and the mock up on this show was close to perfect in size and form. i felt all the doubt i had of my sanity disappear, as such an event shakes you a bit.\r\nyou see mr. pope, if you follow mountain road you come to edgewood where the bright light over power lines were seen and if you go just north of edgewood you come to aberdeen military research and development facility. all the pieces had fallen into place. my feeling about the object is it was not “manned” but was a drone of some kind and without a doubt used tech well beyond anything i have seen or think possible by our species. a scientific leap but the most rational to me.\r\ni'm getting old and have seen now many mock ups of the event and i thought i would come out about this and perhaps add another piece to this and maybe let those guys know there was another sighting across the pond. \r\ni have enjoyed your professional approach to this area of investigation and concluded you should be the one with whom i would share this story. my hope is you will not think this ravings but rather the honest description of a life changing event relevant to redlesham, without a doubt.\r\n","distance":"21-100

to study spiritual energy and ectoplasm; the unseen as described in the quran  and everything concerning the possibility of extra terrestrial life.  i started collecting crystals and meditating to high frequency vibes. \r\n\r\ni also began to take photos at dusk - wherever i happened to be.  on the 21st  of march, in 2016, i took the usual photos of the area around and above my home.  as a habit, i resisted using a flash for fear of distorting whatever might be projecting natural light.  that night, took photos of what i believed (at the time) to merely be the dark night sky above and behind my home - where i had photograiphed other phenomena  (but not observed with my naked human eye), including tall dark smoky looking images, weird images reflected in a car mirror, and objects floating to the ground like a spider on a web into my ancient trees.  it wasn't until a month or so later that i noticed the two attached  photographs, as i was casually flipping through my ipad and deleting bad photos.  i've taken lots of photos since, but have taken nothing that compares to these!  \r\n\r\nattached are photos of the event.  also attached are two comparative photos: one showing the night sky featuring a triangle of stars, one of which appears to have been near the area from which what i call \"the lightship\" may have been traveling.  there is another object in the

my granma's house,a mountain beautiful house where you can see the mediterranian sea right in front of you.We were talking, laughing. suddenly, my cousin asked me what was that bright light in the horizon flying just above the sea. i told her it was probably a star, it looked like a star. and i continued talking. she then screamed: i moved!! i looked back at it again and i found it was not moving. i told her she was imagining things.She swore it moved.I decided to stare at it and suddently, the bright light started moving right, and then went back to its spot, and then left, and then back to its spot. we were surprised and tried to analyse the thing.Suddenly, the objct started moving with a phenomenon speed going towards the mountain, which was on the right of the house.It moved silently and then stopped mid flight, then it riversed gear, then moved forward, then riversed gear again and then moved forward again. then i saw its shape , clearely, it was so close.It was like a disc, with a fish tale form on its back. blue and red lights were flickering all around its surface. it stopped a moment, projected a light from its below, it appeared that it was landing, and disappeared behind the mountain. the weird thing is, it remember the event lasted a minute or two. the atatched video will show you it lasted 5 minutes, and i didnt film all the event. plus, my cousins don't remember the event as clearly as i am. and i feel like some pieces are missing. it is a bit blurry when i try to focus, especially with the time thing. apparently it lasted for many many minutes. and i discovered that i have the video only days ago. i dont remember filming it, i remember taking a photo of it and my phone at the time had a poor camera quality so i put it down 'cause it didnt show the real form of the object. i remember that i was soooo excited and happy during the event, waving to them etc my cousins were scared. i wasnt. i'm still so curious about what happened that night.I hope you help me to make the video more clear. thank you","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:07:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,

it.\r\ni was about 10 or so and can not remember the exact year but know it had to be around 1963.\r\n in my classmates term paper he did talk about livestock mutilations and a number of odd
