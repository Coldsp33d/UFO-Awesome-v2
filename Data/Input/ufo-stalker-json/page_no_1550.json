Unknown","city":"Springfield","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On july 4 at approx eleven pm i was standing in my back yard looking at the stars and etc  when from my right an orange orb or light appeared traveling at a slow speed.  it was relatively high in the sky but appeared to be very close to my position and yet i couldn't see any structure               associated with the light it was as if it were on fire, a frozen fire because  there was no flickering nor smoke nor was anything  falling from the object.  i was completely floored by the sight of it mostly because this was a relatively large size light , about half the size of my thumb at arms length and larger vertically than horizontally and yet no sound could be heard, no flickering of light such as all aircraft have fore and aft  and so i couldn't figure out what it was.  for a moment i entertained the possiblility it was a meteor and hoped that if it were one it would drop some material that i could retrieve.\r\n as i watched this light proceed in a north to south direction i noticed , again to my right, just over my right shoulder,  a quick movement and looking that direction i saw another light that seemed to swoop (for want of better way to explain how it appeared to fly) into view coming from a north to south direction and changed direction  immediately to a east west direction and then again to the same apparent direction as the other light which apppeared to be from north to south..  it assumed the same height and speed of the original light   and  was also orange and appeared to be on fire but with no flickering observed nor flame, smoke or matter emitted and it was completely silent.  there was also no wobbling nor wavering of either object in the sky..  the second  object, although seeming to be the same apparent size of the first object was more of a tear-drop shape than the other one and it had a rather spiky appearance to its light.  these objects appeared to be  entirely composed of light i could not make out any features. however they flew as if they were intelligently controlled, i mean they seemed to have purpose. \r\n\r\ni was thinking someone else must be able to see these objects, people were out  watching and shooting- off fireworks and so their was good  chance that someone was looking up at the sky at the time  --\r\ni felt very excited seeing these objects because i've never seen anything like them before and i felt i was seeing a priviledged view of something spectacular  but by no means did i think i was the only one who could see these objects..  the big dipper was in the northwest sky and was setting..These objects were approximately half-way up the dipper or a degree or so more than  half way up the sky in my estimation, about the same height a small aircraft would fly and lower than a jet would fly. they were moving slower than i have observed any aircraft fly other than a blimp.  \r\n i have seen plenty  of aircraft in the skies   and none have ever had running lights as large as the size of these two , not even a helicopter's light appear as large  and helicopters i've seen in the near vicinity of my house always have had  white lights.  these lights were definitely not white but were quite orange tinged with golden yellow.\r\n\r\nthe two lights, (the second light had somewhat caught up  to the first light), continued to move steadily and at the same height in a southerly direction and i as watched them, looking from one to the other,  i noticed the first light  appear to turn to the west and began to get smaller as if fading out or even burning out?  i watched it completely disappear in less than a minute, less than fifteen seconds actually.  i looked back to the other light and at that moment  it too appeared to change direction, from moving south to moving to the west  and  it began to fade from sight appearing to be going west directly away from me straight ahead of me, as opposed to the first one which had traveled further south and therefore was at an angle to me (west/southwest) when it disappeared.  i was facing due west.  i did not take my eyes off of the second one  and i  watched it  as  it got progressively smaller until i could see only  a tiny white circle such as a star would appear in the distant sky  and it  seemed  to be very far away, but for all i know it had stayed in place and merely faded out.    it had  also taken less than a minute to disappear, that is,  for it to no longer appear to be present in the sky. there was nothing left in the sky along their apparent flight path   such as debris etc, smoke, or contrails.\r\ni have seen planets in the night sky and they always appear to be sharply round or at least sharp in their outline  whereas these objects had irregular outlines and were brilliant in appearance, really beautiful in color   although neither gave  off a glow nor had a \"halo\"\r\n i don't know what happened to either object except they appeared to become progressively smaller until i could no longer see them at all.\r\n  i scanned the sky for another hour on this clear night (with the full moon behind me) for anything even vaguely resembling what i saw but did not see anything moving in the sky , not even the occasional  aircraft i normally see in the evening. \r\n\r\ni have never seen anything like this before but im eighty percent sure there's an explanation other than an extraterrestrial one.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

no engine hum; in fact, it gave no sound at all.  what struck us odd was that it had four perfectly spaced lights that were larger than those of higher flying planes.  typically well see planes with flashing strobe lights and the green/red starboard and port lights flashing as well.  the lights were perfectly spaced apart and solid, only the ones on the east and west sides (it was flying northward) flashed but not quickly like the typical planes lights.  we watched it slowly fly above us northward until it disappeared from sight.  it might have been a plane, but other planes in the area that night all gave a hum and the lights were smaller, brighter and had the green & red colors.  this \"square object\" was, from our standpoint, about the size of a quarter or 3/4\" diameter.  as a comparison, the lights on the other planes at a similar, or higher, altitudes were the size of a small pointed felt-tipped marker, while the strange craft had lights the size of pencil eraser heads; definetely larger and not as bright or strobe-like.  it might have been a plane, but it was odd enough that we thought we should report it just the

pm, at alum creek dam, my family and i were in our boat motoring back to the dock and i looked up and noticed a glowing reddish-orange ball that seemed to float across the sky below the cloud cover. we listned to see if we could hear a motor or helicopter blades, but there was no sound. the object seemed to move at a good pace and the light was steady. we watched it until it disappeared into the cloud cover at the horizon. the orange glow was prominent when it was overhead, but not as much as it went farther away. it reminded me of the iss with the way it moved, but the color and the fact it was below the clouds made it clear it was not iss.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

few fireworks began and while looking up we saw this strange red object.  it was glowing and seemed to be transparent with a white light emanating from inside.  we thought it was some kind of balloon at first but we realized right away that it was something very unusual.  we watched it float into the distance at a steady pace.  it appeared to stop and hover for a few minutes and then disappeared.   we were very excited because we knew we had seen something rare.
