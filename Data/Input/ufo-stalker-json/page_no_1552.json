they racing upward to explode like they usually do?\" i asked my cousin, \"what are those!?\" we thought they looked like chinese lanterns on fire. then we noticed they weren't going up, they were moving sideways, and i thought it was weird that they seemed to be \"caught in the wind\" and moving away from where the fireworks would be. i'm not good with direction, but we were facing fair park from the parking lot, and these orbs were moving past us, in the direction behind us.\r\nthey were not moving quickly. they never seemed to stop moving but taking their very sweet time, maybe going about 20-30 mph. everyone was staring at them, trying to figure out what they were. they were reminiscent of tail lights on a car, but far apart from each other. they were also hovering rather low, which is the other reason i discerned they weren't fireworks. low, slow moving, and non-exploding. and then i got impatient waiting for the fireworks and forgot all about them.\r\nuntil the next day. my brother in law arrived at my house to pick up his kids and he sat down and said, \"i saw something last night.\" the kids were around so he was hesitant to go into detail at first but i instantly

glow from celing to floor and sometimes random blue or red lights similar to a laser flash on the wall. they always seem to know where i am despite being sneaky and in complete darkness. there are also lights that illuminate the backyard and roof to chicken barn, despite a large canopy of trees. these lights come to the corner of the windows and glow. they glow from onr room to another as there are several hollow knots in the wood. these lights appear to be like flashdrones i researched online. they illuminate in the thick leafy trees and undergroth. today i saw a path through thr row of trees and vegetation that appeared to be blown out on all sides from center flattening and killing all the plants which were totally healthy yesterday. \r\n\r\nthere are several different flying objects from what sound and appear to be a helacopter yet when on video they shoot all over the screen while flickering and changing color. in one video there were 2 small glowing blue lights in the sky when one dimmed out and left what appear to be smoke trails that go all over on the screen in the video.\r\n\r\nthere have been what sound like military jets chasing after a flying object. \r\n\r\none night when my house began to light up at 1am i called a friend to check\r\nit out,and as he circled around on the loop rd he saw someone squatted by the boat in the driveway. i heard him yell and ran to the window in time to see him chase and illuminated object/person with his car until reaching the edge of field, while then jumping out and beginning a foot chase. eventually the person got away and when my friend came back i could still see the person glowing/illuminating a couple acres away at the end of the field. i then began to ask what? who? how? when we herd a click and the backyard that had been light up for hours suddenly went pitch black. then a massive round saucer with red blinking lights appeared overhead and continued on its way. \r\n\r\ni have also herd footsteps all throught the night causing branches to break and snap. when this happens i usually hear coyotes howl and loons beinning to sound.    twice ive herd a loud growl unlike anything ive ever herd before.\r\n\r\nits as though im completely surrounded. i can totally feel myself being watched!!  erie!!\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, Over 1

no clouds in the sky and it was stationary at first, but difficult to judge its distance, but it appeared to be far overhead. the twinkle-effect changed to a slow blink remained still in the sky, at roughly 70 degrees from the horizon to our west. after about 25 seconds, it accelerated eastward and flew directly over us. it was the size and luminance of a bright star visible in a city. it travelled eastward, accelerating twice in bursts. the acceleration pattern reminded me of shifting a car into a higher gear, but between shifts the speed was constant. it continued blinking at roughly 35bpm for the entire travel time. at about 85 degrees above the eastern horizon, after it had passed over our heads, it arced roughly 5 degrees southward toward i-96e. during it's acceleration process, the object \"up-shifts\" from stationary to what would roughly be 800-1000mph if it were flying in the upper atmosphere where it appeared to be. when it reached about 60 degrees above the eastern horizon it appeared to either slow to a stop or change trajectory to match our path of eyesight. my coworker and i watched it return to a flicker or twinkle pattern, grow slightly dimmer, and

the sky, which i often do, and noticed this bright ball. it startled me because for a brief moment i was going to comment on how odd it was to see venus in the sky at this time of night during this time of year. i immediately realized this wasn't a planet or start. it was moving. it was moving in the direction towards the ohio river, which is roughly north east. it moved it a straight line, had no tail or anything that could make it a potential shoot star. as it moved it hovered up a little bit than back down and was dimming as it moved.It got brighter again and then dimmed and disappeared. this only lasted a minute tops. i tried to rationalize it as best i could but shortly after and right before the sighting, some airplanes had flown over head. i compare the two and knew for a fact that this ball of light could not have been a plane, because i never lost sight of any of the planes that flew over head after the sighting and of course they didn't dim the way this ball did nor did the ball have the flashing lights like the planes. i can't say i was surprised or frightened by this, this isn't my first sighting of a ufo.

a spot to stand and watch, the show had already begun. we were standing infront of three small trailer type venders selling ice cream and snacks. all three of the venders had elctricity, with lights and ice boxes, radios. we had been watching for approx. 10 min. when my girlfriend pointed out to be a redish orange orb object. the object seemed to glow and had no exterior lights. it did not glow with a brightness that hurt your eyes but yet still very bright. my first thought was that it was a peice of burning ash from the fireworks, but it came from my right side a good distance away from the fireworks when i first noticed it. after a min. the ball had moved and appeared to be heading on a path directly above the fire works. by this time i thought it was not ash because it had not burned out and had been moving a steady straight path. i did not see any lights so i thought it could not be a plane. after another min. the orb was just about out of my sight because of a tree line, all the power goes out in the venders stations behind me! the one stations lights flickered for an few seconds and i could here one of the venders say. does anyone know what just happend to the power. a min. later the lights came back on and the light in the sky was gone. when i noticed i could not see this object any more, i did notice a plane, which immediately reminded me that this is not what i just saw. the plane headed in the direction i origanally saw the object. this was a big gathering of people, there must have been 1500 people in the surrounding blocks, all outside looking up. my girlfriend and i could not have been the only two to see this, if u were watching the fireworks u could not miss it,  and i was very mad i did not have my phone on me to record all of this

after the object passed, a dark double rotor helicopter with a searchlight flew in the area the object came from. the helicopter flew over the cornfield for a few minutes and then left the area. the searchlights also went off when the copter left the area. i've never seen these searchlights before. the object was appearantly to us very large we guess larger than a jumbojet.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

cages were secure when i noticed the chickens making a lot of noise. i searched the area to make sure no raccoon or possum were around then headed back towards the house. i observed 4 white lights rotating clockwise then meeting in the center then spreading out and circling again. at first i thought it to be spotlights or something of that sort but then i realized where i was and that it is a thursday night with no grand events going on in or around town not to mention this place dies after jeopardy goes off. it has been really humid and hazy \"we live very close to the kentucky river\" with a lot of cloud cover so it was hard to get a good detailed look, and the fact that with all the haze and fog no source for the light could be spotted coming from the ground. i then went and got my wife to make sure i wasn't just imagining it and she as well saw what i saw. i tried to capture it on video with a camera and cell phone but was not very successful at getting anything other than a pitch black picture. the event lasted about 15 minutes then stopped. my wife then went inside and posted about it on facebook, low and behold a friend that lives on the other side or garrard county had witnessed it as well. she stated her sons told her to come outside and see the \"aliens\", she described exactly what we did with the same duration. still unsure about what it could have been.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":40283,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.735428994910656,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07052012-0105","longitude":-84.55862856044743,"occurred":1341552000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kentucky","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1341556542000,"summary":"4
