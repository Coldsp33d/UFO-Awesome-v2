saw the episode in england with the triangle shapped ufo in the woods and then they got a picture of it.Wow i freaked .Ok hear it is. i saw the same one .I no for a fact.I was in norcross at a storage unit when i just happend to look up and see a bright light like someones welding torch. it lasted about ten seconds.Then a super bright white vapor trail popped out of the bright light.The vapor trail was as wide as the black triangle that came out of the vapor trail.The vapor trail disapated as fast as it appeared.Out shoots this black triangle with a white yellow light in each corner of the craft with this reddish mesh like light in the middle.The lights were very dim because i figgured it just came throgh the stratisphere.It was way up there.So the thing had to be huge.After it came out of the vapor trail.It shot across the sky so fast and silent it was gone in about 2 seconds.Just how big i dont no but im guessing 300 ft or more.I no what i saw .I dont see things i got 20 12 vision.I no the differnce between ufo and aircraft spent whole life around aircraft.All i got to say is not a day goes by that i dont think about what i and many others just like me have seen.The possibillites are endless.After seeing those pictures ive been lost .Need some answers wow this has really ben messing with my head you no .Ty yall keep up the good work   ","distance":"Over One

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We were walking around my neighborhood watching fireworks in the sky, when all of a sudden we see an extremely fast moving, glowing red object, about the size of a star. what drew my attention was that the object never blinked, but did give off a red pulsating light, which seemed to dim around the edges of the object.It seemed to be travelling from west to east. my position was in utica, mi, looking south. at first, we passed it off as a satellite. once we continued walking towards my friend's townhouse, and got into the complex, we were not even 40ft. away from his door, when i looked up, i assumed, and pointed out that the object was back again, this time at a much lower altitude, and a slower speed, which almost seemed like a slow hover, again moving west to east. the object was so close that we were able to determine that it was not a fixed wing aircraft, since there was no green light on the opposite side, and that it also didn't blink, just pulsated a very bright red glow, which would alternate shades of red/orange. again, i was looking south, while my position was in utica, mi. the object gave off absolutely no sound, during which my first sighting i wouldn't have expected because of the altitude, but when i seen it for a second time, way closer, again, no sound, which would completely eliminate the idea that this was somehow a helicopter or airplane. my buddy did bring up those chinese lanterns, but the 1st sighting would rule that out, since it made it from horizon to horizon in about 8 seconds. and the much closer 2nd observation, would have revealed a yellow glow, and some structural definition, if it truly were a lantern. the one thing that really made my head spin, was when i attempted to take a photograph of the object through my phone's 8mp camera. the object would not show up at all, even when it was close by during our 2nd observation. when i returned home, my mother immediately said to me that she believed that she saw a ufo. so i asked her to describe it, and she gave me the same answers i gave for my 2nd observation. she has an iphone, and also tried taking pictures, which all turned out black. i have 3 more witnesses that were with me personally who all saw the object, plus my mother has three more witnesses who saw her sighting, which i believe was the same sighting i had for my 2nd observation. on top of it, my buddy who lives in sterling heights, which is south of utica, also saw two red objects, and the 2nd one also being much lower in altitude. he was also looking south, and reports that the object flew from west to east. for my 2nd observation, i would give an azimuth of 77 degrees, i'm telling you guys, that 2nd time i saw \"it\", this thing was close, and huge. and that's exactly what my buddy is saying, the only difference is he believes the object was bigger than what i saw, which i assume is because he was farther south than me, meaning he was closer. he described the size of the object to be the same as if you held a quarter out at arms length, while my 2nd observation would have been the size of a penny held at arms length. i saw the chinese lanterns that plagued the metro detroit area last july 4th, these were not those lanterns. i spread the word out right away last night to get some friends to look up, and see if someone could catch this thing on either video or picture. i also assume it wasn't showing up on our camera's, because it's spectral range was most likely closer to infrared.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

suddenly pulsate a very bright white light.  when the white light dimmed, the object returned to it's orange orb like appearance.  the pulse was like a three second build up to a suddenly immense white light.  about five to seven seconds for every pulsation.  the object began to fly directly towards myself and my friend.  it got closer and seemed to move faster.  when it was just about directly overhead, i made a joke that what we were seeing was superman.  i made the joke because directly overhead it didn't appear to be an orb anymore it appeared to be a capital y flying across the sky like superman with his arms out.  at the ends of the three points of the y were orange orbs.  the rest of the y was pulsating a yellowish white to an all white flash at it's peak.  at this time when it was directly overhead we expected to be able to see it clearly for a while, but then it sped up quickly.  in about a few short seconds it was something so visible to something so tiny as a

could not identify what they were. i called my mother and father in law outside for them to help me identify. the objects would fly very fast, then slow down and hover in the sky, then pick up speed again. out of nowhere three more appeared behind the first two, flying in the same kind of chaotic change of direction path. the objects eventually completely dimmed out, but we could still see the black outlines/shadow of the objects. i was so confused on what they were, i started researching my newspaper and internet the next day to get some answers. i found over 100 reported sightings of the

before bed.  i'm an avid sky watcher and i happened to look up in a slightly ese direction.  at first i noticed what i thought was the iss flying over because i like to watch it as often as i can with binoculars and to the unaided eye it appears to be the brightest star in the sky as it is moving.  i have since checked though and the iss wasn't due to make a visible flyover in lockport, ny last night.  i'm assuming it may have been a satellite?  almost at the same time i noticed a very large bright orange \"shape\" following the \"satellite.\"  it was roundish in shape but irregular.  you could obviously tell that it wasn't perfectly round or sphere shaped.  at first i thought it was a plane but it only took about 2 seconds to completely discount that aspect.  i also discounted that it might have been a chinese lantern.  it deliberately followed the path of the \"satellite.\"  what i keep referring to as a possible satellite visually appeared to be nothing other  than what a satellite appears to be when viewed from the ground.......\"a moving star.\"  at all times the ufo exactly followed the same flight path(which was mostly straight) of the \"satellite,\" maintaining the same distance.  after approximately 30 seconds both objects disappeared suddenly and completely. it moved in a southerly direction.  i've only seen one other ufo in my life so i was quite excited while at the same time trying to make note of all details that i could.  at first i was hesitant to talk about it but i happened to mention it to a good friend that i communicate regularly with on facebook and he posted the following reply to me:  \"this was posted on the local news station here in tulsa, oklahoma facebook page....Any one else see a strange orange light move soundlessly across the sky from ssw to nne last night about 9:45. i had another friend see it and said it was 5 orange lights when it came by her..It was moving as fast as a plane, but it wasn't a plane.\"  now tulsa is a long ways from here but it sure seemed that it might not be a coincidence.  i'm sorry i don't have alot of evidence.  i have no camera and my cell phone won't take photos at night.","distance":"501

he called me and his dad to come outside because our son  saw some lights. it was approximately 10:05 when we joined him on deck. i didn���t think much about it because it was the fourth of july; however, he pointed out four unusual red/orange lights that hovered in unison from the east to west direction. our back deck faces north. it was peculiar to see these lights drifting slowly from east to west against the night sky when there were plenty of fireworks. the first three set of lights formed a trianglular shape with the fourth trailing behind. we then called our oldest 17-year old son to see these lights and ask what he thought about them. shortly after he came to see them we noticed that the first three set of lights in a triangle shape lost the first bottom left light, as it simply disappeared. our 17-year old also agreed how odd the lights appeared. we noticed some airplanes to the southeast and we could hear their engines slightly. the remaining three lights continued to hover together and kept at the same distance for some time. the lights began to trail behind a set of trees so my eleven-year old son and i came down from the deck to move to the east part of our yard to visually follow the lights after they began to go behind the trees (to the north of us). we then noticed only one light left, and that last light mysteriously dissappeared before it fully went behind the trees. my eleven-year old son and i went further into the east section of our yard to see the light before it completely went behind the trees, but then we noticed that it too disappeared. what was peculiar is that after i stood there for a while looking towards the sky where the lights were, i noticed a round ring in the sky that sort of looked like a white aura or white glowy circle of smoke. my eleven-year old son explained to me later what prompted him to call us. he said that as he was watching the fireworks on our back deck he noticed one light hovering still in the sky. he thought nothing of it, and continued watching fireworks; however, when he turned and noticed the light he noticed the three additional lights joining and hovering along with what became the tail light. this was the first sighting of two this particular evening.
