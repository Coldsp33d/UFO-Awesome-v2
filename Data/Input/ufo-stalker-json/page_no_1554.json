small white orbs were visible in the south over the tree line moving toward the west. the objects were maintaining level flight and traveling at a continuous velocity, keeping an equal distance between each other.\r\n\r\ni went in and alerted the second witness who also viewed the objects, discounting them as ���flares.��� i continued to watch the fireworks and three more ���train lights��� appeared over the tree line in the same area as the first two and traveled in the same (direction, formation, and speed).  they were not aircraft as they were not strobing green/red and they never made any noise.\r\n\r\nonce again i went in and alerted the second witness to come outside, we both stood in the yard watching the objects ���float��� across the sky. at this point more of the similar objects appeared over the tree line to the north, traveling south to the same relative area in the sky.\r\n\r\nwhen i noticed the objects coming from the north they started out as a bright yellow/white light (train light), turning red as they came closer. when the objects passed overhead they fizzled out and just their circular black outlines were visible. \r\n\r\nas one of the dark object traveled from an overhead position to the south, an exploding firework illuminated it just above the tree line. this allowed me to view the side of the side of the dark object, which had a shape likened to a muffin (circular on the bottom then rounded with a dome on the top.) when the object was illuminated it appeared to be grey in color.\r\n\r\nafter that the second witness encouraged me to go inside and get my camera phone and take a video of one of the objects coming from the north, moving towards the south.\r\n\r\nreflecting on the incident these objects made no noise, traveled in a similar direction, all at slow consistent speeds. all the objects had similar flight characteristics, appearances, shape, and sizes. as the objects moved to the south their color became faint, ?Due to  increased altitude? then they would fade into the southern sky and more would follow from the north.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

satellites, the international space station, and the space shuttle fly over. and these orange lights have me spooked.  i've never seen anything like it. and they were orange, not red-orange, and not yellow-orange, just a deep orange color.\r\n\r\nthere were at least 3 (i saw them between trees). i noticed one at first, and the solid orange, size, and speed were enough to make me take notice and be curious.  but then i noticed the other two, which seemed to be in \"formation\", with one ahead of the other.  then i tried to locate the first one again, but i couldn't find it. \r\n\r\ni stood and watched the other two as they moved away, and saw one catch up with the other and seemingly pass it, before it faded away, as the eastern sky either had haze or clouds.  then i watched the remaining one until it, too, faded into the distance.  i should also point out that there was a large full moon rising in the southeast at this time.  but these lights were headed pretty much due east.\r\n\r\nif they were moving slower, and weren't orange, i would think they were a formation of 3 helicopters, with one being way off the side.  but not likely.  \r\n\r\nfirst, no sound at all.  i live in a quiet area, and it was very quiet at the time, and even though they had already passed me, if they were helicopters, i would have heard something beforehand, and still heard it fading away as i stepped outside.  but not a sound.  \r\n\r\nsecond, the speed in which they were moving wasn't correct.  if you've watched the iss fly over, this was about 1.5 times that speed, meaning if they were at high altitude, they were moving fast.  at first i thought i was seeing the iss, except that it was way too large, and bright orange, almost glowing.  then of course the fact that there were 3 of them. and at this speed, and the distance they seemed to be from me, i don't think helicopters can move that fast.\r\n\r\nthird, i was also seeing planes in the distance, in a pattern, that had taken off from o'hare airport and heading south.  so if these lights were helicopters, or any other aircraft, i don't think they would have had clearance to pass through chicagoland like that, in that direction (west to east), crossing the airplane traffic.  unless they were at a very high altitude and would not interfere with other planes in the area.\r\n\r\ni am perplexed, and i can't stop thinking about this.  whatever i saw was definitely not ordinary.  it was either aircraft with a new type of lighting (no flashing, just solid orange, is that even allowed?), or some type of experiment, such as planes traveling at high altitude with large, solid orange lights, or something very spectacular.  i have never, ever seen anything like it before. \r\n\r\nand i can tell you this, if these lights moving any faster, i actually would have been scared.  at the speed they were moving, it did seem like they were possibly man-made, and felt that there could be some explanation.  but i cannot explain what they could have been, or what altitude, or what speed.\r\n\r\ni really hope that i wasn't the only one that saw them, and also hope that they can be explained, because it's really bothering me.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

on the different islands.  i was watching the gig harbor show alone at this point as everyone else in the group had gone in different directions to try and find other vantage points, and the three tree point show had just started and was very close to me, but somewhat obscured from the 150ft+ tall bluff that was standing on.  at some point, i see what appears to be just another firework that had just been launched, but this one was traveling at an extremely acute angle from the water and was passing behind the tree tops below me.  as i am watching that, the gig harbor show is hitting the crescendo and really popping, as well as about 15 more shows that i can see from there when i realize that this \"firework\" is still going.   i mean, it hasn't detonated yet. now, the thing is totally unobscured and ascending at a nice steady pace on the slightest ever, upward-curving arc of a trajectory, almost in a straight line. about this time i am thinking \"this is a ufo!\"  -when suddenly from behind me and elevated even more than i, was a large group of folks in a yard were asking \"what is that?!\"  i turned and asked \"you see that too?!\"  the entire group saw it and one guy kept repeating, \"that ain't right, that ain't right\" the children were asking if it was a helicopter or plane, and we all studied it as it left our atmosphere in a fading glint as it got so small we could no longer see it.   at which point i said, that was not one of ours...  i asked if they had seen where it came from and if had exited the water and they said they didnt witness that part, it was just there and started it ascent. the group were all silent now and i see my family walking back down the hill right by their yard, and i could hardly contain myself and asked did you see the ufo?! to my dismay they started laughing at me and said no in an incredulous manner. as they were snickering i said all those people right there saw it, right?  they all agreed and were astounded amazed and talking about it as we returned back home, up the hill.\r\n\r\ni would estimate the object was roughly in between 1-2 miles away from me, leaving the surface or from under the surface of the puget sound between three tree point and vashon island. the object itself was glowing an orange color and slightly pulsating at an irregular rate. it's tought to estimate the size, as most of it appeared to be corona, so it could have been anywhere from 20ft across to 40ft. its speed was slow and steady, no unusual changes in course or disappearances.  we were looking ssw and it was on a trajectory that was leaving away from us at a sse direction. it continued to climb slow and steady, on an almost arc-like line, but ever so slight, until it slowly faded out against the hazy sky.  the entire event taking place in about 1 minute.\r\n\r\nit looked like a firework that was shot horizontally from a boat out in the middle of the bay, that slowly climbed into space, never detonating.  i suppose it could have been a dud of a firework, but it was the best dud i've ever seen!   and it actually was way cooler than the awesome shows that we got to see!! \r\n\r\nthere literally had to be hundreds and hundreds of people that witnessed that from down below.  and i doubt there will be a whisper about it in the news.

observation to me(i had seen ufo's in my earlier life)and i went out with 10x binoculars to look for myself. there was a moderate cloud cover starting from over my house(meridian, id)and stretching towards her area. i did use the stars to get my binoculars adjusted for infinity but thought i would not see anything because of the cloud cover. after waiting for about 10 min. i noted a bright red 'largest-star'-sized moving object moving generally north to south roughly between her house and mine. so that confirmed(to me)her general observation. i used a steady-rest to stop the wobbling and

it was at first assumed to be a plane as i am located in a direct path of commercial planes heading for sky harbor airport. the brilliant orange light emission is what kept my attention on the object. it made no sound and moved at a seemingly slow but steady speed. it appeared from the east and took a path heading north west.\r\n\r\nafter 10 seconds of viewing the object and ruling out the possiblilty of it being a conventional craft i called for my daughter from the living room to come and verify what i was seeing. as soon as she came out i pointed at the object and asked her what color she was seeing. she confirmed that it was orange. she asked me what it was and i dismissed her question and asked her to go and fetch her mother. in a panic i also asked her to bring my phone which i later realized was in my pocket. while she summoned her mother i snapped one picture of the object but realized that the flash was on and the photo was probably not going to show anything

and in another 10 seconds give or take was up and out of sight.\r\n\r\nthe objects were coming out of the northwest and i would say the height was much lower than commercial aircraft that are in the cruising altitude, in fact i would say they were the usual altitude of say a news helicopter or a plane preparing to land 10 miles from the airport. at least that is how it appeared. we live about 8 to 10 miles from gainesville airport and when a commercial jet is on the landing process it looked like the right altitude, sorry i don't know how many feet that was. the size of the triangles was appox the same size as a commercial jet from that altitude. they left no visable trail i could see and made no noise. of course the rec center was chock full of people and noise but i believe i would have been able to hear a jet or helicopter because i was intently observing these objects. the entire sighting lasted appox 5 minutes. there were no other aircraft in the area but there were several small helium filled balloons the kids were given the fireworks started at 9:30 pm sharp which was 25 minutes after these objects disappeared from view. \r\n\r\nall in all my wife and i were very calm and analytical. as soon as they were out of sight we watched the area for several minutes to see if they would return and they did not. there were no other fireworks displays in the distance so i ruled that out, plus fireworks do not follow a trajectory as these did. i then tried to text a friend who was in military intelligence and had quite a lot of experience in these matters. my cell phone would not send a message nor would it let a call go through. my 14 yr old daughter was at the rec center and was walking around with her friends i tried to text her to no avail a voice call did not go thru either. the phone gave me a message stating there was trouble with a connection after each attempt. finally after 4 or 5 minutes i managed to resend my texts successfully.  \r\n\r\nneither my wife or i had no aberrant feelings like fear or dread. we were of course a tad excited about the sighting ,but, i believe that would be considered a normal reaction. i tried to take a cell phone picture but the phone was slow to load the camera because i set it to save to the micro sd chip instead of internal memory plus i was watching the 2 objects intently.","distance":"Over One

our house , quickly moving south. as it moved across the treetop level (at unknown distance) it gradually started to change from a bight orance to a deep red, then reverting back to orange. it continued south for approximately another minute untill completely dissappearing  from sight, as if someone blew out a candle. \r\n\r\nabout 10 minutes later, a second orange orb appeared in the same spot that the first one had originated. this one appeared to be moving at the same altitutde, but much faster on a north to south flightpath. after about 30 seconds or so the orb started to change from orange to red, but then started to dim much sooner then the first. when the orbs light diminished the boject was not in silhouete. i was a oval type ball about the size of an asprin (more then likely still a large distance away from my position). and it want into the hover i witnessed the object change direction rapidly from a hover to decent to ascent to left and right before dropping below the tree line and out of sight.\r\n\r\nand about 15 minutes after that my mother and i noticed a thrid object. once again, an orange orb, at same altitude moving on a north to south flightpath. this time as it approached the point where the second ones light went out, this one started a slow decent still fully illuminated and dissappeared behind the tree line.\r\n\r\ni can tell you this was not a conventional aircraft. there were airliners all over the sky that night an none were flying as fast, manuvered as quick, or went completely dark as these three objects did.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

in the same direction and speed. i observed this for 3 more lights before i witnessed two coming into view at the same time, circling eachother for about 20 seconds before they also dissapeared. these were the only lights i viewed circling eachother, but in all i counted a total of 20 lights. i finally left our deck and came inside. after the 17th light i made my husband come outside to make sure i wasn't seeing things. he also saw them. they were not stopping when i came inside. i'm not sure how many came by before i noticed them either. i am very freaked out right now. i know for a fact that they were not fireworks. i also know that they were not conventional airplanes, as 3 planes flew by when they were also going by. these planes went right by these \"lights\", they looked completely
