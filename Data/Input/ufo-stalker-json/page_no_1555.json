so i rubbed my eyes to get the best look i could. it was in a lazy left turn (my left) and the only clear sky i had was the width of the house across the street. it seemed about 2000 feet up and less than a mile away.  it was very bright, hard to look at bright. the object itself was a sphere/orb it was emitting an aura that looked like a plasma flame. i don���t know what it is but for now i will call it plasma. now very close to the orb the color was a very bright blue/white and as the plasma moved away from the orb it took on an amber color. the plasma seemed to go about 75% upward, 50% forward, 50% backward, and 25% downward in the shape of a flame. i could see what looked like interference lines in the plasma and seemed to be in motion (twinkle). this whole thing seemed to be surrounded by a containment field that glowed orange (like when you put your hand on a plasma ball-lamp). the speed it was going was about the same as a conventional aircraft and was silent. it left my view heading to the nne direction, mosby and excelsior springs area. that���s my 2 minutes with it. my opinion is this was a display ���look at me��� kind of thing. also as it left i could hear a jet in a turn west of me, like kci was diverting traffic away from the area.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":40151,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.209836777214484,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07042012-0020","longitude":-94.45933237225478,"occurred":1341292500000,"potentialRelations":[40115],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1341450148000,"summary":"Fire in the sky","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"64068","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Liberty, Missouri","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:11099"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Wixom","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"While walking in my neighborhood with my girlfriend we witnessed a reddish/orange light in the sky about 10:05 pm 7/3/12. we were facing east and the object came from the south heading north. it varied its speed and actually stopped and hovered it moved up and down slightly and moved on a curve. it appeared to begin moving away from us to the northeast and then the light disappeared. when we arrived home we kept looking to the northeast and saw it again off in the distance moving non linear and then it disappeared into a tree line. we noted the time and the fact there was no wind at the time and commented on the fact there was no sound from the ufo. did anyone else report this?","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":40150,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.51301148868698,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07042012-0019","longitude":-83.52028014233345,"occurred":1341378300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1341447902000,"summary":"Observed an orange red light in the sky moving south to north no sound didnt move like an aircraft","tags":["sound","light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"48393","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Wixom, Michigan","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:11100"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Arvada","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was home in the kichen eating at the table in the dark, starring out the open window toward denver, which is over 250 miles away, 07-04-12 at 2:50am\r\nthe morning was absolute clear and quiet.\r\n\r\ni am always seeing lights on the jets flying over at night. thought it was a white light on the wing of a jet... wham!
