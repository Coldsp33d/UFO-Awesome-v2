believe this. when i went outside it was 5am and still dark here. in the eastern sky i saw 3 lighted objects. they together formed a flat triangle with the point of the triangle angled more upward then the back 2 corners and the point was toward the north, the 2 corners toward the south. each light had a different brightness to it which made me believe they one furthest away was dimmest, the brightest closest. the point of the triangle object was the more active of the 3 as it constantly dimmed and brightened and changed shape in what appeared to go from like a star to a long stick figure like shape. up and down. all 3 objects did the same type of shape change but all at different times, and at different speeds. the 2 corner objects appeared as if one was above the other but as already said, the dimmer of the two i believe was further away. this is also the one which appeared to be over the top of the other. the lower, brightest of the 3, was the least active and stayed brighter longer, changing shapes less often but was also the one most easy to see clearly. it appeared to have 2 appendages going outward from the top with 2 others going upward from the middle and 2 leg-looking things below. the appendages would disappear from bottom upward making the light look starlike briefly then the appendages would return. each object shape changed like the same way but at different intervals. me, my son and husband watched for an hour trying to come up with logical explaination but could not. and the just as my husband and i were about to go back inside, a 4th lighted object came flying out of nowhere and look like it was going to fly between the 2 south corner objects. and just as it approached them, the 4th flying object vanished. we continued watching a while longer and the flying object never was seen again anywhere in the sky after that. when we came inside the point object was no longer visible but the 2 southern objects continued as before. it was very hard to determine if the objects were hovering and stationary or if they were moving at an upward angle ever so so slowly. all of us thought at times we saw them ascending upward but yet never move. i can't find the right words to explain it all really let alone fully comprehend it. but i cannot logically explain any of it as being of human origin. this i know.

started driving out on the outskirts of town where there is no people living and mostly old abondon houses. i drive a newer car so no problems with the raido. the music started to fade in and out and cut out all together. but before that happen a weird noise came apon my speakers and it sounded like a half of some type of word. it is a sound that will always be in my head. as i glance out my window i saw some lighting as i thought it was more fireworks but the lights were still at first. then i stopped on the side of the road and saw the lights started to move. they were moving up and down but in a slow moving way. it kind of felt like time was slowing down. i could not belive what i was seeing. i have seen a few ufo's in mississippi but not this close to me. with in the time i was able to grasp at what i was looking at it started to flot up and into the clouds and disappered like it had a camo of the clouds that were comming in from a storm. this area has open farm lands in this area also. i will keep watch on any news of missing or dead animals. the ufo itself was hard to see for what shape it was. as i moving around   the shape was not fully oval but more of a triangle with a oval end. the lights on it were a light green with hints of white in them. and it also had a single light that was i redish orange. when i fist saw the ufo it made my heart skip because it was like walking up on a snake. the feeling of a low electric current start comming over my body. i was able to move and pull over my car to step out to get a better look. my judgement the ufo was there some time before i got there and was in the process of leaving when i drove up.","distance":"Over One

10:25pm as we were leaving the bridge,where we were viewing the fireworks. at approximately 10:30pm my girlfriend stops me and says whats that in the sky, so we stopped and i looked at the objects which had a blue/purple glow almost like a black light. i had no idea what they were, i just know they were not any aircraft i have ever witnessed. there were 5 to 6 in the main group,and in a very loose formation with one of the objects trailing behind the others. they moved very slowly in a straight path in a slight northeast direction for close to 3 minutes,before they faded out. there were many helicopters and planes in the sky as this is a huge event and these were distinctly different. i tried to get video on my camera and i believe i caught the trailing object for a brief moment as the others were obscured by the street lights, but cannot be sure it is not just an artifact of the street lights. i know the people we were standing beside during the fireworks stopped with us to view the objects. im not sure how many people saw this as there were thousands leaving the area. i was very excited to witness this, my girlfriend seemed a bit less enthusiastic about it but kept calling them aliens,as we discussed what we saw while walking back to our vehicle.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

into the intersection to make the left turn, i could tell the lights were moving slowly in the same direction and at one point were directly above us. i could not see any body or mass to whatever it was, but i remember that i thought it was really strange that it blocked out the view of what little stars were in the sky. i remember feeling a bit of panic, and i didn't take my eyes off of it. as
