(from a distance of three miles the object appears as a glowing golden disk which i presume is due to viewing it \"edge on\".) my friends who had accompanied me were in a second car closer to the object and stated it made no noise and \"glided\" over the treetops. after a while it hovered out of our line of sight over the treetops. this incident was one of two that were witnessed by a number of people both within 9 days of each other.\r\n\r\nthe second incident occurred approximately 9 days later on june 2, 2012. a similar object was sighted and photographed by two different people around the same time period. one photo was taken by each person with a gap of approximately 10 minutes between each sighting. a third and fourth witness whom we met later that night described a similar object that resembled a triangular pattern of lights confirming the earlier sighting.\r\n\r\nthree photos were included with this report, the first was taken by me, the other two by the the other witnesses 9 days later. the objects in question have been circled in each photos.","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1

a yellowish light (like a sodium vapor light) in the diastance. given the angle from my perspective i would imagin it to be around 15 miles out. it seem to me at first to be a helicopter. as it got closer it made am abrupt turn north then totally reverse direction and proceeded south for maby 3 seconds and stopes and hovered in place and glowed incredibly bright. at this point it was mabey 5 miles out. i called over my wife and she seen it also. something else i want to point out is we live under the approach to lax for planes coming in from the north, it's like a highway in the sky. i would guess there altitude to be 5500'. we had a near full moon at the time and the object was at the 7:00 position to the moon. it stayed stationary for 5 minutes then moved into the path of incoming planes, as one plane approached i noticed the object moved to avoid it at the same time it's light intensity decreased then it started to move into the glow of the moon then it blinked a few times then disappeared straight up. i kept an eye out for it but it was gone. as all this was happening i had an uneasy feeling about it and i also felt it was observing the air planes flying into lax. i've observed alot aircraft but nothing has these traits that i witnessed that night, it seemed like it was intelligently operated although somewhat indecisive in what direction to fly in. also i felt like it knew i was observing it and as it flew off it did so by bleeding in with the moon glow.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

night, one was observed doing a figure eight pattern directly above my house but still at a very high altitude. as usual, i began signaling with my light as i mostly get a signal plash response back. this time, five others instantly zipped into view from all directions directly over me, but at a lower altitude. one dimmed out as it decended down to me. this was the first time i had ever gotten this kind of reaction from flashing my light at them. i ran into my house in a panic and imidiatly called my friend and then my neighbor, informing them that i may have made a mistake and pissed off either the grey guys or the blue guys. either way, i have no plans on going anywhere so if i can't be found than expect foul play. the next morning it was on the news, many sightings where reported. the news broadcaster said that nasa insists it was just a new kind of meteor that comes down in different directions and hovers etc. sightings of it where recorded in corona ca. and arizona. but this is just one of many ongoing sightings i am and have witnessed for many years. i also have photos of past sightings, but it has become more interesting since i discovered a way to communicate with them. i believe that where i made my mistake was using my hand held spot light, i think that made them upset. if anyone uses a light, don't use anything larger than a surefire light, i have had better results with my tac light. one day i will share my experience with the blue guys, but i wont go into to much detail as, since it is top secret military stuff, i won't disrespect their privacy and right to secrecy, but it was very interesting as i was on duty at the time in full uniform. knowing what i know now, i am sure they where laughing their ass's off at me.

stars as i do several times every night when i spotted what i thought was a plane.  i was facing west and this thing was hovering about 35 to 40 degrees off the horizon and seemed closer than an aircraft should be (maybe about a quarter mile away if not closer).  but, the more i stared at it i noticed that it had 3 horizontal round  white lights in a straight line with red and green lights underneath flashing at a very fast rate.  the 3 white lights did not blink and i could see them lit the entire time and remained in a straight line.  i believe the 3 lights were portholes since they were not very bright. the object was moving slowly but strangely.\r\n     i went inside to grab my binoculars and came back out and the object was still hovering in about the same spot but, doing a circular motion and moving up and down and sideways.  i focused the binoculars on it and played with the zoom in and out trying to get a clear look when i noticed the 3 white lights started to turn vertically and then kept turning until it did a 360 degree turn.  this is when i went inside and told my husband to come outside.  he tried using the binoculars and even went inside to get his hunting spotting scope but could not get a perfect view of it since we have a light on a pole close to our deck which makes it harder to see the sky.  he still thought it was a strange sight and not a plane. i had a better view of it since i was a little further away from that pole lamp. we watched it for several minutes before it finally took off slowly and finally went behind a tree where we could still see some lights through the leaves before it finally disappeared from our view.\r\n     the whole episode must have lasted about 10 minutes and i could never get a clear view of the body of the object because the green and red lights were flashing so bright and fast (and i was shaking a bit)  but it seemed to have a dark (maybe black, gray or silver) body.  i could not tell the shape of the body but if i had to guess it appeared to be cigar or disc shape.  i have never seen anything like this in my entire life.  every night i watch the planes, stars, planets, satellites and occasionally shooting stars in the sky and am very familiar with objects in the night sky but this was a new experience for me.  it was both exciting and a bit scary.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

how long it it was there, it was definitely not a balloon and i've seen them so many times, this was a perfect sphere, also it almost looked like it had gradient from darker gray to lighter gray, maybe because of low sun and some clouds around but it was well below the cloud-line.\r\n\r\nwhat made me first notice it, it was freaking huge for it's distance, darker and larger than the usual aircraft there and definitely larger than a helicopters that fly every few months around here.\r\n\r\ni had no other people witnesses, i've told nobody either.\r\n\r\n\r\ni only have memory it happend

(four or five objects of the same size would fit between them.) it is difficult for me to say how far behind the aircraft these two objects were. not a large distance.\r\n\r\njust as the airplane was moving towards the north-east corner of my house, i moved my binoculars away from the objects to the aircraft. when i tried to locate the two objects again, i could not find them.\r\n\r\nfor the next hour i watched other aircraft in the sky, all of them flying much higher than the first aircraft. i did not see anything unusual following these other terrestrial airplanes. \r\n\r\nwhat makes this observation interesting? the two saucers were following the aircraft. both of them lined up one behind the other. they were not bright, but dull grey in colour. while they were about the same size as the aircraft, they were distinctly different. i'm sure that i would not have seen then without the binoculars.\r\n\r\nnotes:\r\ni live about 5 blocks from the welland canal to the east. on the other

school.\r\ni was shaded from these city lights by my house and garage and backyard trees.\r\nit was a hot but dry night.\r\nthe object were seen overhead.\r\nthere were no other witnesses. photos not possble, not enough light.\r\nno military bases or airfields nearby.\r\nmy reaction was one of slight surprise. i've always been an alien ufo skeptic and would welcome a sensible

why-this puzzles me. nothing more that night. i think about two or three days later i used the cloud video to make a video w/ my music(guitar). i then posted it on you tube. i think later that night i was watching the video i had made(w/ music) and after a few times i began to feel quite odd for no apparrent reason-i can vividly recall at one point thinking to myself, \"was that a ufo in the video?\", and sure enough, there it was, what appeared to be a metalic disc, emitting a cloud like mist, hovering in the sky. i am not sure how close it was because the mist it was emitting might have actually have been a cloud. so i would say it was either about 30 ft. in diameter or much, much larger. it appeared to have a dome on the bottom and top. it was a similar color to the sky but darker and i could see it reflecting light, i think it was rotating slowly but i am not sure.\r\n    i later noticed two objects in the video above a restaurant. one was pizza-box shaped w/ dome. it was cloaked in a misty cloud-like cover which trailed off to the left, sort of flame-like. next to it is another cloaked object, but cloaked different, it was triangle shaped and seemed to 'smear'\r\nthe light in a way which hid it very well.\r\n    the final object is the largest, furthest and clearest. it was in the clouds, kind of peeking out, very well hidden but not disguised. it appears in my video a few times(while panning right to left a couple times). it can also be seen in the second video i took(15 min later) as it moved off and up to the right. it was huge. it might have been a half-mile or so. the object was book-shaped and metalic, and had large , rectangular windows that can bee seen along the top of two of the visible sides.\r\n    the video can much better show what i can say about it. there is something very strange about the fact i did not notice them at the time. there were about four people having dinner 25ft away from me and they sure \r\nseemed oblivious as

we could see it for about 10min. then drifted below the tree line.  all this was between 2:30am and 2:45am.  all our observations were made  using bushnell 8x42wa 430ft at 1000yds binoculars.  my wife saw all this too.   at this point we all went back to bed, but about five minutes later my son called to us that he had sighted another such flying object.  this one was visible only from the front of our house, in the northeast area of the sky, relative to our house(position), at least 120degrees away from the position of the 1st flying object.  this second flying object was either the first object we had seen in the nw quadrant of the sky or one exactly like it, with the same lights and horizontal shape. we all watched this 2nd stationary, hovering flying object from approx. 2:50am to 3:20am, and the object didn't move at all!!!  it stayed right in the exact same position where it was when my son first sighted it.  by 3:20 or so we got tired of watching the motionless object and went back to bed again.  at just about 4:00am, since i couldn't get back to sleep, i got up to take one last look.  the object was still there, although it had moved about five degrees to the east.  this report is respectfully submitted to mufon of ri or nearest chapter to ri.  we invite and hope to have questions or other communications from mufon.  thank you very much.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
