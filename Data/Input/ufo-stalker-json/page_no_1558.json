run to the door and call my dad then i turn around and i can���t see it because it���s behind some trees. \r\n9:30 when my dad comes out the object is visible he tells me to run and get the binoculars

look at the object and it starts to speed up heading east directly away from us.\r\n9:35 my dad asks for the binoculars and says ���it���s winking out��� and disappears.  he mentioned that it seemed

on the east coast i saw a large glowing tri color ufo. we lost power at about 10:30pm during the storm and i was sitting in my living room reading by candle light. at about 11:30 (i didnt have power so i am quessing at the time)i went to the door to see what damage there was on my street. instead i was amazed to see in the sky a round sphere type object that was white in the middle,with rings of yellow,orange and a glow of red. it was slowly desending until it was out of my view obscured by trees and buildings. my entire sighting lasted about 45 secs. it was after the storm but there was still a soft steady rain. as far as i could tell it was silent. i have no idea about the distance.I thought to go get someone else to see it but could tell i wouldnt have enough time. after it disappeared i continued to stare at the are dumbfounded. it was the first time i saw a ufo. i would like to find others who saw this that night. it had to of been seen by others. it was amazing,if you saw this please report it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

work to take a video of some very strange clouds. i filmed them(clouds) for roughly two and a half minutes. about fifteen minutes later i went back out and filmed another minute, not sure why-this puzzles me. nothing more that night. i think about two or three days later i used the cloud video to make a video w/ my music(guitar). i then posted it on you tube. i think later that night i was watching the video i had made(w/ music) and after a few times i began to feel quite odd for no apparrent reason-i can vividly recall at one point thinking to myself, \"was that a ufo in the video?\", and sure enough, there it was, what appeared to be a metalic disc, emitting a cloud like mist, hovering in the sky. i am not sure how close it was because the mist it was emitting might have actually have been a cloud. so i would say it was either about 30 ft. in diameter or much, much larger. it appeared to have a dome on the bottom and top. it was a similar color to the sky but darker and i could see it reflecting light, i think it was rotating slowly but i am not sure.\r\n    i later noticed two objects in the video above a restaurant. one was pizza-box shaped w/ dome. it was cloaked in a misty cloud-like cover which trailed off to the left, sort of flame-like. next to it is another cloaked object, but cloaked different, it was triangle shaped and seemed to 'smear'\r\nthe light in a way which hid it very well.\r\n    the final object is the largest, furthest and clearest. it was in the clouds, kind of peeking out, very well hidden but not disguised. it appears in my video a few times(while panning right to left a couple times). it can also be seen in the second video i took(15 min later) as it moved off and up to the right. it was huge. it might have been a half-mile or so. the object was book-shaped and metalic, and had large , rectangular windows that can bee seen along the top of two of the visible sides.\r\n    the video can much better show what i can say about it. there is something very strange about the fact i did not notice them at the time. there were about four people having dinner 25ft away from me and they sure \r\nseemed oblivious as well.\r\n

was pink or light red, and the light on each side of it was a pale shade of yellowish green.  the pink light was blinking or flashing on and off irregularly.  object was in a horizontal or flat shape,

we could see it for about 10min. then drifted below the tree line.  all this was between 2:30am and 2:45am.  all our observations were made  using bushnell 8x42wa 430ft at 1000yds binoculars.  my wife

our house, in the northeast area of the sky, relative to our house(position), at least 120degrees away from the position of the 1st flying object.  this second flying object was either the first

in the northwest area of the sky(nw oriented from that position).  the object was stationary not moving at all!  it had 3 lights in a horizontal alignment, but rather close together.  the middle light was pink or light red, and the light on each side of it was a pale shade of yellowish green.  the pink light was blinking or flashing on and off irregularly.  object was in a horizontal or flat shape, more linear or disc(saucer-like?) than anything else.  since object was rather far away it was difficult to get a real accurate look at it's exact shape, or to tell it's actual size.  it hovered where we could see it for about 10min. then drifted below the tree line.  all this was between 2:30am and 2:45am.  all our observations were made  using bushnell 8x42wa 430ft at 1000yds binoculars.  my wife saw all this too.   at this point we all went back to bed, but about five minutes later my son called to us that he had sighted another such flying object.  this one was visible only from the front of our house, in the northeast area of the sky, relative to our house(position), at least 120degrees away from the position of the 1st flying object.  this second flying object was either the first object we had seen in the nw quadrant of the sky or one exactly like it, with the same lights and horizontal shape. we all watched this 2nd stationary, hovering flying object from approx. 2:50am to 3:20am, and the object didn't move at all!!!  it stayed right in the exact same position where it was when my son first sighted it.  by 3:20 or so we got tired of watching the motionless object and went back to bed again.  at just about 4:00am, since i couldn't get back to sleep, i got up to take one last look.  the object was still there, although it had moved about five degrees to the east.

was pink or light red, and the light on each side of it was a pale shade of yellowish green.  the pink light was blinking or flashing on and off irregularly.  object was in a horizontal or flat shape,

object we had seen in the nw quadrant of the sky or one exactly like it, with the same lights and horizontal shape. we all watched this 2nd stationary, hovering flying object from approx. 2:50am to 3:20am, and the object didn't move at all!!!  it stayed right in the exact same position where it was when my son first sighted it.  by 3:20 or so we got tired of watching the motionless object and went back to bed again.  at just about 4:00am, since i couldn't get back to sleep, i got up to take one last look.  the object was still there, although it had moved about five degrees to the east.  this report is respectfully submitted to mufon of ri or nearest chapter to ri.  we invite and hope to have questions or other communications from mufon.  thank you very much.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

in the northwest area of the sky(nw oriented from that position).  the object was stationary not moving at all!  it had 3 lights in a horizontal alignment, but rather close together.  the middle light was pink or light red, and the light on each side of it was a pale shade of yellowish green.  the pink light was blinking or flashing on and off irregularly.  object was in a horizontal or flat shape, more linear or disc(saucer-like?) than anything else.  since object was rather far away it was difficult to get a real accurate look at it's exact shape, or to tell it's actual size.  it hovered where we could see it for about 10min. then drifted below the tree line.  all this was between 2:30am and 2:45am.  all our observations were made  using bushnell 8x42wa 430ft at 1000yds binoculars.  my wife saw all this too.   at this point we all went back to bed, but about five minutes later my son called to us that he had sighted another such flying object.  this one was visible only from the front of our house, in the northeast area of the sky, relative to our house(position), at least 120degrees away from the position of the 1st flying object.  this second flying object was either the first object we had seen in the nw quadrant of the sky or one exactly like it, with the same lights and horizontal shape. we all watched this 2nd stationary, hovering flying object from approx. 2:50am to
