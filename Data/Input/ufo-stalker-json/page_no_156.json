i looked up and saw a bright ball of light in the sky. it was the brightest object in the sky. we discussed what it could be. it was much too large and close to be a star. it was about the size, color, and shape of an oncoming headlight.  however the area that were were driving in was very flat and this object was very much in the sky.\r\nit just looked like a ball of light. it did not look like a plane at all.\r\n\r\nat first it was stationary. we didn't think much about it. then, coming into view at our left a plane came into view. it was obvious that this was not a commercial plane. it looked like a small military type plane. it was dark-colored. the ball of light then started to match the pace of the plane.It seemed like the plane was chasing the ball of light. both moved in a stationary line. from our left to our right, then out of view over some trees. as the plane and object moved to the right, it was at an angle where it was coming closer to us and lower in the sky. that is where i got a good look at the plane. i could tell that it was smaller and darker than a commercial plane.\r\n\r\nthe photos are of course terrible. they were taken using an iphone 7 by my friend in the passenger seat as we were driving down the highway.\r\n\r\nthe light at the top left is the plane, the one at the bottom right is the ball of light. what is strange is that in the photo, the ball of light, kind of looks like what we saw, it was just a bright ball of light. the plane very much looked like a plane in real life, but when photographed, just looks like a ball of light.\r\n\r\nto establish some credibility, both my friend and i hold advanced degrees and do not engage in illegal

gave the casino aboit 300 bucks that we were done and ready to leave, so we cashed our tickets in and left through the front door to gain access to the parking garage where we had parked, so we get in, start up, and began to drive alongside of the casino and we get up to a stop light on the side of the casino i look up to my right and about what seemed like 60 or 70 feet above but in front of the casino was this bright basketball sized floating object and its just still and stiff as a board, the stop light tham began to change so we drove on, it was just about a minute before i turned around in my seat a noticed it was following us, we than get on the highway and the strange orb of light lowers and gets on the passengers side of the car where i was sitting and flies just right above the trees at the same pace of our car, i then realized there was a smaller object i absolutely couldnt believe it the thing was literally no bigger than a dime in shape and diameter, it glowed very brightly and trailed about 15 - 20 feet behind the initial orb that had been following us , i thought , this is absolutely astonishing but a part of me still feared them, i then began to take pictures of the orbs as we drove on the highway but the dime sized orb was to small for me to catch in a photo, we soon come to the end of the highway and take the streets home, well at the end of this particular highway it curves into a street that takes us all the way home and at first the orb kept strait but as we curved it dropped lower and curved just as we curved , this left me in absolute shock as it now had shown some type of definate intelligence and clearly really was following us , in the mist of the ufo following us we had forgotten that we had no ciggarettes we then pull into our local gas station which is only about 3 minutes from our house to get the smokes and i noticed the orb was not in site, well i come out of the gas station and get in the car we began to pull off and just hovering above the gas station at about 250 feet is the same strange orb following us once again on our 2 miute journey now home and just before we even pulled up to our block the orb flew overhead of our car and gained about 800 feet in altitude and hovered above a friend of mines who lives directly next door's house, me and my girlfriend see this and quickly decide to park right

were sitting at a table looking east toward the ocean.  an intense shimmering object (it looked as if you were gazing into a rectangular door opening into an intense blast furnace).  the light was extremely intense. i thought at first it was a helicopter with a search light on but the light was too bright, there was no sound, and there were no marker lights. it moved slowly covering about a half a mile to ene in about 30 seconds, and then at about 500 feet in altitude it stopped and hovered about 1/8 of a mile due north east from our position.  it hovered without sound for about 2 minutes.  suddenly it changed to a pale white/green orb about half the size of the blast furnace rectangle and accelerated to the south at a very high rate of speed, and it traveled in a direct straight line directly away from us as if it was trying to achieve an orbital position.  as it traveled away the green white orb left a trail or an optical illusion as if it was travelling through a series of pale green triangles.  the acceleration into space could be viewed for about 30+ seconds.\r\n\r\nten minutes after this occurrence another identical object followed the exact same vector to the east then hovered in almost the same spot but slightly further away, and did exactly the same as the previous.\r\n\r\nthis appeared a total of four times over the course of about 20 minutes.  aside from the blast furnace effect of how the crafts presented themselves, the most interesting observation was the green triangles that seemed to emanate from the objects as they rapidly accelerated at a shallow 15 degree tangent into space.  the further the craft got the wider the triangles appeared to become.  the triangles could have been some sort of positioning guidance system or possibly a guide to vectoring to a dimensional transition.  \r\n\r\nthere was never any sound, only intense shimmering light then extremely abrupt acceleration as soon as they changed from the shimmering object to a smaller greenish white orb.  after the four sightings none other were seen.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

sphere was moving slowly and wasn't more than a hundred yards from us.(completely silent) i turned to get my father s attention to look at this thing and by the time turned back it was gone. i immediately took off on the four wheeler to try and find it, i couldn't find it anywhere. \r\n now ,six years later. i am an avid whitetail deer hunter. that being said i do use my trail camera quite often. i move it around alot to get a good idea of the animals using the area. i have collected thousands of picture of many different animals using this method. about a week ago 8/14/17 i captured a picture that sent chills down my back.The picture was taken at night but my the camera didn't use it's night vision as usual. it usually gives a black and white picture at night.This picture is in color with an unknown light source shining down through the trees on to this entity. this entity or being is facing the camera only 15 feet away. it appears to be 4 or 5 foot tall, almond shaped black eyes,two holes for a nose, shining luminescent type skin,and it's difficult to see if it even has a mouth.The body is covered by some kind red oddly shaped suit or something it appears to be wearing.Also there are two animal skulls with it,one small skull on it's shoulder and another looks like a deer skull at it's feet that it appears to be hanging onto. it looks like you can see a hand and a foot coming out from under the red garment it's wearing. very strange.I have before and after pictures and i have looked over the area good but there was no evidence left behind.There really is no other explaination  for what this could be.\r\n i am a quiet ,reserved family man/ carpenter. i have no idea what to do with this picture or who to tell. i did share it with a local law enforcement officer but only because he is a long time friend.It spooked him,he said i should send it in somewhere.But i don't know.Maybe you could help me.\r\n i forgot to mention that the ufo and the picture happened in the same area. its an 11 acre wooded piece of property off the oswegatchie river in ogdensburg ny. it a summer camp.\r\n thank you for your time,i hope to hear back from
