lately, i have been watching the area of sky around the big dipper because i have seen a few  lights in that part of the sky recently, in which, i cannot explain away as a meteor, satellite, airplane, or other man-made aircraft. my girlfriend and i,  a week ago, in the same area of sky, had witnessed a blue flash of light (happening multiple times) but not continuous, just every now and again, sometimes blinking twice and then nothing for awhile. this occurred a couple of nights in a row. we named it \"blinky light.\" then, early this morning (july 1st, 2012)  at approximately 1 am, as i'm sitting in my backyard watching the sky, i began tracking a satellite coming from the west. i watch it for a moment until the light reflecting off of it begins to dim and i cannot see it very well anymore. then, i decided to fix my eyes north toward the big dipper and just then what i saw was an object ascending at incredible speed out into space. at first i thought it might be a meteor, but i don't believe meteors fall up into the sky. i immediately new it was something other than a man-made aircraft. it must've been moving thousands of miles per hour cause it had a bright light trail behind it and disappeared in a flash. there were no clouds and it was a perfectly clear night. no obstructions. the high speed object disappeared as it accelerated at speeds ive never seen anything move before. i continued to watch the sky for awhile after that and saw nothing more.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

means certain. i was in my backyard, after returning from taking my dog on a late walk. i looked up at the stars, as there were no adverse atmospheric conditions, and the view was fantastic. from the south-west, three lights, moving in single file, made their way into my field of vision. their intensity and size was consistent with an airplane at approximately 1000ft agl (i live on the down-wind leg for a small airport, and am a pilot myself). they made no noise, and proceeded to fly more-or less directly overhead. now, an airplane has multiple lights, each a different color. red is on the port wingtip, blue on the right, a white landing light is on the leading edge, and a white strobe is sometimes on the upper portion of the fuselage. the orientation of the lights to the observer (or nearby aircraft) can be used to indicate an aircraft's heading relative to you. however, none of these were present. instead, a white light was emitted from all directions, making the objects look like bright stars. as they passed overhead, and then began to continue away to the north-east, two of them accelerated (i don't remember which two), and began to ascend, one veering off to the north more, the other to the east. the third maintained its' heading and speed, but also ascended, though not as mush as the other two. at that point, all three stopped, forming a v in the sky. it is difficult to say what their altitude was at that point, so i will not muddy the waters with an incorrect altitude. however, after they were in position, their lights dimmed so that they were indistinguishable from the stars above them. fortunately for me, from where i was standing, the light at the bottom of the \"v\" was right in line with the top of a large, easily-identifiable tree. \r\n    for over a week, i would check on the lights each night, and each night they were there. on or around the tenth night, they were gone. i tried using binoculars, however i say nothing unusual in that quadrant of the sky during the day.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then

talking to them i noticed a large orange-red ball of light, i thought it was a satelite but it was very large. the object was about the size of an aspirin at arms length, moving from north to south. i assumed it was the same satelite or object i seen aweek before. i told the people on the belcony to look up and checkout the object. i had already noticed it for about a minute or so  before, and didn't say anything until it got over the building enough for then to see it. just as i pointed to the direction to look it slowed almost to a full stop, for about 2-3 seconds brightened up to a yellow-red and quickly accelerated away no noise at all. with it being almost a full moon you could see a circular vortex waves around it, like when a jet goes through the sound barrier. with in 2 seconds it was gone to the south. very cool experience. my friend dennis told me the next day when we were talking about the object, that about 2 hours later he spotted two more very bright objects,

southeast of my position headed northwest.  at first i thought it was a plane, but realized it wasn't after seeing the triangle shape and three very bright white lights pointing downward, and one red light in the center which was flashing sequentially at first. there was no red or green lights where wings should be, no wings, and no tail, and absolutely no sound. if this had been a commercial jet or the b-2 there would have been some type of sound since it was so close to us.  i estimated the distance to be above 500 feet and under a mile due to the size of it.  it would take a golf ball or larger to cover it up at arm's length. there were no flashing white beacon lights, only the red one in the center.  after a minute, the front light on the point of the triangle went out for a few

any sound at all the fan on low over powered it. the air did have a feel strange to it, but that may have been the excitement of seen what i saw...","distance":"501 Feet - 1

when i rounded a corner and noticed a bright star-like object in the western sky. at first i thought it was the planet venus, until i watched it move in a southeasterly direction. this object had no blinking lights; only an orange-like glow. there is a power-plant and some other machinery running at the job-site. normally, i would be able to hear other aircraft, such as helicopters, passing by. this particular object did not make any sound. it was difficult to judge the altitude of the object, and i could not make out any solid surface, as it was already dark. it was a very clear night; hardly any clouds. less than a minute after initially spotting the object, i text-messaged my wife on my mobile phone to look for the object in the western sky. she was driving on the road at the time, with our three children, in the same town. she replied back that she could not see anything. when the object reached the southern sky, i told my wife to now look up and into the southern sky. she replied that she could now see the object. i continued to watch the object travel in a straight path until i could no longer see it in the southeastern sky. i glanced at my watch, and it was 7:58pm.\r\n\r\ni then wondered what the object could have been. i thought that it could not have been an airplane or a helicopter, because i would have seen blinking lights or heard the engine running. i thought that it could not have been a weather balloon, because there is no way a weather balloon can travel from the western sky to the southeastern sky in four minutes. i thought that it was most-likely a satellite, but the object seemed too bright and to low of an altitude. it was difficult to judge the altitude of the object, but i would have to say that it was at an altitude where airplanes fly, and not in outer space. i am very curious and would like to know what this object was.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

apartment buildings.  i am on the third floor of mine.  i was on my balcony at the time.  each pulse of light was approximately 1 second apart and the light seemed circle or sphere like.  both flashes happened in the same exact spot.  there was no sound.  i've also checked the storm radar.  the only activity that is being detected is west of here.  nothing that would produce that kind of lightning to be visible from this far away.  and i double checked.  the direction that i saw these pulses of light were in the northeast direction.  not the west.  it's been suggested to me that it may have been a power transformer exploding, but i would think that a light that seems to be that close by and being that strong, i would have heard some kind of sound.  i have none the less contacted my apartment office to see if they may be alerted of any kind of power transformers exploding in the area.  i will let you know immediately if i find this to be the case.\r\n\r\nsince i was unable to get

sparks st. in burbank, ca, approaching the olive avenue intersection. \r\n\r\nbetween the trees, we each saw directly ahead hovering just west of the mountain ridge line four extremely bright bluish-white lights resembling field lights, in a row but hovering and with no supporting structure. no object was visible; just the lights. this mountain ridge line lies between sylmar and santa clarita. the row of lights did not appear to move. we could only see the lights for the briefest of moments, because as we drove through the intersection at olive ave., our view of the mountain was blocked by nearby buildings. it would've been approx. 17 miles from our location in burbank to that spot. if the lights were actually located next to the mountain ridge as they appeared, they would've been roughly over interstate 5 in the new hall pass.\r\n\r\ninstead of stopping at the grocery store as we'd planned, i continued heading in that same northwest direction on reese pl., then turned east onto clark st., then northwest again on victory blvd. to try to see that exact area again, but by the time we could see the mountain, the lights were gone. this took less than 5 minutes. i circled back to the original siting location on sparks st. to retrace our route, but the lights were gone and nothing else was evident.\r\n\r\nthere were no other lights, planes, choppers or even stars visible. at 8:30 p.M., it was just sunset, so the sky wasn't dark in the northwest. \r\n\r\nwe both were intensely curious, i was excited, i wanted to follow it. now, writing this description, i am baffled and eager to find out if anyone else saw it. on the way back to our apartment after shopping, we discussed whether it had been four lights attached to an object, or four distinct lights in formation. there was no way to tell. i did feel a little creeped out by the discussion of whether it was one something or four somethings, but that passed quickly.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
