it look and appeared at first to be airplanes, but the color brightness/ depth was wrong.  noting that, i watched for a moment and the one closer to the ground started to change color from red to a

colors i took my attention off of the other.  about a minute of watching the object it appeared to crash/land.  i felt sick like i had just witnessed an actual plane crash.  there was no sound of explosion, nothing.  curious i looked to see what the other object was up to and noticed it stayed in the sky and began moving about the sky making circles and other random maneuvers i had never seen any plane or helicopter make before.  it did this for 50 minutes or more and would disappear then reappear a short distance from it's previous location.  my boyfriend could see it moving around what looked like black objects.  after watching it disappear for the what i thought was the last time i grabbed my stuff and headed home (barely 1 mile south east of him) once home i walked to the end of

any normal aircraft and it was not fireworks based on  the fact that if it were fireworks they would travel vertically and then possibly drift a little and go out. these red orbs traveled quite a distance across the sky in a short period of time and as i said they were circling each other. it was too dark out and too great of a distance away to tell if it was one object with several lights or if they were separate objects circling each other, in all i counted 15 lights which in my opinion appeared to be separate objects. the 15 red orbs traveled out of our line of sight and disappeared. myself and my 3 other co-workers were shocked at what we were seeing, all of us were in awe and disbelief and ruled out every ordinary explanation....What we saw were 15 ufo's.

outside in my backyard. there were red orbs over my neighbors house pulsating turning a metallic white pink, yellow orange color and then red i starting taking photos and video i couldn't beileve it- the orbs were breaking off from each other and they would dissapear and then reappear.( i went in front of our house to get a bette shot/ video) i saw about 8 total but i couldn't get more then two in a shot ( i was trying to watch what was going on as i was filming so sorry for the shaky video.) at one point they would align into a straight line then dissapear they were moving fairly slow- i felt like it was almost a triangle at one point. after about 20 mins they disappeared. i saw a couple riding their bikes and asked them if they knew what they were and they were shocked and didn't know. \r\ni've been seeing white metallic orbs during the day off and on for a couple years there always high above the atmosphere they'll move sided to side and just hover in one spot- i remember taking a
