hovered for a bit and then just gradually moved around in a very irregular flight path before slowly fading out. strangely enough during the sighting of this star like ufo, a bright flash like a camera flash happened and no less that 1 or 2 seconds later what looked like a shooting star dashed across the sky. it was too low to be a shooting star. at that time of night, it was unusually bright out from a bright moon. it must have been going thousands of miles per hour, it just darted across the sky. what i did see though, was that whatever craft if was had a very odd glow to it. almost like a glow in the dark dull yellow green. like bioluminesence. it was very odd. \r\n\r\nhowever the first star like ufo i saw was very high in the air, maybe 70,000 feet, in my best guess. from where i was standing it was at a 45 degree angle in a slight ese direction. i guess it would then be hovering over the vista/san marcos area which is about 10 miles or so east from carlsbad.\r\n\r\nthe flash for the second ufo came from across the hill, over el camino real, near some houses and a power line, maybe it's a telephone line, i don't know. it looked like it came from a house. it was like a camera flash, but it was huge, so it couldn't have been a camera. who would be out at that hour taking photos anyway?\r\n\r\nafterwards my dog started to act a bit frightened, it might have been from the flash. she's easily scared by lightning, but there was no weather of that sort in our area. very strange.","distance":"Over One

that i ran out of a small construction office type of trailer behind his business. i went out side to \"water the flowers\" when i saw cars that were parked at the end of messick rd (the road ends about 1/4 mile from what was then my shop) and they were going back up the road from the end of messick \"hauling ass\" is the only words that come to mind. i looked toward the east, which from my perspective appeared to be over bells oyster gut, a small inlet of the back river, was a large quiet cigar shaped object. it appeared as if someone was welding the outside of it and molten steel hit the water. of coarse that can't actually be what ahppened but that's the words i'd use to describe what i saw. just prior to the 1st iraq war and being in visual distance of the langley afb runway we rarely saw a time when there was no air traffic, but there was absolutely none during this siting. i didn't know how big it was or how far away it was until later when it moved sw and was behind the 4 towers on the other side of the river and it stuck out of each end from my perspective from the 1st to the 4th tower. that means it must have been at least several hundreds of yards long if not dozens. i went back into the shop to call my wife and tell her what i just saw and went back out after getting no answer as she goes to bed eariler than most folks but when i went back outside it was gone. i told both of my older brothers the next day and was laughed at and rejected. the reason i'm even saying anything now is after seeing a documentary about richard lang investigating chris bledsoe, i thought maybe those cars that went screaming up the road saw what i saw, and maybe just maybe have reported it over the years. i could be off by the dates by 6 to 8 months either way. i guess when you are rejected by wife and brothers after telling them about the siting you put it out of your mind knowing that's where its got to stay if life is gonaa be normal. but now after 25 years of marraige the trust is there so its not a problem and i dont care what my brothers think. i wish the story was more exciting but it is what it is. i saw another documentary where a lady said she had what looked like sparkling star dust on her trees and realized that really is like what i saw discharging out of whatever it was when the \"welding sparks\" landed in the water during my siting so long ago. i hope someone out there has witnessed what i did aound those dates and has contacted mufon. i'd say at least 5 cars where moving back up messick when it occurred and they had to see what i

to me)\r\nsky view (degrees) est: 120 ��� north/south, 90 ��� east/west\r\nfresno, ca (northeast)\r\n\r\n\r\nobject being chased by 2 fighter jets\r\n\r\nat approximately 23:30 pm on june 26, 2012, i let my dogs out to do their nightly business.  as usual, i went out with them to look at the stars.  i was just getting ready to go back inside when i heard a louder than usual jet engine.  \r\n\r\ni looked up to see two military fighters flying in a north to south direction at a high rate of speed.  though i am not sure of the altitude, they appeared to be about one half inch in length.  i am not sure how fast they were going. certainly not above mach i, but close, maybe.  they were in a slight climb as they passed almost directly overhead.  all of their navigational lights and strobes were on.  \r\n\r\njust in front of the fighters (approximately one quarter of a mile), i saw a single, pale, greenish/white, spherical, or round light that was about one third of the size of the fighters. it was pulling away, slightly, from the jets.\r\n\r\na few seconds later, the object executed a slight climbing right turn to the southwest, and accelerated, increasing the distance from the fighters as they turned to follow it. at that point, the object disappeared (winked out).  the jets continued to the southwest until i could no longer see them.\r\n\r\nthe whole sighting lasted no more than twenty seconds from the time i first saw the jets until the object winked out.\r\n\r\nit is unusual to see any aircraft flying north to south at the altitude i observed, because of the proximity to fresno air terminal, and the traffic patterns.  though, at 11:30 pm, there is almost no air traffic at all.  also, the air national guard is based at fat, and they tend to keep noise levels at a minimum over the city.  the air guard flies f-16s, and lemore naval air station (nearby) flies fa-18s. hopefully, this will help determine the altitude they were flying.\r\n\r\ni am a retired information technology analyst, and a private pilot.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with

really wasn't paying much attention until suddenly the lights i had been watching went out and to the rear of those there was a sudden circular pattern of white lights. maybe six or seven. they lit up in sequence. very fast. 4 0r 5 times it went around then poof. just disappeared. the whole thing lasted maybe 45 seconds and i really didn't get a clear view. just looked weird. like a ferris wheel in the sky and then nothing. i thought it was strange at the time, but didn't really get a good look.\r\n\r\nabout a month later same scenario. same time. i stepped out for a breath of air and this time it was sse moving towards the ne. watched for about 3 minutes. it was above the treeline and i got a good look. white light on top then red lower and slightly ahead then white lower. looked very airplane like except the lights were separated vertically by more than a distant plane could be. i watched it for a couple of minutes or more. same pattern. white, red, white. once again i thought it looked a little strange, and then suddenly like the other time the front lights went out and to the rear there was this circular display. very fast. maybe 6 or 8 white lights in a circular pattern. not sure if they went clockwise or counter. just like the other time they ripped around several times for a few seconds and then nothing. all lights disappeared. had a pretty good look the second time. never saw a structure. just lights. never saw anything in the papers or tv about it. still, i don't know of anything that has a vertical light display like that. and i'm pretty sure that airplanes just don't turn off their lights and disappear. i don't know. might be an explanation. looked strange to me though.","distance":"Over One

and humid day.  the temperature had gotten in to the nineties on the 20th of june 2012.  we sat over looking the woods for almost an hour, it was the first night that the fire flys had come out.  as we sat we both began to notice that all the sounds of the woods ceased.  all the crickets stopped, all the peepers stopped in the pond behind the house.  it was at this time i noticed something in the yard.  at first i thought it may be a skunk because all i could make out was a little bit of white.  as i stood up off my chair to investigate, the patch of white that i had seen began to back up and admit a very dim glow.  at first i was bit taken back my this and told my wife to stand up and take a look.  by the time she stood up the glow of the life form had gotten a small amount brighter and backed off to the other side of the fence where it stopped and seem to focus towards us.  my wife stepped towards the glow now about 5 yards in front of us and again then glow got a bit brighter.  it was very noticeable that when you took a few steps towards forward it got one step brighter.  we felt that this thing was observing us but we did not feel threatened.  for  twenty minutes or so this had gone on and that is when we decided to try to get closer.  no sooner that we thought about getting closer a second glow appeared out of nowhere five feet to the left of the first glow.  the second glow was a lot brighter and was clearly moving side to side.  at this point my wife and i got frightened and walked back up on to the deck not taking out eyes of the two glowing forms for a second.  once back on the deck the second glow started moving towards us at a fast pace about  ten to fifteen yards in front of us.  once it cleared the fence and was clearly in our yard we retreated to the house.  we were to scared to go out side again so we decided to call it a night.\r\njune 21st 2012. \r\nafter the events of the previous night my wife and decided that we would investigate in the back yard to see if what we saw the night before would return.  the night was very reminiscent of the first night.  there were no sounds of the maine night life to be heard. we laid out on the deck observing the sky for a an hour when my wife noticed something up in the air. best described as an extremely white bright light shooting across the sky. the main shape of the object was oblong or rice like.  it was brighter then anything we had ever seen and moving very fast.  the most bizarre characteristic of this bright oblong light where what appeared to be almost appendage or tentacle like things coming of from each side of it.\r\nthey moved side to side extending and retracting as it made its way across the sky west to east out towards the ocean. we both found this to be very strange and proceeded to do some research on the ipad that we had brought out.  it was at this time that i had focused my attention back towards the woods where we had seen the glow the night before.  after looking for only a couple of seconds the glow started to appear again slowly on the opposite side of the fence. i alerted my wife to the arrival of the glow but this time it was not as bright as the night before.  we were a few yards further away then the first night and we had observed that the closer we got the brighter it got, the further away we got the dimmer it got.  there was only the glow which we both felt was the
