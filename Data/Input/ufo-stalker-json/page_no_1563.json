we still dont know for sure what we see but we for sure have this speech recorded and it is loud and very clear. we have no clue as to if we are really seeing this or not,were hoping its just our imagination because this is very frighting and too close to home we know the video on the ipod isnt perfect but we thought we were just going to document toys being moved by what we thought may have been a spirit in our sons room. the speech is what really has me convinced it is alien in nature i would gladly post the audio of this to anyone that wants to hear it. we are weeks away from having a baby and dont know if they are here for that reason or that they were doing something that has nothing to do with us at all,but my sons story a month prior now seems more believable to us all now,were all 6 sleeping in one bedroom together now and are moving out as soon as we can.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":39921,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.00498052490974,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06292012-0017","longitude":-95.22819518152787,"occurred":1333962360000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Iowa","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1341016309000,"summary":"Updated with photos from original event","tags":["video"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/39921_submitter_file1__alieneditpic.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/39921_submitter_file2__photo4.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/39921_submitter_file3__photo3.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/39921_submitter_file4__IMG0760.MOV","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/39921_submitter_file5__photo5.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"51566","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":81,"locationName":"Red Oak, Iowa","triangle":false,"type":"Alien Encounter","$$hashKey":"object:434"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Cottonwood","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I take pictures of the sky a lot. i've never actually seen what ever it is that shows up in the pics. i do find strange things all of the the time in my photos.

1/4 mile to a small pond.  on my way back, probably 200 yards below the dam there was suddenly, to my left about 20' away, a sort of rectangular area that was irregular but definitely did appear to have depth.  it was approximately 5x8 feet and very brillant shimmering white. it appeared to have straight sided panes or euhedral crystal faces. i only saw it for what i believe to be a few seconds and then i was sitting on the sloping bank where the light had been and i know now as i knew then that it simply was \"later\".  i have absolutely no idea how much time had passed.  i was also aware of a itch on my left leg.  about half way between my knee and ankle there was a deep pit about 3/8\" in diameter that just had a very light abraded area on it, not really a scab.  that night my mother saw it and asked what happened and i simply had to tell her i didn't know.  this pit is still there.   there has never been any doubt in my mind about what happened and it has always been present but not in any way dominate or intrusive.  another thing which ocurred, a comparable mark appeared in proximity to the first in the last few years and i have abolutely no idea how or exactly when this happened.  my memory is and always has been phenominal.  i have never said anything about this to anybody at anytime.  i would like to be able to describe, in more detail, all of this to someone and
