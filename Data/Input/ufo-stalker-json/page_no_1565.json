this is a small town about 1/2 hr away from alpena in northern lower mi. we were there to patch up some holes on the eves where bats were going in and had a nest. it was dusk and we were waiting for the all bats to fly out before we patched the holes. my husband seen a object and he pointed to it. it was moving very slow coming towards us and it was black. it was about 3 telephone poles higher then the tree line. the place we was at was very wooded and surrounded by nothing much but farms and fields, it was a very quiet night. this object made no noise and moved slower then a bird. i thought it must be a huge bird he's showing me but as it got closer i seen it had no movement just slowly floating across the sky! it was bigger then a human..Almost as if a person could fit inside of this small thing? or a large creature kinda hunched over? i don't know how else to decribe it. i instantly got the feeling something wasn't right about this thing cause nothing moves like this. we got a good minute or so to look at it as it moved in front of us and we couldn't figure out what this thing was. we coulden't make out any detail on it. nothing on it was moving. it wasnt a bird, plane, ballons, or anything we have ever seen. it gave me the creeps just seeing this strange thing move so unnatural. my daughter kept asking me what is it? i had no idea what to say. it continued to go past us and never went higher or lower just perfectly straight across till it disapeard behind the tall trees out of our sight. went baack there the next night but didn't see it.","distance":"101-500

so not many stars to see, i watched the ferries going in and out to the islands and other occasional seafaring traffic.  as i was facing the ocean ( south-east) over my left shoulder i see something coming in from a north west direction.  it's length looked to be about the size of a telephone pole or larger(i noticed that as it coasted over a pole)was square, flat but somewhat curved on the top part. underneath in each corner were green lights that did not blink ,in the middle on the bottom were red and white lights that flashed on and off extremely quickly while rotating in a circular fashion very quickly. the body of the object was a dull grey with indistinct edges. it was a sight to behold that took my breath away!.As i was on a private beach next to the large public beach there was no one else around to say  \"did you just see that? \"...Anyway as to it's direction...It came in over the utility poles maybe about 12 feet above them (there is a row of poles  lining the beach) i'm looking at this in my binoculars ( it is probably a mile or two away from me) ...And it just glides horizontally, slowly heading toward the ocean at about the speed of a glider. it came in (leading with the corner ?)and within a few seconds slowly turns (away from me) the bottom lifting up so that i can see that it's square, and now seems to lead with it's side as it curves slowly in a big semi-circle over the shallow part of the ocean.After traversing (maybe a mile?)it becomes horizontal to the ground again and heads back from the direction it came (north-west.) there is a radio tower that lines up with the row of poles and it flew around that and then i couldn't see it any more because of trees. the whole event took just a few minutes, was the speed and movement of a glider, no sound or emission , seemed to stay the same height to the ground the whole time.  i ran to my car to write down and draw the details then i kept looking with my binoculars again..Approx. 10 minutes later the whole thing happens again!! i go back to check my drawing and notes (since i got another look) for accuracy..Then i wait around some more \"just in case\"... not thinking it could happen again..And it does!!!..Approx. another 10 minutes later. i wait around along time after but nothing like that happensthe whole thing happened between approx 10:30 and 11:00pm .  this really blows my mind and i'm not sure who i can talk to about this!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with

to go out and look.\r\n\r\nfrom our 4th floor parking garage i soon saw a very large, silent airplane leaving no trail nor noise until it passed westward and thought that may have been what she had seen.\r\n\r\ni decided to go to the ground level and search upward . . . there were 4 or 5 airplanes circling and then i saw this large shiny orb higher up than any of the airplanes in the exact location my daughter described.\r\n\r\na plane landed at a nearby airport, others kept circling and the ufo hovered in the one location for a number of minutes, then started to glide se. as i remembered i had my camera, i looked down for a second, turned it on and when i looked back up it was nowhere in site.\r\n\r\ni waited a few minutes and it did not reappear. it was visible for 15-20 minutes at least.\r\n\r\nit was over and se of broomfield and perhaps over western westminster, co as well.","distance":"Over One
