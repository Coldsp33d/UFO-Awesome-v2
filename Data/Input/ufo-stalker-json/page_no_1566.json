was in the backyard of my house in juigalpa, chontales (nicaragua), at 00:40 with my cousin. we were looking the nightsky as we usually do with our telescope. that night the sky was covered by scattered clouds so we wouldn't see as much as usual. the only star we could see was fomalhaut, from piscis austrinus constellation. then i saw this dark triangle-shape object, with red-orange lights in each of the triangle vertices. the lights weren't too bright, but still visible. the object was darker than the nightsky dark blue. i yelled at my cousin to come over and watch the ufo but he wouldn't see anything. i drove him in the backyard for a while (at most 5 to 10 seconds) but he still didn't see the object. the ufo moved from southeast to south and i thought we couldn't see more of it. we came back to our former position in the backyard (with fomalhaut star in front of us). i was trying to explain what i saw to my cousin when we both saw exactly the same object coming from south to southeast. i was getting fast heartbeat by that time but we remained watching the ufo. the three lights were now hovering and then got closer to our backyard. we both sensed a feeling of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, the heartbeats getting faster and faster. we can describe the ufo as getting closer for the triangle-shape was getting bigger. at that moment, i can hardly describe it any different, we just wanted to get in the house, to be anyplace else. the lights, normally in the three vertices of the triangle, were now changing to a \"v\" shape. not that the ufo's shape changed. just the red-orange ligths. i could count six of them forming the \"v\". then the rest of the story isn't that hardcore. we ran like hell into our house. the flying object was clearly getting over our heads, approching at an extremly fast speed, we wouldn't have stand there any longer. it was clearly a once in a life experience. no one told the other to run, but we did at exactly the same time. we could hardly speak for a while. it has been three days now since it happened, and one cannot watch the nightsky as before.\r\n","distance":"101-500

in the road to look at the light.  it was bright red and not flashing, then slowly began to change from red to white as if fading in and out.  it was then suggested that maybe the item was a flare, since it definitely appeared to be falling slowly and getting closer.  we rolled the windows down on the vehicle to see if we could hear a helicopter, everything was silent.\r\n\r\nafter watching it a while we realized it was actually spinning.  flares do not spin with color changes, so we became a bit alarmed and curious.  a car came up behind us so we pulled into an abandoned church parking lot to view it w/out being in the road.\r\n\r\nonce in the parking lot we pulled out a camera phone and began trying to take a picture but almost as soon as we did this it changed directions, moving sw very rapidly and gaining altitude as it went.  it eventually disappeared completely like the lights had just been shut off entirely.\r\n\r\nthe entire experience lasted maybe five minutes tops, but probably not that long.  it was bigger than a star or an airplane, about the same size as the red lights on top of a radio tower when you are very close to them.  it was a very exciting experience.  both the driver and i were not quite sure what to make of it and as soon as it vanished started talking at once in excitement.\r\n\r\nwhatever it was, we both know we have never seen anything like that before in our life.  ever.\r\n\r\nwe ended up with two very low quality cell phone images of the object, but it was already moving rapidly away at the time we took the photos. one picture shows

(this may have been due to some small clouds moving in, but hard to tell in the faint dusk light.)  total time of observation was around 10-15 minutes.  i am an engineer and have a good understanding of physics, avionics, etc.  i cannot come up with any rational explanation of what i saw.  it must have been swamp gas :-)  i've checked the skies every night since then but have not seen a repeat performance.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":39815,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.613739,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06252012-0023","longitude":-116.237651,"occurred":1340256600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Idaho","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1340693243000,"summary":"Starlike object moving and hovering in eastern sky","tags":["hovering"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":5,"locationName":"Boise, Idaho","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:639"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Fremont","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On june/23/2012 at about 10pm, i was standing outside of my house and saw what at first looked like a bright big star. as i was looking at it, a blue light about half the size of the main white light appeared then circled the light once clockwise then stopped and both lights disappeared. the next night on june/24/2012, my brother and i were in my backyard he saw a solid white light flying fairly quickly and pointed it out to me. we watched it fly for about 10 seconds then it disappeared. there were commercial planes flying lower than the light much slower than the light. it was a solid white light. it didn't have any blinking lights like airplanes and as fast as it was going, it wasn't like a shooting star. it didn't look like fire and it didn't have a trail behind it. i've seen satalites before and it didn't look like any i've seen. i'm going to be out tonight with a video camera in case it happens again.

pm) while taking my 19 year old daughter to best buy to purchase a video game, we drove down spring creek drive from our home in our sub division, through the forest which is a deserted park, due to it being in the flood zone and had been abandoned years ago. we saw (in clear view) a large red sphere sitting on an abandoned road in the forest as we passed by the entrance to the road,  which had been blocked off by the county to prevent cars or campers from entering. as we passed by, i looked down the road and saw the craft a few hundred feet from the entrance. i slowed down to give my daughter a chance to view the craft with me and we were convinced it was a ufo sitting on the road. it was a solid red sphere, larger than a car or truck and made no sound or movement and emitted a reddish light.  due to the necessity to get to best buy before closing hours, we continued on and simply had a laugh at the thought of actually seeing a ufo in our forest.\r\nthen, on friday night, january 22, 2010 at 11:10 pm, my wife  and i watched what appeared to be the same large reddish, glowing colored sphere descend into the woods directly in front of our home from our front porch at about a tenth of a mile from our home. we first spotted it through the front window in our den, while we were watching t.V. by accident. we ran outside to the front porch to get a closer view and watched it as it descended, taking about a minute to get to the ground. \r\nat first sighting it was about 80 feet in the air, just above the tops of the trees already in its decent. we watched carefully looking for any signs that it could be identified as an earthly object. it made no sound at all and proved to be something we���ve never seen before. it was very stable in its control.\r\nit was sphere shape at approx. 12 or 15 feet wide and made no noise as it carefully descended very slowly, between tree branches towards the ground, until it could no longer be seen behind the shrubs. it had no flashing lights or created any wind or disturbance of any kind.  it did have a small flickering flam at the top that went away during its decent.\r\ni grabbed my flashlight and called my daughter to pile into the car, for a closer look, and drove around the corner to get to the road that ran next to the location it came down at. my wife stayed behind in fear of making contact with visitors. \r\nthis forest area is an area of low level marsh land. no power is present. the trees are tall pines, oak, and other hard woods with tall youpon growth at ground level. there is a stream that runs through the center of the property usually filled with the songs of thousands of frogs but at this time, they were silent! the weather was cool with overcast and a cloud cover ceiling of about 10,000 feet. it was very calm.\r\n on the first pass, from our car, we were looking for the reddish glowing object that was first seen in the air. we drove to the end of the road, watching into the woods but not seeing anything. i made the block and retraced the area for a second time, driving slowly and shinning my flashlight into the forest. then we noticed a single white light deep in the forest, near the location from where the craft came down, approx. 30 yards from the edge of the road in the forest. \r\nit was a light, much like a light emitting from a bulb of about 60 watts but was too deep in the woods to make out its shape or intent. it looked as though it was sitting on the ground.  we watched the light for about five minutes with no movement, either around it or near it. then we slowly moved forward, shining our flashlight into the forest edge, when we noticed the outline of a curved, grayish colored, metal craft nestled behind the dense yaupon shrubbery which was about ten feet high. it emitted no light or sound. we could barely see only part of the round side as the craft was hidden behind the foliage, and we were not going in for a closer look! \r\nwe continued to drive forward approximately another hundred and fifty feet when my flashlight caught the reflection of two very large eyes watching us through the shrubs in the forest edge, set back about 25 feet from the road. i stopped the car, rolled down the window, and shone the flashlight into its eyes and watched as it watched us for about the next several minutes. \r\nwe noticed that the eyes were about 8 inches apart and glistened like two very large white diamonds in the reflection from my flashlight. they were about seven feet from the ground.\r\nlater observation revealed there were no objects in that area in which someone or something could have been standing on, such as a fallen tree. \r\nwe could not see the body shape as it was very dark with no back light and whatever it was remained hidden behind the yaupon shrubs. it never blinked or turn away for a moment and made no sound or movement but continued to watch us very closely as we discussed the details of what we were seeing. we ruled out the possibility of it being a deer, or any animals of any type that would be common in the area, and being that we watched the landing of a ufo and sighted the craft just yards away from where it was, it was determined that we were looking into the eyes of an alien visitor.  \r\nthe eyes were forward facing and twinkled as they moved to view us. the iris of the eyes was large, about the size of a quarter and glistened like diamonds in my spotlight and reflected bright white in color.  we turned on the car's interior dome light and waved a couple of times to let him know we were just curious and meant no harm. we felt like he must have been alone and came to that specific area for samples of something for testing, maybe bugs from the forest floor? that could explain the light in the woods, to attract insects. we felt like he moved away from his space craft, as we got closer to it and he didn���t wish to be noticed by humans in the event we got out looking over his ship. maybe he just didn���t want to frighten us or was afraid himself!  \r\nwe felt he was rather curious by our presence, maybe even a bit frightened that we had accidently caught him landing and he wished to be left alone, so he stayed hidden. however, taking the opportunity to observe a human family in our earth bound, ���wheeled��� car, checking him out as we stayed calm.  i could feel our presence becoming un-wanted as the minuets passed by as he was probably anxious to get out of there before other showed up, maybe not so peaceful and we were taking up too much of his time. \r\nas we stared into those large glowing eyes for as long as we did, for some unknown reason, we turned off the flashlight and drove out of the neighborhood and away from the area for quite a distance, discussing the sight of the craft coming down and what a beautiful, majestic sight it was. only to realize we were driving for no reason away from such a monumental moment in our lives! we turned around and returned to the area only to find that he had departed, light, craft, eyes and all. we believe he sent us subliminal messages to leave him alone so he could pack up and get on his way without being detected any further. i felt the effect of confusion the next few days and found it difficult to focus my thoughts.\r\nit was an odd feeling but, once you actually see a landing and the occupants of an alien craft, it feels very natural and like it should be left alone as it must only be our neighbors tending to their business in a natural way, and we really don���t have any place hanging about or getting in their way.  \r\nit was a satisfying experience. it���s nice to think he is telling his story to his friends and family, in some faraway place, of the nice human family that stopped by for a brief visit while he was on his mission.  \r\nabout four days later at approx. 8.00 pm, i watched a saucer shape object moving slowly over the same patch of forest with a single, dim red pulsating light on the top at its center. the light was pulsating very slowly, much less than lights on towers or aircraft and it never completely went out between flashes. the top of the saucer was lit up bright white while the bottom of the craft was dark. there was a single beam of white light shining out of the bottom of the craft shinning downward in a cone shape, very bright but was odd in the fact that it did not shine all the way to the ground. in other words it shown down about twenty five feet then came to a clean stop in midair. i watched it until the trees hid it from view. it too made no sound.\r\nupdate: exactly one year later. on the anniversary date (2-22-11) of the alien encounter, my daughter and i saw the return of what looked like the same red sphere near our neighborhood at 8:45 pm in the sky. it just appeared as we were driving north bound on i-45 approaching the spring exit, when a bright twinkling object appeared in the sky about six hundred feet off the ground next to the freeway in front of us. it appeared to have white, twinkling flames coming from its bottom moving upward over the round craft. it sparkled like a star and was moving southwards towards us at a slow speed. when we spotted it, it was completely covered with the white flames then it \"suddenly\" changed directions and its flames began to subside. it began to pick up speed, now moving north bound next to the freeway. my daughter reached for her phone and videoed it. we pulled over to capture the tail end of the sighting. i watch with my naked eyes as it moved away decreasing its \"flame\".  we could see the red sphere that we had seen in the forest on two other occasions near our home. then it just vanished from sight, like it cloaked itself from sight. before it vanished i could see a force field around the craft as it glowed slightly from the energy flame before disappearing. i am guessing that the craft with occupant had returned for an annual checkup on forest samples, etc. it was moving towards our forest near our home. we raced to the house and watched the forest for a while but didn���t see any activity.  after all, what the heck can you do in the event that we did find it again? we just felt satisfied that we had been involved with an actual ufo encounter and it���s nice to know the truth! hope to see him again soon. \r\n\r\nharold smith
