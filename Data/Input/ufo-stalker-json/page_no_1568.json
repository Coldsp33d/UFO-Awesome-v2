same direction. it too move passed us then flamed out. i went into the house and told my daughter to go out and look and a third went past and went farther west then flamed out. suddenly a fourth ball of fire approached at about the same path and it burned out just above us. my daughter noted at that time that all of the dogs in the neighborhood began to bark. immediately after the fourth burnout a fifth approached and also burned out above us, about thirty seconds later all of the dogs quit barking. these appeared to be lower than normal airplane traffic and above the helicopter that transfers from one hospital to another several times a week. i am ex air force and i know what all types of aircraft look like. these were large flaming balls , no aircraft lights, red, green or strobe. a truly majestic sight to see. the best i can explain is that it looked like a distance campfire, but in the sky, moving faster than normal aircraft. location, albion road, north royalton ohio 44133, moving

evening. the sky was clear with a thin crescent moon nearing the horizon.  my son-in-law, daughter, wife and i noticed 3 lights in the sky, one behind the other, with about a 20-25 deg separation, traveling in a straight wnw to ese direction.  we first noticed them at approx. 35 deg off the wnw horizon \"flying\" toward us over a neighbors house across the street.  a fourth object also appeared from behind the neighbor's house but was perhaps 30 degrees behind the third object, a bit of a straggler.  helicopter exercises, i thought, but never saw lights on them like these, and, they were completely silent!  they seemed to be moving at a speed a bit faster than the helicopters i usually see around here.  i said that these were really unusual. my wife went back into the house and retrieved my 15x70 astronomy binoculars and a regular 7x50 pair as well.\r\n\r\nwhile observing them with my astronomy binoculars the light which each one emitted appeared more as a flickering or wavering \"plume\" of light, like a propulsion kind of effect although at the same time the light seemed to be more reflective rather than coming from an energy source.  as each object approached near it's highest elevation the light changed from a more reddish hew lower in the sky to a more yellowish hew to white and then went from dim to completely out having reached its highest elevation.  earth satellites do this as they cross overhead and into the shadow of the earth's horizon although they don't change color as these objects did.\r\n\r\ni observed the objects as well with my regular 7x50 binoculars which actually revealed a roundish dark structure about a third again as big, behind and surrounding the \"light\" the object seemed to be emitting.  i actually had the impression that they could have been helicopters with large under-mounted reflectors attached to them. this may have been reflecting the remaining sunlight off the horizon but i don't think they were high enough since it was fairly dark by then.  if they were helicopters, they were stealth in nature because there was no sound coming from these objects.  we have military helicopters flying around here and often with 2, 3 or more at a time. there is a helicopter base within 20-30 miles of us.\r\n\r\nif i hadn't looked up as i normally do, going out at night, we would not have witnessed what we did.  i know the sound of helicopters (normal ones anyway).  they are loudest coming toward you and less \"thumping\" moving past and away from you.  these objects made no sound at all and were close enough to do so if they were of the normal variety.  these objects were really strange to witness.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

middle school.  the sky was overcast and the temperature was neither overly warm or cool.  as we were walking, we came to an intersection and i was looking to make sure it was safe to cross the street.  as my gaze returned to what was in front of me, i saw on object hovering in the air.  i was immediately curious as to what it was, as it wasn't making any sounds that i could determine, or if it was, it was either too far away for me to hear, or was drowned out by other sounds.  i looked at it for a moment, while the realization dawned on me that i had no idea what i was looking at.  it appeared to be a dark grey or black cylindrical oval.  at first the points of the oval were pointing vertically, but the object was rotating counter clockwise along the more narrow axis, and the points of the oval moved from vertical to horizontal to vertical multiple times.  the object was slowly moving to the east (left from my perspective) and eventually disappeared behind a large fir tree.  i walked around the tree in an attempt to continue watching the object, but i was unable to find it in the sky a second time.  as i was watching it, i felt very calm, but also energetic (yet not in a restless way).  once i had lost track of it, for the rest of the day i could not stop thinking about it and trying to analyze what i had seen.  the client i was with saw it as well, but did not seem interested by the object.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

step looking at the western sky.   what they all three saw made her call me and tell me to go look to the west from my yard.  \r\n\r\nmy yard ends abruptly at a cliff that overlooks about 3/4th of kansas city, missouri, all of kansas city, kansas and several small towns up the missouri river north of kansas city.  i walked out into my yard and, against a very dark sky at about 10:25 pm, was startled to see a strange formation of reddish/reddish-white, glimmering objects in the sky about 35 degrees above the horizon.  there were four objects that appeared to be moving in trail formation, coming from the north, north-west flying on a heading of perhaps 160-170 degrees, a heading that i decided would take them to kansas city downtown airport.  however, when they were almost straight west of me, they each turned, still in trail, and circled to the west, making a wide 360 degree turn until they were back in front of me.  they then continued to the south, south-east and went out of sight, disappearing behind some trees.  then a fifth object appeared flying the same course, but when it was straight west of me it suddenly vanished, totally disappearing from sight.\r\n\r\nthese objects appeared to be shaped such that they reminded me of two old- fashioned glass telephone insulators joined at the flat part and upright so they seemed more tall than wide.   they appeared narrow at the top and bottom and a little fatter in the middle.  the color seemed more red at the top and bottom and became more reddish-white closer to the center.\r\n\r\nunlike the sharply, distinct, rotating beacon, and the more modern strobe lights on an airplane, these objects appeared to be emitting a fuzzy light from all over their surface.   they reminded me of five japanese lanterns with the light coming from within the object.\r\n\r\nthe speed of each object was simular to what i would expect of a small airplane, like a cessna 152.  maybe the most unusual part of this whole \r\nexperience was that there was absolutely no noise coming from these objects.  they certainly appeared to be close enough that had they been any aircraft that i know of, i would have heard a noise.\r\n\r\ni have been a professional pilot for 58 years and most of my time was at very high altitudes where the weather was usually nice and clear.  in all of my 20,000 plus hours in the air i have never seen anything that remotely resembled a ufo as described in most sightings ... until last sunday night.  while flying at high altitudes i have watched satellites go over, but never a ufo.   i can remember maybe 30 years ago when pilots were reporting ufo sightings on a regular basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

below)\r\nmufon # 34937 (#2 below)\r\n\t\r\nadditionally, a delaware sighting later that same evening bears similarity to the three observations in pa that night.\r\nnuforc # s86669 (#3 below)\r\n\r\nand, the previous evening, sw of the three pa sightings on 18 january,  a very similar craft was observed. \r\nnuforc # s86663 (#4 below)\r\n\r\ninterestingly, reporter #1 saw a single craft the previous evening.\r\n\r\n\r\ni arrived home in the time-frame of the two below reports (~6:45 pm). as i backed into my parking space, i observed two sets of lights toward a mostly east direction. initial observation indicated to me that they were a pair of military helicopters in the distance. i assumed this due to the fact that the 'choppers' were in a somewhat typical flight pattern. that being one offset and a bit higher/lower than the second.\r\n\r\nas i walked to my mailbox, i watched and assumed that they would be coming nearly directly toward/over me as this is the typical flight path for aircraft traveling east toward mcguire afb / lakehurst nas. i have many low-level flyovers of military aircraft to these military locations.  i am approximately 40 miles from these facilities.\r\n\r\nas i watched, i realized that the craft were flying in, from my perspective, a more southerly direction. this is a bit of an unusual flight path for low altitude aircraft. my view was obscured periodically by leafless trees and a couple of homes.\r\n\r\nas the craft traveled it became obvious that the direction had changed as indicated in #2 below. this direction change put the path coming nearer to me. i am nw of philadelphia.\r\n\r\nas the two craft came into full-view in my south direction, and at the apparent nearest, i had an unobscured view for about 30 seconds. what i observed was different than those below. it was not until this point that i became really interested in the craft. this was my nearest observation of them.\r\n\r\nas indicated below, there was absolutely no sound coming the craft.\r\n\r\ni observed what appeared to be two individual aircraft. the leading craft was lower than the following one. what i saw were four lights. three white and one red, on each of the objects. there was no symmetry in the lighting pattern. i saw no variation in intensity of the lights. additionally, i am / was unable to put a shape to the objects in question. the position of the lights on the craft made no sense.\r\n\r\nthe lighting configuration on both craft were identical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ni first saw the craft at a 7 degree elevation (this elevation number is quite accurate) and 81 degrees toward the east. utilizing the location information from #1 below and a distance of 19 miles from my location, would yield an altitude of 2.3 miles above witness #1.  i believe that i first saw the objects very close to the time as seen by #1 below.\r\n\r\nwhen the craft were nearest to me, the elevation was approximately 11 degrees. utilizing the information from #2 below, that being turning west, distance from me to the objects would be approximately 2 miles. this yields an altitude of about 1/2 mile. obviously, there is a problem here.\r\n\r\ni had the objects in view for some period of time. it was not beyond 10 minutes.\r\nutilizing a 10 minute time-line and the distance traveled by the objects as seen by me, approximately 25 miles, yields a speed of 150mph. again, different than the speed indicated in #2 below.\r\n\r\nalthough there variations in the observations, there is no doubt that all three observations were of the same objects during the same time period.\r\n\r\nwhat they were is certainly unknown to us. the flight looked 'military' in formation.\r\npossibly some 'stealth' type plane / chopper.\r\nbut who knows ?\r\n\r\n\r\n#1\r\njanuary 18th at 6:40pm\r\nlevittown, pa\r\nmufon # 35024\r\n. . .(17th sighting information) . . .  on january 18th at 6:40pm i was driving in levittown, pa southbound on woodbourne rd shortly past the roads intersection with business route 1, heading towards trenton rd. above the residential section to my left, i saw two sets of three horizontal lights that appeared to be stationary to my left. one set of lights was slightly above and to the right of the other from my vantage point. the lights were the same as i witnessed the night before, but now there were two sets of them. i drove into the section to get as close to the lights as i could. at 6:41pm, i called a relative who resides in the section to look at the objects. as i got closer and towards the end of the residential section as it met bristol oxford valley rd, the lights started to move and again as had happened the night prior, the large sets of three horizontal white lights were no longer visible. the lights flew over the edge of the residential section and woodbourne rd in the southwest direction. at one point i was only a few hundred feet from being directly under the objects. i could hear no sound being emitted from them. i followed the direction of the two aircraft as i headed towards my relatives house. i was now behind the aircraft. the structure of the lights resembled a cross or plus symbol with two white lights on the sides with two vertical red lights on top of each other in the middle. the lights were blinking. i arrived at my relatives house and we watched the objects fly southwest towards northeast philly in formation from a window in the upstairs of the house. approximately 5 minutes had gone by between first sighting them and their lights fading as they flew too far to see.\r\n\r\n\r\n#2\r\njanuary 18th at 6:45pm\r\nnortheast philadelphia, pa\r\nmufon # 34937\r\n\r\nfour family members, including myself, were walking returning home after grocery shopping in northeast philadelphia, pa at around 6:45pm on wednesday, january 18, 2012. we first noticed the lights flying very low and close to each other back to back, almost as in a flight formation, with absolutely no sound. we could not make out a solid object around the lights that we witnessed. at first, both sets of lights appeared to be in a single horizontal line, with white lights on the sides and a large red light in the center. my son ran inside and grabbed his hd camera, and after zooming in, we realized that the large red light in the center was actually two red lights stacked one above the other. because of this, the lights looked like the following ��� : ���\r\n\r\nagain, in the video footage (to be uploaded at a later date), the lights on the sides were white and the two in the center were red; there were two of these sets of lights, making for 8 lights in total. in formation, they appeared to be diagonally flying next to each other, with one on the bottom left and one on the top right. the pair appeared to fly almost directly over us and then drifted off towards the west, over neighboring montgomery county, pa. the lights speed was slow, possibly traveling at 10 to 20 mph. my son claims to have seen one of the sets of lights shoot up into the sky, while we saw the other one disappear beyond the tree line. i personally did not witness the first set of lights shoot up. what we witnessed was definitely not anything ordinary, especially since i am usually skeptical of ufo sightings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#3\r\njanuary 18th (reported at 7:17 pm,  19:17)\r\nlincoln, de\r\nnuforc # s86669\r\n\r\ni saw blinking lights in the sky, & think it was hovercrafts.\r\n\r\ni went to take my dogs outside when i noticed 3 blinkings lights in the sky. they looked like they were far away and i assumed they were planes... that is until i realized they weren't moving, just hovering. i ran inside and got my littler brother who came and had a look for himself. the lights appeared to be moving just a tiny bit but not too much. one went dark then came back on.. then after a few minutes both of them stopped blinking and it looked like they disappeared. - by the way they were changing from red to white in color.\r\n\r\n\r\n#4\r\noccurred : 1/17/2012 23:00 (entered as : 1/17/2012 23:00)\r\nreported: 1/18/2012 8:50:34 am 08:50\r\nposted:

three. this craft travelled within a very close distance of brandywine airport, but passed it by. when the craft travelled overhead a sound of a jet engine was present but very faint. was very odd for the slow speed of the plane and very low sound output. i was surprised the craft did not fall out of the sky. it appeared to be moving no faster than 40 mph. any assistance that could be provided with finding out if this was \"one of ours\" would be greatly appreciated.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

june 23 2012. i heard moaning and thought maybe someone was hurt, but when i looked out my window i saw a couple \"messing around\" down below. i then noticed what looked like to me a shooting star, coming straight down from high in the sky, it was very bright and very fast. then all of a sudden it stopped, and was hovering above some buildings in the distance. it was not moving forward, backward, or side to side, it was stationary. the lights looked like headlights from a car and as i took a closer look i realized that the lights were moving in a rotating motion. that went on for about 2-3 mins. then the lights went out but i could still see the object in the sky, it was disc shaped and large considering it was quite the distance away. it stayed in the same spot, did not move and lasted about 2-3 mins. then the object emitted a large lightening like flash, then it went straight back up in the sky, faster then it came down. i would say it took 20 seconds for it to disappear from my view. i was in shock as i witnessed this, my phone was being charged and i honestly didn't even think to grab it to take a picture. i live in an appt building and i'm about 6 floors up, when i looked at the object it was straight in front of me hovering about 3 feet above where i was.","distance":"Over One

on. the unit is not scheduled to turn on, and i checked.\r\n\r\nabout a half minute later, the shop vacuum downstairs turned on, which it has never done before, as well as the main television unit in the living room.\r\n\r\nafter turning off the electronics in the household, i went to check the time on my phone which i had on the counter. even though i had just taken it off the charger in my room, it had shut off, and was refusing to turn on for some reason.\r\n\r\ni heard an owl outside, or at least i thought it was an owl by the sound of it, i never saw what was making the noise, however, i went outside to check, when above me, i see what i though was the light from a car over my head, upon looking closer, it appeared more closely to four, aurora like ripples across about a quarter of the sky.\r\n\r\ni had seen something like this on another night where i saw a craft i reported, however, i had discarded this fact as unimportant at the time, thinking that it may have been my mind playing tricks on me, however, after early this morning, i know for certain what i saw wasn't an optical illusion or a case of a mistaken identification.\r\n\r\nabout 5 minutes after seeing the ripple, i spotted the first craft i observed during the early morning, it was a elongated, cigar shaped ufo, flying below the early morning cloud layer at a slightly awkward angle(about 10-15 degrees off from how you'd expect an object of its shape to fly) and it flew in a straight line from the nw to the se of the horizon, taking about 3-5 seconds to completely cover the distance and vanish beyond my line of sight beyond the treeline. its apparent size was to narrow to be the of a bird or bat, and no wings at all made it have the wrong profile. \r\n\r\nafter another 30 seconds or so, a second object became visible for a few seconds towards the se of my location, this object appeared to be glowing golden orange, with a deeper golden orange straight line patterning upon its surface. this object in only what i could describe as blinking into sight, the object remained immobile and eerily still for the time it was observable, and just as it had appeared, the object seemed to just blink out of sight.\r\n\r\ni remember feeling a sense of curiosity and anxiousness, as i usually feel when i observe these kinds of objects, however, i did feel a bit alarmed with the electronics turning on and my cell phone refusing to apparently turn on.\r\n\r\nafter these incidents, i stood outside for a while longer, hoping to observe more phenomenon, as dawn began to break, i went back inside, only to discover my phone was now on with the main screen waiting to be unlocked, as though it had never been turned off.\r\n\r\nafter going through the house a bit more to see if any other devices were having issues, i came to discover the downstairs door, which was locked and dead bolted around midnight, was now completely unlocked for some reason, what relevance this may have to events is unknown.\r\n\r\nboth my mother and father, who live in the house with me, slept through the entirety of these events, and the dogs we have did not bark a single time, even with the shop vacuum turning out right outside their doors. i found this incredibly odd, as usually the slightest noise during the night will put the dogs in a barking frenzy, yet not once during the nights events, did i ever hear a peep from them.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line
