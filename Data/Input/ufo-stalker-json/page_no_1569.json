i thought the initial roar of the aircraft was a bomb at first until i saw the craft emerge. strangely the weather was nice that day 6/21 (sighting at 1:04am 6/22) and now today 6/22 into 6/23 (as i write this) it's been pouring down rain all day and dark clouds loom over. also i noted after the sighting that vehicles were strangely driving slower than normal for almost 30+ minutes. there was a strange feeling in the air and later at 1:27am i went back out side and heard a strange clash/bang noise somewhere out in the distance towards the south west, maybe as far as a mile away, or more, not to sure, but it was faint and i've never heard it before. also on a nice day i will hear various farm animals and wildlife making their sounds well late into the night namely dogs, peacocks, coyotes and roosters. yeah, roosters are weird here. i did not hear any of these animals but i did sight a hungry bear at around 3:00 am getting into the trash bin. as for the size of the orb i would say somewhere between the size of a star in the sky and an aspirin. furthermore the craft and orb were flying so low about as high as the mountains if not lower around 1200ft or less and definitely below cloud cover as there was minimal clouds in the sky at the time so not cloudless. i am speculating that the craft was flying below highest mountain elevation at an angle.  i would say the craft was undoubtedly between the size of a nickel and a quarter and definitely closer towards the quarter held at arm length towards the sky. i had no problem seeing the lights, the red, green, and white lights were not blended together at all, like you would see with a craft at a further distance.I would love to hear from mufon investigators about any information in the area, opinions, and questions.","distance":"N/A","duration":"00:00:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":39731,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":47.490086,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06232012-0006","longitude":-122.021242,"occurred":1340352240000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1340454262000,"summary":"Glowing yellowish gold. moving faster than aircraft.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/39731_submitter_file1__skysight1.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/39731_submitter_file2__flightDiagram1.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/39731_submitter_file3__flightDiagram2.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/39731_submitter_file4__flightDiagram3.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"98027","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Issaquah, Washington","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:844"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Summit","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was waiting for my husband to return to the truck. when a light caught my eye i looked up to the southwest and seen two objects like birds but they were bright silver in color and reflecting sunlight back but they did manuvers only birds could do they were abouve the clouds and would come in and out of clouds. i was facinated and asked by husband what kind of bird can reflect like that and he had no answer other than it was like nothing he or i had ever seen befor. i didnt want to leave but was facinated by the objects but i am a traveling nurse and had a 2 hour drive ahead of me and had to go. the day was clear with few high clouds and a breeze coming out of the west about 15-20 mls hour. time was 1700 hours and was witnessed for around 5 min.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I'm visiting family in joplin, missouri, and mom asked me to step outside and see a ufo. the sun set about an hour before, and what she pointed out to me was a slow moving, bright star in the south. i figured it was probably a reflection off a satellite, and it disappeared after about 10 minutes. it was moving due east, but it was unremarkable. while watching it, with the binoculars, i happened to see some flashing faa lights in the north east and when i zoomed in on them another set zoomed across the frame. it was a little frightening, so i stopped and looked with the naked eye, and there was a section of sky kind of ablaze with activity. once i got some perspective on it, there were 3 sets of faa lights that seemed to be jets, they went nnw, and then one circled back and headed out of sight in the opposite direction, while the two others took up positions flanking some large lights that were not flashing. those lights seemed to turn wsw, and they were not flashing. when i zoomed in with 7x35 mm binoculars, there were 3 distinct crafts, they seemed almost like cubes with backlighting that was more prominent on the corners of the craft highlighting the cube shape.  my dad wandered outside, and i hollered at my wife to come see the event, so we had 4 adults all seeing the same thing.  it was definitely not chinese lanterns.  they moved similar in speed to conventional jets, but their shape was different, with no apparent wings, and no faa lights.\r\n\r\nthe entire time there was an apparent roar, but it was deeper in tone than typical fighter jets or even commercial airliners. it seemed to be a very large type of engine, or something operating at very high power. just as i ran in to post this, the were starting to near the western horizon, and the sound was at its loudest. \r\n\r\ni observed many other typical passenger jets after the sighting, and in comparison to those jets, these were much lower.  the cubes were a little larger than the escort jets.  the size change when zoomed in with the binoculars was significant, so i take that to mean they were fairly close to me, compared to other jets i observed through the binoculars.  \r\n\r\nthe roar was similar to a jet roar, but much deeper and rumbly.  it reminded me seeing an f117a flyover at an airshow.  the roar was significant enough to get the attention of the kids when they walked outside.\r\n\r\nthe event stood out to me for the following reasons.  the initial activity was a bit chaotic, with multiple craft and direction changes.  i first thought it was fighter jets training or mock dog-fighting, but then the 3 larger crafts headed in a direct line and two of the jets took up flanking positions, while one zoomed out of sight in the direction from where they originated.  they did not follow the same jet paths as any of the normal passenger jet flyovers, and the noise was significantly louder, deeper, and more rumbling than anything else i've ever heard at this location.\r\n\r\nthe attached sketch attempts to capture the size comparison between the cubes and the escort jets.  this is how it looked through the binoculars when zoomed in.  the shape of the jet was easily discernible.  the red wingtip lights were visible, and both white strobes, but the opposite green wingtip was not visible.  the cubes seemed to be a yellowish, orangish strong middle glow, with whiter light concentrated at the tips.  the light was steady, and seemed to be more of an internal glow instead of distinct exterior lights.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

wanting the view the object that looked like it was going to land on us but not wanting to get into a wreck. earlier, we had been put on edge with seeing some kind of light flash far in the distance, in the direction we were driving.  looking up, in the small amount of time we had to get a good look, a gigantic black triangle hovered partway over the road, and partway over the lower area to the left of the road. it had small lights on each corner of the triangle, and a small center light. there was no spotlight or beam type of light coming from the lights, they seemed extremely flat and were out of view at a certain distance because of the angle.  we caught a hint of patterns etched into the black/grey surface of the triangle, but it was such a short glance we cannot be sure what we saw in regards to the types of patterns - the best i can say is something like squiggles or abstract lines, nothing like the outline of a hull door or definite squares and lines that you see on normal planes. more like it was decorated, not for function.  it had a hint of being metallic, but it was nighttime viewing an extremely dark object, so our 'hints' are vague at best.  the \"point\" of the triangle was pointed towards portland, behind us. it had the look of having either just landed and was heading up, or was descending down, but our speed on the highway plus the fact it was hovering and not moving forward or backwards, it was hard to tell. i got the best view looking out the back of the car, and saw it as we drove away. it was most definitely larger than any plane, say if you watch a plane land and you see its actual size, it was much larger. it was below the tree line so soon it was obscured by the trees (we were getting into a much more forested part of i-84 e), and at this time me and my fiance (the driver) and our friend were in a heated \"oh my god what was that\" discussion, and going methodically through makes and models of planes and military aircrafts.  i couldn't contribute much, being the only girl in the car. i just kept looking at the sky. soon, i start noticing more triangle shapes coming out of the distant clouds, some that had already been making their way over the mountains and were getting closer to the city. they were all headed precisely towards portland. they came from both our left and our right, but at this time i'm first noticing the ones on our right.  i still have a good view of portland behind us, and i see two triangles making their way towards the river and the bridge we passed over only minutes ago. near them, a plane is on its normal route, giving me a good comparison for size. the lights seem bigger than the plane lights, and the shapes (made more noticeable by being darker than the sky and blotting out what stars were there - the clouds were in front of us, it was clear above portland). i had no way to tell if the plane noticed or not. it just went along its way. the triangles (moving at a speed maybe a little faster than the plane, but not by much - they had a way of seeming 'unconcerned' and 'confident', but i'm emotional and tend to put feelings on things that there's no actual way to tell that's how they felt).  some seemed to have their middle light on, and some did not.  at this point, i begin to panic, thinking that we were being invaded by someone on the coast and this was our military coming to fight the war - or it was an enemy force coming to bomb the heck out of portland. i kept thinking, \"stealth bombers are triangles, right?!\" so i was convinced portland was going to be bombed, and i couldn't help but think of my family and friends. i proceeded to be emotional, and panic. i also continued to observe. i watch as a helicopter moves across the bridge, following the river like most news helicopters do (i couldn't tell what color the helicopter was, but the shape seemed average, nothing special) and was headed straight for the triangles. it seemed maybe slightly lower altitude then them, where they had seemed slightly lower than the plane from before.  i kept thinking that the helicopter couldn't possibly not see them - they were headed straight for each other! i watched as they got closer and closer but soon our momentum with the traffic of i-84e took us too far and i couldn't see. i looked at the rest of the sky and saw 2 to 4 more on each side, coming from the mountains and clouds, and headed in the same direction - portland. i continued to panic, completely forgetting i had a camera sitting in the purse that i had so casually at my feet. trust me, i've regretted this every single day after and will for the rest of my life. i continued to see them appear to each side of us, and above us (i have to mention, these are all higher elevation than the one we first passed, that seemed low enough for  us to be able to hear any noise and be deaf from it, if it were any normal aircraft - but it was silent. these were all at different heights but still much higher than that one. we soon noticed that we were following the tail end of a thunderstorm, headed northeast like we were. it seemed like these crafts were coming out of that storm, headed south/southwest. soon, there were no more, and i had my face glued to the windows the rest of the night, not wanting to miss a single second of possibly seeing any more. because i was sure, if i stared at it long enough, i would be enlightened to what it was, and be assured that it wasn't going to bomb portland.  the storm, which ended up right where we were headed, was a strong one, tons of lightning and thunder and apparently even started some wildfires in yakima, our destination. we arrived in yakima with the horizon tinted with the glowing red of fires, very common in that area in the summertime. we eventually dared to say it - that they might have been ufo's, something not human. we still tossed around bombers and military crafts but the nagging feeling that we just saw something amazing and otherworldly just wouldn't leave us. we were shaken up. i have no idea if any other cars saw this - i honestly didn't look anywhere but the sky as soon as this started.  and between the three of us, we can't seem to agree which lights were red and which were white, and sadly, three years long its been and i couldn't tell you which colors were where. our minds were overwhelmed with trying to figure out what was happening, i think.  it lasted a while - i did not look at any clocks during this time and it both seemed over so fast and also an eternity - depending on when my fear was at its most.  it was late, so i could not call anyone back home to see if they saw anything in the sky, or you know, got bombed. we went home the next day and asked, and no one seemed to have seen or heard about what we saw. no one was bombed. everything was fine. i probably should have reported this, but i didn't know where to go to report it and i felt like no one would believe me if i spoke to strangers about it. my family was hard enough, but i sat down and drew diagrams and was determined to at least help them understand that iiii believe what i saw. but i still do not know what i saw. but this is the type of things you need reported, correct? i hope that my report helps, i'm sorry it took 3 years for me to find out who to go to and realize its important enough to report at all.  \r\n\r\ni don't know if i should also mention this, but around the same time in 2011 i was sitting in the back yard of my friends house in beaverton oregon, and we were discussing \"deep\" subjects and looking at the stars, when two objects that we thought were merely satellites started moving erratically, impossibly, then disappeared into nothing. i have been an avid meteor-shower watcher and sky gazer my whole life, well trained by my science and space loving mother, and i know satellites and stars and that was certainly neither! it was fast, but not like a bug, but nothing like how any aircraft can move. went in tight zigzags for a moment then flew off into nowhere, just gone. me and my friend looked at each other and just went \"uhhh....Did you see what i saw?!\" and felt a tingle in our spines.  that was certainly less scary than our 2010 experience! this, by the way, was a different friend, than the one with us in the car the night of the triangles.  it was her first sighting of anything like that, haha. we were both just grinning silly and couldn't help but talk about more 'interesting' topics after that.  i felt emboldened to speak about my experience with the triangles, and she took it well.   anyway, thank you for letting me tell my story. i hope i helped, at all. (and sorry i didn't have the presence of mind to get my camera out - i'm never letting myself off the hook for that as long as i live - and i hope i'm better prepared if i ever see anything strange like that again!)\r\n\r\n-deanna ","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":39699,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.5314215,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06212012-0032","longitude":-122.6739571,"occurred":1281337200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oregon","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1340343335000,"summary":"Saw multiple large black triangle shaped unidentified crafts in sky while leaving portland, coming towards the city. they  were coming out of a thunderstorm.","tags":["triangle"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":682,"locationName":"Portland, Oregon","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:871"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82757,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1569}
