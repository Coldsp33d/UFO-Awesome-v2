originally reported this. i never heard back, so after watching the lowe files i decided to re-report my sighting:\r\n\r\nmy sister and i were on our way home from abingdon, va going to hurley, va. the stars were beautiful that night as i had been star gazing the whole way home (i was the passenger). the sighting occured at the new mountain (some sort of bypass with the coalfield expressway they’re trying to build) in grundy, va, \"walmart mt\" if you will. the moment when we started to go down the hill we saw a ufo. i didn't see it go from one side of the sky to the other; i didn't even see it until it turned its super nice blue lights on (i guess it was hovering in the middle of the sky and decided to leave so it turned on its “get the h3ll out of here” lights) and that thing was gone. i’ve never saw anything go so fast! it didn't have a noise (i had my window down cause i was smoking (a cigarette by the way)). it was shaped like a waning crescent moon (but rotate the image in your head to the right) and it went from my right to my left, but it was hovering right above us (or it appeared out of thin air, but i like my hovering theory) and i only saw the lights, i couldn't make out a ship color. i think it was either a round shaped ufo with only one half of the edges lit up, or it was just the crescent moon shape and it was completely lit up (the latter being what i actually saw). when it turned the lights on, it lit some of the sky up, sort of like lightning, but not as far out into the sky as lightning would and the “lightning” was a bright led blue color just like the lights. and it was higher than the trees but no where near the stars. i really don’t know anything about altitude to describe how far it was, it seemed close but not close enough to scare me. it was as big as a full moon would be hanging in the sky. i wish i could see it again, it wasn't scary, it was cool. it was so fast, it had turned those lights on and was gone before i could finish saying \"wow\". the lights on it could've been one light as i didn't see any gaps to prove seperate lights, but i don't know how it could be a single light and be shaped like that. the lights didn’t blink nor flash, they were just turned on and they stayed on. i guess it could be some form of a military craft, but i can’t identify it, and it was a flying object. so it’s a ufo to me, until someone can prove me wrong.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:03","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line

when all of a sudden two piercing lights appeared in the skies to the north of us, they were not beside each other one was much further ahead than the other. they began to move in abnormal ways which made it abundantly clear that this couldn't be a plane or a helicopter as it moved side to side and up and down far to quick that it almost defied gravity.\r\n\r\nthe first \"craft\" moved in its flight path and as it came in our eye sight, it was clear that this was abnormal, however, still being the sceptic, i didn't think anything as the sound generated did sound like a plane, although impossible. \r\n\r\nas the first craft passed, the second then began to move in the distance following the exact same flight path. its movement was peculiar as it moved in a flight motion then shot forward but continued in the first crafts flight path and once passed, a third one became visible in the distance again.\r\n\r\ni know this sounds crazy and honestly i cant find the words to describe it, it left me speechless. behind the third craft it honestly looked like there was a mothership or something much bigger. this could be because i was caught up in the moment and wanted to believe that this mothership was behind it but back to the third craft. \r\n\r\nthis one was the banker, it closed my mind, i seen a ufo. its flickered and followed the flight path as the other two but all of a sudden, it was in our eyesight, flying towards us. how it changed direction that quick is unknown as it is not as if i noticed it changed direction, it was just there.\r\n\r\nas it got closer, the lights flashed front then back, side then side, as if in a cross. the sound generated for something just touching cloud level was impressive, take a plane in the skies, all that way up, it sounded like that but this low down. now as it went over us, it was clear it was of a circular motion. i would describe the bottom of it as if an eclipse had took place, this black circle was blocking a light which was flickering down. in movies when people get abducted by this light that comes down and the centre bit is left clear, exactly like that. i don't mean the light came down like that, what i mean is, that's the way it seemed. it hovered then continued forward. if you know the colour vantablack, the new black that scientists invented, that's the colour of it. it was visible but invisible.\r\n\r\nat the time i felt like crying, it honestly left me speechless and that's hard to do. the drive home was deafening, we never spoke and today as i speak to people about it, its as if i cant be bothered talking about it because i'm left gobsmacked. its as if i'm depressed and in a low place. that's how it has made me feel and the fact ill never know what it was kills me. i am going back up tonight and finger cross i get answers. \r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Path with directional

tree canopy's in my old village. the object from underneath looked like a mix of black and dark purple with a shimmer of dark green colours,it reminded me me of a smooth circuit board but much less cluttered and much more sophisticated as i look back. it had grooves and bits that looked like they were cut away,but it even though it was past 5p.M and light...It was still hard to make out, it seemed blurry like a heat wave was under it. it had dull red lights,some a greenish colour and i believe i saw some dull blues but they seemed inset. many years later as an adult i have been awoken by many strange occurrences. the first i thought was sleep paralysis and the others i put down to night terrors but i strongly feel otherwise now.. as i've matured in intelligence and in my emotions,along with my consciousness i very strongly feel this has been a regular occurrence throughout my life. i am not saying i have been visited by aliens or beings off world but i will say that i'm open to the possibility....Only after i've exhausted ever other possibilities first & its getting closer to this possibility. i was awoken only a month or so after the 2nd occurance looking up through my skylight window by what seemed to be like minature lightning hitting my big toe and then slowly travelling through my foot and into my leg but i managed to shake it off with what seemed like the hugest effort of will power and concentration. only a week ago i saw a blobby looking mix of multi coloured flashes in the sky,i fist thought it to b a star or a planet...But i have invested in a telescope as these occurances seem to happen to me on and off regularly. i looked through the telescope and was absolutely astounded as i saw the undefined lights zip up down diagonally left and right....In an instant. i've seen a cigar shaped object in plane sight with my 2 nephews somewhere over the bolton on dearne or gold thorpe area...And now.....Im starting not just to see things but feel them...Or presences of some sort....Like my mind...My consciousness is beeing shared or observed in some manner...Please can some one at least talk to me as i feel iyl be ridiculed if i bring up this subject....I would prefer to keep this private.

even though we were able to take off our protective glasses at the point the pictures were taken and i had taken off the solar filter on my camera.  i have some possible explanations - there were some small airplanes who were taking tourists up to see the eclipse in the sky in a neighboring city (rexburg), but again, no one witnessed nor heard an airplane in the area.  it could have been a drone, but we didn't see any drones in this park - it was relatively isolated by the snake river and there were some local people, but no one in our family party noticed a drone.  of course, it could be a bird, but it almost looks like the light is reflecting off of it. in the last picture i submitted, there is a light white object in the lower left which my space-obsessed son had already identified as the planet venus - and a viewer can see that the object in the previous 4 photos was not venus as it is a different color.  i would really appreciate it if you can give an opinion!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:04","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":86190,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.39046596877927,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08232017-0014","longitude":-112.14554840211521,"occurred":1503315240000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Idaho","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1503494498000,"summary":"Taking pictures of total eclipse -

walking my dog. i noticed a triangular object with two orange lights at the base and one white light at the tip. the lights did not flash; they were unwavering. there was also no noise coming from the object; it was silent. as i was walking, a tree obstructed by view, so i moved a few feet to the right, and the ufo seemed to mirror my movement. i then moved a few feet to the left, and again, it mirrored my movement. i moved back to the right once more, and again it mirrored my movement. the movements were very quick and sharp. this mirroring took place over the span of approximately 10 - 15 seconds. at this point, i started to panic and became very anxious. within a second or two of me becoming anxious, the ufo suddenly looked very clearly like an airplane. the lights started to blink and i heard a noise consistent with what an airplane would sound like. after this apparent change in shape, it then traveled in a straight path away from me. i eventually lost sight of it as it flew away into the distance, toward the airport (approximately 2 minutes).
