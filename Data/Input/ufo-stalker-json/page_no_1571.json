i quickly pointed it out to the person i was with and she could not explain it either. i have seen my fair share of satellites and this was not one. we live fairly close to the fresno airport and i have never seen a plane or helicopter behave in this manner and even then, their was no sound coming from it!Once it started moving it was going about 3x the average speed of a plane and headed ne towards the mountains. but the sightings dont stop there. i work outdoors during the day, i was standing near an intersection observing a jet passing over leaving behind a contrail when out of nowhere i am almost blinded by a metallic egg shaped object that appeared probly 700ft over the intersection. at first i though it was glare from the sun on my sunglasses. i moved my head and glasses around a bit, thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me. but this object was just hovering in the same position. it looked like it was emitting alot of light from it. it felt like i was staring at a mini sun. it was hoving for a good 10 seconds and then as quick as it appeared, it was gone. for the next 2 nights i saw the same star-like object as the night before, heading in the same direction, with no sound coming from it, moving againts the heavy gusts of wind. after that the sightings stopped for 3 days. then i started seeing the same star-like object almost every other night. in the past 2 weeks i have probly seen it  about 10 times, at varying distances, ranging in movement from hovering, to a very fast straight path, to high speed precision turns. the wierdest recent sighting took place with the person who saw the first one with me.  we saw the same bright light, make what i can only describe as a rollar coaster motion as it swooped down then arched back upwards and disappeared above the neighborhood not 500ft from us. we determined this thing to be about the size of a small bus. i havent noticed any missing time recently but ever since these sighting began i havent been able to recall a single dream i have had, which is wierd as i normally vividly remember my dreams. a couple mornings i have woken up and been very sore and achy all over, i also noticed a rash like burn that almost looked like a finger tip on the direct center of my chest which was not there when i fell asleep that night. i dont think i was abducted, just thought i would note the strange occurances that have been going on since this started. sadly i dont have much money right now and have no access to a camcorder, and my flip phones crappy camera dosnt get me very far. i havent really told anyone about these sightings other than the person who has seen some with me, i think most of my friends would just laught me off as a kook! the activity has again quited down for the last couple of days, will be sure to report if i see anything more.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":39635,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.79018795864946,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06202012-0016","longitude":-119.68916375690561,"occurred":1338872400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Egg,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1340236597000,"summary":"Multiple orb sightings in clovis, ca ","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"93611","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":15,"locationName":"Clovis, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:1011"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Bountiful","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was in the back  yard having a smoke about 8.45 pm i saw was a craft round in size.  come over the east mountains it came towards me  it was lower then helcopters usally fly.  the disc like ufo was  probley 100 ft away from me.  it then stopped and hovered above me.  no sound then this  orange light came on and expanded it looked like  dimples in the lighting.  i called out to  my son in law but he didnt come then i ran to the front door and told him to come outside and see this  ran back to  the back yard.  its still there. my son in law didnt come so i ran to front door and told him to come see. ran back  out  it was still right ther above me.  but the hugh orange lite was smaller.  my son in law came out to see finnaly he said how weird, the  orange like smaller. then it went out and  a bubble white light came  on it appeared to be like it was in a  cloud.  a circle  cloud and it was in the middle of the cloud. it went north then at a very slow pace.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"08:45:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":39634,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.87389434266869,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06202012-0015","longitude":-111.88365190132326,"occurred":1338274800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Utah","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1340236381000,"summary":"Came slowly over tne  mountain then stopped in air.  hovered then  hugh orange light expanded  look like  dimples in  the light .  tryed to get my son in law to wittness took  him about  7 mins to come as it hovered.  it was  still hoverring when  he saw ","tags":["light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":22,"locationName":"Bountiful, Utah","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:1012"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Grove City","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Approx 10:30pm, i noticed the pulsating stars lining up and flashing more prominently last night, just like the first time i observed the orange orb(last week.) so i went to the front of my house to look for the orange orb that i saw there previously and less than a minute later i saw the solid, orange, glowing, non-blinking ball traveling west to east again. however, this time i noticed it hover a second and slightly adjust path from it straight line and then descend below the tree-line and out of view. \r\nat 10:58pm , i was back in my back yard and noticed a bright flash of light in a constellation that was low in the southeastern sky. the week before i observed a dark object traveling through the sky and then flashing when it hit the handle of the big dipper constellation.

stars,my house faces south.To the right of me (west)i saw a large,dark orange glowing object.Coming into view.At first i thought it was fireworks or a flare.But it was moving very fast toward this direction.My son was in his room,he is almost 14,i yelled immediately for him to come out and look.It continued west,then slowed,and lights got dimmer and brighter,almost the color of the sun.It seemed round,and then slightly elongated,it seemed to hover,aproximately in the area south of p d x.Then it turned and headed south.This was 10:45 pm.We were very excited,my son was a little fearful,we watched,for a total of 4-5 minutes as it silently flew out of our sight.....Someone said,they thought it was the space station,i have seen that twice,and this i can say (from my experience)was not the space station.It was far too low in the sky,and too large,and looked like it was on fire,because of the color.Also,the radio,101.1 a caller reported a sighting in portland or.At 10:28 pm.When compared to the stars in the sky....It dwarfed them in size.The craft or object was silent.","distance":"Over One
