location and saw a group of vapor trails that looked to be angling downward. from what i can see there was at least 10 seperate vapor trails but all appeared to be going the same direction. the best way i can describe these trails would be as if all the objects broke the sound barrior at the same time and same altitude where it leaves a short puff of condensation or as if all objects went through a thin layer of moist atmosphere leaving a trail. all the objects trails were very close to the same altitude. i looked at it for a few minutes and picked up my cell phone and took a picture. the first picture clearly showed all the vapor trails and it looked just like what i was seeing with my naked eye. i then took a second picture making sure this time to include the roofs of the neighboring houses so you can see how large this formation was. what i found odd is that even between the 2 pictures you can see the clouds in the background were moving but the trails stayed close to the same place. you can also tell the trails were below the cloud cover. my best description would be that i saw the rements of a large group of objects that were in a formation... a group all about the altitude, leaving vapor trails of very close to equal length. when i looked at the photos it does appear that some of these objects were of different sizes.\r\nthe pictures were taken by a dell

going to have to tell him that it was just a plane. it was a cloudy night so you couldn't see any stars or the moon. i bent down to get a better view and off to the west looking i immediately saw 3 hovering orange lights in a triangle formation. the lights didn't move and were as bright as street lights viewed a block away. i knew i wasn't seeing a plane, helicopter, or anything familiar. i quickly exited the gazebo and ran down the deck stairs toward the levy to get a better look. as the four of us ran, i called to my neighbor who was outside with 2 children. all three of them ran over and we watched what we now noticed were 4 orange lights hovering. i tried to record them with my camera phone but as anyone with a camera phone knows that even taking a clear picture of the moon is almost impossible. we watched for a minute as they seem to ascended into the clouds one by one. i'm not sure how long they were present below the clouds but we saw them for about a minute and a half total.

to my left over the lake and approximately 200 feet from the road hovering above the tree lines i saw a round sphere about 20 to 30 feet across.  it was a very bright metallic color with a glow around the outside of the sphere.  at first i thought it was a helicopter but there was no sound it was just hovering there.  i reached over on my seat to grab my cellphone to take a picture and when i turned to take the picture it was all the way on the other side of the lake barely seeble and then it disappeared this all took place within 3 seconds.  i drove down the road further approximately 1/8 of a mile looking and when i came to the next area of trees there it was again.  it was approx. 2 minutes from the first sighting that i saw this sphere.  i do not know if it was the same sphere or a second one.  i had the phone in my lap and raised it to take a picture it was still hovering over the trees, as i went to focuse in for the photo, it shot off across the lake again and disappearred out of site within approx. 2 seconds. it has remained in my mind and i constantly have the needy feeling to return to the site.  \r\n\r\nthis has not been my first experience of seeing similar crafts.
