you can tell us what we saw at wyandotte lake last night 6/16/2012. \r\nfive of us, age ranging from 59-79 were out on a pontoon boat last night about 10:00pm. over the hill towards the east side of the lake above the tree line we saw 1 bright orange light about the size of a small street light rise up above the thick tree line. then 3 more lights in a triangular formation came up. ���then another triangular formation the same, rose up under the first one. the first single light disappeared or turned off. ���the 2 triangle formations, with 3 lights each turned into 2 lights each. the 4 lights moved around and lined up to make a straight line. then 1 single light came and 5 lights were in a straight line. the line of lights rotated counter clockwise and disappeared down into the trees. we all saw the lights about the same time. we were talking while it was happening. saying things like look there, what is that? what are we seeing? i think we just felt curious, not scared or fearful. it all happened in a moderately slow, controlled way. after it happened we just wanted to see where the lights went. we expected to see more, but that was it. afterwards everyone was talking about what happened. mostly trying to explain it in a rational way. we even moved the boat to try and see more. it happened in the opposite direction on the lake from the legends.  so we didn't think it related to activities there. one person said, maybe they were helicopters. they were too close together for helicopters. in about 15 minutes 2 helicopters started circling the lake. they looked different than the lights we all saw, we all agreed on that. wyandotte lake is on the flight path of kci. all night long we saw planes going and coming to and from kci.  the planes all looked and sounded like aircraft. this was silent, no noise. \r\nwe saw something, we just don't know what we saw.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

on highway us 131 in three rivers, michigan.  the sun was just disappearing to the west as it was dark to the east.  i noticed a bright light object in the sky to my left (east) as i was driving.  the immediate thought was to see if the light was from the top of a tower such as a cell phone tower and to see if it blinked like one.  the object did not blink and the bright light of the object was moving closer toward us.  then i thought that it might be an airplane since it was moving.  i realized that it was not an airplane because it didn't have the small classic lights or blinking lights (red or white) that you see from an airplane in the sky.  as the object traveled closer, i realized that the object consisted of a bright fire-like orange glow.  i immediately found the closest side street off of the highway and parked my car.  my wife stayed in the car but i grabbed my cell phone, got out of the car and walked toward were the ufo was traveling overhead of us.  i used my iphone 4s to take pictures and a video of the ufo.  while recording the object in video mode, my wife yelled out to me from the car that another one was coming over the trees.  i moved my camera to record the other similar ufo.  there were approximately 3 more bright fire-like orange glowing objects traveling across the highway in succession.  a total of 5-6 ufo's seemed to be following each other in a pattern of about 30 seconds apart and were about 500 feet or more into the night sky above.  i believe that each ufo was about the size of a very small house.  the ufo's did not make any sound but just seem to glide effortlessly across the sky.  i was simply amazed and in awe of how big and bright they were.  each one of the ufo's flew almost directly over us toward the west and disappeared over the trees and into the clouds.  they seem to have come from over the trees and through clouds on the other side (east side) of the highway. this is a first time i've seen a ufo.  i showed my dad the footage i obtained and he told us that that was the same object he saw last year memorial day weekend.  although the bright orange glowing ufo my dad saw traveled downward toward him and his friends and suddenly, at a very high rate of speed, changed directions at about 45 degrees and disappeared into the night sky.","distance":"101-500

straight ahead thru the center top of my windshield and see what looked like an aircraft still out at a distance in approach what caught my eye is that it seemed at such a distance still maybe over the chandler area but it was so bright i kept watching it and it didn't seem to be moving either away or towards me like i believed i should notice if it was a plane.It seem to be hovering but slightly bouncing up and down. one of my friends was in the car sleeping in the passenger seat i watched the light for a few minutes and wanted to be sure what i thought i saw before i woke her because i knew if it was a obviously a plane she would just laugh at me. approx after i have driven another mile i wake her i tell her look see that light she says no i keep pointing till she sees (honestly she sort of likes her sleep so was not as enthused as i was)i ask her what she thinks by the time i look back over she has nodded back off and i feel slightly embarrassed wanting to pull over but feeling a little stupid for showing her so  i  slowed a little more but didn't want to stop on the highway as i exited the highway i approached the toll i could no longer see the light. i sort of wish i would of just stopped to know for sure myself so now that i am home thinking about it i figured i would contact you. i didn't know where to begin to check local area flights to dismiss

Township","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Ok so i've been noticing these singular orbs or more like moving stars some times dim and small sometimes bright and larger possibly due to distance who knows. i've been seeing them in the skies over waterford michigan for the past 3 years, you can see them with the naked eye, i usually yell out to my neighbors and say hey check it out! i've taken a few pictures but they were lost over time with changing phones, i never cared much for the pictures anyway it wasn't that impressive in a picture anyway, most of the time the camera wouldnt pick the light up, and when it did it's not like you could tell what it was, just a ball of light int he sky like you took a picture of a bright sometimes dim star that was close.\r\n\r\ni have been able to see them on almost everynight that the skies are clear, maybe like 1 or 2 days out of the week i wont see any, probably because i wont stay out longer for 25 minutes usually if i dont see anything right away. they almost always, always travel north, or north east, again maybe 1 or two days out of the week i'll see one travaling south, or just plane west bound.\r\n\r\nnow the only thing they could be are satellites, if they are not, than it is unknown. infact over the 3 years, i've been able to prove to my self that some of them could infact be satellites, using gpredict i'm able to track many satellites and i've been also been able to \"possibly\" connect some of these sightings to satellites possibly passing in my overhead sky, all i have to do is look at the approx time and direction their orbits are and try to match it up in gpredict, sometimes i come to the conclusion that they could've infact just been satellites.\r\n\r\nnow i'm not a professional and i'm not spending any time on this(other than just looking at the sky, i've recently started using binoculars but thats it) otherwise i'd have more legible and exact time and what not.\r\n\r\nlike i said some of these could be satellites passing over the horizon and when the sun on the other side of the earth hits their reflective surfaces it makes the illusion that its glowing and than dimming after half a minute.\r\n\r\nsometimes it's not so simple.  sometimes i'll see one that'll seem to be crusing along at a slow speed even for how far away is, untill it's to far way in space to see, even when you can see the stars around it it just disaperes and than usually approx 4-5 minutes later you'll se another, and in another 4 or 5 minutes you'll see another one, gradually going faster untill you'll see one travaling twice or three times the speed as the slow one you seen approx 12-20 minutes beforehand.\r\n\r\ntonight i saw 7 or 8 consecutively mind you just in a small time frame of about from 10:25pm to 11:10pm traveling north and one going north east, the first couple were pretty close together time wise, like you could watch one untill it just disaperes into space and than 3-4 minutes later you'll se another going the same direction, at around the 5th or 6th they started getting 10-12 minutes apart, with the last one i saw moving way faster than any of the previous (who for how far away they look still look like they're moving as fast as a jet, but it looks like they're moving slow cause it's soooo far away) he was moving atleast 4 times that and looked equally as far away, it was very very bright when i first cought sight of it (i was looking north bound and it came over my south) but within 7 seconds as usual it just dims to a dim light, no blinking no nothing, just a hovering star.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe only option for these things are satellites nothing else floats around that high up (or higher for all i know they look exactly like stars or moreso like planets because they dont flicker, they just get bright once, and than dim... i've seen maybe 2 or 3 out of 50 in which the same object would get very bright and dim twice with in the .5 minutes you can actually watch it fly across space untill it gets to far or high that the light cannot reach your eyes anymore, it's not like theyre passing over the horoizon, or a treeline they just straight up get to high up and the light isnt powerfull enough to reach your corneass.\r\n\r\nif you guys at mimufon  (or anyone else who wants to watch for that matter ) ever find your self in the areas of oakland county and have a clear sky look up, if you wait long enough i guarentee you will see one or two at the very least\r\n\r\nthey always almost go north\r\n\r\nyou can see them almost as soon as its dark enough that you can see stars in the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown,

building, when an orange/amber object became visible on the horizon. it was still light out, just before sunset. i remarked the object reminded me of a ufo and jokingly asked how much he would like to bet on it. as a child i was convinced i had been abducted, and the object seemed familiar, even though i had no clear memories of such a thing. the object stayed in place for 2 to 3 minutes and suddenly we became aware, it wasn't something normal. we continued nervously watching the hovering ball of light when suddenly and soundlessly it flew straight at us. the object hovered above the roof of our apartment complex. it was a vast, dark grey object with a matte finish, its bottom had a ring of blueish light around the edges and three orbs of orange light underneath. the object was a triangular disc with rounded corners. for 10-20 seconds it hovered silently above us and our building, then zipped away to the east without a sound. hardly believing what we had just seen, my neighbor and i ran down the stairs of our deck, to the parking lot to the east of our building and looked for anyone who also witnessed the object. there was a couple grilling out, sitting in a garage, and we asked them if they saw it. the asked us if we had been drinking, to which we replied \"no\" months later i asked my neighbor, to describe the object, just to see if what i remembered wasn't some kind of realistic dream. he described the object in exactly the manner i remembered it. ive always felt like this object new i was there, and purposefully revealed itself to me. it knew, i knew what it was. i have no memories of abduction, only missing periods of time during my childhood, a tendency to see objects in the sky, particularly at dusk and dawn, but i always brushed it off as a childhood fear of aliens. this moment solidified in my mind that these event must have happened because this time there was a witness who agreed we saw the same, seemingly impossible object. i have to say when the object was hovering over my head, i wasn't scared, like i had been before, just seeing lights in the distance. i felt it knew i wanted to see it, that there was intelligence there, but no malice.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line

side to side or quiver as it continued to traverse a straight course when before our eyes it started to go transparent with and changed to a fading orange streak and disapeared or cloaked....The aprox height was it was flying was about a mile and as it first pass over us you could see the side,the bump on the top in middle,it was moving along pretty good but not as fast as you would think,kinda
