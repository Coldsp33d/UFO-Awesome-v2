(after hours), just like we always do rain or clear, warm or cold. one friend sat in his car with the door open, legs outside, feet on the pavement. the second friend sat in a plastic lawn chair that we have in front of the store, which he pulled over to sit next to where the first friend was sitting with his car door open. i stooped next to them, since i had grown tired of standing, and didn't feel like sitting on the pavement.\r\n time: approx. 11:30-11:45. every night we see the occasional plane fly overhead heading into mbs, our local airport. once in awhile we'll spot the dot of a sat. going by. there are the few times when a helocopter will fly by also.  you know, the usual. there was cloud cover, but it was beginning to break up. temp was warm, with a pleasant breeze.\r\n the light caught my eye, and at first i thought it was just another plane, but the color of the light was odd. i said out loud to my friends, \"well that dosen't look right,\" then stood up to view it better. the parking lot is lit, but not very well. the light had an almost mars colored glow, maybe a bit more red. there were no other light being emitted from it, steady, blinking, or otherwise.\r\n it approached from the south, and moved steadily, and at the speed of an airliner, maybe a little faster. my friend in the chair got up, and suggested that it might be a copter, but changed his mind because of the objects speed, and lack of noise. in fact there was no engine sounds throughout the entire incident.\r\n i moved out into the parking lot and turned my back to the lighting of the lot, while keeping my eyes on the thing the entire time. there was only one light coming from the side of a building, so i used my ball cap to block it, which clarified my vision.  once it was nerly overhead, i tried to see if i could see any wings, or other light sources coming from the object, but to my suprise, i saw a clear view of a round, almost egg shaped object flying by. it was directly overhead, and its edges were clearly defined, and i remember saying \"wait...What the **** is that!\" i knew that i had never seen anything like it before.  \r\n\r\n experimental aircraft? non earth aircraft? don't know. i have never sighted or reported a sighting before. this is a first for me, and a  strange enough incident for me to report it.\r\n don't be afraid to contact me, and thank you for your time.

draw attention from a distance, with lights pointing towards teh sky, but then i realized that this wasn't like that at all because the light was coming from the sky, and not pointed towards the ground, but pointed horizontally. it appeared like a light house would, with a two beams of light pointing in opposite directions and spinning from their source, staying 180 degrees apart. the lights were parallel to the ground. this looked like if there was a large light house within the cloud and the beams of light continued to spin at a fixed rate and from a fixed location for the entire time i watched it, which was as i traveled down the highway. the beams of light were illuminated in the sky by the light cloud coverage. the beams of light were very strong and very wide, much wider than search lights typically appear on helicopters, and rotating from their source at a fixed speed and fixed angle. they came from inside of the cloud, and judging by the sky, if its elevation was normal for that type of cloud, the light source must have been a very very large bulb, because the beam of light appeared to be about as wide as a quarter when it passed parallel above my sunroof. after i passed 76 the treeline prevented me from watching it further, but i'm sure it continued.","distance":"Over One

south on hwy 6, crossing the grand river in caledonia when we observed two orange, firelike balls to the south west, over the area of the old mill.  the balls appeared to be the size of large hot air balloons, but were perfectly round and appeared to be illuminated, the colour of orange fire but not flickering.  one object was higher than the other, maybe seperated by 100 yards and at about a 60 degree angle from each other.  they were both in perfect syncronization and both travelled north.  another man and his wife pulled over as we did, for some reason, none of us got out of our vehicles.  we joked, in an awkward way about 'war of the worlds', but it was very awkward as we were both seriously seeing something we never had seen before.  we didn't know what to say to each other.  as the objects continued north, they appeared to ascend then became very small, the colour changed to greenish blue then disapeared suddenly.  two more objects came from the south, in the exact same manner as the previous two, and followed the exact same path and, like dejavue, they both disappeared in the same manner.  the initial speed would be compared to a small plane, but the ascent was uncomparable to any thing i've ever seen.  we seperated from the other two witnesses and immeditatly attended a family function and told everyone what we saw, you can imagine their reaction.  they had lots of suggestions as to what it may have been, but honestly, i don't think anyone could ever explain this to me.  this weekend is the hamilton airshow but there is no plane that looks like or can do

buildings in front of me. it was not directly above them, they just happened to be blocking the view for the most part. after a few moments, it was in full view and heading at a relatively low speed to the north west. i thought it may be a helicopter rotor light, there where no other lights on the object/sphere however. the light did seem to be a fairly dark red but was lighter near the edges, with a gentle blending of said shades via the pulsating. the outermost edges where rather blurry but it was 1am in the morning and there where florescent lights behind me, this may have played a trick on my eyesight. i am sure that there where no strobe lights. perhaps it was a flare of some sort, i do not know.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

and i go to the 1st step and noticed an air plane flying from the south east heading toward the north west toward the airport.  it travelled toward the horizon then there was a huge flash of light that filled the entire sky that was really strange. it was an unusual blue greeny color - almost started like a radiation outward of energy like an expanding light that went in all directions...  i was shocked/awed by what i saw and my heart was racing... its like something from twilight zone or the movies... it was quick but bloody enormous! whatever it was it cause the power in my house to go out and come back on... i have one witness to the affects it had on the power...(she was inside) i couldnt help but think immediately the idea of an em pulse but it wasn't an explosion as there was no sound at all and no wind.  it definately was not lightning - it expanded outwards... the plane was still visible in the distance... no idea what is was other than
