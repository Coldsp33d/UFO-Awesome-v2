and it did not take long for me to discredit it being any manned craft, it moved just a bit faster as it got close to earth, right before it came to the top of mountain it went dark then back on again then lowered behind mountain,i know it went behind mountain due to the fact i saw the light hover behind the trees at the top, for a second after hovering it dropped behind, i watched for some time and never saw it go back up, but i could not stay out all night,  while i was watching to see if it would come back up, i say another way up maybe space, at first i thought a satellite, the speed was about right but then for a moment i could barely see oranges yellow color then by surprise it cut right very sharply into another path and kept going,\r\n\r\ni am pretty smart and try to dismiss any

janes military and other aircraft books.  even at the time of my sighting i could indentify 95+ percent of any aircraft, military or civilian.\r\n  during summer school vacation my parents would send my younger brother and i to stay a week or two with my grandparents in wells maine.  i was approx 14 or 15 years old at the time.  their house sat 90 degrees to the road it was on.  a small dirt parking lot about 40 ft wide and 100 ft long separated their house from the neighbors. my grandparents house was a two family with a garage attached to the rear of the house. above the garage was a patio, accessible by the second floor apartment where my grandparents lived.\r\n  behind their house was a small field, 150 feet square.  beyond the field was a row of small trees, less than 25 feet tall. beyond the trees was a water treatment facility under construction at the time.  beyond that was a large salt water marsh several hundred yards wide,a road, beach houses and then the ocean.\r\n  many times while at play here i noticed many,many military aircraft coming and going from the north.  they were always rather low, less than 5000 ft. due to their low altitude i always assumed there must be an air force base near by.  i saw mostly c 130 cargo planes, but do recall one time seeing a b-1 swing wing bomber, again heading due south right over the house then out over the marsh.\r\n  on night my grandmother, my brother, and i were just settling in to watch tv.  it was around 8pm, but summer time, so it was still kinda light outside.  all of a sudden my grandfather could be heard yelling \"hey, come here,hey ,hey come here\"  he was out on the patio above the garage. we all went out there, and when i turned to the right and looked there was a saucer shaped craft over the dirt parking lot about 20 feet off the ground. it was about 60 feet away and moving south very slowly.  it was about 15 to 18 feet long and about 3 or 4 feet thick.  it was a dark flat black color.  i could not see any rivets or panels, or doors.  the lower half was ringed with thin, almost lazer like lights. green, yellow, orange in color, with thicker \"bumps\" in the lines that moved back and forth.  it made no sound. \r\n  nobody said a word, i could feel every hair on my body standing on end.  it's height was even with my line of sight.  it just cleared the row of small trees, went out over the marsh, then out over the ocean.  due to its slow speed this took some time.  we all went into the house when it was just a dot of light in sky.","distance":"21-100

it was hard to *not* notice it.\r\n\r\nwe sat there in awe as it flew across, and after it passed, ran into his house a bit scared.  we attempted to explain it to his mother, which was unsuccessful, thinking we were just fooling with her.\r\n\r\nit was during the night, so it was kind of tough to see exactly how this object was formed.  it appeared to be triangular in shape, like a dorito chip. looking up, it had red lights on the surface underneath.  i cannot recall how many; but it was in a pattern of a triangle as well. the object did not alternate a course, or speed.  it couldn't of been more than 20-30 ft above the roof of his one story home.  i can't recall if it had a low hum, or hardly any noise at all.  it was definitely not loud at all. it was in our view for about 10 seconds, and exited our view once it went past the treeline. it wasn't going real fast, kind of just scoping the area out possibly?  \r\n\r\nbeing so young, i always dismissed this as a possible government project of some sorts.  i just watched the show \"ufo's over earth\", which featured sightings in bucks county, pa;

was dark , clear of clouds, and the moon hadn���t risen yet .I came back into the house and sat in the recliner to watch television . i am looking at the tv right next to the full sliding screen door to the open porch \r\ndirectly in front of me. the view of the sky from where i am setting is jet black. \r\n\r\nsuddenly a red circle appeared. it was large not small like a star . i���ve never seen anything like this in the sky.  the color was like a dark red ripe strawberry. as i ran out onto the porch it changed right in front  of my eye���s.  there was a orange red deep crescent thicker in the middle and tapering at each upward point . there were two perfect circles watermelon colored  above each point of the crescent. it was moving in a vertical position horizontally  across the sky. the size of the circles were like the size of a pencil eraser compared to a star ,and the depth of the crescent was at least  three times as long as the circle���s size. next there appears  a  frame of light yellow gold in the shape  of an elliptical with the circles midway of the yellow gold frame there appears to be cup like indentations on right and left top, outlined by the yellow gold frame. the frame appears to be equal in height above the circles as the orange red crescent is below. the size is now much larger now. there is nothing visible in the center.  \r\n\r\nthe object is slowly moving behind the treetops , the tree is approximately 40-50 feet tall. i can see light through the trees. the glimpses i can see it seems to have changed position . i can see it more horizontal to the ground with white in the center. at this point it definitely looks like a craft. it���s gone behind a taller tree and all i can see is light coming through the tree for a couple of seconds. then i see it again this time clearer. i see two  bright  white large rounded cylinder shaped protrusions in the center  with a deep red circle on either side. it is tilting toward me as it passes from behind the tree. it seems extremely close like two hundred feet or less , and its large. now it suddenly turned and i see four white rounded cylinder shapes sticking up from one side giving it a somewhat shape of a crown or tiara. at this point i realize that this object is not  making a sound !!!\r\n\r\ni turned and ran as fast as i could into the house to get a camera and ran out the back door to the front yard , but by the time i got out there it was gone. i so much wish i would have just stayed there watching . at least i saw what i saw  and it was the most spectacular thing i���ve

sky immediately after driving out of a bend in the road. the sighting was of what appeared to be a disk shaped object viewed from the side. the object was reflecting sunlight equally across its surface that looked to be shiny and metallic. its was wobbling on its axis which caused the sunlight reflecting on it to glint. the thing, as if knowing we had spotted it then either took off at a high rate of speed in exactly the opposite of our line of sight, or imploded/faded in on itself and disappeared! its size was that of an advil pill held at arms length at 25 degrees straight ahead on our right as we were driving east on u.S. 36 about 7 miles from urbana ohio. duration of the sighting was around 10 seconds. i thought at first that it was some kind of metallic kite or balloon. after concluding that what we witnessed was inexplicable our feelings were that of elation for having witnessed something so incredible!\r\n\r\nsomeone else had to have seen it besides us a traffic was heavy at that time and the way it was reflecting light against the blue sky made it impossible to ignore.\r\n\r\nno pictures, sighting was too short.\r\n\r\nthis craft was something real and not a

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On monday, october 17th, 2011 at approximately 7:45pm, i was traveling with my spouse on i-355 southwest towards new lenox. we were roughly four miles from the us 6 southwest highway exit when i noticed a small, extremely bright silver and amber hued light flare violently in the southeastern sky. after momentarily intensifying, it began to soundlessly plummet towards the earth at a 75-degree angle.\r\n\r\nthe light, which at first resembled a pulsating silver and amber flame, was falling so rapidly i estimated it would collide with the terrain just a few hundred feet from our car in seconds. unconsciously bracing myself for impact, i was startled when it began to decelerate, releasing four amber-hued jets or streams of what appeared to be flaming gas as it declined to an altitude of 200 feet.\r\n\r\nafter a moment of intense anxiety, i was able to discern that the light concealed a dark object, roughly disc-shaped and tilted at a 45-dgree angle so that the amber jets appeared to be issuing from its underside. \r\n\r\nas soon as i was able, i drew my spouse's attention to the disc and she began to reduce her speed to between 5-7 miles an hour. the disc was roughly 200 feet from us at this time and we were gradually approaching it from the northeast.\r\n\r\nthere was virtually no traffic on i-355 at that time and i was becoming increasingly concerned that we were alone, vulnerable and potentially in danger. i felt the onset of panic but tried to remain calm. \r\n\r\nthe amber jets issuing from the disc cut off abruptly and were replaced by a vaporous fog which enshrouded it as it as it hung suspended in midair roughly fifty feet from the ground. \r\n\r\nthe disc had become a black silhouette which did not move or sway in the wind. the fog quickly began to dissipate and the disc tilted from 45-degrees to 180-degrees and began to glide very slowly across the shoulder of the road and into the oncoming lane as if on an invisible track. \r\n\r\nas it approached it began to descend at a 45-degree angle, but did not change its axis. the descent was surreally smooth. the object did not waver or rock in the wind. when the disc had descended to about 30 feet, i suddenly felt an unaccountable feeling of calm come over me. as it neared the well-lit median, a small teal (the color is still difficult for me to describe - this is approximate) light or beacon slowly appeared under its outer lip or rim. the process of illumination reminded me of the irregular flickering of a fluorescent bulb when first switched on.\r\n\r\nthe light emanated from an object that superficially resembled an ornate cylinder lamp or lantern hanging from the underside of the disc's outer rim. it also seemed as though portions of the disc had suddenly become internally illuminated by the same unusual teal light, giving the impression of an detailed inner framework and a large window-like area.\r\n\r\n\r\nas the object continued its descent it passed between two median streetlights and paused directly in front of our car. we had slowed almost to a halt at this juncture and the object proceeded to slowly move directly in front of our vehicle. i was now able to confirm with certainty that the object was disc shaped (although observing it from its side caused it to momentarily appear football-shaped). it was roughly 30 feet in length and perhaps 9-12 feet in in height. it emitted no sound whatsoever. its surface was metallic and highly refractive like an intensely polished mirror. its undercarriage appeared to be corrugated in the light of the teal lamp. \r\n\r\nthe object kept an even 30 foot distance from our car at all times, moving silently forward as we approached it while remaining directly in front of us at all times. again, it did not rock or sway in the wind.\r\n\r\nthe disc remained in front of us in this manner for about 20-40 seconds, then slowly moved west to the shoulder of the road where it continued to follow us from an approximate 30 foot elevation and 30 foot distance for another 20-30 seconds. it then proceeded into the darkness over an adjoining field. as it moved out of the street lamp's illumination, the disc���s internal lighting dampened and gradually went out - leaving only the glowing of teal lamp to identify it.\r\n\r\nwhen it had passed completely into the darkness the disc became almost totally camouflaged, except for the teal light, which had become faint and ghostly. my spouse and i strained to observe the object as it begin to climb in elevation and pass over the (then) unfinished structure of the silver cross hospital near the us 6 southwest highway exit. \r\n\r\nas we traveled towards our home, i was able to observe the object by following the small teal lamp. i was also occasionally able to see the entire disc as the ambient light beneath it caused it to become visible. the object remained visible in the night sky for a distance of about 5 miles and a span of about 5-6 minutes before it vanished moving towards the southwest.\r\n\r\nsince this occurrence, i have contacted nuforc (just a short time after the event) - the investigator suggested that i may have seen the direct tv blimp. this seems unlikely because the object did not resemble the blimp in question, or any other blimp i have ever seen for that matter. moreover, i would be astonished if any dirigible could maneuver in the manner we witnessed. flying an unlit blimp just 30 feet above a major highway (between median streetlamps!), residential area and at least two airfields is not only extremely dangerous but against the law and highly improbable.   \r\n\r\ni contacted the faa on the afternoon of the 18th but they told me bluntly that they couldn't account for the object (i mentioned it might have been a blimp). i was also surprised to discover that the faa apparently does not track everything in their jurisdiction and that private aircraft could be flown and landed in virtually any private field without radio contact or illumination!\r\n\r\nwhen it became apparent to the agent that i was trying to report an unconventional aircraft sighting, i was referred without further comment to the private company, bigelow aerospace corporation. not wanting to waste any further effort i simply gave up.\r\n\r\ni am writing this report with considerable reservation. there are other aspects of my experience which i am not comfortable disclosing in a public forum. this experience has severely troubled me since october last year. its implications are enormous and have had adversely impacted my life, health and worldview.\r\n\r\ni am submitting this because recent circumstances have caused me to reflect further on the possible implications of this shared experience and because, frankly, i really don���t know how else to deal with this.\r\n\r\nit is my hope that a responsible member of the mufon organization with experience, sensitivity and demonstrable qualifications might assist me in finding a way to better understand what i experienced and why.\r\n\r\nfor this purpose, i may be reached at the email address included with this report.\r\n\r\ni would greatly appreciate any assistance, explanation or corroboration which might be offered. my thanks in advance.","distance":"21-100

different.  through the binoculars i realized the sun was making the objects shiny. several minutes later i observed that the sun wasn't shining on them anymore.....One was black, red and plane-like and one was silver and cigar-shaped but the other would not come close enough to observe. the 3 objects flew very slow back and forth for about 30 minutes the black one flew slowly off towards virginia.  the silver one and the unknown one flew several times around the mountain area and one even disappeared before my eyes.  then they were gone.  i waited for 5 more minutes and then i just went inside, afraid.  i heard no noise whatsoever the whole time i was observing.  there were no vapor trails but it did appear there was heat around the objects.  they were moving slower than most planes fly around this area.  we see many planes and different kind of planes go over everyday...But today was different.  i have never seen anyhting like this.  absolutely awesome and distubing at
