across the sky in different directions and then coming together in a formation, interacting, twirling around and then they dispersed and all went in different directions very rapidly...In a split second.  there were no surface to air rays that would be visible if these were spot lights.\r\n\r\ni was watching them do this for about 15 minutes and then went inside to get my adult daughter to see if she could see what i was seeing.  and she did. she went inside to get my digital camera and was snapping pictures of the objects.  my daughter then went inside for a few minutes and handed me the camera.  while my daughter was gone, i looked over the pictures she took but didn't see anything in them so i deleted them. \r\n\r\nshe came back out and we were watching them for another 10-15 minutes repeatedly doing the above.  their position started moving westerly so they were almost directly over our house.  my daughter went back inside and i stayed outside and continued snapping pictures for another 20 minutes or so.  i then went inside for the night about midnight but they were still in the sky when i went in.\r\n\r\nafter looking at the pictures i noticed an object that i hadn't seen in the sky.  it was a solid circular object with a white glow around it.  it wasn't the moon because the sky was cloudy and no moon was visible.  there were 3 pictures that were all taken at the same time (11:54pm) split seconds apart.  the 1st picture showed a solid white circular object with a glowing white ring around it.  the 2nd picture showed nothing and the 3rd pictures showed the same solid circular object with the same glowing white ring around it but it was 3 times larger and in a different spot.  keep in mind these 3 pics were all taken in the same second...11:54pm.  \r\n\r\nthe next day, we uploaded the pictures to my daughter's computer and noticed faint circular objects in the sky that were not visible from the camera's view finder.  my daughter put red circles around the objects so they were more easily seen.\r\n\r\nwe live near chicago executive airport, so i called them a few days later, described the incident to them and they requested that we email them the photos.  we did and they gave us the standard \"we'll get back to you\" but haven't.\r\n\r\nwe know what we saw was not spotlights but have no idea what it actually was.  the pictures are still on

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This happened a long time ago. i never reported it officially before but wanted to before i get too old or aren't around anymore. the time was a weekday night 1st/ 2nd week august 1969, the place, the extreme nw suburban corner of detroit mi. i was 8. it was the summer before i started 3rd grade.  \r\ni woke 3-5am to find my room lit by a soft glow. the window shades were drawn as usual, the room should have been quite dark there being only a small night light. the light was coming around the borders of the shade from the room's larger window that faced due west and looked out over our backyard. upon lifting the shade and looking out i saw the 'object'.\r\nit was intensely lighted with bright white light all over it. it's outlines could not be exactly made out due to the intense light against the black sky but it seemed to be round perhaps hexagonal. it was close, about 80 ft. from me, about 50-90 ft. off the ground and about 20 ft. in diameter. *when i was 8 at the time i didn't know how to calculate such distance/size, but we lived in the same house a long time and i had the same room, so as i got older it was easy for me to reconstruct it's size, distance, height from the same tree line, phone poles and place in the sky where i saw it from that same window (in fact the experience made me a life long careful observer always noting time/ distance/ size etc.)\r\nit was hovering and unmoving. as i looked studying it i noticed that it did not hurt your eyes despite the intense light and that there were pink hues mixed in with the white. the most notable feature beside the overall bright white light was 3 large round lights in the primary colors equally spaced in a horizontal row in what seemed to be the objects middle. i know there was red and blue and i think yellow. these lights blinked fairly slowly on and off individually. each of these lights was one of the 3 colors but not always the same color (for example the one that had been red, when it blinked back on might be blue, and the one that had been blue then blink on red). as a little kid i thought it the most amazing thing and fun to watch. there was also a barely noticeable narrow band of rotating lights in sequence, near the objects presumed bottom. these were white lights followed by dark gaps. \r\nthe object made no sound i heard.\r\nas an 8 year old i was thrilled and excited and knew it 'must' be a 'spaceship' and since it didn't seem to be going anywhere (at this time i'd calculate later i'd been watching it 4-5 minutes) that it must be 'landing' and in 'my' backyard! this made me even more thrilled and excited (little kid logic). the thing was...What to do?\r\nbeing out of bed so late (i'd never been out of bed that late before) was a really major offence in our house, and if i woke my parents and by the time they looked, it was gone, i'd really get killed. sneaking all through the house unlocking the doors and going out in the backyard by myself was out of the question. i thought of telling my sister and went to her but she was fast asleep and was always 'stealing' my stuff anyway, and this was 'my' discovery. so, with little kid logic i determined that the only thing to do was wait till daylight which i knew couldn't be too far off. \r\ni went back to bed and tried to wait, i kept opening my eyes to check if the object was still there (from the glow in the room), it was. finally i forced myself to keep my eyes closed and not look anymore to make the waiting easier. the whole experience had probably been about 10 minutes. eventually i feel asleep.\r\nin the morning of course, there was no 'spaceship', no one else had seen/ heard anything and had all been asleep, as i knew, and no one believed me! i scoured the backyard for 'signs' of my 'discovery' and of course as an 8 year old found nothing. i told all my kid friends all that summers day and by evening they were making a joke of it. my parents got sick of the story. my mom tried to convince me it was a dream or 'something i ate' and i called my parents 'stupid' and slammed my door on them which got me a whack from my dad.\r\na couple of months later in oct. 1969 then in 3rd grade we were to write about something exciting that happened to us over the summer and i wrote all about what i'd seen that night and drew a picture. the teacher said it was a good story but we were supposed to right about something 'real'. i talked back to her and said it 'was' real and she told my mom i had 'quite the imagination'.\r\ni always saved that 3rd grade paper because it was the only 'proof' i had that it happened at all.

end of beach, i left her house at approximately 11:00 pm. i was driving home along back beach road and was very close to home. all along the road are large telephone/ cable towers. i first noticed the three very bright lights that were connected and thought it must be a new/ different type of tower, or a plane. the towers blink at intervals so usually when it blinks again you can see more. i was waiting for that to happen....When i waited i noticed the three lights i was watching went away.I did not actually see them move away, they were just gone after i looked away.  because i was driving i had to keep my eyes on road so i did look away for a decent period of time. i figured the tower was probably just behind cloud cover, which was moderate. a tower blinked in the distance and i could clearly notice it was in some clouds so i knew that wasnt it. the tower was defintiely just  a single light. only a few seconds later i noticed the three light object again not under cloud cover. it appeared to be hovering, so i did try to keep track of it out the window of vehicle. we have military bases and an airport  so i was not really alarmed just seemed odd that it was so still. then i realized  it was also quiet. i turned everything off in the car, except the car itself. it was in same place, as i turned right onto alison avenue it was the closest it would be to me during my drive home. as i traveled down alison avenue it was to my left.  it was still motionless and definitely silent. i lost sight of it again as i stopped at red light and turned onto front beach road, i never spotted it again \r\nit was definitely three different very bright lights that appeared attached to each other, the middle one was red, the outer ones were yellow. they appeared extrodinarily bright and seemed as big as an aircraft. i was tempted to pull over on alison but i was a little frightened. as i got into my neighborhood  i briefly stopped by the front door and looked up to look to spot it again but saw nothing, and was not going to keep looking cause i was creeped out. i have no idea what it was, but it seemed weird to me. i have told no one not even my husband. i definitely believe in the possibility of the phenomenon and life elsewhere, so coming from me they would just think i was telling a tall tale. not to mention i have no idea that is actually what it was.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

radio towers near the barons on the horizon and while looking at them, noticed something green and what appeared to be the same size and height of the radio tower lights.  my initial reaction was that one of the light's shell must have shattered and the light was arcing.  as i continued i began to notice the object was appearing larger to me and realized that it was traveling toward me, maintaining it's altitude, which i guessed as approximately 500 - 1000 feet.  as it got closer to me i pulled off the highway and parked, turned my engine off and rolled my driver window down.  i could clearly see the object was emerald green in color with gold sparks emanating from all around the sphere.  because of the proximity of the local airport, the characteristics of the object and it's apparent flight path, i thought i was witnessing a small aircraft that was on fire trying to make it to the airport to land.  there was absolutely no sound from the object.  i watched the object maintain it's

the west heading south-west. \r\n\r\nafter it passed over the apartments i ran out to the front and continued to see it ascend over i-35 and into the low lying rain clouds. it was all black in the back part and looked flat there unlike the sides and cone front which were white with 7-8 glossy light navy blue window trim with the window part white too. a design in the same blue color was observed on the larger front window but i couldn't make it out. the best i remember it was a zig-zag type like a lightning bolt of some sort. \r\n\r\ntwo blinking lights one of the front and one on the back part. i remember red and green and blue lights blinking.\r\n\r\ntwo long antenna one top and one bottom with blinking colored lights on the top and bottom.\r\n\r\nthere were many lights around the complex and other complexes and it helped reflect off of the craft and was very visible to see because of this fact.\r\n\r\ni have seen blimps up close and they are real loud with their propellers and this craft made no noise at all. it did not wobble or appear to be swayed by the breeze, but make an intended straight line over the complex and i-35.\r\n\r\nalso, no undercarriage for a crew and passengers was ever noticed like a regular blimp and no rudders at the back also. \r\n\r\nwe viewed it in the back of the building about 60-70 yards away and it was only about 40 yards off the ground and looked about 30-40 yards long. we saw it at an angle going south-west.\r\n\r\ni have wondered why the craft had the antennas on the top and bottom and after thinking about it thought the most practical reason is that it uses them for sensors and markers since the large silver metal power lines were just feet below these antenna. my guess is they are retractable and that explains why i never saw them on any cigar shaped ufo on google image search.\r\n\r\ni will download the picture to you tomorrow from the sketch i took just an hour after we saw this object.\r\n\r\nyes, i have

scary...","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

was in deep shock after what i saw, i believe in god, but couldn't believe that i saw this,i wasn't alone. that night my mother told me to call my brother andrew in it was late, and he had been rebuilting an engine for several hours in the back yard. i notice some stobe lights in the sky and decided to look to see what was going on, it was a clear night. all of the sudden i was paralyzed with fear when i saw a spaceship disklike acending from the sky hovering and stopped directly above me. it was purple silverish, and spinning clockwise. i called to my brother to look but my voice was being controlled and i couldn't yell loud enough to get his attention. i kept looking up and said i must be dreaming and is this for real,this cannot be happening. all of the sudden it was closer but still far, and i could see three red lights changing colors to yellow and red in a triangle shape. they communicated with me telephathicly, telling me it was my time to be abducted. they were going to take me, but i ,strongly refuse to go. finally after 10 mins, they i knew there was more than one creature, they sent me images of them in my head. the saucer started spinning faster and they slowly moved around the sky and then in hyperspeed like starwars ships do and took off into space. then my brother looked up and it was too late. i ran to tell my mom what had happen,she said i was crazy and if i reported it i would end up in the mental institution. so i kept it to myself all these years except to my husband. \r\na year ago my husband was suffering from sleep paralysis. he gets frozen and held down by creature like things in the bed. sometimes they are holding his legs and arms towards the celing. he cannot move, breathe, or call out for help. sometimes he was levitated and moved in the room. he was being dragged out the front door once and woke up in the bed screaming and believing he was awake the entire time. this would happen for a few months. he would  also wake up to sounds of explosions. one day the nosie woke me up too. i was panicing. he had a dream we were being watched by aliens, grey creatures. he still sufferes severe headaches since and me too, like we never had before. and a year ago i had a terminal illness, which is completely gone now. the sleep paralysis is gone too. \r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

watching the sky at night. i had observed the same pulsing/strobing star that floated over my neighborhood that weekend,  now in the distance on several occassions. however, last night i saw something different. i observed some flasing lights over my treeline and called my boyfriend out, who also observed them. we then lost sight of them, so i went around to the front of the house to take a look. at this lime i saw an orange ball moving through the sky. it did not blink or make a sound. i watched it come across our entire block, but then it went behind a tree and never emerged on the other side. at which time we noticed an airplane in the direction the ball had been heading. we eventually went back inside, but i kept popping back out to check the skies. at one point i saw a flashing light dancing around the pulsing star that was in the distance. i called my boyfriend back out. the single light was then joined by two more flashing lights and they danced/flashed around for a few minuted until they lined up in a straight line directly below the pulsing star. this alignment seemed to cause a reaction in the star object of a bright red strobe. the small lights then moved off in seperate directions and disappeared. the pulsing star object became more distant.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

of a boomerang. the craft was between 500 and 1000' in the air. it came at our area from the south west and headed toward the north east. when it was over head i could hear what sounded like 5 or 6 jet engines and they made a loud roaring sound. my wife tried to grab the camera but it did not want to work. then my cb radio started going crazy getting louder as the thing went over us. the lights on our truck went dim and almost died out. when i noticed this in the air i tried to raise a friend of mine on the cb but could not get anyone.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

its lights swirl around and around i began walking towards the east when i looked quickly around to see if any one can be a witness  and no one was around i looked i looked back at the area that the ufo was and it was gone completely vanished with absolutely nothing for it to hide behind so i was upset that i turned away and didn't get to see it leave, i looked all around and then looked straight up to ursa major and saw a tiny star looked to be out of our atmosphere traveling slowly without lights blinking it kept a continuous whitish dim light glowing traveling from above me to the north and then  2 army jets side by side split apart and drifted away from each other both going to the east coming from the west looked as if they were searching then 2 more army jets further apart one came from northwest other from south west both did the opposite to the 1st set of jets as they came closer together as they traveled east i started feeling very dizzy and a little sick no jet went north as i don't think any one could have saw it traveling north unless they were looking from outer space so i started going back inside my home when i felt like i was going to be sick i got inside an puked in the bathroom it is now close to 4am i i can't shake the feeling that im being monitored and i just seen something go by my window
