part of town and see if we could see any lights that we have been seeing for the past few weeks. it was around 2247 hrs and i started to look in the sky toward town, we were all looking in different directions at the time. after about 5 minutes of not seeing anything i decided to smoke a cigarette and that is when i noticed on the horizon approximately 1000' up a very bright orb moving at a fast pace above the trees, i said for everyone to look where i was looking and they noticed it also, while looking at the one that was off to the north of us i turned to look in the opposite direction and noticed that there was a second and also a third object in the sky above us. the second one was closer than the first. this one was triangular shaped and had three very distinct lights that did not flash or strobe they stayed on the whole time that this was in motion the other two were round in shape. whatever the objects were scared the life out of my service animal. after watching these objects in the sky i noticed in the distance that there was a few military aircraft that were on a path to intercept the objects. we were all awestruck when we saw these. my wife and i have been watching the lights in the sky at around the same time every night in different locations. i am not willing to give up the location for fear that the wrong people will try to step in and say that we are not seeing anything but \"weather balloons\" or something to that effect. my dog was poking her head out of the window of our truck and started to whimper and shake really bad. enough that i had to comfort her and let her know that everything was alright. \r\nwe lost sight of the three objects when they went lower than the horizon and we saw the military going after them.\r\n

some reflective object in orbit such as a large satellite/etc. roughly 5 to 10 seconds later the object (very) suddenly accelerated away at a high rate of speed and became fainter and fainter. as it sped away i could track it for only about 5 seconds before it was too faint for me to make it out any longer. i witnessed the same thing about two weeks prior at about the same time of day while looking at the stars in the east, except that one started out completely stationary. it believe it was only by dumb luck that i happened to be looking right at it when it began to move. neither object appeared to have red, green, or white strobe lights characteristic of the other aircraft often seen flying through our airspace, and the rate of acceleration appeared extraordinarily conspicuous. i have no training as a pilot and little astronomical experience, but i do not believe these were any mundane objects entering the atmosphere, nor do i believe them to be any conventional aircraft due to the fact that the first object initially appeared to be (relative to other stars) stationary, and they both accelerated away. both sightings occurred during clear skies. i used nearby stars as well

between 12am and 1:30am on june 9th-10th. i had been looking into the sky for hours when i noticed a brilliant orange light hovering over the sand dunes to the north of my position. it hovered, unwavering, at a 25 degree angle, very low in the sky. it was at least 5x brighter and larger than any star in the sky. since i have been to the san luis valley many times before, i knew there were no towns or a population of any kind in the mountains where the object was hovering and have never witnessed such events, whether viewing stars, planes or otherwise. \r\n\r\nafter approximately 10 minutes, perhaps a bit less, the object disappeared. shortly after, it reappeared a few miles from its previous position more toward the san luis lakes area. it moved very slowly and deliberately toward the sangres, and took about 3 minutes to travel across my field of vision and out of my view over the mountains. as it moved, it remained silent and a steady, brilliant orange color. as it neared the mountains, i noticed 3 distinct 'wobbles' in its pattern, like a bobber in water - all of the characteristics of this flight was beyond anything i had ever seen before. i tried to take a photo of the object but, mysteriously, my camera would not turn on for about 30 seconds. i was finally able to snap 2 photos using the same exposure and shutter speed as previous photos i had taken that night, that inexplicably came out completely black. of the 100+ photos i took that night and the next day, these are the only photos that did not turn out.\r\n\r\nshocked and still trying to process what i had just witnessed, i sat staring at the sky in the vicinity i had seen the object when i noticed movement over the sangres. at first i thought it was a satellite, since it looked like a star, but it moved much too slowly. i then noticed 3 more objects, identical to the first, flying in a rectangular formation, all completely in sync. after about 1 minute the objects reached the ambient light of the moon and i lost sight of them. a minute later, another identical object followed the same path as the 4 before it except this one had a light that flashed brightly in my direction every 15 seconds exactly. it reminded me of a lighthouse beacon - the beam hitting my vantage point every 15 seconds as if it were rotating. i followed this object  until i lost sight in the light of the moon, as well. all objects traveled from north to south along the sangres and i viewed each of them for approximately one minute. i sat and watched for the next hour for more activity, but saw none.

years old. sitting and watching it i could see the sun reflecting off the side of the object that we were facing. it appeared to be closer and above the hospital area. and moving in in many different

same height a helicopter would and at about the same speed. however, it was close enough that i would have been able to hear a helicopter and most likely see the shape of the body. i could only see the light and there was no sound. the light was bright and -for lack of a better word- twinkling. it was not like a searchlight beam. i watched it for about 15 seconds before i lost track of it behind the trees. the path the object took (from the point i first saw it) was a smooth u-shaped arc coming from and then returning to a northerly path.
