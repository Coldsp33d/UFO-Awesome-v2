roof.  i was looking up (about 75 degrees off the horizon, and roughly due n-ne) when i noticed a redish light that seemed to fade in to my field of vision between two stars. i immediately thought it was a satellite until it got very bright and began to travel north.  it dimmed down fairly quickly(after 2-2.5 seconds or so), then changed into a light blue color(1-2seconds).  it continued it's motion and faded to black.  \r\n\r\n      i said aloud to my girlfriend \"what the hell is that thing?\", and pointed in the general direction i saw it disappear.  she began to look the right direction as it began to glow red, fade to blue, and disappear again.  we watched it for about a minute before it began to head in a more n-ne direction, always pulsating the same color pattern, but the intervals between it disappearing and reappearing weren't evenly spaced apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n    we continued to watch it for about 2 minutes, and it seemed to be growing much smaller (although it wasn't relatively big to begin with) until it just seemed to fade to black for good.  we were both slightly shaken from the underlying excitement of seeming an anomaly that we couldn't logically explain away.\r\n\r\n\r\nwe went inside to fetch a video camera just in case, but it did not return after about an hour of watching for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nit is worth noting that we live under somewhat trafficked airspace (austin bergstrom intl), but when i saw it appear i had a clear view of the sky around the area and it did not seem to fly into my field of vision.  if it had, where it was coming from/where it was headed isn't really facing the airport to the best of my determination.   just kind of faded
