13th,2011 at 12am.\r\n\r\ni saw a red light to the east and dismissed it as a helicopter. \r\n\r\ni work in aviation and know this is a typical route for med evac choppers heading northward to uk. \r\n\r\nwe continued southward and noticed the light getting closer, but, still payed no mind. \r\n\r\na while later a truck caught up to us and followed closely for a few minutes. \r\n\r\nafter a while it passed us in a big hurry.\r\n\r\nthis caused us to look around to see what was going on and a business jet  sized aircraft (100ft x 100ft x 100ft)was heading towards us very slowly moving westward roughly 50ft above the ground. \r\n\r\nit was black and had a pyramid shape, was not square, but triangular on the bottom.\r\n\r\ni'm not sure if it was fear or not but we slowed down to nearly a stop so it would pass ahead. the craft than averted it's course and stayed true towards our vehicle.\r\n\r\nonce the ship was directly above us we could see a glowing red / yellow orb in the center as well as slightly smaller red lights on the 3 pointed edges.  it also had small blue and white rectangular lights that flashed in a pattern once it was directly over us (almost like it was scanning our vehicle)\r\n\r\nmy wife attempted to video the ordeal with her phone, but, was unable to get it to work.\r\n\r\nluckily we were in our 92 honda accord which has an engine that is not as computer based as a newer vehicle. i firmly believe it would have stalled the car.\r\n\r\nthe ship never made a sound while hovering directly above us (approx. 15 mins) \r\n\r\nit then slowly moved to the southwest and took about 15 mins to appear to be the size it was when we first saw it. it than right angled northward towards the stars.\r\n\r\nthe event lasted nearly 30 minutes and spanned from nicholasville to lancaster.\r\n\r\nwe phoned some friends who traveled ahead in another vehicle to see if they saw it as well.  \r\n\r\nthey did not see it since there was an hour of time in between our departures.  \r\n\r\nwe didn't get home until around 3am which was an hour later than we should have, even with our slowed trip. we are still unsure about that.","distance":"101-500

orb-like ball of light. it was the same color as the deep-yellowish-orange street lamps (but ever so slightly more yellow), but definitely not a streetlamp because it was high in the sky. it just disappeared. intense, bright orb-like light flickered out and vanished. there was no blinking lights that i could tell (like any earth-bound aircraft). the fact that it simply disappeared is what

camp. i knew there was a meteor shower occurring that night and over the next few nights. after dark, i think it was around 10:30, a group of us decided to go out to the amphitheater right next to the lake for best, unobstructed viewing on the scout reservation to watch for meteors. it was a warm, clear, cloudless night. we saw a few meteors but then, out of the south, southwest, a small whitish-green object came from the horizon over the tree tops on a straight path toward the north, northeast. as a scout, i had seen plenty of night sky objects in my years of camping and at first thought it was a satellite; it was about the same size and brightness and traveled along an approximate north-south, straight line at a constant speed just like every other satellite i have seen. however, things changed as soon as it got directly overhead, nearly at the center of the sky from our viewpoint. it came to a dead stop. of course, at this point, it got our attention. there were no flashing lights as one might expect with conventional aircraft, no sounds, nothing. the object seemed to be at a very high altitude so we weren���t scared but just kept watching in amazement. it remained at the center of the sky for a moment or so and then began to vibrate wildly, back and forth, side to side, in circles, all while remaining in the relative center of the sky. these movements lasted no more than a few minutes. then, almost instantaneously, the object zipped to the north-northeastern corner of the sky, swelled to approximately 5 times its size (to my eye, the object was first the size of a large star and swelled to approximately the size of a tic-tac), turned bright red, and shot off to the northwest faster than anything i have ever seen. these movements were so fast, they were almost unbelievable. as i have told this story over the years a few times, i have attempted to convey the speed at which this object moved. the only way i can come close to describing it is to use a laser pointer to replicate the objects movements on the ceiling of the room i am in while telling the story. \r\nafter the object shot off, we all discussed what we had seen but mostly our comments were, ���did you guys just see that too?��� and ���what the hell was that?��� we all agreed that it was not a meteor that we had seen performing such radical flight. being young teenagers, it didn���t seem to bother us that we had no idea what we had just seen in the sky and we decided to stay and continue to watch the meteor shower. about 5-10 minutes later, we noticed another object similar to the first unknown object appear on the horizon to the southeast. it was moving to the northwest at the same, constant rate of speed as the first. we thought, this time, this object must be a satellite. a moment later, yet another object appeared on the horizon opposite and began to move to the southeast and it appeared the two objects were on an intercept course. as the two objects approached each other, i felt nervous; it began to dawn on me that if these were vehicles not of earth, there might be a chance they know we are watching them. i don���t know if the others had the same feelings ��� we were pretty silent at this point, i guess in near disbelief of what we were observing. as the two objects nearly met, they stopped at the center of the sky in almost the same spot that the first object had stopped. then as if as a means of communication ��� or at least that is what i have always thought was going on ��� they began to move around each other. it was like a dance. one would be still, no movement at all, and the other would go around it in circles so fast it was unbelievable. as i stated previously, the only way to accurately communicate what i

pointed them out to us and we watched them move across the horizon almost overhead (toward ne?). they flew in tight formation, but there seemed to be some slight fluctuation in their closeness to each

group of three. then followed another 2 or 3. some of the objects dimmed their lights when they got close to overhead, but could still be observed flying across the sky. they were absolutely silent,

in regard to tonight, i am ashamed i did not post my sighting sooner.  i must tell you, now, that i saw the same red orb, from new mexico, where i live.  yes, it was in the southern or western sky.  i live seventy miles north of santa fe.  i am looking out beyond the horizon, into the sky, and i see this red star, but is it a plane?  no.  it does not seem to move.  i see a plane to the right flying far above it to the left.  i have no reason for fright, but i feel a chill. its real!  what is it.  it remains still.  it is an intense red object, smaller by far than our moon, but about the size you would expect from a planet.  this is to me, half the size of a dime, in the sky.  it is round, glowing, and stands out clearly.  i have looked at this section of sky continually for three solid years from the same vantage point.  this is an object which has never before appeared.  i do believe there was some movement, that it may have dropped, and it may have made some chnge to the right, but unlike other objects i have seen in my life, this object did not dance, make sudden movements, or fly away rapidly.  it remained.  i admit a fear of it, as i sensed it knew of my presence, and more, that it had called me outside, to see it.  i heard a splash of water, and thought there was a visiting dog, taking a drink from a pan of water, i left outside, earlier in the day, for another, neighbors, dog.  i went outside to greet the dog.  it was not there.  i looked up into the low horizon, and i gasped, to see this deep red glowing orb.  yes, my friend, this is not a coincidence.  i was fortunate to talk with a friend a few hours ago and after.  i went to their place to see if they could see it.  they are a half mile away.  they could not, nor i.  their place is a bit lower on the landscape, than mine.  we are at or about at 7000' above sea level.  it was low on the horizon as you said.  my house is fairly high oa hill, so i saw it on the horizon, a few inches above the horizon.  my friend and i talked about 2012.  could this be nebiru?  it is mentioned by the mayans and is expected, and it's return is marked by a 243 year event, known as the venis transit across the sun, and connected to the last annular eclipse.  the venis transit was june 5th.  i now feel this may not have been a ufo, but a planet, if that is possible.  scientist refuse now, to acknowledge the planet.  lets see who else saw this event.  blessings.  love and light to you.  by the way, i went to hb high school, in 1977.  how's that for synchronicity.  now is the time, the hopis have told us about.  blessings, one and all. the exact time of the sighting may be recorded on twitter, @queerwire.  i wrote, omg, i just saw a ufo....Omfg!\r\nyours in truth.  a reliable witness.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path then
