was suprised with the detail.  you can see the solid shape of disk with some type center structure. you can also see some transparent tenticles.  when you look at the series of pictures (that were

pictures yesterday to capture the behavior of animals on our farm during an eclipse for my blog i do on farmlife.  about 15 minutes before the full eclipse i was taking pictures of my goats.  i have a special setting on my camera that does artsy shots.  so, i press the camera once and it takes four pictures in rapid succession in different stylistic forms.  when i downloaded my pics today i noticed in one of my shots that had four different interpretations of the shot spanning about 1/100ths of a second intervals - an object in the sky high and smaller.  there were no birds flying at this time...As we had all noticed much earlier.  the animals including our chickens and turkeys had all gone to lay down.  then on the next picture the object had moved a vast amount and was larger but looks to have dropped about 300 feet directly downward.  it was shaped like a disc.  so, the odd thing is in the series of four camera shots, the first picture didnt have any object, then picture two and three both showed this disc like object and the fourth picture didnt have it at all.  so when you look at these two pictures side by side that were taken 1/100th of a second apart, it had moved a huge amount.  in the first pic that has the sphere it is tilted at an angle like it is going downward.  in the second picture it has decended  what is probably 100s of feet in the sky and the disc is now horizontal. in the pictures i sumbit below please note that they are stylized differently i.E. you can see clouds in one and not the other as that was the artsy thing the camera does...It makes the picture color or black and white.  but i wanted to point out that file 1 was the first shot of the two where the disc was higher in the sky.  file 2 the disc had dropped near vertical to much lower in the sky.  for your reference, i also noticed in other pictures wierd orb like object in the upper left to the sun the whole day......It turned pink and could even be picked up through when i took pictures through my solar glasses covering the camera lens.  i dont know what that was either.  those are files 3,4, and 6.  you actually see the mass type energy ball that i am referring to in the upper corner of the picture of image 4952 somewhat higher that the black disc.  i have no idea what this stuff is as none of us saw any of this with the naked eye.  and the one picture through the solar glasses that was put in front of the camera...You see that energy ball in it too.  so there are really two things baffling us, the black flying object and then that mega energy ball sphere that was above the black object and is seen in all pictures to the left of the sun/eclipse.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

to fill the liquid in the back of my truck i was just sitting starring up at the mountains because they were so pretty. i noticed an object come out of a cloud and then go back in. at first i thought it was bird but then i saw it come out of the cloud again and stop in mid air and slowly go back into the cloud. it did this about 3 times. on the fourth time it came forward out of the cloud and i can see that the bottom of this object was a dark color like a shadow underneath. that is when i observed a second object come down out of the bottom side of the cloud. and they both in unison went back into the cloud. that is when i got out my iphone 6 to film this. when filming i couldnt see it happen again. nothing coming out of the clouds so i was disappointed that i did not capture it on film. but when i got back to my office i sat down and watched my .55 second film and i did indeed capture the phenomena but above and to the right of the cloud. it was 2 white ords that seemed to flicker a little one was for sure brighter than the other. the both came together and seperated or at least seemed to look like they did because when they came together as one for a split second it got brighter then dimmed. then i watched them circle each other and seperate by about a few hundred feet then stop and come back together and become as one and the seperate again. one went sout the ther seemed stationary then my video ended. i would have kept filming but i was looking at the cloud and not the area where the phenomena happened so i thought i didn't capture it. i do have the video on my iphone still but to see the orbs you have to pinch zoom with my phone to the section where they are. i was in shock. this was about 3 hours after the solar eclipse.I would attach the video but i

was aware that the vulcan would be flying over or nearby i positioned myself at the top of an outdoor single flight of stairs on a two storey temporary building where i thought i might get a decent view of the plane and i waited with my iphone 6 ready to record . i was not disappointed as shortly after the vulcan flew over the power station . the second it came into view i began to record it . it more or less flew straight over my head . i stopped recording after it went out of my view because the building behind me was in the way . a small tracker plane was flying nearby the vulcan to my left . later on , after work , i sat down and watched the video . where i had stopped it there was a black spec . i was annoyed as i thought i had captured a bee or something and it spoiled my video . i made my mind up to crop the video later on to remove the 'bee' . i zoomed in to look at it and discovered that it wasn't a bee. no legs or wings and if you look closely right at the end of the video you can see the object flying along at great speed . it appears to be a saucer type object with a dome shape on top as the zoomed in stills show . i did not see this object fly over when i watching the vulcan . i honestly think i would not have seen it with the speed it was traveling at.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

a bright lite low in the eastern sky traveling due east at a slow rate of speed, thinking it to be an airplane with reflected sunlight.  after probably 2 minutes, it became clear it was not a plane and puzzled over the possibility it might be the space station.  it then changed direction due west.  as it got closer, i could make out a craft which appeared at first glance to be a helicopter.  as it drew closer, it was a tumbling boxlike craft with a framework structure and the ever present well defined bright white light, either on the side or the bottom.  it was like a truck headlight with brights on. the craft suddenly changed direction reaching higher elevation. still in traffic, i turned to a side street, trying to get my cell phone out of my purse, but it was too late.  it was then just a bright white light, ascending in an erratic pattern until it reached a hovering height, side to side that made it almost impossible to see.  i watched for a possible change in height, but it
