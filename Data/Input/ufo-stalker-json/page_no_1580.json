degrees from horizon. i was using my telescope in my backyard on a saturday night, looking at some stars with three other bystanders. as i was looking at random things, one of the witnesses told me, \"hey, what is that bright red thing over there?\" i looked at it (with my eyes) and it was a bright red dot looking thing and it just stood there at 35 degrees from the horizon on the north side for about 20 seconds and then moved slowly to the left (west) and suddenly changed direction to go up as in altitude and then vanished into thin air. all four of us saw the whole thing. what made us notice it was that it was as bright as an airplane light but a deep red color at where no airplane was seen or heard and i looked at my ipad after it vanished at an astronomy app at the recorded time and no satellite crossed its path, no airplane, meteor/meteor shower, or planet/star/comet. there was no change in feeling/attitude of all four of us except we were amazed by this finding. of course we did not lose sight of it, it just vanished slowly. the object was located about an acre away north from my house. when i first saw it, i thought it was a satellite until i checked my astronomy app at the recorded time.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:00:40","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

uncompaghre national forest in colorado. we live only a half hour but decided to stay for only one night. everything was fine during the day, there was nothing abnormal at dusk either. when night finally fell (around 9 o'clock in colorado) we were laying in the tent without the rain fly on so we could look at the stars. the conversation was casual and suddenly we heard a pack of coyotes. they began howling not far from us and then began to scream. it was a sound that i had never heard from any animal even while hunting and spending time outdoors. it lasted approximately 30 seconds and then stopped abruptly. moments after, we both saw a bright flash just above us as though you would see from a digital camera although it was extremely concentrated as though something had just taken off. a few minutes later the first craft was observed near the tree to the right of us. it appeared slowly and then grew brighter and dulled as it moved across the sky until it faded away after hovering. the final craft was approximately 15 minutes later and again appear right above us, lit up so that you could see the border on the ship and the 3 main lights in the center. we watched it move across the sky for approximately 10 seconds before it disappeared in the blink of an eye.\r\n\r\nthis area is so secluded and at such a high altitude that there is little aircraft interference that you witness. the crafts did not blink as an airplane nor behave accordingly. we heard the coyote screams twice more in the night before fading into nothing. i am surprised there have not been more sightings. we were both completely sober and very aware of what we saw. it appears as a simple sighting but never in my life have i felt such terror in those moments that we witnessed the objects. we both wanted to leave but were honestly too afraid to leave the tent or move inside of it never the less grab and pack all of our belongings that were spread around the camp sight. the rest of the night i heard footsteps and we both felt nausea and stomach pain and i experienced a long lasting headache.","distance":"Over One

down my phone accidentlally took a picture of the sky when i noticed what it was i stood up and took another pic in the same direction it revealed a trail of some sort. when i first saw the photos i didn't know what to think but there really wasn't anything to distort the pictures. it was about 2:00 in the afternoon and the sky was clear and it was very warm out. it looks like a blue orb of some sort. i did not see anything with my naked eye it was only visible via my pictures.
