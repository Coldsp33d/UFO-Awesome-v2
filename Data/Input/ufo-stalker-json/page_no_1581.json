chemtrail activity, so when i started to see dispersants being laid, i decide to take some photos. as i took the first photo, i noticed something else whizzing past the plane ... at a much faster speed than the plane itself. what was most interesting is that it simply looked like a round ball, but in sync with the object was an orb trailing, almost parallel to the metallic object, but not close enough to be attached to it ... it was more like the orb was closely following this object. in my vision i could see a chmetrail heading directly away from the earth, almost as if it was going towards the atmosphere at a 90 angle ... in addition, were two passenger planes, so i could tell that the ufo was not a plane, as i had actual planes to compare it too. the whole sequence lasted about 3 -  5 seconds. i tried taking a photo, but i'm not sure i caught the image. i was using a cellphone camera, and after uploading the images i was able to capture during my very shaky and frazzled encounter, i'm not certain i caught anything. what puzzles me though is that my cell phone, which typically snaps away, started to freeze, and at one point somehow took a photo of the ground ... but i only ever had the camera pointed in the sky. i know the image appeared to be, from my perspective, about the size of an aspirin sitting on the table in front of you ... but nothing of the image appears in my pic ... although all of the other planes in the sky do appear. the shape of the image is what initially caught my attention ... almost a perfect sphere, but what really got my flustered was seeing the orb trailing it. the orb is what convinced me that this is indeed a ufo. the orb was white/yellow and looked somewhat transparent/translucent. it differed in speed but maintained a cloe proximity to the ufo. i wonder if anyone else saw it. i can send in the photos that i took of it ... but i'm not certain they show anything, although image enhancement may help? the problem is that the location of the image is simply blue where i remember the ufo/sphere to have appeared. i've highlighted the images with white for the normal plane, blue for chemtrail planes and as the ufo/orb got closer, it looks like they only refelcted light, but they move across the bottom of the sun as you can see in image 3 the white and blue spots are in one position, and image for they have moved ... i need a better camera. this was my first daytime sighting ever.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path

the wall and there was a quick flash of dim, greenish white light that came up from the floor, which was hidden from my view. ���i then got a glimpse of the top edge of what looked like an amoeba-like, semi-transparent creature,  ���i quickly lowered my head and the creature was hidden from my view but there were furious energy waves coming up in that corner of the room. the waves looked a lot like the ones you see over the highway, when driving in the desert on a hot day. ���i decided to take a good look so i popped up onto my right elbow, very quickly, and got a good face-to-face look at the entire being--for just a second--and then it disappeared and there was a slight rustling of two or three of the vertical blinds that cover the sliding doors which open onto the patio. i got a good look at the blinds swing a few times right after they made a tiny clattering noise. ���it all happened in probably two seconds: ���\r\n*rise up and look,���\r\n*disappear,���\r\n*clatter,���\r\n*swinging blinds.���\r\nincidentally the sliding glass door was securely fastened, so if the disturbance in the blinds was caused by the being's exit, it went through the glass like it wasn't there. ���today there is no damage to the glass.\r\n\r\nappearance:\r\n��� ���flat, like a fried egg without the yolk in the center. rectangular, but with a wavy border--again like a fried egg sometimes looks. the border is thicker, like on a pizza. the size is approximately 12\" wide and 18\" tall. ���it had visible objects scattered randomly inside it, sort of reminiscent of vacuoles in a cell. ���the objects ranged from 3/4\" to 1\" and were whitish to dark green--but���diffuse, since the creature was translucent, not fully transparent. ���the inside area of the being was dimly lit almost like the light a night-light puts out. ���my opinion is that everything of the creature that was visible was seen by light emanating from the being itself--this theory is based on the fact that as soon as the creature disappeared that corner of the room was nearly pitch black.\r\n\r\nmy conclusions:\r\n\t���\t��� ���these creatures seem to have the ability to switch their bodies from matter into pure energy or spirit, instantaneously and at will.\r\n\t���\t��� ���they don't seem to have any malicious agenda because i have had hundreds of similar occurrences since 2010 and have never suffered anything other than jangled nerves a few times.\r\n\t���\t��� ��� i need to re-think my earlier conclusion that the many nighttime visits i have experienced were merely holographic projections and there was no physical component to them. ���one might make a wild hypothesis that creatures such as last-night's visitor are the ones who are projecting the holographic-like images. ���\r\n\t���\t��� ���i am convinced that there is a connection between these light shows and the ufo presence, since, on two different nights, ���i have seen multiple triangular craft hovering high above my apartment building during a series of these nighttime visits.\r\n\t���\t��� ���i have no conclusion on why i can detect the same kind of energy waves, described above, emanating from my finger tips--to one degree or another--at any time of the day or night. ���the most logical theory would be that everyone has the same energy but that these visitors have given me something that allows me to see it. ���but logic seems to go out the window when dealing with these matters. ��� (sorry, mr. spock.) ������\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

was traveling alone in my vehicle... tonight (june 8, 2012) my husband was with me in the vehicle and he witnessed this sighting.\r\n\r\nwe were traveling east on m-55... we turned north on sand lake road.  about a half mile north of m-55, on sand lake road (at 10:01 pm), i looked east (out the passenger window) and saw a ball of light in the sky (60-70 degress off the horizon).  i asked my husband to \"look\" at what i was looking at, and he immediately pulled over to the side of the road, turned the engine off and jumped out of the vehicle.  he wanted to find out if there was any sound coming from the object. there did not seem to be any noise coming from the object, but within seconds of the engine being turned off a car coming from the other direction drove by... by the time the noise of the passing car was gone the object in the sky was further away from us and we could hear nothing coming from it.\r\n\r\nmy first impression was that it was stationary in the sky, but upon stopping (the vehicle) i relized that it was moving very slowly... it appeared to be moving away from us (heading east). it was a bright, clear, ball of light that was so very \"out of place\"... it was the only light in the sky...  there were no stars (or moon) visable, there was heavy cloud cover, and it had recently rained.  this object was moving below the cloud cover.  my husbands first impression was that it was a light from a radio or cell tower... but it was too high in the sky, there are no radio or cell towers in the area, and it seemed to move away from us very slowly once we had stopped the vehicle.\r\n\r\nwe both agree that the object was a solid ball of light that changed colors from dark red, to light red, to orange, to yellow, with an occassional flash of a white light... all within the solid area of the \"ball\".... there were no fuzzy edges... it was a crisp, round, solid ball of light...\r\n\r\ni would describe the light changes as a random sequence of colors, not necessarily fading in and out, just a continuous color change with no pattern... it was not pulsating and the color changes did not seem to be in any squence or in any pattern, however the white light did seem to be more of a flash or strobe, and the white light was in addition to the color... the \"ball\" was never solid white.... \r\n\r\nmy husband first thought it was some type of remote control plane (since he flies rc planes, this was his logicical thinking), but he was not able to hear any noise coming from the object...  and his first impression of the color changes reminded him of a chinese lantern floating in the sky... with the occassional white light being a glimpse of a flame. he then described the color changes as a bright light with a colored flag wavering in front of the light...\r\n\r\ni must agree... \"wavering\" is a good way to describe the color changes.\r\n\r\nwhen we first saw the object it was about the diameter of a straw (if you held a straw at arms length)...  when my husband got out of the vehicle, i rolled down the passenger window and grabbed my cell phone to take a picture... at this time the object was moving away from us (and seemed smaller)....  the photo i took shows not only the cloud cover, but also a power line just above the object.  the photo also looks as if the object has a \"tail\" which is not what we saw with our \"eyes\".....  i then got out of the vehicle, but my husband asked me to get back in so we could turn around and go back to m-55 to follow the object which seemed to be heading east.  the second he turned the vehicle around, the object vanished... we had watched the object for approximately 2 to 3 minutes   we continued back to m-55 and traveled east for a few miles hoping to see the object again, but we saw nothing....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering

light, and immediately thought it was a bright, weird looking airplane flying kind of low. after looking at it for a few more seconds, i noticed 2 more of these lights, and they all formed a triangle. at first, i tried to make sense of what i was staring at - synchronized planes, helicopters, fireworks, etc. but nothing i've seen ever looked like this before. i couldn't believe what i was looking at - the lights were so bright for how far away they were, and all 3 lights were moving at the exact same speed in a triangular shape. it then it clicked that i wasn't looking at 3 different objects, but one 'transparent' triangular flying object with these bright lights at each end. i say 'transparent' because you can usually see the outline of objects flying in the sky that low, and when i focused in the middle of these three lights, it looked like every other part of the sky - no outline or anything.\r\ni then called to my wife to come outside ('immediately!') and she ran outside and saw the same thing. we stood there, with my son, just watching this thing fly off into the distance over the horizon. it came from the north-east and headed south-west, but more south than west. the

because it was moving and was a pinkish red color.  it was partially obscured by a tree in the yard.  it was moving from the northeast to the southwest.  when it emerged from behind the tree, i looked at it for a second trying to figure out what it was.  it made absolutely no sound and was moving at a constant speed, too low for an airplane, plus it was shaped like a football with rounded ends.  it wasn't moving nearly as fast as an airplane or helicopter would be at the altitude and distance from which i observed it but it was going much faster than a blimp would have been able to go.  i ran down the west side of the house to our backdoor to get my wife to see it.  by the time i reached the back door it was passing over the tree line on the west side of our house but you could still see it through the trees every now and then.  by the time my wife got out there and we ran to the tree line to watch it, it was already several miles away but still visible, still pulsating and still on the same straight line course.\r\n\r\nmy wife went back in and i went to put up the dog.  about 15 mins. after the first one went over a second one came over flying the exact same flight path but higher in altitude.  this one looked more star shape and rounder than the first,but was the same pulsating color.  i got my wife and we both watched this one as it crossed over the back yard and disappeared over the western treeline.  we both had a really good look at the second one.  it was on the exact directional path as the first on only higher in altitude.  it was also silent,too low for an aircraft, also no blinking lights, and also at the same rate of speed.  there was no wind, no clouds and the moon wasn't up yet.","distance":"101-500

do with ufo's, or anything related to same. even as i write this, the hair on my arms wants to raise. i know i saw something either way ahead of our technology, or something very secret! from now on, i will be watching the skies!
