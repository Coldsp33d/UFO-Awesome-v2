i screamed to my boyfriend, who was also amazed by these lights, \"that's a f@#%ing spacecraft, dude!\" he ran to look through the telescope and was in complete agreement that it was not anything he'd ever seen before! it was a diagonal line of lights, at one end, a steady green light. at the opposite end, there was a steady orangish light - in the middle were 3 erratically blinking white lights and in between the white and orange lights were distinctly smaller red flashing lights. my boyfriend and i were quick to get outside opinions, we yelled for my roommates who were also astonished at the sights of this craft-like object. we all watched for over an hour as this craft slowly hovered from left to right and saw a single orangish orb of light which appeared to dock with this vehicle and quickly drift away. between 11:30 and 12, a large/bright white star-like object was also visible coming from that direction. we all watched as it ever-so-slightly drifted across the sky and over our house. we all ran outside to watch this light drift through the sky and slowly out of sight (northeast). as for the craft-like object, it was visible for about another 30 minutes and was drifting from side to side, which was clearly visible from the telescope and even visible with the naked eye. i was also able to record a video of the flashing lights through the telescope with my phone.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":39032,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.7199028,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06082012-0056","longitude":-74.0001531,"occurred":1339052400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New York","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1339217782000,"summary":"Diagonal string of flashing lights hovering in sky - orange orb docks. star-like object drifts across sky.","tags":["lights","flash","hovering"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"New York, New York","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:170"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Stafford","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On or about august 2nd, 1962, i and seven members of my family observed lights in the shae of a \"v\" appear in a portion of the sky about 75 degrees above then cross the sky silently and make a sharp turn (randomly with each crossing)  and the disappear. there were multiple v shapes which performed this way at various starting and ending points in the sky. at the highly of this display there were at least three or four shapes performing this consistently.  the entire anomaly took about 10 minutes to complete. \r\ni was 10 years old at the time, the youngest person to witness the event. several adults also witnessed this event with one still living. other adolescents can also verify my account.\r\nafter all these years i wanted to offer this first hand account for review and recording.
