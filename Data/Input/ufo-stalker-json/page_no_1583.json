minutes before i decided to take out my telescope. when i pointed it at the blinking lights, my heart literally stopped! i screamed to my boyfriend, who was also amazed by these lights, \"that's a f@#%ing spacecraft, dude!\" he ran to look through the telescope and was in complete agreement that it was not anything he'd ever seen before! it was a diagonal line of lights, at one end, a steady green light. at the opposite end, there was a steady orangish light - in the middle were 3 erratically blinking white lights and in between the white and orange lights were distinctly smaller red flashing lights. my boyfriend and i were quick to get outside opinions, we yelled for my roommates who were also astonished at the sights of this craft-like object. we all watched for over an hour as this craft slowly hovered from left to right and saw a single orangish orb of light which appeared to dock with this vehicle and quickly drift away. between 11:30 and 12, a large/bright white star-like object was also visible coming from that direction. we all watched as it ever-so-slightly drifted across the sky and over our house. we all ran outside to watch this light drift through the sky and slowly out of sight (northeast). as for the craft-like object, it was visible for about another 30 minutes and was drifting from side to side, which was clearly visible from the telescope and even visible with the naked eye. i was also able to record a video of the flashing lights through the telescope with my phone.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

of speed. we both asked each other at the same time ,do you see that? as it got closer i slowed almost to a stop thinking it would hit us, i swerved towards right hand side of the road hoping to avoid contact but just before it got to us it disappeared. we were no more than 20 feet away at that point. the sighting seemed to last about 15 seconds. we saw no visable meens of flight, no wings, no windows, no doors, no welds, no rivets, it was dull and almost a well used silver metal, looked like mercury. we both thought it would hit us or the ground in front of us, but it just simply seemed to vanish before our eyes. the craft was about 60 feet in length and 12 to 15 feet thick. it was a clear day about 4:30 in the afternoon. we both sat there for a few seconds in stunned silence. after arriving at our destination, about 1 mile away we relized it had taken 14 minutes longer to get there than it should have taken. my friend wanted to ask around at farm houses in the area if anyone else had seen the object, but i was a buisness owner in the area and was afraid that may not be the best idea. i do not know what we saw that day, but we were not drinking and were both clear headed

dull star and then disappeared. the moon was to my direct right during the sighting and on the same longitude as the object. i can only guess that perhaps the light of the moon may have hit a

orange-reddish glowing orb coming from the soutwest.My wife spoke first asking if that is a helicopter,i said no i do not see any blinking red and green lights or any sound(i grew up and lived for 27 yrs. less than 2 miles from hopkins international airport and have been observing aircraft my whole life.)the object was on a straight trajectory toward the northwest like a satellite but appeared to be below the clouds.(my wife and i spend many summer evenings observing satellites and have observed the iss and space shuttle and this was much brighter than either).We continued to observe the object travel on it's trajectory until it went behind some clouds, at that point i noticed and brought to my wifes attention that the moon(which was close to full) cast a shadow on the clouds and, the shadow was a perfect circle. at this point my wife and i are trying to figure out what we saw by ruling out all possibilties. my first thought was a satellite because of the straight trajectory, but this was brighter than any satellite either of us have ever seen.Next we thought that possibly it could have been a meteor but i have never seen one that bright that did not have a trail(i have been an amatuer astronomer for over 30yrs. and have observed every astonomical phenomemoan there is).Then i suggested space junk entering the atmosphere but we did not witness any breakup of the object like you would expect from a stallite rentering the atmosphere.My last thought was that it was the spaxex falcon9 coming in for splash down but when i looked it up online i found out that the splash down was 2 days prior.Our only explaination would be a bright satellite we did not know of or an unidentified flying object.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

4000 foot range. it was traveling roughly south to north and i was traveling east to west. it was not moving too fast, and its speed seemed to stay consistent. after a min, maybe a little more, it was in the field of view directlt in front of my, when it seemed to darken out. it just kinda went from shiny metallic to a shadow and gone. i continued watching the area for another couple of minutes where i last saw it and the path it was on, but i never noticed it again.\r\n\r\nthe object itself seemed maybe cigar shape and as it came closer to center of my view, it was more like a cone, wide at the back to a point in the front, front being direction of travel. the wider back seemed to have more reflection than the front. i never did see anything that appeared to be wings or any other identifiable marks. we do have military and personal aircraft in the area frequently, but i don't feel this looked like the planes i'm used to seeing. with the cloud heights and the position of the object, i suspect it was about 1 mile from me line of sight and no bigger that a 737, possibly smaller. commercial flights in this area would typically be much higher.","distance":"501 Feet -
