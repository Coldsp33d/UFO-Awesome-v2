own, the light was extremely bright, then dimmed out all of the sudden, you could still clearly see it, just not as well. for example if at its brightest it was a 10, it dimmed to around a 3. then it came back to a 10 and stopped moving for about 1 mintue. then it started to move again, for about another 5 minutes it didnt dim, just moved in a directional path. the object then went back to a 3

a commercial airplane with ensuing vapor trail heading westward and almost simutaneously noticed another object heading eastward that did not resemble anything i've ever seen before. flagstaff az is roughly 50 miles north of my location and was in the general direction i was looking when i witnessed this. to put into perspective, i was looking at something far enough away as to get any detailed visual confirmation but close enough to make out a definite visual confirmation of the airplanes fuselage and the outline of the tail section. when i first noticed the unidentified object, it seemed to be stationary then started to move what looked like from my perspective, toward the commercial airplane. whatever i was looking at was disc or cigar shaped with a very bright metallic like glare coming off of it and looked larger than the airplane. i wanted to grab a camera and get a picture of this but at the same time, i didn't want to miss anything seeing that the object, and the airplane, seemed to be very very close to each other in proximity. what happened next is the part that turned my stomach.......It vanished right before my eyes. the hair on the back of my neck and arms seemed to be standing at full attention. all i kept muttering to myself was omg...Omg...Did i see what i really think i saw? did anyone else see what i just saw? i am a sky gazer during the night and day.I hope to get pic's and or video if the opportunity ever comes my way again. i've been waiting 20+ yrs to see something along these lines. the day may have finally come!

midnight). i was walking our dogs with my mom and we heard a weird noise and saw something in the sky. we thought it was a helicopter at first but the shape proved that innacurate.It was a long cylinder shape and it moved slower than an airplane. the color seemed to blend in with the sky , as if it was almost camouflaged, we could in fact see the outline of the object. it had a red and green light on the front and came right at us and did 4 roundabouts each time coming right at us. its flight path was east then it did a turn and headed south,than west directly toward us, after getting close and going directly over our heads it would turn north, then east, then south and onto west toward us. i felt like it could see my mom and i and was headed right at us. i had no idea what it was and i just stood there frozen. i felt like it knew we were there and was specifically coming round in circles towards my mom and i. it circled and came directly at us a total of 4 times, one right after the other. i had a horrible feeling inside me.I felt afraid but was in such shock and so curious. i thought there had to be a plausible explanation. after all this isn't the first weird flying object i've seen near my house before. after the 4th fly by it went off into the distance heading northwest.  i don't believe in ufo's but i cannot explain what i saw. i never heard of a cylinder shaped ufo so i went inside the house got on the computer and looked up cylinder shaped helicopters. the results i received were cylinder ufo's . upon looking at the images i realized it was exactly what i had seen. i wish my phone wasn't dead inside the house at that time otherwise i would've tried to somehow capture it on camera, but even so i was so frozen and felt so weird that taking pictures wasn't even on my mind at the time.Perhaps its just the government testing new technology.","distance":"21-100

find or open a portal or doorway of somekind to leave our planet.  it was having a problem in trying to open up the rip (that half of the other part of the ship was in) and finally after 12 to 15

board (our sky).  i know it sounds nuts but this is exactly what i witnessed!  the power and technology to do this must be extremely great like something out of science fiction.

camera. the first craft was seen in the distance flying in a strange zig-zag pattern. this object was photographed, but at a low quality. the first witness and i discussed the object and thought it was strange as we had seen other objects in the area that resemble no known air craft and behaved in a strange halting then speeding up fashion, like pumping the brakes on a car. i said it was strange and thought nothing more until two minutes later the first witness ran back to me and told me to come to the window. that is when i saw a spot in the distance that was a purple,green,white,and orange strobe light. the object appeared to be going away from us but changed direction and came directly towards us. it seemed to know we were there watching. we had shut off all the lights to get a better view but it still seemed to know we were watching it. we watched the object come into view as a tadpole shaped craft with two antennae (one longer than the other) on the right side and a smaller one on the left side. the object came within 50 feet of us but it was moving at a rate of speed that no air craft i have ever seen. it was a metallic surface that was like the color of mercury and behaved in a strange fluid motion. it had four window like openings on the front that resembled the lenses of a fly. the craft flew over our garage and was in full view of our outside light, it seemed to come within inches of hitting the phone lines and light-pole. we were trying to take a photograph but our camera would not function properly, it had been used previously with no issues. our dog was acting very upset before the incident started, that is one of the reasons the first witness was up walking in front of the windows. i felt an almost metallic feeling in my body, partially out of fear but it was a strange feeling like i had a magnet inside of my body that was being pulled towards this thing. the other witness reported a similar but more intense feeling. she states that she was being drawn to look out the window. this object looked like a metallic tadpole with three spindly arms. after it almost hit our light it vansihed. it didn't go off into the distance it vanished without a trace. we pondered over it, thinking of all the explinations that we could. we would have been able to hear a plane or helecopter out of the windows but it was silent. this shook us up a bit and i have reported to you before and thought this was the most impressive thing i have ever seen. i hope this is detailed enough for you.
