recently i can't stop looking at the night sky. since the last sighting on the 28th of may, i have seen 4 steady lights traveling across the sky but nothing to interesting. but, this sighting was just as odd as the 28th. the 1st object was a steady dim light traveling from the west to the east. when facing north the object was about 70deg from the horizon. it came into view and traveled in a straight line until no longer visible. it crossed about half of the viewable sky in about 2 min. this object was very high poss. outside of our atmosphere. as soon as i lost sight of it i check my phone for the time. it was 10:14 \r\na few minuets later i saw a 2nd steady dim light traveling south approx. 45deg from eastern horizon. it was also very high alt. it was visible for about 1min before i lost sight of it behind some trees.\r\ni observed a 3rd and 4th at 10:28. around 50-60deg from the northern horizon i saw a stationary bright flashing light and another light flying past the flashing light. the flashing was brighter than any star, and seemed timed. there was prob 1 sec between several flashes. the first flash in the series was brighter than subsequent flashes. the passing object would start as bright (not as bright as the flashing one) and dim along its path until it would disappear then would reappear further along its path bright again. it did this 5 or 6 times covering most of my viewing area. its path also seem to have a slight curve to it. the 3rd or 4th time it reappeared it looked like it was either double or maybe dropped something. meanwhile, the flashing one flashed several times after the other had passed it faded out then reappeared a second or two later on the path of the one that had passed it and did another series of flashes before disappearing again.\r\ni also saw several planes during this time. the last object that i saw appeared near a plane. the plane was prob around 30k ft heading east. the object may not have been close to the plane, poss. much higher. it was due east 40deg above the horizon and moved nnw for about 2 min before i lost track of it at 10:59.\r\ni could see the marker lights on all the planes even the ones i believe to have been around 30k ft with the naked eye. i tried to use a pair of cheap binoculars but could not see any faa required lights on the ufos.","distance":"Over One

grey, transluscent and it looked like there were things inside of it, but we couldnt really tell what.  there was no noise and it was just floating or hoovering at the edge of my apt. building and it was approx 12 to 15 feet, i supposed in diameter.  then it appeared to be moving slightly towards us, so we got scared and ran into the apartment.  ever since then, we have had some extremely strange happenings inside of  our home, with shadows and light, even feeling something that we couldnt see, entering our bodies that would cause our heads to be extremely heavy and sometimes pain in various spots and every time we leave someplace, one of the bright stars, that are still outside of our apartment complex, follows us, and will come down quite low.  i keep feeling like there is something implanted on the inside of my back now, that sort of moves around.  on a friday night at the end of march, my daughter and a friend of mine had seen what appeared to be a floating lantern sort of hoovering in tree that's on the neighboring property and it also looked almost as if there was some sort of creature inside of it, but was not making any noise as it hoovered.  we didn't really have the time to investigate, so we just ignored it and continued on with what we were doing and that was at around 10:45 pm, along the fence line of my carport.  i have hesitated to say anything, but this has become an ongoing nightmare and there doesn't really appear to be anyone from the government that you can report these types of things to.  my daughter will not leave my side!  i hope this helps

of halo of light surrounding it in the shape of a circle. after watching for maybe one second i realized that it was moving towards my left (north). my boyfriend had his eyes on the light as well. he didn't have his glasses on so he couldn't see it as well as i could but he could tell that it was moving. i thought it may have been a plane as i continued to watch it since i live relatively close to the richmond airport as well as the hanover county airport, but tried and failed to find the usual flashing red and blue lights or at least hear the engine.\r\n    suddenly, the object stopped moving and the circular halo of light around the object seemed to become squished into more of an oval. my jaw was dropped wide open and my eyes were probably as big as they could have gotten. it quickly decreased in sized and seemed to be moving up and diagonally away from where i sat at maybe a 130 degree angle to make a rough estimation. it went from a substantial and easily visible orb of light to the size of a pinhole in an unreasonably rapid rate and disappeared into the sky.\r\n    like i said, my boyfriend did not have his glasses on at the moment but he could tell that the light that he'd

few weeks that i have seen something odd in the sky of saskatoon. the first time i had went for one of my late night drives, which involves an ice cap and loud music not ufo hunting at all. when i decided to go home, after getting out of my vehicle i felt this scary feeling so i hurried to my back door to find it locked, that's when i decided to look up and there right above my yard and a very tall spruce tree was this bright white star like object hovering with a weird path(it could be a satellite) but this was really big and bright and looked like it was in our atmosphere. so i watched it for a few seconds then i unlocked my door and went in to get my room mate. he came out but we had to run to the front because we could not see it past the trees. the front of the house was worst but we could see it moving through the trees still at the same pace so i decided to run out back again and get in my car, and i drove fast down the alley way to the street near by which has a big clearing of most of the night sky but nothing! it was gone so i drove to 8th then to the university bridge and still nothing. \r\n\r\nstory number 2 just happened tonight, i had taken one of my late night drives  and ended up going into the wood lawn cemetery. usually i park in the fields just past the cemetery to collect my thoughts and as i was sitting there looking at my face book this scary feeling came over me again, so i looked up and around and i noticed this bright star or so i thought in the sky above the industrial section of saskatoon. so i am thinking ok this is clearly just a star its changing colours like other stars i have seen but then i thought but that's in the winter time so i looked at it again and it was gone. so i left the graveyard i still had that scary feeling the whole time, and after going for a short ride around the west side i ended up parked in rotary park by the river. just as quickly as i parked i got that same creepy feeling again so i looked out my window and there was another of those bright white star like objects and this time it seemed super close, i didn't know what to do so i watched it as it seemed to hover towards me and i got this feeling like it was checking me out. then i turned towards it with my car and it jolted and started to hover towards broadway/8th street, during this time i tried to videotape it but was to shaky, though it's on there but still hard to make out. so after it started to get dimmer i decided to follow it only to lose it again. never found it again. \r\n\r\ni am starting to think that perhaps i am being followed

us navy base in vieques, p.R. about 15-20 years ago. although for some reason(maybe the language barrier) little has been informed to the public about it, this area has had a fairly large history of ufo and alien activity. this activity was concentrated and has been recorded to had happened here more during the years that the us navy operated and had they're base facilities here. it is said that many people who were there at some time during those years observed and witnessed several unexplained ufo and alien beings encounters. this eye witness reports were people that included civilian security personel, local police officers, us navy personell stationed at the base there, and civilians from the island. it is known that some of this unusual encounters and incidents were recorded and entered into official records by the us navy people. and also that this records became us government \"classified information\". vieques is a very small carribean island and part of puerto rico a few miles south-east of the main island. the us military occupied 3/4 of the whole island for over 50 years until around the year 2004 when they ended operations there. they had two military bases there, this particular one on this story was the us navy on the west side of the island. and it was a location were navy stored naval ammunitions for the atlantic fleet. you can see vieques and both od this the military bases there that were feautured in clint easwood's movie heartbreak ridge (1986). my brother was working as a civilian patrol security guard there when he had this encounter. he recalls that on this occasion, him and a security guard partner were patrolling doing they're rounds around this very remote area on the hills on the base facilities area. and while they were at at one of the ammunitions storage magazine warehouse, they spotted in the distance a very unusual craft(ufo)hovering in the air over this remote beach area. my brother in total disbelieve became very inquisitive about what he was observing. and talked to his partner about wanting to drive down to that area to take a closer look to see what this thing was. but his partner seemed to be full of fear about it, and did not wanted to drive down there to get any closer to the object. my brother observed that this thing hovering in the air over that beach was emitting all this very unusual colored-lights and that is was something like he had never seen before. and he could not explain to himself what that thing was. but whatever it was, it did not appear to be like something out of this earth. he did not wanted to go alone down there closer to that beach area to investigate what that thing was. finally he was able to convinced his very frightful partner to join him and drive they're 4-wheel drive patrol vehicle down there and take a closer look at it. according to his description of the account, they drove down from this hill area down this remote beach 4-weels trail and stopped the vehicle a little distance away from where the craft was still hovering over the beach. and he got out of the vehicle mesmerized observing all this wierd display of colored lights comming out of this hovering craft. he went back into the vehicle and brought out this spot light with him. and then he began to flash like signals to this craft. at this, it sounds like the craft noticed they're precence nearby. and inmediatly turned and began hovering and approching them at a very fast speed until it came to a distance right above they're heads. and even with both being so frightened by this, they observed all this lights comming out of it and then like a light beam began comming out from the bottom of the craft at them. inmediatly panicking and back inside the vehicle they managed to peel away and make a run down that trail away from that thing for dear life. and they kept going until they got back to the base buildings area. and this story is one of the several others ufo/allien encounters that had occured over the years on this area in vieques, p.R.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

jets, helicopters and military aircraft are very common.  in fact, there were aircraft in the area during both sightings.  the first light did not have any blinking collision lights. the light was slightly higher than the jets coming in for landing at the san diego airport; but still pretty low.  there was no noise.  the light had passed over me and then was about where the 8 freeway would be below it, and then, the light just turned off.  there was no overcast this evening.  this was interesting, but if that was all i saw, i wouldn't have filled out this form.  then at 10:18pm, a single semi-transparent light flew by faster than any jet has ever flown by.  i could see it less than 4 seconds.  this light was dull white and it almost seemed like i could possibly see through; but i could not.  it flew in a straight line and very low, almost at the same elevation as the jets coming in for the final landing pattern at the san diego airport southwest of this location. this dull white light was traveling southwest to northeast with no noise.  it flew low, in a straight line and was totally silent.  (if there has been coastal fog or overcast, it would have been below that level.)  this light did not turn off like the first light but i lost sight of it only because it was blocked by buildings. every jet or plane that passes by at the same elevation as the second light, or even much higher, can easily be heard. this second light was totally silent.  this was not a meteor, i have seen many meteors.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:04","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":38935,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.7499833,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06072012-0006","longitude":-117.1639438,"occurred":1339046280000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1339064468000,"summary":"One slow white light and then one semi-transparent white light traveling low and very fast","tags":["light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"92103","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"San Diego, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:2203"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Florence","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This am i had gotten my walk with my dog in and she barked at the door shortly after aggressively i went out and she was still on leash she immediately looked up at the sky i too looked and we saw a round bright white yellow light no flashing lights with it. the light headed south east over our heads it stopped for a second or so and then continued i watched as clouds came in just shortly behind it making the same pattern as the light. also noticing that the moon was never covered by the clouds during any of this time when we went for our walk it was clear starlight sky. i was able to guess the hight by it passing the tree in my back yard. florence oregon.June 6,2012  4 :44 am normally not light out at this time this was an exceptionally bright am","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":38934,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.991069561036284,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06072012-0005","longitude":-124.07213367579493,"occurred":1338983100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oregon","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1339057607000,"summary":"Huge white yellowish light flying south eastern clouds following its path","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"97439","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Florence, Oregon","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:2204"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Saco","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Me and two other friends were on our way to a movie in maine coming from massachusetts when my friend in the driver's seat noticed the object in the sky. his cousin in the back seat and i drew our attention to the object and watched it until it disappeared. it was in triangle form and had white lights on the outer edges and one blinking red light in the middle bottom part of the craft. we all assumed it was a ufo since we couldn't figure out what kind of craft it could be and my friend is a pilot so he would have known. we were pretty close to the movies and watching the time closely so we have an accurate time that we witnessed this. we just thought it was cool and decided to look on the internet to see if anyone else saw it and ended up finding this website.
