december of 1969 when i saw a ufo huvering only five feet off the highway.  there were two cars on the sholder of the north bound side and three cars on the south bound shoulder.  i stoped and watched as this beautiful crome colored craft with light of  red and green going counter clockwise around the middle of the craft.  one third of the top half of the craft appeard to be mirrored glass because of the light smoke gray coloration compaired to the metalic part of the craft.  the bottem half of the craft had a vented extention of about one third the diameter of the width.  this extention was what appeard to be the motor part of the disk.  the lights moved around the black belted area in the middle with one light bright red the next was clear pure green, one light was white and it roated around with the other lights but came around only once every six to eight seconds.  i along with all the other witnesses watch as the craft houvered then rotated by elevating on the west side to about 45 degrees and climbed above the trees on the east side and leveled above the rail road tracks where it stayed for thirty to forty seconds then rotated and went to the exact same place over the highway where is stayed motionless for thirty to fourty seconds then rotated on its east side and climed to the west of the highway.  it leveled and remained there for the same amount of time.  the craft went back to the position over the highway and repeated the manovers once more just as before.  this time is leveled over the highway remained there for about fourty seconds and tilted to the west and moved slowly to the west between the trees.  it changed to about sixty to sixty five degrees and started moving upward to the north west.  it started slowly increasing speed very smoothly but in a compounding increasing speed until it climed out of sight in the stratisphere in about three seconds.  the craft made no nose of anykind that i could dectect.  it has been a long time and now that i'm older i will tell my incounter.  it was an experance that i will not forget.  as far as i know none of the people who witnessed this has ever come forward.","distance":"21-100

the photos. however, the object is round, not 80%. the object changes direction, whereas the moon would follow a path. the object is below the horizon in some of the photos, whereas the moon can't go in front of trees. i can't explain it.\r\n\r\ni am attaching the consecutive photos downloaded from my game camera. because there was a small tree, approximately 1\" in diameter in front of my game camera, over a 2 month period, it took over 6,000 photos every time the small tree moved. therefore, i deleted most of the photos, which were many photos of nothing. there were a fair number of photos from deer. no hogs. some crows. as i stated above, if that is the moon, i can't explain why it changed directions and went below the horizon. the trees in the distance are a planted pine plantation, so the moon should be hidden or partially hidden when it is behind the trees. out of the 6,000 photos that the game camera took in that two month period, the attached photos are the only photos that have this object, which may be the moon or may not be the moon. what i can't do now is look through the other photos that i deleted to see if the moon should have been rising in that direction at a certain time, for comparison.\r\n\r\none thought is that it could be from a helicopter, but why would there be a helicopter flying in this area, which is a clear-cut area of a pine plantation at 3 am? also, why would a helicopter be there, hovering for 40 minutes?\r\n\r\nalso, someone mentioned that it could be dust on the lens, but dust would not be illuminated by the flash, so it can't be that.\r\n\r\nthe photos are titled grand marquis because i have the back seat of a grand marquis in my hunting

satellite.\r\n\r\nthe sighting:  what i thought was satellite pulsed a very bright white light and then dimmed to be totally unoberservable. a few seconds later, the light again pulsed and the object has moved some distance from where i had first seen the object.  \r\n\r\nthe pulsing of the light was totally periodic - it was not chaotic or random; it had a period of maybe 5 seconds.  between pulses, the object was totally and completely unoberservable.\r\n\r\ncnsidering i thought as first it was satellite, the altitude had to be extremely high.  size could not be estimated.  \r\n\r\nthe sighting lasted for a few minutes as the object travelled to the south. and then, about 45 degrees from my vantage point, the light simply stopped pulsating, and the object as stated before was again unobservable and that is how the sighting concluded.\r\n\r\nfinal note: the direction was north to south, but the flight path started to change at towards the end of the sighting, as the object then began to travel south-east.  satellites don't do that.  \r\n\r\nthe light (when pulsing) was much too bright to be a satellite, it was more like a bright star.\r\n\r\ndefinately not an airplane...

neared (around 1:35 pm). i notice a sea gull and a jet and what appeared to be another jet but, upon further observance, noticed it looked more like a cross between and jet and a bird. it was west of my position and moved very slowly to the north. it appeared to be several miles away and several miles high. the day was clear and i could see the jet at 30-35,000 feet with an obvious vapor trail. the \"wings\" appeared to reflect some of the sun light, but not as a pure metallic reflection. more of a hybrid metallic reflection. it moved very slowly as a jet would appear to move. i glanced away and back again and it was still there. i thought i'd get my phone out and take a picture or video, but when i looked back it was no where to be seen. i looked for several more minutes and then decided to go back into the office.\r\n\r\nwhile eating lunch inside i couldn't stop thinking about it so i went back outside and sat in my car looking for the object again. i saw two more jets with vapor trails over the next 15 minutes. then i decided to go back into work and i got out of my car. then i saw it again. this time lower in elevation but in the same general location. it appeared darker than before but i knew it was the same object i saw previously. it was large and difficult to see...Almost invisible. i watched it for about 10 seconds trying not to take my eyes off of it. they started to water and i wiped them. it was still there not really moving in any direction. i reached for my phone and searched for the camera function. when i finally launched the program and looked back for the object it was gone. i sat there for another 20 minutes but was unable to spot it again. it is nearly 3 now and i am going out to observe the venus eclipse and search again for the
