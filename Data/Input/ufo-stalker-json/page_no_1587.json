(2years older) all about what the little people talked about.. i told him how the little people talked without moving their mouths.. his response was how could any one talk without moving their mouths and that i was a big liar.  i tried to explain to him that it was like bubbles came out of their heads and when the bubbles burst i could hear their words...My family seemed to act as if i had a big imagination. eventually as i grew up when i recounted the story as a funny story i made up as a child. when close encounters of the 3rd kind came out i was very excited to see the show. when the little people came out of the ship i got very excited and before i thought about it i was saying out loud... oh my god it really did happen.. \r\ni did observe from the movies little people that the eyes of the little people seems to be wrong...   \r\ni will say that one time when i was in my 30s that i was with a group of people that had a guest speaker that researched ufo's and other events such as personal contacts and i tried to share some of my story with him. he asked me what color their cloths were and as i tried to tell him i heard myself tell him their cloths were silver... i knew that was wrong but that is the only word that would come out of my mouth.  after that he just dismissed my story..  until i met glen means i have never talked about the little people to any one that i thought might be investigating the other people as i have come to think of them.  my encounters with the little people have never been a negative experience and i have as a grown up felt protective of them because of the negative prejudices humans have for each other let alone what i felt would be even more horrific to the little people.  why am i sharing this now... i'm not 100% sure except that as an older woman with more life experience i feel there surely must be other people out there that  have had good experiences with the others (little people and more) i feel it is time and suspect the time for humans and the others will be meeting more often and i hope that we can meet and greet in a positive way in spite of us humans.  well there it is ... i hope this gives courage to other humans to share their stories and help the humans that live in the fear to know that there are others out there and here and we will come together in a positive way if we as humans choose to do so.\r\ni am not discounting any persons experience that was not a positive experience. i am just saying that they are not all negative and there can be open communication with out fear.

something truly anomalous. my mother and i were at an evening bat program put on by the rangers at carlsbad caverns. around 8:30, the program ended and the cars left the parking lot. we waited until all the other cars were gone (maybe around 8:45) and it was getting dark before we left. we were the only car on the road as we made our way back into carlsbad (route 180)on a two-lane highway. around 9 pm, i noticed a bright white/yellow orb about the size of a basketball (perhaps larger) approach the car from the behind (it followed the road, but approached rapidly). the light stopped very close to the bumper (there was maybe half a car length between us and the object). i at first thought it was a motorcycle and i thought it was weird that they were so close to the bumper and that the person did not try to pass us since there were no other vehicles on the road. the object followed the car at the same speed for a minute or so when i decided to roll down the window. there was no sound other than our own car (no loud motorcycle engine noise either). at one point, my mom turned on the brights of our car and a smaller light underneath the larger orb appeared as she did so (it was rectangular and yellow about the length of a pencil). a few moments later, a car approached in the other lane with its headlights on. my mom turned off her brights and the smaller light under the object \"turned off\" as well. i waited for the headlights of the approaching car to illuminate the road behind us so i could see if this was a motorcycle. just as the other car's headlights were about to light the road where the object was, the orb dimmed quickly and was gone. the lights of the approaching car clearly lit the road, but there was nothing behind us: no motorcycle, no car, nothing. there wasn't anyone on the shoulder (which was actually lined by cones) and no one was in the other lane. it simply vanished and was not seen again. the light appeared to reflect off the road and it was bright, but not blinding. i could not see it attached to any vehicle. it traveled smoothly and followed the road. it was only a few feet off the ground as it was clearly seen out the back window of our suv. the time was now about 9:10 pm. we both thought it was weird and neither of us could explain where the light went and what it was. to this day, i wonder about it and have had a few other sightings here and there, but this was the first one of something that i can only describe as \"odd.\" i've told one to two people about this, both of who laughed in my face. i toyed with the idea of submitting this for a while because i don't want to freak out over something that might not be significant after all. at the time, i felt calm because i thought it was a motorcycle. as the incident progressed, i felt uneasy and curious. i still wonder what it was.","distance":"20 Feet or

just south of da nang, vietnam.  i observed a red dot 70 degrees above the horizon moving south to north in a very straight line.  since no one in his right mind would fly with any lights on in this area i assumed it to be a space satellite.  with nothing better to do, i continued to watch the \"satellite\" for about a minute.  at about a 60 degree angle to the northern horizon it suddenly just stopped!  it then back upped and made a perfect counter clockwise circle around a star.  when it reached the exact point that it started the circle, it shot in a general direction toward the star (about 15 degrees to the right of it), going from the red color to green then yellow,  so fast that it seemed to be in three places at once.\r\n\r\nthe night sky was extremely clear, no moon, no ground lights or flares, and although the sky had more stars visible than i have ever seen, this particular star was in a region of space with no other visible stars near it.\r\n\r\nconsidering how spectacular the sighting was, i assumed that dozens, if not hundreds of people must have seen it also.\r\n\r\nonly recently did i see the documentary  \"the universe ~ i know what i saw\" by james fox and did an internet search to see how other people reported the sighting.  when i couldn't find anything even close i realized the mistake i made 44 years ago by not reporting

overhead:  almost like a t, with the longer t-bar at the trailing end of the craft.  although not spectacular, the sighting was curious and mysterious nonetheless. \r\n\r\nmy husband, who's a ufo skeptic, also witnessed these aircraft with me.  the basic shape was reminiscent of a plane, but there were no wings along the center of the \"fuselage\" - just small winglike appendages at the leading edge of the craft and a larger wing-type shape at the rear, more or less in a \"t\" shape.  these craft few together, one tailing the other slightly offset, heading north out of sight over the hills and presumably over the west part of the city of boulder.  each time we heard planes the rest of the day, we looked to see if the ufos were back, with no luck.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

chinese lantern, which is what we thought secondly) and appeared to be flame lit from the bottom.\r\nthey continued to fly into the easterly direction out over the ocean until we could no longer see
