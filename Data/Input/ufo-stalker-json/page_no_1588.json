abduction one telepathic, 08 the year 2008, 09 the year 2009. \r\n\r\ni am about to turn off the lights, and go to sleep, it was a good, day at work, a good evening at home. i did not have the usual stressors from my emotions or work related issues. it was a calm and ���connected��� evening.\r\ni turn off the light and no sooner as i hit my head on the pillow i was taken from my home in what felt like an immediate whirl wind.  i was taken to what appeared to be a remote area on a highway. i looked beyond the horizon and saw it was evening. but it appeared so bright around me. \r\ni am standing on a highway with what i can see is a house to my right, and a tree in front of me. they seem bright, and the street lane below my feet. i then look up and see a large ufo hovering above me, i was prettified. its outer shell was very white like bright as if glowing. it had some other lights underneath it, blue, red, and yellow-no sound. i am scared my heart is racing. \r\ni look to the right side of me and there is standing a male figure, hybrid reptilian being. he looked half human half lizard. in a telepathic message he says ���someone wants to meet you.��� we walk left towards a red van. the window is open, another hybrid in the van, he says ���this is jayson, my heart is racing, i am in the space of fear, looking up the ufo craft follows our every move as its now over us and the van-no sound. \r\nthe being looks at me and says telepathically, ���if you love nature so much why are you destroying it.���\r\nafter he told me this i was back in my bed-disconnected from the experience. i attempted to re-engage but it was my own human fear that broke the connection.\r\nthat was in 2008- his first message:\r\n1-\tif you love nature so much why are you destroying it.\r\n\r\nsecond visitation 2009-non- abduction-telepathic engagement:\r\nthis time again i was preparing for bed, when my brain felt as if it was ���tapped into���, it was jayson i knew it was him. i asked him ���where are you,��� he said in a craft near by. i felt distinctly i was not to be taken again due to the extreme fear i had experience during our prior experience.  he reported he came back to finish what he wanted to tell me in 2008. \r\ncase report file #0208-09\r\njayson���s eleven points of wisdom.\r\n2-\tlove god with all your might all your soul, we love god too.\r\n3-\tothers may not come in peace.\r\n4-\tyou are descendents of another race.\r\n5-\tthey are jealous of us because there are more of us than there of them.\r\n6-\tthe reptilians are more advanced we come in peace.\r\n7-\tall disease is created in the mind, thought of in the mind.\r\n8-\tthe cure is in the mind\r\n9-\tgod is evolution, he creates that���s all he does, and everything else creates itself. there is no sin.\r\n10-\tyour bowel movement is important for the physical body.\r\n11-\tyour crops are dying over harvesting is depleting the planet\r\n���the jews were not chosen. we encountered them in the desert, they accepted our teachings. they became children of the ���light��� because they accepted the wisdom taught to them.���\r\nthis was the last i heard from him. i do not know or clearly understand all of this, although he did give me reasoning behind each statement.  after our last encounter, i woke up one evening to a large luminescent orb over looking my bed. it was a little bigger than a basket ball. it hovered, bright light, then in an instant it shot left out of the window- it was closed.
