outside the cape town city bowl area.\r\n\r\nmy ex-wife and myself were busy working in the garden and our property normally allowed us the most amazing sunsets between the table mountain and lion’s head towards camps bay.\r\n\r\nthat evening it was totally clear with no clouds and we enjoyed the last of the sun’s rays as the sun set...... and once the sun was gone, we were just finishing off when i glanced towards the direction between the mountains. there was still some after-glow from the sun – but what really intrigued me was this very bright disc or orb floating quite some distance out to sea. at first i thought it might be a large balloon reflecting the sun...But the sun had dropped way below the horizon already.\r\n\r\nthe orb seemed multicoloured but somehow moving and because of the distance, i thought it was my eyes that were merely playing tricks on me....So i ran into the house and got my binoculars.\r\n\r\nviewing the orb was through the glasses was even more amazing – but it was totally weird. the only way to explain what i saw was that it appeared to consist of constantly moving molten light with constantly merging and changing rainbow colours. the colours seemed to flow into each other and simultaneously spin or rotate inside the orb. it was stunning and mesmerizing and not an item i’d ever seen before.\r\n\r\nwith the binoculars it was quite large and i scanned the area around the object but could not see any other flying object or aircraft that could perhaps have this item hanging from it.\r\n\r\nthe orb remained for more than 5 minutes and i even called the local newspaper – the argus and reported the sighting to the duty journalist, but he was not really interested and said they’d investigate...\r\n\r\na few seconds later the orb moved slightly to the right and then suddenly sped off in a steep angle in a northerly direction and disappeared. the speed and acceleration led me to believe that it was not a normal aircraft....Firstly none of south africa’s fighter jets could hover and then move that way and although we did have an amazing attack helicopter – the rooivalk that was developed in the 80’s – there was no way it would have been able to move across the sky at that speed....\r\n\r\nexcited we told some of our friends and soon realised they were very dubious about our claims. family members also just laughed and soon my ex-wife also preferred denying it had happened.\r\n\r\nthe sighting has been on my mind for years and unfortunately i cannot deny what i saw that evening.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

was looking at a low flying plan ...In my perifreal vision i caught what appeared to be a camera flash just above my head. i stopped looked up and watched for it again....I witnessed a white to yellow white  flasg above my head at 90 degrees. it was about the size of an aspirin above my head and there were no clouds directly above my head stars can clearly be seen. the flash was random and did not have any certain sequence. at times it would flash several times and there may be a delay of about  10 to 15 seconds. the flashes are much brighter than an aircraft stroke.Sometimes instead of a flash it would fade in and fade out with no flash. the object hovered above us for approximately two or three minutes flashing in the same spot directly overhead. the object then moved towards the  east at a slow pace. no sound was heard from said object. the object continued east ward until disappearing over the horizon. the flashes would either be a flash or a fade but not following any preset patterns such as an aircraft light and no other colors were seeing other than white and yellow white dim.    upon turning back to the east and looking up again we witnessed another light. this one appeared to be at a higher altitude and was a blue and red light. smaller than the one previously witnessed. this light was an approximately 75° above head and was moving slowly   to the southeast. we watched this light for approximately two minutes and then caught yet another light. the next light was in the east at approximately 60° was a blue to blue white color approximately the size and appearance of a star but this light moved to the south east rather quickly.  there were aircraft about flying out lower altitudes however this light appeared to be at an extremely high altitude as it appeared to be a star but was moving at a very rapid speed. the transit from east to south east out of sight was approximately 10 seconds.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

however i did transition to a ship going by on the river. maybe i lost interest, as i didn't really think much about it at the time. i grabbed my camera and took a series of pictures, 3 of them were

reviewed the cctv security camera to verify if low motion detection setting recorded activity from the night sky. from the timeline there were 3 video events recorded from the night. at 2:15am-2:21am pdt there was a bright flash of light making night into day.  the video recording of the flash of light could be inaccurate from the ccd sensor overexposing the bright flash of light from the sky.  if there was a noise beyond 80db i should have heard it. the camera would have showed an alert on the timeline. the houses became clearly visible in great detail from the intensity of light from the sky. it seems unlikely that the intensity of a flare from the sky or a transformer created the bright light. if it were lightning from the clouds the video of entire sky from darkness to daylight should not appear that intense.\r\n\r\nmy thoughts.  the light may have been off the coast of the pacific ocean or within the san francisco bay.  i wondered if it may be similar to the shag  harbour incident of nova scotia.\r\n\r\nthe flash of light happened for a duration of 1 second or 1.5 seconds.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

see the view. as we were talking we noticed that multiple military aircraft were flying pretty low past us. what freaked us out was that we never saw military planes in our town before so something must be up. it looked like they were traveling towards new york so we looked on the news to see if anything happened, but nothing was there. when i looked up into the sky i noticed something weird. i go to him \"babe look at that. doesn't it look like a giant ufo hiding in like something mode or invisibility?\" he agreed and we both soon felt an  eerie feeling and we decided to leave and go back to his house. we were driving down the street when i saw it. i was looking out of the windshield and i saw a floating orb just sitting there. it looked like a fireball, but not. i couldn't see through it. it looked solid and it was glowing orange. we got out of the car and we were just in awe. it was floating and moving around. it seemed like i could just get on my boyfriend's shoulders and i could of grabbed it. i told my boyfriend to take a video, but he sucks at taking them so you couldn't see, then again i haven't looked at the video in a long time. i would have to look for it in his phone. the orb then started to flying steadily away until i lost it. i love aliens and everything surrounding them. it was really a special moment for me. i hope i get to see some more again.","distance":"20

the building as a point of reference ensuring the object was indeed moving very slowly, southward... not a trick of the eye caused by nearby clouds.  there was no sound, no port/starboard or fore/aft lights.  having worked around helicopters, i'd guess it to be approximately the size of a commercial version yet certainly not a helicopter. i lost view of the orb when obstructed by a patch of clouds, so we left the scene and continued our walk. \r\n\r\nusually, my cell phone is on me but wasn't that night.  had i taken an image of the orb, the resolution wouldn't have been enough quality

the east.  the object was very dark and hard to make out as it drifted by, and with the eclipse in progress, the lighting was dim with a pink hue, since eugene, or was not in the 'zone' for totality.  i had my dslr ready, and remembered that all the settings were for the direct sunlight and i was using a polarized lens filter.  i had to quickly make adjustments for exposure for non-direct sunlight.  i was only able to photograph 7 images before the object was 'lost' behind a large nearby pine tree, and the focus was sketchy.    i had opened the jpeg files of the object from the nef raw
