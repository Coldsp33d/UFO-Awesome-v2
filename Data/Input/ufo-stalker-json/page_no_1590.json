detroit, michigan on leave with my one year old son and wife. after a few days of visiting with family and friends i decided to go with a friend to manistee national forest to do some fishing over the weekend. just prior to arriving, my friend and i pulled over at a gas station where he asked me if he could drive my new ford bronco ii the rest of the way to the campground, to which i agreed. approximately 10 minutes after leaving the gas station and with my friend driving at approximately 1:00am, my friend looked in the rear view mirror and asked me \"what is that following us?\" i then turned around from the passenger seat and looked out the back of the vehicle which was traveling at approximately 45mph. what i witnessed was an \"object\" that was approximately the size of a two story house with mo descernable outline with thousands of overlapping red lights going on & off at different intrivals, but they were going on & off like \"dimmer switches\" which created a pulsating appearance. my mind was trying to put it into a catagory of \"something.\" i then turned to my friend and said, \"i don't know what the hell it is.\" i then turned back to the object and noticed four yellow \"slits\" in the lower left hand corner. they were approximately 4ft long and approximatley 6-8in wide, shaped like eyes with bright yellow lights coming out, stacked one on top of the other, two sets next to each other. as i stared at it, the eye shaped lights became wider at the same time, aproximately 2ft wide for approximately 10 seconds, they then went back to narrow, 6-8in. as i stared at it trying to find a catagory in my mind, it...Disappeared. i then turned around in the passenger seat and didn't say a word and neither did my friend, for approxiamtely 30 seconds. we both started talking at the same time, him saying, \"i ain't telling no one\" & me saying \"i'm telling everyone.\" to which he said, \"no one is going to believe you and they're all going to make fun of you and accuse you of being on drugs, to which i replied, \"i don't care, i saw it.\" immediately after the incident we started noticing deer out in the road, approxiatley 10-15. we had to slow down to 5-10mph to keep from hitting them and as we drove by them, they didn't move.\r\nmy friend was right, everyone i told laughed and made fun. even my own wife said, \"i believe you saw....Something.\" this incident as haunted my mind ever since.\r\n20 years after that incident (2005), i was in the approximate area and witnessed \"somthing,\" not of a \"unidentified flying\" nature, but more of a ? \"supernatural\" orgin.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Sitting down in my backyard on this beautiful and clear late tuesday afternoon, i was looking around at the sky noticing the birds as i often like to do when i'm sitting outside. living in south st. louis, i yet sometimes see one or both of a pair of red-tailed hawks that live in a large cemetery close to my house, and a fairly wide variety of birds (and bats in the evening) for what i would expect living where i do, including hummingbirds. ten days before i'd noticed a very-large \"black hawk\" and got a picture of it in the distance that no one has yet been able to identify, but could be an immature turkey vulture.\r\n\r\nanyways, i was looking up in the sky and peripherally noticed a large black \"hawk\". pretty much at the moment i then focused right on it, it appeared to be the shape of two triangles connected at one of each's points! it then started darting around in the sky, never moving in curved lines but in straight lines then angles when changing direction. as it was darting around it was moving closer to the ground and seemingly slightly closer to me. i pretty quickly figured it wasn't a bird because i've never seen nor heard of a bird move that way before. its movements were \"jerky\", where it would move fast, perhaps stop then suddenly change direction and suddenly move fast again, etc. the object appeared to be tumbling or changing shape all along its travel, where i am certain i did see the two-connected triangle shape more than once during its travel, but it seemed to be changing its orientation/shape while moving. in terms of a conventional description, it looked most like a black trash bag being buffeted about by a strong shifting winds storm.\r\n\r\nhowever, there was a very gentile wind mostly perpendicular yet slightly against the direction of the object's travel at the time which i took notice of. i also noticed how black the object was, it never seemed to reflect any kind of sunlight in the clear sky, which made it appear only 2-dimensional as no depth could be perceived of the completely jet black non-reflective surface of the object. i also noticed the speed at which the object took on its longer beelines through the sky. i've seen birds diving, kites diving, radio-controlled planes diving and none of them nor anything else i've ever seen could match the speed it could travel as if on an invisible rail in the sky when going from point to point while constantly changing its orientation/shape. if the object were the size of a large hawk in my relative perspective, i first noticed it about 45 degrees off the horizon at perhaps 300' distance from me point to point. it eventually traveled diagonally down to my right to about 10 degrees off the horizon where i lost it when it went behind some trees heading towards the ground. again, if the object were the size of a large hawk, i last saw it perhaps 200' away, point to point. holding up my hand at the start, the object would have been the width of my pinkie finger, and the width of my ring finger when i last saw it. by that time i had gotten out of my chair and walked to a point in my backyard where i could see it as long as i could from my yard, the total focused visual contact was about 7 - 8 seconds.\r\n\r\ni've included an image i created using a picture i took of that area of the sky just five minutes later from my sitting position, and painted in a facsimile of what i saw. i was able to see the object further to the right of what can be seen in the image, having walked to where i could see there during the sighting. the object's path isn't exact either, it probably had a few more twists and turns. a sense of consternation immediately overcame me at the time of the sighting, and hasn't fully left. the night before i witnessed a large object, or fixed set of lights, traverse i-55 in cape girardeau, which i also reported to mufon but also had another witness who also called it/them unidentified. this circumstance took place less than 24 hours later at my house in st. louis but i was the only witness. it is a strange personal co-incidence that when i first noticed it, it bore a resemblance to the black \"hawk\" i'd recently photographed and have been trying to identify, which i'm also including with this report of the personal co-incidence. knowing that the thing was under control, whether it could be called \"intelligent\" control, it was not a natural creature nor a conventional object, but my consciousness thought it acted like a \"fake\" bird, and the object/lights i'd seen the night before my consciousness thought it acted like a \"fake\" plane. my consternation is that another consciousness may be \"messing\" with my consciousness!\r\n\r\ni make this report not so much for mufon but for you people of the public, those who think that other consciousnesses may be messing with your consciousness. this is aldo to you who think that other people won't/haven't believe/believed you as you may try to recount your own unique personal strange circumstances to your family, friends or even the public

animal.  so when i turned out the lights to go to bed i looked out the window and noticed and larger than normal star over the next door neighbors garage.  i watched it for a while and noticed it was blinking a lot.  thinking it might be my eyes i just figured it was an airplane and watched it for a while.  i began to move up very slowly, much slower than an airplane usually does and it was still blinking a lot.  it looked like it had colors of at least red and yellow on it. and then it hovered there.  so i thought it might be a helicopter off where i couldn't hear it.  but the blinking bothered me, so i got my bird watching binoculars and focused and then the colored blinking became clear.  there was blue/white light and yellow, green and red.  in the binoculars they looked like orbs  or haloed lights but that could have been the refraction in the lenses from the light.  but there was definitely colors.  i realized that the reason the object looked like it was jerking up and down and side to side slightly was because of the blinking of the lights.  it was hard to tell any shape but the lights were giving it an affect of being cross shaped. i watched it for about 45 minutes after i got the binoculars and the object just hovered there and then about 50 minutes from first sighting it began and slow movement back toward where i had first seen it.  and then it disappeared behind the garage.  i looked later but the clouds had come up and i couldn't see the sky.  there was no noise from it.  all i could hear was the frogs and crickets.  there are no large airports in the area and i suppose sandpoint id is the closest military installation.  i have not heard aircraft fly over since we arrived 2 weeks ago.  i'm not given to flights of fancy or imaginations and i was rather surprised to see something like this.  i still feel there may be an explanation of what it was.

street lamp and the light-halo emitting from each object was approximately 10-20ft in diameter. both objects were identical size and shape. the lights did not strobe or flash but remained the same brightness and consistency the whole time. there were no visible wings or landing gear or any other physical characteristics we could see. we did not see any landing lights or flashing strobes. the orbs were flying just above nearby westwing mountain at approximately 500-600 feet altitude. the orbs were independent of each other staying 100 or so feet apart from each other. they were flying at a constant speed of 30-40mph due east under their own power. one orb was about 10 feet higher than the other but both traveled at the same speed. it was very quiet out and no sounds could be heard

zoom cam, at 12:34am and just happened to move the cam up a notch and noticed in my viewer of my cam lights fading in and out of view and saw lights of different colors and started recording it,as i noticed it wasn't a plane or anything in the area at the time and was above the moon and knew it wasn't a plane because of the distance. i started recording it because i knew it wasn't anything i ever saw before, i wasn't sure what it was but knew it wasn't a plane or anything else , it just kept fading in and out showing different lights as it did that. i lowered the cam a bit and caught it. i felt kind of freaked out at the time because of what it was and wasn't the only time i recorded something else in the night skies above the moon. it was kind of exciteing knowing that there is something else out there and am still amazed by it. i i tried to zoom in a bit but lost it as i did

on t.V. over the years.  this is just what i saw tonight.  it was definitely the most unusual, interesting and kind of scary thing i have witnessed in the skies. especially when it seemed an airplane was going to crash right into it.   \r\n\r\nsent by me to the marin independent journal tonight may 31st around 11p.M. right after i saw event.\r\n\r\ni live at marion and 8th street in novato ca  and i just witnessed at about 10:50p.M.  two fiery red objects very large in appearance heading south-west to north-east direction.  these were nothing like anything i've ever seen before. they came 2 minutes apart and glided through the sky making no noise whatsoever.  i believe it was not in any standard flight path.  in fact, the second one went right past an airplane which was going in the direction of sfo.  the airplane was very audible but the fiery thing was not. very interesting occurence; i hope someone can explain it, i'd be thrilled to know what they were because they were kind of majestic as well.  i caugth it on cell phone video but i can't download it right now.  email me if you would like it.  \r\n\r\nsent to the local mufon chapter same time:\r\n\r\n\r\n i just saw two very unsual objets glide slowly across the sky over novato in a northeasterly direction. they arrived about two minutes apart and were bright bright orange like fireballs,. oi don't know much about meteors but i went to a meteor reporting website and everythinkg there was reported as being blue or green or multi colored and having a tail and burning out and etc. these objects lost no intensity of color. that stayed the same as they each kept going until they disappeared into the horizon. they were off of flight paths i'm sure. in fact the second one passed right past an airplane headed easterly toward sfo or oakland airports. another strange thing. they made no noise whatsoever. i have cell phone video but its not very good. i would love to have someone analyze it \r\n\r\nor even better, if anyone else saw it how can i connect. thanks.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
