i hope someone can explain it, i'd be thrilled to know what they were because they were kind of majestic as well.  i caugth it on cell phone video but i can't download it right now.  email me if you would like it.  \r\n\r\nsent to the local mufon chapter same time:\r\n\r\n\r\n i just saw two very unsual objets glide slowly across the sky over novato in a northeasterly direction. they arrived about two minutes apart and were bright bright orange like fireballs,. oi don't know much about meteors but i went to a meteor reporting website and everythinkg there was reported as being blue or green or multi colored and having a tail and burning out and etc. these objects lost no intensity of color. that stayed the same as they each kept going until they disappeared into the horizon. they were off of flight paths i'm sure. in fact the second one passed right past an airplane headed easterly toward sfo or oakland airports. another strange thing. they made no noise whatsoever. i have cell phone video but its not very good. i would love to have someone analyze it \r\n\r\nor even better, if anyone else saw it how can i connect. thanks.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":38706,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.1091933,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06012012-0005","longitude":-122.5782968,"occurred":1338529500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Fireball,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1338544599000,"summary":"Like fireballs but def not meteors, bright fire that never faded. seemed on a flight path.  crossed paths with an airplane.","tags":["light","fireball"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"94945","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Novato, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:2807"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Wollongong","country":"Australia","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Myself and my partner went to wollongong harbour to view the waves from a storm we were having it was winding and dark , we were taking photos of the people in wet suits braving the waves when we captured the object. we didn't see it at the time only when we returned home to view the pics on our computer. i believe that we are not alone and excited if its what it looks like.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":38705,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-34.419034,"location":null,"logNumber":"AU-06012012-0003","longitude":150.8956339,"occurred":1318748400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New South Wales","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1338539355000,"summary":"Watching waves at the harbour and took photos, noticed strange light upon returning home","tags":["photo","light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/38705_submitter_file1__image.jpeg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":229,"locationName":"Wollongong, New South Wales","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:2808"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Concord","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"There were about 8-10 orange/yellow orbs moving northwest.  they were not in any formation, but clearly moving together.  afte they past, one large orange/yello orbd came out of the south east and becan to move in a north northwest direction. while moving in the group, they began to fade away as though they were moving out from the atmosphere, rather than within the atmosphere.

on each side of the center light) were glowing, but only as strong as a dim candle. \r\ni then called my sister up to our apartment so we could use her binoculars to get a better idea of the lights and rule out the possibilty of airplanes. as i stared through the lens i saw that the bright lights had a cross shape to them. i could not see an outline of a craft. it was as if it did not want to be identified. \r\nfor the next half-hour, the brightest light in the center would begin to fade as one of the lights on the side would flash/pulse a red/orange glow. at this point, the brightest light would fade and exit slowly towards the left side of manhattan until it was no longer over manhattan. the red/orange light would then shift towards the place the original center light was. it would then grow a bright, yellow light like that of a light-bulb. this would continue until all the lights would dissapear.\r\nit is now 10:02 pm, and i have seen an additional 5 lights go through the same

our guest cottages. this must have been at about 1230-1240 pm. my eyes were drawn to the sky by a column of dust left by a dust devil; this was probably only about a block away.  in it, rather through it, i noticed an object that i first figured to be a distant aircraft. something about it kept my attention.  at first it didn���t seem to move, which was odd for an object in the sky during the brightest part of the day. then it seems it was moving very slowly in an east-by-southeast direction.  it was too high up, and away from any known objects to get any real perspective.  i would say that this object could have been as far away as over tucson or phoenix and as high up as possibly orbital. soon, it moved slowly toward the south. at some point my wife came out onto our back deck and asked what i was looking at. she must have sensed that i was watching something strange. at some point one of us noticed there was another smaller object nearby; i can���t remember if i had noticed this before she came out or not. she grabbed her camera from inside the house, a canon eos rebel t3i with ef-s 55-250 mm telescopic zoom lens. she began taking photos. we ended up with 49 pictures captured at (on average) 6 mb each.  while taking pictures we could see up to 13 of the smaller objects. they appeared to be moving and my wife and i think that at least two of them moved up to the bigger object then moved away at a different direction.   this cluster was generally ~ 45 degrees above horizon, ~ 300 degrees magnetic azimuth from tombstone.  sometime shortly before 12:44 pm i went just inside the back door to post on facebook via our dining room pc that we were watching ufos.  at 12:50 i posted that we lost sight of them. they had moved slightly northward and then just dissipated. \r\ni know it���s debatable whether stars can be seen during the day but we checked google sky shortly afterward and did find that uranus was in that area of the sky at the time of our sighting. but it���s debatable whether uranus can be seen in the best of conditions at night.\r\ni have been with the military for 26+ years; much of it as an intelligence analyst. i have traveled the world. i have watched the sky, aircraft and celestial bodies for all my years. i have flown extensively. i am a bit of an aviation enthusiast. i tell you all this because i have never seen anything like this before and it just didn���t fit. the only thing i can propose to explain it is that it was an unusual effect of the annular solar eclipse that was to happen a few hours later. maybe the moon was already casting a shadow (that was unseen to us) on the outer part of the atmosphere in the direction that we were looking and this somehow allowed us to see stars in that direction during the day. maybe it even magnified them. the movement could be attributed to atmospherics and one star becoming visible while one was disappearing from view. \r\nend of report\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

had some darker values that gave it shape.\r\nmost noticeably, there were dark grey grid lines on it. all over it.\r\nlike a sphere with grid lines, and just like the color, these lines gave it shape.\r\nthe lines were equal, and moved when the ufo morphed.\r\nbefore it morphed, it had glided into view (again, on a straight path.) it had appeared into my view after it passed some trees (from my point of view\r\n.) it glided (i cant describe its movement in any other words) about halfway into my viewpoint, and then stopped. \r\nwhen it stopped, it morphed. i couldn't describe the shape, all i know is that the grid lines moved with the transformation. it had a point somewhere in the middle of the morph, the outline of it changed into a shape unknown.\r\nthe pause lasted exactly four seconds, and after it had changed into the unknown shape, it slowly and soundlessly glided out of my view.\r\nthere were no lights, and absolutely no sound. the trees on the other end of my view had obscured it.\r\nmy friend and i reacted as anybody would: bewildered. i stared at it and would not blink, in case i were to miss anything. i went on top of the table to get a glimpse of it over the trees but it was nowhere to be found.\r\nmaybe ten minutes later, there was a loud bang and the sky almost unnoticeably flashed a very very light shade of its original navy blue for a second or less.\r\ni told other friends about it, and i learned that five of my other close friends described the same thing. and i had heard that 12 others reported it, as well.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

birthday party for my son.  we had been sitting outside on lawn chairs.  several teenagers were on the other side (west) of the house.  the adults were sitting in the front yard (east side). i started to get out of my chair and just happened to be looking up to the east, when a concentrated bright orange (very dark orange) beam started piercing the clouds shining directly on us.  it was about 3000 feet in altitude. my first impression, was crap, a 747 is about to land in my yard as i thought what i was seeing was a plane with its landing light on.  but, we live out in the sticks and there would be no reason for landing lights to be on.  but i then quickly realized the beam of light was too concentrated for a landing light, and the color was too dark of orange.  everyone quickly said something to the effect \"what in the heck is that?\"  it was coming in from east to west right in line with my house. everyone quickly assembled in front of my garage as we met the panicked teenagers coming around from the back of the house at that location.  at that point the beam of light shut off and the craft banked slightly to the right bearing northwest.  this was almost on top of our house which sits on 40 acres.  when the beam was off we could clearly see a diamond shape of lights that formed the outline of the craft.  there was an orange light at each tip, non-blinking.  also, the craft had a bright red pulsating light which didn't appear to be directly centered in the diamond shape.  we were all amazed and in agreement that this was no aircraft any of us had seen before. it was also silent.  it traveled about the speed of a small plane, at a constant speed.  we all watched as it gradually disappeared to the northwest several miles away. two theories developed among us about the beam of light.  one thought was that we were being checked out (we were really lit up) by the craft and the beam was shut off once it figured we were no threat.  the other thought was that perhaps the pilot was not familiar with our atmosphere so was using the beam to navigate through the clouds it was encountering.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

i thought to myself, \"this is not a star, this is a ufo!\" when my wife turned to me and said, \"honey, what's that?\" while pointing over to my left. i looked up where she was pointing just in time to see a \"star\" flying eastward. it was not blinking or oscillating or anything like that. just a white dot traveling through the sky. as it was traveling by, it flew in a mostly straight line, but then it made a few sharp angles that would be impossible for any aircraft to make, before going back into a mostly straight line again, and then blinking out of sight, leaving a light streak or trail behind it that instantly disappeared! the first thing that came to mind in terms of how to describe the pattern it flew in, is that it looked like a sawtooth wave. forgive me for the comparison, as i am an audio engineer, and that was the first thing it reminded me of, but it later occurred to me that it also looks like the pattern that is displayed on an electrocardiogram machine. you know, that ecg monitor that people get hooked up to in hospitals that shows your heart beat? that's the pattern it flew off in!\r\n\r\nso i answered my wife by saying, \"that right there is what they call a ufo, honey,\" and immediately turned my attention back to the right, at the ufo i was looking at. my wife was very excited, vocalizing how that was her first ufo ever, and how amazing that was, and she noticed i was looking at this other \"star.\" she then said, \"is that one too?\" i told her that i thought it was, and explained how the strobing/oscillating thing it was doing can't be explained by the tree because from where i repositioned myself the branches were no longer in the way. she then said that she, too, was noticing that star, before seeing the other ufo that just flew off, and she thought it was just leaves getting in the way. right at this point it decided to start moving! and i mean, it moved, in a way that we could only think that it knew we were watching it, and it was saying, \"look at me! look at me!!\" it started dipping down, flying up, making circles, getting brighter, and just, acting out! my wife and i both saw this!\r\n\r\nbut then, the most exciting part, to me, is that my wife was somehow able to really focus on the object itself, through the light it was radiating, and see that it was spinning, doing somersaults, and apparently shaped like a gyroscope. i personally did not see this, although i saw \"patterns of light\" being emitted from it, which were changing and shifting. this thing, every once in a while, would try to hover around a general area, as if to tell us, \"this is my job, i can't leave my post, i have to stay around this general area and look like a star,\" or something like that. it was following the general path of the the rest of the stars through the sky, but it was doing it in a very whimsical, almost clumsy manner. i eventually started dozing off, but the thing was still there all along. at one point, as i was fighting sleep, i caught myself with my eyes closed and opened them back up again, just in time to see the ufo back up in the original spot in the sky that i started seeing it in, and it quickly sped back down to where it should have been due to the earth's orbit at that time. i went to sleep with the thought of, \"this is it, finally! i have seen them up close and personal, on top of a mountain, with no possible doubt any more, that what i'm seeing is a meteorological phenomenon or human aircraft.\" then i went to sleep.\r\n\r\nsince that night i have been experiencing some \"synchronicities\" and other sort of mental phenomena which i don't comprehend yet. one thing i forgot to mention above is that during the event i felt like i was having thoughts that i don't normally have, and i found myself \"feeling like\" i had some kind of golden bubble around me that was coming from my breath. i can't help but feel like the ufo somehow was involved in this. nothing like that has happened before.\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************\r\n\r\nmy wife wrote a report as well, which is as follows:\r\n\r\nwe set up the tent, built a fire, spent a few hours watching in burn down, and climbed into the tent to watch the stars before falling asleep. i had already set everything up in the tent with the sleeping bags facing the largest expanse of sky to north. at the last second, i had a strong urge to turn the sleeping bag around. i just went with it automatically and told my husband we should face the other way, so we flipped the bags around and finally settled in.\r\n\r\ni clearly remember noticing the star that \"danced\" for us right away, because it looked like it was almost flashing, or strobing, but from my point of view, it was directly behind a big tree, and i just brushed it off as wind in the branches obscuring a really bright star. i was focusing on the section of sky to the left (east) of that big tree where there were a few bright stars twinkling. i remember thinking at this point, \"why did i turn the bags around, we're looking at a bunch of trees?\" but my husband wasn't complaining, and i was comfy and tired, so i didn't mention it.\r\n\r\na few minutes later, one of the stars i was looking at moved! it happened so fast, but i know as soon as that first movement registered, i said something like, \"honey, do you see that?\" and pointed. he saw it at the same time that it started zig-zagging across the sky. it flew like a dragonfly. it had very erratic movements, but patterned; it made a short, fast leap, paused, then a long, fast leap, then it would change direction at a 90 degree angle, i think, and start the pattern over (this all happened faster than any craft we're supposed to know about could manage!). it did this three or fours times, and it left a trail of light in its wake, so by the time it disappeared from my field of vision, i could still barely make out its trail across the sky. its burned into my memory, even though it happened so fast. its the first i've ever seen with my own eyes! that my husband saw it too makes it that much more special. the impression i got from this one was, \"oh, crap, i've been spotted! retreat!\" as soon as i focused on it, it streaked away.\r\n\r\nso i was all excited, and my husband gets excited too, and he points out the 'star' behind the tree. i mentioned that i had seen it, too, and that's when everything he lays out above took place. what i saw differs slightly from what he saw, but only in that i definitely saw something beyond the light itself. it wasn't more than a shadow of something, but it was rolling and spinning and the light kept shifting and changing configurations all around it. i was finally able to form the thought today that it moved just like a gyroscope moves! it seemed to me to be overjoyed that someone was watching it and giving it attention. it was showing off and prancing around and radiating joy, is the only way to put it. it would occasionally blink out all together, and there were a few times we thought it had disappeared for good, but it kept coming back, at least until i fell asleep, which was before my husband.","distance":"101-500 Feet, Unknown","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":38691,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.2406472,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05312012-0012","longitude":-82.7297619,"occurred":1338184800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North Carolina","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Sphere,   Star-like,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1338501272000,"summary":"Two ufos seen posing as stars above looking glass rock in the pisgah national forest. one interacted with us.","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":3,"locationName":"Brevard, North Carolina","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:2821"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Dover","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was at work outside on my lunch break, when i saw 3 bright lights hovering over top the sky boxes on the other side of the track. i tried to get a pic but they were gone when i pulled my phone out, i waited still looking in the spot they were when 6 bright lights appeared, i was able to get a pic of them hovering, one as they started moving. i first thought it was one solid abject, they started moving very fast and in different directions. i was kinda scared i was outside by myself, i tried to call someone else out to look at the lights, my 2 way radio stopped working, the battery was completely drained. as quick as i could snap 2 pics they were gone.

report as january 25th @ 12:13:04), at approximately 10:45 am, est, i stood on the back deck of my house which faces se, and looked up to enjoy the clear, blue sky.  i noticed a large flying cylinder shaped object, flat dark gray in color, moving at fast clip toward the east.  i said aloud to myself, \"what the heck is that thing?\" as it approached it almost resembled a torpedo or bomb and seem to be in a maneuvered descent. it came in at 120 degree angle, flew overhead and i saw a large white ring in the middle of what i believe was the undercarriage.  the ring appeared to be metal with integrated \"teeth,\" much like that of a gear, facing inward toward ring's center.  in the center of the ring was another, smaller dark colored ring with something in the center of it i cannot identify.  two smaller, dark colored or black rings were equidistant from the center white ring and within these was a non-reflective gray material. there were no insignia, writing, numbers, wings, propellers, portholes or blades of any kind.  yet, i surmise it was controlled or piloted by virtue of its maneuvers.  the craft passed beyond where i stood and i heard the sound of a jet airliner moving in a w or sw direction, possibly to atl, which momentarily distracted me.  i looked up at the jet airliner and hoped someone was seeing what i was seeing. i turned back to look at the other craft which now appeared bluish-silver and watched it maneuver from e to n, moving at fast clip.  as it turned n, i saw a shaft-like object, resembling a missile arising from the far side of the object, toward its nose.  although i consciously made a mental note to absorb more detail, what i perceived was not congruent with any of my experiential knowledge; it simply was and is beyond my scope of understanding.  i watched it until it was no longer visible, turned back to the plane and thought that the flight paths of the two crafts were dangerously close:  if the plane had been ahead of schedule, the two paths might have intersected at the point at which i first saw the ufo.  the whole thing took place under a minute, but i felt a distortion of time and space, which i suspect anyone would feel when confronted by the surreal. i am not detail-oriented by nature and terrible at gauging distance; certainly not equipped to judge the size or altitude of aircraft.  (for example, in my first report i said the airliner had to be closer, when it was not, simply because it was identifiable!) what i provide here is information which i hope someone can discredit and provide a plausible explanation for what i saw.

continued once the traffic moved. \r\n\r\nthe video was not viewed until 6am 28-may-12 while i was uploading other photos and cleaning up memory on my cell phone.  approximately time one minute twenty-six seconds.What i noticed on the top right of the screen was several objects flying from the cell of the storm and back to the storm, from second marker, 30 seconds on for approximatley twenty seconds. \r\n\r\nspeed of the returning objects are quite fast. objects colours vary from white lights to red-orange glowing objects, faint lights underneath the clouds trailing other lights. the clouds also lit up in a small sections for several sections, not like lightning, rather like a pulse or round flash.\r\n\r\nthe latter of the video was taken in a downward direction to try get the dark cell storm area, however, i recorded reflection of merging traffic during the last few seconds.  there is no reverse traffic while heading north on the deerfoot trail only merging.  southbound is or could crossover the overpasses.\r\n\r\ninitally when i viewed it, i was dumbfounded, as i've seen many video's with similar lights.  just didn't think i would see any on my time. i kept reviwing it over and over again, to make sure lack of sleep was not tricking me.  at 6:30 am i woke my daughter to tell her what i recorded.\r\n\r\nbackground music was from the local radio station. the calgary international airport was nearby, however, there was no visible aircraft during this video.  airport traffic is quite noticeable while low flying.\r\n\r\nsuffice to say, there was not lightning

wylie. this is the nc side of lake wylie, in belmont, nc. my daughter told us all to look up. there was a bright light (like a high powered flood light) that was predominately orange with a hint of red glow. the object was hovering around 500 feet and was 1,000 feet out. this object slowly began to move in a vertical direction and disappeared at a high altitude. a couple of minutes later, another object descended from a high altitude (from the direction of east mecklenburg county) and was followed by 5 other objects. all objects had the same color and size. they all hovered at the same altitude and were in a loose formation, spread apart in substantial distances. all objects then broke formation and went in different directions. one of the objects maneuvered to the west, towards our direction. my oldest son began taking pictures. this object continued to slowly move towards us until it was 500 feet away and roughly 500 feet altitude. this object hovered for a couple of minutes with it's lights on. while the lights were on, the shape, size and color of the craft's structure could not be estimated. however, the light slowly faded and to our utter amazement, there was a solid, deep black disc shaped object hovering and spinning like a top. this object then proceeded to maneuver to the south, towards the duke energy allen steam station, which is about a 1/2 mile to a mile south (parallel to the dock we were fishing from). we were shocked, excited, and very concerned. my wife used to always roll her eyes when i talk about ufo's. she has a different outlook now. this was a truly amazing event we witnessed and the craft performed maneuvers that are not known to be performed by aircraft in today's society. i think this is either a well kept secret project or something not of this earth! i am leaning on the latter thought! also, these craft seemed to \"swoop down\" from space or a very high altitude. back to the sighting...This particular object spinned in a counter clockwise direction while hovering and continued to spin when moving in a straight path towards the steam station. the object appeared to be observing lake wylie and allen steam station. the object had no noise whatsoever. the outside lighting conditions were when the sun was setting and nighttime was a few minutes from taking place. \r\nthe other objects (which were farther out) appeared to be observing the charlotte airport and the other parts of lake wylie. \r\ni am a navy veteran, discharged with honors. my mos in the navy was with radar, air intercept operations and aircraft warfare. i am employed as a project manager with a mechanical engineering firm. i have been with the same company for 15 and a half years. as of this writing, i am still employed with the same company (which is established). this is not the first instance that i (and my family-multiple witnesses)have observed ufo's in the lake wylie and belmont area. i have seen a triangle back in may 2005 and also saw these disc shaped objects on separate occasion the past few months. i have pictures and video on my iphone! i will submit to a polygraph test and i am open to answer any questions. i am very interested in the ufo phenomenon since i experienced these in the past, dating back to the military. this area seems to be a definite hotspot and should be a trove of data for an investigator to look into. i will help in any way to answer questions, show the sighting location or anything else! thanks for your time and please call me any time, if you have questions, etc. on a closing note...I am very concerned about these objects interfering with the takeoff and landing patterns for the commercial/private aircraft using the charlotte airport. i have a video from last april, which clearly shows one of these objects hovering and a commercial airplane having to take evasive action (or at least this appeared so from my angle of view) while taking off to avoid this object. there has to be some pilots/air controllers that have knowledge of this. thanks for any help with finding some answers to this.\r\nbest regards, \r\n\r\na concerned citizen\r\nnote: i have the photos and video on my iphone. i can personally provide this to an investigator or can email this.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"01:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then
