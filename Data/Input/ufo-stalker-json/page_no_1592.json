States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Driving back home to st. louis from the hot springs ar area, it was about 9:45 pm and we were in cape girardeau mo. i'd been driving for 5 3/4 hours, and still had another 1 3/4 to get home, so i was mainly concentrating on the road. when about a mile from the southeast medical plaza, which i could see, i noticed what at first appeared to be a large sized commercial airliner approaching a runway, taking its near landing approach across i-55 and over the plaza. i couldn't help but notice this as it was taking place directly in my line of vision. i live in st. louis about six miles from its international airport and am quite familiar with approaching aircraft to an airport. these lights were at a declining angle towards the ground, passing over the plaza at about 500', the length of lights about 300' in length. having better than common familiarity with conventional aircraft lighting, i couldn't quite discern what i was seeing, also wondering why in the large expanse of land available would a runway by built just a few hundred yards east of the plaza? i didn't think cape girardeau had a commercial airport, so i asked my passenger and she said she didn't think so either, and then mentioned that she'd seen some other strange lights just before acknowledging the lights passing in front of us when i asked her if she knew what they were (no). as we passed the plaza, i quickly glanced a few times expecting to see the the craft coming down to a runway, but as i last saw it it instead seemed to have banked right slightly and had leveled off! i was confused, i'd just seen at least six distinct lights that appeared to be fixed to a single indiscernible \"airplane\" decline down to the ground right in front of me but level off and bank right, a craft least had to be 300' long from first light to last light. the front light was white, steady but strobbing. then there was a distance and there were two white lights close together - these three white lights seeming to be \"in-line\" on the craft. the last three lights were in a tight triangle a distance from the two \"middle\" lights, but appearing to be slightly higher \"in-line\" on the craft. if the object were a plane, the front light appeared to be under the nose, the two lights under the center where the wings would be, and the last three as a small triangle in the middle of the tail of the \"airplane\". the top lights was green and the two bottom lights were red. this did not appear to be an faa regulation lighting arrangement for a helicopter nor airplane based on the direction of travel of the craft. when i noticed the strange green and reds triangle, i remember having read that when seeing strange lights that one should try to discern a pattern to the lights. i would say the pattern i've described i saw more than once when looking and glancing at the lights, but the rear triangle of green and reds sometimes appeared to be white instead, where sometimes they were green and reds, and sometimes they were white. anyways, i and a passenger witness thought these lights were strange, seeming to be on approach to an airport that wasn't quite there.\r\n\r\nsince that sighting, i did some research using internet maps and found that i had just passed the cape girardeau regional airport about a mile before i started seeing the lights passing over i-55 and the southeast medical plaza! it was because of the street view of the maps that i figured out it was passing over the southeast medical plaza, at the time i only knew i was in cape girardeau and hadn't realized i'd just passed the regional airport!! note again, just passed the regional airport, it was behind me at the time i saw the lights. so, ironically, i'd just passed an airport without realizing it and was passing a sign with the mileage to st. louis (where i was going) without realizing it when i was actually seeing the craft!!! anyways, hopefully there is an image associated with this report depicting what i and my passenger witnessed in cape girardeau as we were approaching and passing the southeast medical plaza at about 9:43 pm as memorial day evening.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

possible. it was pretty strange.It was just a large cloud cover rolled in off the ocean, coming towards us.As it got closer it was just different.As the large cloud got close to the pier it turned to our rite and continued heading south along the beach.But out over the water..As it went away from us,and it was still very close at the time. we could easily make out 6 to 8 turbine type emissions from the rear,,although there was no sound. at least not that we could hear, and again, we were very close.But also all the rides and boardwalk noise was loud,along with the waves of the ocean. this vehicle was the most amazing thing i have ever scene.Because of the heavy cloud cover surrounding most of it,the rear with its flame type emission was the only very clear section,,it hovered a good 10 to 15 feet off the water..Keeping in mind also. there were no other clouds in the sky.It was a clear night. also when i say it had 6 to 8 turbine like emissions in the rear..The closest thing to compare these emissions to would be like the end of a propane torch,,only each exhaust was much larger..This was a pretty large vehicle..It hovered effortlessly,without displacing any water below..It continued slowly down shoreline hovering over water,,a good 75 to 100 yards from where water meets the sand again heading south. as it moved away the fire like exhaust was eventually covered by cloud . we watched it in amazement till it was out of sight.We looked at each other and we each asked the other if they saw that.We both agreed we did  and never spoke of it again ever since..I was in awe after seeing it..I know we seen something very strange that night..I had never seen anything like it before or since..For you people into this stuff,,you would of loved it..I'm not into this stuff and i was grateful and amazed at seeing it..Not sure how i would of felt if there wasn't someone else there that saw exactly what i did..","distance":"21-100

this is only about a mile away from the neighborhood on 30th terr. s where we were last night.  my husband, two daughters, and two grandsons came along.  we first observed one object appear at dusk in

asked what we were doing and he said that he noticed the object as well and thought that it was odd.  we observed the same characteristics, only clearer, through high-powered binoculars.  i took some long exposure photos with a nikon camera but nothing showed up on the photos. we also noticed several bright white streaks in the sky during the 3 hours we were at this location. \r\n\r\nat 10:30 pm
