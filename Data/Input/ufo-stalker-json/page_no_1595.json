this object with three(3) very bright lights that was hovering over the road. i noticed the object quite a ways out but only noticed that somthing was strong when we got close, and said to my girlfriend \"do you see that?\", she replied \"yes what is that a plane?\". once we got closer, i noticed none of the flashing lights that planes or helicopters have when flying. i must note, that we live near philadelphia pa, which has a large airport; during the sighting i noticed planes very far out and very high in altitude and could easily spot there flashing lights. the three lights were so bright that i could not make out what the objects shape was; but it looked like the lights were wrapping around the object so there could have been more on the other side. when i say bright, i'm not talking about the type of brightness that is shinning and is hard to look at, i'm talking about brightness that had no direction; if that makes any sense. the object was just hovering and moving west very slowly. the object was only 150-200 feet off the ground. when we got near i noticed that it was not over the road, but that it was over some land just north of the road, i also noticed that i heard no sound (my window was down). i kept asking my girlfriend if she could see anything i couldn't, she would reply \"i don't know what that is\". we got so close to it that she could not see because it was about to be above us and to the left of us and she needed to watch the road. i leaned forward trying to look up and left through the windshield and still could only see three bright lights just before we drove under it. once we drove under it i could no longer see it. we drive back and forth on naamans creek rd. at night frequently, and we have never noticed it again.\r\n\r\nas for my feelings, i didn't feel fear or anything that made me want to get the heck out of there. i was so surprised to see this that i didn't have time to think about anything else except of what i was actually seeing. after we lost sight of the object, i looked to my girlfriend who was driving, and just said to her \"there's no chance that it could have been a plane or helicopter right?\". she replied \" i was only able to look every few seconds, and i didn't see the flashing lights that planes have\"","distance":"101-500

northwest of us.  at first i thought it was a plane and reminded him that we're right by o'hare. as the object descended (in a southeast direction) and was no more than 300 feet above the ground, we were surprised at how far west of ohare it actually was and that it no longer looked like an airplane, although it was difficult to make out what it was because it was so dark out (about 11pm) and our view was obstructed by trees.  as we approached where the object had passed over the highway we were able to see that it was 100 yards away and hovering about 100-150 feet above the ground.\r\n\r\nthe object had an oval base and looked like a sports stadium (the height was probably about 1/2 of the length of the base so it looked like a sports stadium that had been \"smushed\" down).  there was an \"l\" like piece that hung under the bottom and reminded me of what a tv satellite looks like.  the object was light colored (maybe tan or beige) and there were a bunch of thin \"l\" shaped rods that came off of the sides and pointed upwards with blinking lights on them.  i could not believe how close it was and how clearly i was able to see the \"l\" shaped rods because they were not very thick.  i dont remember if there were lights on the actual object itself, but the object was lit well enough that it stood out and was so clear that other cars on the road must have noticed it as they passed by too.\r\n\r\nwe were in such disbelief that what we first thought was a plane on its way to ohare ended up being a ufo that we didnt feel scared, we just kept asking each other if the other person was seeing it too.  i'm not really sure ive fully grasped or comprehended how real what i just saw was and what it means.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

light in the sky caught my eye. i looked directly at it thinking perhaps it was some type of fireworks, but it just sat there hovering. then another just seemed to appear not far from the 1st. i asked my spouse what those lights in the sky were when i noticed a 3rd light. jokingly i asked if it was the mother ship coming in when i noticed the 4th light. my spouse began questioning if it was some type of weird fireworks bc they all seemed to be moving, yet stationary. they were just hovering there in the sky. we walked out into the street to get a better view of all 4 lights as the last 2 were somewhat obstructed from view by trees. the lights continued to hover, but seemed to move from a pointed v formation to a flat v formation. we continued to question each other what they could be and why they would just be hovering in place, and why the v formation? i kept telling my spouse that it was crazy how they looked like fireballs, or stars that were really close and on fire. they glowed and flickered a reddish, yellowish orange glow. then the in the opposite order that they appeared they faded out. at first it appeared the 3rd and 4th fireballs were ascending toward the north, but i couldn't be sure if they were really ascending or if they just fizzled out. then the 2nd fireball appeared to be getting smaller. then the 1st one appeared to be fizzling out. it appeared to have an afterglow that lingered in the sky. again, i couldn't be sure if they ascended, burnt out or fizzled out. the 1st one i saw appeared to be the biggest and brightest of all 4 objects. each one the appeared, appeared to be smaller than the one before it. once they all disappeared i continued to stare into the sky. then began looking all around in the sky. behind me i noticed an airplane flying northeast. i was so bewildered, curious, a little unnerved and awestruck all at the same time. and i keep going back out to look at the sky. and i watched the news to see if they reported anything

a star-like object in the sky moving twice as fast as a plane would be. we see planes all the time. this was not in our atmosphere. it was white and moved in one direction to the southeast above our heads. we waited and watched till it was out of our view. i don't know exactly what that was but it was great experiencing it because of how high it was and how fast it was moving. it didn't blink. it

my husband said\"what are those planes doing?? \" there was a stream of red orbs all in a line heading west. they were in groups of 4 and then 2 and 3.  i said, \"oh they must be in a holding pattern for the airport and can't land\". my husband said \"the airport is way way too far south of here for anything like that and some of them are following very close together\". i then noticed & said oh my gosh your right. looked closer and begged husband to pull over so we could get a better look and i could videotape with my cell phone.  he said there was no where to pull over so i opened window and tried to tape what we were witnessing.  i was terrified at this point and couldn't understand what they were. we stopped momentarily at railroad crossing and i looked out and up and there were two of these red glowing orbs directly above our car. i could see them clear as could be but couldn't make out any details.  they were silent, no engine, no noise at all.  they were not chinese lanterns and they were not flickering as such, they were just glowing and kind of like pulsating. they were not airplanes or any type of helicopter or drone. they were large red glowing spheres.  we crossed the tracks and went to the parking lot across the street and by this time they had gone so far i could only see one in the far distance which i believe to mean they were obviously traveling at a high speed of around 500 mph. i tried from the lot to videotape with my phone the remaining glowing red orb and didn't think i was picking anything up so stopped quickly but at home realized i did get a shot of it very briefly & i have saved it as a photo. i have video of 20 seconds of this event but unfortunately it is not great because i was doing it out the window of a moving vehicle. i was very much affected by this event and am still shook up over it. i have never ruled ufo or other life out but now that i have witnessed such an unexplainable event i feel i have witnessed something  i will never forget as long as i live. it was upsetting, creepy and disturbing and i had almost wished i hadn't seen it. again, i apologize for the poor video quality but i am glad i got anything at all. in it you can see three of these moving red glowing orbs.
