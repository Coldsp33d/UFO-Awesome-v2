crossing the sky from left to right. when the light passed behind a group of trees, i waited for it to emerge from the other side, but it never did. i then noticed a very large glowing light that would flash atop a big tree in my back yard. it then fell like a leaf a few feet further down the tree and continued to glow, flash and change colors, including a red and a blue-green. it then went dark and flashed 50 feet over to the the right, went dark, reappeared and changed directions and then hovered by a tree in my neigbors yard for a few seconds. it then reappeared again several hundred feet over to the left and back in my yard before it disappeared. i felt so bewildered that when i finally went to bed, i couldn't fall asleep. i went back out to the patio around an hour later and after several minutes saw a larger(but still small) diamondish shaped object crossing the sky about 75-100 yards away, while pulsating/fluttering brilliant lights that were changing from red, to white to blue-green. i observered it in this solid form for at least 90 seconds before it disappeared into the night.","distance":"21-100

a strange object travelling very swiftly from the south to the north, passing below ursa major toward auriga (to the right of capella) in the north at approximately 11:50 p.M. on saturday, may 26, from edmonton, alberta, canada? very strange indeed... i was outside putting my bedding plants into my shed for the night (heard there might be some frost tonight) when something caught my eye (i always look up especially on a beautifully clear and pleasant night like tonight as i am an astronomer).  i noticed a strange red ball like object moving rather swiftly, from where i first noticed the object slightly west of zenith moving to the north to the right of capella as seen from my backyard in edmonton, alberta, in the castledowns area. it moved faster than a satellite but in a similar way, made no noise, did not get brighter as it moved toward the north, definitely not a bird (more like an aircraft but no audible sound was heard), did not look like a meteor (magnitude maybe around 0 to -1 but very diffuse as i had to strain to try and make out any shape).  just looked really stange and very different over any other aerial phenomenon that i have seen in my life. it could have been a meteor but it would be the first time that i have seen a semi-bright meteor like this as it did not flare, did not have any ionization trail or any fragmentation.  to me it looked like some diffusely defined object moving rather quickly (faster than a earth orbiting satellite and even a jet aircraft but slower than some of the slower fireballs that i have seen).  maintained a true course to the north with no deviations in its flight path.\r\n\r\njust wanted to see if anyone else may have seen anything tonight since this is something that i have not seen before. wish i had my 11x80 binoculars with me but it just moved too swiftly for me to even think about getting them. maybe lasted a whole 10 seconds to go from near zenith (slightly west of zenith when first seen) to the north when i lost sight of it over my neighbours house.  really strange.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I stayed overnight in the holiday inn express in downtown columbus, one of the upper floors.  i was watching out the window to the south, overlooking rich st. when i observed two objects further south slowly descending, not much higher in altitude than the floor i was on.  at first i thought it was a parachuter descending, but i quickly realized that the upper object and the lower object were about the same size as each other.  also, the objects were descending at a very slow rate, much slower than a parachuter would.  i live near an airport and frequently watch parachuters float down and so i am quite familiar with what that would look like.  the objects appeared to be connected to each other by a rope or other cord of sorts though i couldn't see the cord.  i was led to believe this because the distance between the objects was always the same, i later estimated the distance to be around 10 feet.  the objects were both black, and if they were painted then it would have been gloss black because at times the sun would glint off a surface on the objects.  they appeared to be round or circular one one dimension and somewhat flat on the other, so the shape was something like that of a tire.  in fact, i believe the size of each object to have been about the size of a large tire, possibly a little bigger.\r\n  the objects continued to descend lower, and it finally occurred to me that they were closer than i originally thought when they began to descend below tree-level.  i could see that they were in front of some houses/buildings that were on the south side of the i-70/i-71 freeway, yet they were falling behind some 2-3 story buildings that are on the north side of e. engler st. between washington and grant ave.  at this point, i could vaguely discern what appeared to be a pole, but more likely a rope connecting the objects, and a rigid pole extending above the upper object by 5-10 feet.  gradually, the object descended below my line of vision, and i had written it off as a balloon or other object.  a few minutes later, the same objects rose above the treetops about two blocks to the west, near a church.  they ascended somewhat fast, faster than a balloon would but definitely not like a rocket.  the ascent was somewhat steady, at times it appeared the lower object was swinging around below the upper object but from what i could tell it was not in reaction to sudden movements by the upper object.  the objects rose to between 1000 an 2000 feet above the ground and from that point on, the altitude didn't appear to change much.  mostly the objects stayed in one area, moving horizontally somewhat.  i could see the clouds being blown by the wind (not very fast) to the southeast, but the object was not being moved by the wind  i observed it in this position for 5-10 minutes and then it started moving to the north.  it finally passed beyond my range of vision, limited by a sill from the floor above me.  it would have passed just to the west of the hotel moving northbound.  approximately 20 minutes later i went outside, but i couldn't find the objects in the sky anywhere.\r\n  during the time the objects were observed, i witnessed three helicopters and several small and large airplanes fly by, and the objects bore no resemblance to any aircraft whatsoever.  i wondered if they were balloons of some sort, but had that been the case, the wind would have blown them to the southeast (they went the opposite direction).  there was no apparent means of propulsion or lift that i am familiar with.  at the time, the skies were cloudy and though it was quite warm outside, the potential for thermal activity that might explain the lift was low.  winds were light, i could see branches moving on a tree about one block to the south, but only if i looked very closely.\r\n  later i walked to the area where i observed the objects descend, there was no evidence that the objects were ever there that i could see.  i took note of the size of trees, buildings, a pole, and other objects and later looked out the same hotel window at those objects to get some perspective on size, and this is how i reasoned the size of the unidentified objects.  i did not attempt to take photos or video of the objects because i was quite certain that it would not appear in the photos due to the size/distance of the objects.  i heard no sound, nor did i observe any unusual phenomena associated with the objects.","distance":"501 Feet -

and friends had actually been at the sweet spot watching the eclipse and we were returning home for the night. we were about to go into the house when i saw a bright orange light in the sky toward the side of our house, so i walked over to investigate. when i got to the side yard i saw that there were many of these orange orbs, all appeared solid and were flying low to the ground, barely above the trees, however they didn't make a sound! they were moving from south to north. i like to think they were flying from the sweet spot too. :)\r\n\r\ni quickly started calling my family and friends over to witness this, and my friends started taking pictures and video. the orbs were in groups of three and four, no pattern, and they faded and disappeared right above my house. we could see others coming from the south as the ones nearest us were fading and disappearing. we saw at least twelve orbs, and i was able to take pictures with my cell phone. usually my cell phone doesn't take very good pictures, but i was pretty impressed with the pictures it took that night! i wish my phone could've taken video. part of why i've waited so many days to report this sighting was so that i could include my friends videos and pictures, but they live out of state and left the next day, so i've decided not to wait for their pics and vids, and just report this sighting with my pics. \r\n\r\nit was incredible to see these orbs, and now i can't stop looking at that part of the sky hoping to see more. \r\n\r\nthe lights appeared to be orbs when seen with the naked eye, but in the pictures i've included they seem to be different shapes. in the picture with three objects, you can see one fading and the two that were right behind it are brighter but they also faded and disappeared when they got to the same spot in the sky.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

party and a few anonymous online witnesses. event happened around 11:45pm may 25th. facing east on university blvd in orlando, fl we saw three amber glowing objects hovering above the street in a triangle formation slowly moving east with a counter clockwise rotation of 10-20 degrees. estimated elevation 1500 feet. estimated size 100 feet. this lasted 60 seconds.\r\n\r\nafter relocating 1 mile south of that location, onto a highway over pass, we saw the same three lights fade in and fade out. traveling shortly behind were three more triangulated lights that appeared and disappeared, this happened for a duration of 5 minutes, objects traveled ssw at 20 knots for a distance of 1/4 mile. there were two commercial jets in landing pattern flying past objects nnw by 10 miles, there was a single engine plane headed w one mile s of us. \r\n\r\nwe relocated closer to a lake view and a clearing. upon relocation (5 minute drive) there were now roughly 9-10 objects all within a square mile, variations in altitude from 1000 to 1500 feet. it was hard to distinguish triangulation at this time because of the quantity and movement or amber lights. a commercial airliner was n of us heading s and appeared to maintain its landing pattern and from our angle was positioned just above the group of objects. the objects trajectory was a steady, but semi variable, upward motion gaining altitude for a period of 90 seconds. the objects maintained a grouping of 500 feet between lights and appeared to be in a random formation. after reaching what appeared to be 10,000 feet of altitude the amber lights dissipated within a period of 10 seconds. the commercial jet at this time had already made it to the horizon line s of us and no further jet traffic was observed from the n side.\r\n\r\nwe used a canon rebel to take one photo at raw which is attached it was the best one we had of the group, you can see clearly the three lights. there were more but they didn't come across on the camera. it was my roommates camera that i borrowed quickly so i didn't know how to shoot with it.
