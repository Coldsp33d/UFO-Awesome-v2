with my dog. i was in a chair that faced the direction of about 180-185 degrees. i happened to look up to see an aircraft i heard. i saw the airliner- on a course of about 350 degrees, around 3000 feet agl, to my west.  \r\ni also noticed a very dark, solid appearing object at about 85 degrees above the horizon. it was moving \"slowly\" in a northeasterly direction. it made no sound that i was aware of. it appeared to be a \"flattened circle\" in shape and was seemingly \"turning end over end\". it had a very definite, sharply defined shape. it reminded me of what i would imagine a lp record would look like in the air, but it had a definite \"thickness\". (i know, a circle has no \"ends\", but that is the best way to describe the movement). as it \"flipped over\" and seemed to \"wobble\", it reflected the sun light. it did not appear to be a bird, nor did it appear to be an aircraft. it had an apparent speed of about that of a soaring bird, but seemed to be higher than i have noticed birds flying in this area. it struck me as being solid, and \"metallic\", but that is just my opinion. as i have no idea of the altitude, i have no idea of the size, but it appeared to me to be between the size of jupiter and the size of an aspirin at arm's length. it was under the very broken clouds.\r\nafter about 15 seconds of uninterrupted observation (by now it was just past my apparent 90 degree point heading to the ne it seemed to disappear. what was odd was that the sky where i last saw it seemed to \"shimmer\" for a brief moment.\r\ni had been outside for about 15 minutes; and am in relatively good health. i have spent years as an amateur \"skywatcher\" with binoculars and telescope.  i do have to admit this is the first thing seen in the air in my 61 years of life that i have not been able to explain. at first i thought it was  kite, or perhaps a balloon, but it did not seem to move like either.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":38505,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.67316169978356,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05252012-0011","longitude":-86.129704218355,"occurred":1337989500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1337993266000,"summary":"Dark, reflective circular object that \"disappeared\" after about 15 seconds of observation.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"46227","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Indianapolis, Indiana","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:3403"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Zwevegem","country":"Belgium","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was winter and i was with my mom and dad at our grandparents house.\r\nit was already dark outside and i was staring out the window, watching the fields behind their home and the city lights on the horizon.\r\n\r\nall of a sudden i saw an object hovering behind one of neighbours' trees. \r\n\r\nthe tree is approximately 4 meters (about 12 feet i guess) away from the window and about 4-5 meters high (ca. 12-15 feet), but the object appeared much farther away (the object seemed to be about 300-500 meters away). still the object was at tree level, so must have been hovering pretty close the ground.\r\n\r\nat first i only saw three lights, positioned in a triangle shape. they were red, blue and green and they changed colours in a random way, but there were never two lights which had the same colour at any given time. \r\n\r\nso at first i thought it was the reflection of something in the house (like those small 'party lights' you can buy at the kids store), but when i looked behind me i couldn't see anything projecting such lights.\r\n\r\ni looked outside again and i couldn't really figure out the shape of the object, but because we live in an area that has a lot of light pollution (which makes the sky look brighter), i could now at least tell that it was an object and not just lights, because i saw a silhouet that appeared darker than the nightsky.\r\n\r\nit hovered a little longer and all of a sudden it flew away at an amazingly fast speed, right into the sky and disappeared.\r\n\r\ni the whole event took about 2-3 minutes.\r\n\r\ni was kind of intrigued at first and kept staring outside to see if i could spot it again. when i couldn't find it, i asked my family, who were standing a bit further away, if they saw it too, but they didn't...\r\n\r\ni didn't really bring it up ever again, but besides from the exact date (because it has been 7 years) i remember the experience quite vividly, which i find a bit strange.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet -

the west to east while finishing cooking on the grill. we���ve spent many a night satellite watching over the years so it is second nature to peer upwards any chance we get.  she called me outside to see a different object in the sky. it had a definite disc shaped and appeared to be on fire. it was moving from the south to north approximately 90 degrees above horizon at highest point. color was a very bright orange and it did appear to be on fire. it moved at a constant speed, no wavering, and at a pretty good rate. sky was clear. altitude undetermined, but if i had to guess i would say 3,000 to 5,000 feet if not higher. size of object was about the size of a 737 at that altitude, but again object was disc shaped. i have an aviation background and i immediately looked for but did not see a contrail, no noise, no strobe or recognition lights. no glowing, or trailing debris, or smoke trail like you would see with a meteor or boloid. no sign of a balloon attached, like one of those party balloons that are sent aloft via a candle. \r\nthis was no candle and balloon. object was way too bright, too big, and moving too fast for wind conditions, which were calm to light out of the south east. it appeared to be on fire because of it���s color and the way it looked around the edges, changing in shape ever so slightly like a flickering flame, but the brightness and intensity were constant throughout the object and never dimmed the entire time in view. duration of sighting was approximately 7 to 10 seconds. did not have horizon to horizon view of object due to trees and houses,

state road and drove about 1/2  mile i noticed 3 bright white lights about 2 miles straight ahead. i live in the country and at this time i'm driving on a paved road. where i see the lights is where the paved road curves to the right but a gravel road goes straight ahead. as i get close to this gravel road, these lights are getting brighter and brighter. i'm wondering to myself \"when did they put up a tower down this road?\" and the closer i get the brighter these lights are so then i'm thinking to myself, \"man, the people who live down this road are gonna be mad about these bright lights on this tower!\" i pulled out my cell phone camera to try to catch a picture but with the lights flashing and the delay on my camera i kept missing the shot plus i didn't want to be late for work. i really wasn't thinking ufo at this time but as i kept on driving around several more curves i kept seeing these lights flash for several more miles and then i was out of range. i thought about these lights all night at work. the next night,wednesday 05-16-12, i looked for this \"tower\" but it wasn't there. this is when i thought it might have been a ufo. when i got off work at 7am on thursday morning i drove down this gravel road to see if i could see any signs of a tower or any farm equipment that could have made these lights. there was nothing. i haven't seen them since but i did post it on my facebook and one of my friends who lives about 10 miles or more from me said that she and her husband saw strange lights that night as well.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

years now at this time of night and am familiar with the airplanes at night.  but this wasn't acting like an ordinary airplane. it struck me odd, it was fairly low and appeared to be hovering. it looked so odd.\r\n  i was driving 65 mph and kept getting closer to the bright lights.  then i did see some faint red lights and reassured myself that it had to be a plane.  kept driving closer to it until i passed right by it.  it was on my right, just on the other side of the eastbound lanes.  it was not moving. it was indeed hovering.  difficult to drive, because i just kept looking at it, so i slowed down. \r\n  it was just hanging there. a triangle shape with 3 very bright lights at the corners and a little red light near each big white light.  don't think it was huge as it seemed really close, hovering just above the tree line. never seen any kind of craft just hover in one place in the sky.  became afraid and drove very fast home.","distance":"21-100
