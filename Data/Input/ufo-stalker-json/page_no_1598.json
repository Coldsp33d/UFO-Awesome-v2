a very strange thing for me to see. i have lived with this strange sighting for about a year now always wandering what or if i really saw those two objects in the sky; deep inside i know that i did. if you have not witnessed  you will never know the feeling of unknowing. i feel that has somewhat changed me and the way i look at things. i now wish that i never saw these things!\r\n\r\n6. they

barcroft shopping center.  this area is higher elevation and beyond the shopping center is a panoramic view of skyline office complex.\r\n\r\nit was a clear early morning with sun coming up in the east the sky  blue with an yellow/orange glow in the east.  \r\n\r\nwas sitting in car facing east at traffic light looking directly at the shopping center.  at the intersection, the road makes a curve to the left going to route 7.  \r\n\r\nupon coming to traffic light noticed how clear and blue the sky looked, but notice a few thin elongated very dark grey clouds in the sky. the clouds got my attention because they were so grey.\r\n\r\nat about 10 o'clock on the windshield of the car, i noticed what initially appeared to me to be a dark spherical cloud.  my eyes glanced at it and then turned away back towards the traffic light, initially thinking it was a cloud, but then the sperical shape caught my attention.  when i looked again, i realized the object was not a cloud, but a craft.  \r\n\r\ninitially the object seem to have a haze arond it similar to a cloud, but this then disappeared.  i was able to obtain a clear, unobstructive view of the object.\r\n\r\ni estimated the object to be approximately 1 to 3 miles away.  it was at least the size of a football stadium.  for the most part the object was stationary.  it was simply parked in the sky.  it was initially flat towards the earth.  then it appeared to sort of slightly dip and then it made a turn so that instead of being flat towards the ground, it turned to look like a big grey dot on it's side.  \r\n\r\nafter the turn, the object still just hung in the sky.  i had an excellent view of the surface. the surface appeared to be for the most part a smooth and solid. the surface did not appear to be really anything special, it basically looked like the surface of a car.  it was a dark grey color very much like a dark grey color that became popular on some cars such as the pontiac grand prix.  \r\n\r\nalthough the object appeared to be completely solid, in a semi-circular patern around the top edge of the object, i saw these lines form.  suddenly, a semi-circle of beautiful red lights appeared flashing from right to left.  they flased in sequence one after the other. the lights were separate and somewhat rectangular shaped elongated side by side with the narrow sides touching each other.\r\n\r\nthe encounter was really spectacular and this viewer thoght that a historical event was taking place. however, activity went on as normal.  in the distance, well beyond the shopping center and sky line, air planes could be seen taking off from then national airport. during the encounter nothing unusual took place.  there were no jets in the sky or people getting out of their cars.  thought this was strange.\r\n\r\nunfortunately, shortly after the lights started flashing the traffic light change.  back then had to get to work.  however, thought i would be driving in the direction of the object and would get even a better view.  this was not to be.  after the road curved beyond the intersection in decended down to lower elevation, and the object was never seen again.\r\n\r\nit should be noted that the object appeared to be in the bailey's cross roads area which is just a stone's throw from the pentagon.\r\n\r\nrushed to car after work and turned on the radio to listen to the news for reports on the object.  nothing was reported.  watched all the local tv news broadcasts that evening and heard nothing about the object.  purchased all the local newspapers the next day and found nothing about the object.  \r\n\r\nwith regards to the question about witnesses, i don't know how to answer.  the object was very big and the assumption was that it would be a major news event.  therefore, the assumption is that many people witnessed it.\r\n\r\nthe thing that really impressed this viewer is the way the object just hung in the sky. the object clearly owned the sky.  it was methodical and behaved in an unhurried manner without any apparent concern.  \r\n\r\nthe viewer did develop a sense that the object was suppose to be there and there was a pupose for it being there.  it sort of gave off the feeling to the viewer that one gets while seeing a parked taxi with the engine going waiting to pick up a passenger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

the sky that was blinking those colors rather quickly. it was only slightly larger but i thought it might be a super nova. it was approximately 300 degrees nw in the sky above the rooftops of nearby houses. it stayed there for about 3 hours then when i came out again it was gone. tonight i had seen the report on channel 5 news and was excited because it was exactly what i had seen the night before. i walked outside and called my father and when i looked up into the sky where i had seen it previously i saw it again, only it was now about 312 degrees nw and it was about the size of a star. as i talked talked to my father i watched it slowly move to the north from 312 degrees to 319 degrees to 324 degrees nw. it was right above the treeline this time instead of above the rooftops and if i moved forward i couldnt see it anymore. this all happened at 10:30pm on 5/23/12. im sure it isnt a star, but im not sure what it is exactly. i thought you guys should know, just in case you wanted

in a truck fire.  i have waited a long time but the facts are clear in my mind as though it were yesterday.  i was going to salt lake city utah heading west through colorado with another truck driver.  i was going to salt lake to hire on with kellie simon trucking. the exact date can be gotten from simon trucking as the day i started and this happened the night before. we were heading west on i-70 around the new castle/rifle area.  it was dark out and the sky was clear and i was talking to the driver that had given me a ride into salt lake so i could start my new job.  i was looking at him and a bright green oval shaped object decended rapidly it was trailing a tail of fire that extended from the edges out to about 3 times it's diameter.  it appeared to look like it was black about 20 miles out and an almost neon green glow around the entire edge unbroken.  it looked like the green you might see looking through night vision goggles or from a green calyume lightstick.  the fire trail it was leaving was very close to the same color with slight variances.  it came straight down and appeared to be larger than the mountains that were lit up by its glow.  i was sure it would crash into the mountains but at the last minute it leveled out and went due south behind the mountains. i kept watching for an explosion to indicate that it had crashed. but the mountains obscured my view and there was no bright light to indicate a crash.  i am assuming that it either kept going south or landed out of view.  i was amazed because i had never seen or heard of anything like that in all the accounts i had ever heard.  this is why i am posting here is to find out if anyone else has seen or heard tell of anything like it.  i told the driver of the truck,\"did you see that?\"  he was almost white from shock and he said,\" no, and you didn't either!\"  so, i assumed that he was extremely uncomfortable with the subject and i said no more of it except to my girlfriend several months later and my family a few weeks after when i got home to load up my gear to put on my truck.  i have only seen two ufo's in my life with my own eyes.  the one i related here and one in the idaho panhandle many years ago.  i am pretty sure we don't have a craft that can dive as fast as this object did and then pull out at the last second and change direction.  if anyone has seen anything like this i would really appreciate knowing.  i had no camera or even a cell phone with a camera the morning this happened.  so i only have the memory of seeing it.  i am pretty sure the other driver would totally deny seeing it if anyone could get him to talk about it. i could draw the craft as i seen it to this day the instant it changed direction will be burned into my memory till the day i die.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

a bird in flight. the object traveled from above the hedge to a tree approximately 30 feet away and promptly disappeared (glow turned off?), then reappeared heading away from the patio at the same speed as before. at an approximate distance of 100 feet, the object disappeared again, only to reappear momentarily on the roof of the single story apartment building across the street. at this time, the object changed in luminescent coloration from green to red and pulsated (dimmed and brightened) repeatedly until it disappeared once again and was again seen by my mother and one of her neighbors

lights. we parked in the driveway of an abandoned worn-down trailer and set up. after a few hours of viewing, we were talking about taking down the telescope and as my friend began to take apart the scope, i looked up in the sky towards the southwest in the general direction of gila bend. i saw a very orange light and then it went off and one came on in front of its location, as if heading in our direction. then, that light went out and another came on in front of it, closer to us. in all, 6 lights did this coming toward our direction and what to me appeared to be directly over the train track across the street. my first thought was that it went on light a lightning bug light does. it seemed like a natural light to me in that way when it went on and off. it was completely silent outside--nothing around--very quiet. by about the third light, i knew this wasn't normal and called my friend. he looked up and saw the light a few times before it went away for a while. i rushed for my flipcam and my friend rushed to put away the telescope, not comfortable with the weird lights. a few minutes later, we looked up again and saw them, in a slightly different location, slightly more southerly. it seemed like two lights that would go on and off separately and sometimes on together and seeming to move slightly, slowly in the same direction together. they were redder than a hps light, but still in the orange part of the spectrum. they were about 5 degrees off the horizon, about a degree apart, and about -2 magnitude (my astronomy/chemistry friend reports these definitions). these events would last only seconds, the lights being on anywhere from 2 seconds to 5 seconds and about a few minutes between showings again. the lights were interpreted by my friend as having a slight twinkling, but not as much as stars at that altitude. to me, they had that lightning bug quality of how they went on and off and how long they lit. my friend reports the lights going on and off as ramping on for a half second on and then a half second off. my friend got his binoculars and caught one light in the sights and it looked rather incandescent and not like a line source. he could see stars around the light, it was not blocking out part of the sky. there were no planes associated with the lights, though we had seen a few planes in that area, but not at that time. all together we witnessed these light events about 5 times. we finally had more than a few minutes apart from the last witnessing and the scope was packed and we were ready to leave, so we left. i did pull out the flipcam and got some choppy video of one of the lights. i am curious by nature and i was excited to see it, felt it was a strange wonder of nature. i had no sense of it being attached to a vehicle because of the random spacing of the lights. my friend thought it was very unusual and had never seen anything like it. he knew it was not any kind of star or planet. and, not any typical behavior of an aircraft. he thought it was approaching us at first and spooked him a little bit.

distance above me, i expected something. as it went over my house i moved further out into my back yard, watching as it went over my house and continued diagonally to my right until i couldnt see it

gone.

both noticed a light shoot up some 5 to ten miles away to the south east.Then the light dropped some and then seemed to hover,this caught our attention and really intrigued me and it also strikes me as odd.It was about 1:00 am and we just started to talk some more.The light just seemed like it was staying in one place so we weren't concerned till about 20 minutes went by and we noticed the light was getting closer moving really slow and really low. the light was faint but we could see it the whole time and we waited till we could see the craft or whatever with the naked eye,when we could see it ( an hr later)it was as over the freeway down the street,it was then we saw a dark craft approaching the size of a skyscraper(a close estimation)completely silent the craft was and so were we,we couldn't believe our eyes this thing was heading directly over us and it did.I/ we saw close detail.This thing was shaped sort of like a giant space shuttle from the front,bottom and back,but imagine the space shuttle with a lot smaller wings(my brother calls it the missile as a joke)kinda tucked in.You could even see the thing looked plated or tiled like the space shuttle,the thing was mostly a unique green color with some red outline (or accents) there were no windows that we could see and i looked good,there was only one light under the craft which was located on a protrusion on the ship that resembled the passenger area from a blimp but there were no windows( the light blinked like a slow strobe.This craft made no noise ans even blocked out all noise and the sky when it was overhead,only when we we directly under the center of this long craft that it made a faint rumble or thrust noise,the noise came and went quick,this thing was as long or longer than my mothers street( not kidding)it was moving a a fast walking speed and and took a couple minutes to completely pass over,when it did we could see a very large propulsion  or thrust area that took up the whole back of the ship,it resembled a large rocket thrust that was quite dimmer and completely silent. most importantly is the fact that this thing should have just fell down,there is nothing that could hold something like that in the air at that speed, on a strange note the red and green colors resembled russian or soviet colors and it did look like a giant man made missile/shuttle. then the thing just continued on at slow pace like it was headed toward canada. we hadn't a camera or we would either be famous or assaniated,we did call the local police station to make a report assuming others must have seen it and also called but we were only young teens and they didn't take us serious,or treat us nice,any way i've been looking for another like sighting ever since,i believe in ancient aliens
