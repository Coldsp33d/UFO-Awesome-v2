porch to watch solar eclipse as it was almost complete to witness to the left of it north by northeast a bright blair's white red object bright as venus in the early morning. trying to figure out if it was a planet or star but couldn't be a planet as it was not on the normal plane of rotation on sky. if it was a star i was thinking maybe the eclipse had askewed the star light making up 4 different orbs together with different lights. i stopped watching the eclipse in focus all my attention on the lights 20 degrees north of the sun. still staring at the illuminus lights of object. the sun went to full eclipse, and a second object appeared a mile or so next to it on left. a small black looking sphere it seemed with a red light at 9 o'clock and green at 3 o'clock, one turned off as the other turned on repeating. now i'm staring at two objects. the illuminus orb like object had electric blue color on right side and red on left and white on top like 3-4 orbs all in one. i looked for 2 mins or so. then as total eclipse started to move on and end the biggest bright one, noticably 5-10 larger than black object, moved in a straight path north by slightly ne. stopped instantly, hovered for 15-30 seconds, and continued on same path again fast as a jet fighter. the craft did not start slow and accelerate, it just went from 0-fast instantly away from a stopped position.\r\nthe same craft continued away till beyond trees in my field of vision.\r\n\r\nthe second object, sold black, eery to see in a blue sky, lost flash of green light as sun starting to get brighter, and then only red light visible. then red light disappeared, and it was a solid black object floating but not moving. then it too took off on same exact flight path as larger illuminus one but did not stop. went from 0-fast instantly. and it too went beyond trees in my field of view.\r\n\r\nwhen i first went out on my porch and was staring at the orb which i thought was a star there were two airplanes in the sky. one behind it cruising at high altitude 25000 or higher and a second one heading east low under 5000 feet away from st.Louis int' airport. all this was within 10 miles of stl airport so i would think it should have been caught on radar. these were not helicopters or harriers the only military crap that fly over are f-18s. the two objects i saw where none like any aircraft i had seen military or civilian. and helicopters cannot achieve fast flight in less than a second plus these objects moved as fast as an aircraft 450 mph or faster instantly away from me.\r\n\r\ni did try to use my camera phone to capture pictures, i got two, but the camera would not pick up the same visual effect that i could see with my own eye and then switch to video and started to get an image but my phone shut off because of a bad core in my battery, as it is a three year old phone. the pics is a bright dot in sky like all other pics and does no justice as to seeing with own eyes, wish i had hd digital camera at time, but this lasted 5 mins or so as eclipse happened.","distance":"Over One

to move se away from my vantage point. then i noticed a normal plane flying in the distance (not approaching chicago, but provided comparison between the two objects). the confirmed airplane sighting had sequenced flashing red lights, with a dull, white base-light. the unidentified object (ufo) i speak of had a much brighter glow - to the point of saturation when looked at through binoculars and no flashing lights at all. \r\n\r\nthe ufo had a strong fire color as it's base making up the body of the object. this was a huge light. it looked like it had a crown with three triangle tips, it was s bright - but i cant be sure if this was again light saturation. the edges of the objects would change from bright green, yellow and red depending on what angle i viewed the object through my binoculars. however, these were not flashing or sequenced in any way. it was really just how i looked at the object through my binoculars. looking straight on, the object was a singular gold flame with the shape resembling an oval blob. the shape did not have any specific edges or directional vectors to create any unique shapes.\r\n\r\nthe object remained in view for over 30 minutes ~a full hour, when it went behind a building and i could no longer see it. the object gave the appearance of moving south east (east heavy) across the lake (away from the chicago shore line)\r\n\r\nit could have been one of those lanterns people light on fire and let off into the sky. but - i don't believe it was, as it was much bigger than any normal lantern i have ever seen. also the flame remained

this low light made for a super blurry pic. but, this might help identify some other features. please note: image 1/3 is the best to demonstrate shape & the colors i was seeing. images 2/3 - 3/3 were

size perspective goes- they were the size of a typical pearl bead held at arms’ length.\r\n\r\n i estimate they were traveling at a distance of about 10-15,000 feet and were completely silent and their airspeed was approximately 200-300 mph. the objects’ color never changed.\r\ni watched the objects break formation when they were directly overhead and begin moving in a somewhat straight line as they gradually disappeared into the northwest sky.\r\nthis part of the sighting lasted about 2-3 minutes.\r\n\r\ni then saw another of these objects traveling along the same flight path approaching from the southeast sky at which point, i ran inside my house to get my wife outside as a witness to what i was observing.\r\nwe both watched this object through my binoculars as it headed in a straight line into the northwest sky. same estimated airspeed, size and distance as the other objects.\r\nalso, at this point, i noticed several neighbors down the street from us standing in their

august.  we were on route 87 and took the exit (number?) onto youngs road near the town of  westport.  the area was quite desolate with thick forests and mountains.  the only building visible was the hilltop motel.  when we were on the exit ramp, we saw a ufo in the sky beyond the motel.  it was very large (about the size of a baseball field) and was hovering above the trees. it may have been descending while hovering. it had multiple flashing lights of various colors.  the lights seemed to be pulsating or moving in a circular motion.  it was dark so we could not see the outline of the object but, based on the lights, it seemed to be roundish or disc-like. once we got off the ramp, we were no longer able to see the ufo.  \r\n\r\nmy husband and i are well-educated rational people and did not have strong opinions regarding aliens. however, we were both immediately convinced that what we saw was an alien spaceship.  the only man made flying objects we know of that hover are helicopters and maybe drones but they are much smaller.  a few days later we stopped at a gas station in the area and told the woman working there what we had seen.  she said she was not surprised because there had been other sightings of ufos in the area.  she said \"there are strange things going on around here\". \r\n\r\ni later looked at google satellite map and noticed that there appeared to be a clearance in the woods in the shape of a circle near where we had seen the ufo.  there were no other buildings anywhere nearby besides the hilltop motel - just dense forest. \r\n\r\nover the next few months we became skeptical about our initial conclusion that we had seen an alien spaceship.  we decided it was probably some unusual man made aircraft.\r\n\r\nlast week we were up in that same area of new york for the first time in four years.  i recognized the gas station that we had stopped at back then.  i decided to go in there and i told a man working there about the ufo we saw four years ago.  he told me that not only have other ufos been sighted in the area but that crop circles have been found.  he even said one farmer discovered his sheep gutted and turned inside out with no incisions.  i asked how he knew about all this and he said word of mouth and online duscussions.  he also told me that recently the government blocked off an area in the woods. he said he did not have the guts to check this place out but that a friend of his went there and found signs stating that trespassers would be shot.  the government does not usually post this type of warning unless the area is top secret. he believes the government only recently sealed off the area after the many unusual occurances were reported.\r\n\r\nall of this information made me more convinced than ever that the ufo we saw four years ago was from another planet.  my guess is the crop circles and animal mutilations were done by aliens  and that our government is secretly investigating these strange activities.  perhaps the aliens are visiting that part of the adirondacks because there are objects there they either need or want to study (vegetation, minerals, rocks, animals, etc). or perhaps they just feel comfortable there because it is so isolated. \r\n\r\ni am hoping you all will investigate these reports of various unexplained occurances in that part of new york. i would love to know what you find out. thanks.","distance":"21-100

it was midday and i marveled at this sight. from my initial vantage point, it looked like this string of spheres had started low to the ground.  within seconds they had reached an altitude of approx. 3000 ft. i work in army aviation and am fairly confident of the alt.  several of the spheres shot straight up and out of sight the remainder seemed to float aimlessly into a pattern.  that's when i grabbed my ipad and took the video. i clearly filmed what i thought were 3 spheres which had formed a triangular pattern, but in the video i see one or two more .  one of my students also witnessed this event, but not from the beginning, only after he saw me run for the ipad and start filming.  we both agreed this was high strangeness.  the event ended with the spheres gradually moving in an eastern direction out of sight , while still in a triangular pattern.  one of the objects appeared to be more reflective than the others.  i have ruled out reflective balloons based on the way they flew. and the wind direction seems to have been out of the ne that day. not sure what these spheres were.   i got the feeling they were under controlled flight.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":86091,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":31.784445855576482,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08202017-0027","longitude":-106.3517542382444,"occurred":1489881600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1503272365000,"summary":"Observed several round, reflective spheres ascending in sky. continued watching them assume a pattern as they moved slowly from my sight.","tags":["video","floating","light"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":1503287150176,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/86091_submitter_file1__trim.2373C97EC04F4212A4A30DB935361AC2.MOV"],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":32,"maxtempi":90,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":24,"meantempi":75,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":16,"mintempi":60,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":32,"maxtempi":90,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":24,"meantempi":75,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":16,"mintempi":60,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":154,"locationName":"El Paso, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:1755"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Ship Bottom","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"They just flying up or in to a orbit. and hover  not to hi . then mimic a star . another  one comes firing up, glowing orange?
