 he wasnt hurt in any way which is sort of weird in itself since he is 76 yrs. old and falling hard to the ground should have somehow hurt youd think.  he was stunned and staggered back to the house....He was worried that he wouldnt make it back so there was a traumatized effect on him and feeling like \"what the ?? happened\".  the kids were really anxious so we had to down play the whole event while giving each other the wide-eyed look to communicate how crazy and wild it was to us too.  i tried to distract them with the whole procedure of getting ready for bed, all the while wondering what to do and keeping an eye on my husband to see if he was still ok.  i got them in bed and calmed down.  all this while, the lights were still there glowing and i wanted to go out there myself to see what would happen and to assure myself that we werent seeing an anomoly of some sort.  my husband said \"no way, youre not going out there\" so i had to temper my curiousity.  he said in the morning we will go out and see what it is.  so probably the last time we looked before going to sleep was around 11 pm.- they were still there and they hadnt moved.  we got up in a.M. and had to get kids and selfs ready and off to church, but as soon as we returned around noon, we changed and went out to find evidence that someone had spent the night out there.  we searched the area for a couple of hours all together that afternoon and found zero signs of anything having been back there!!!  no foot prints or tire marks or tent impressions or anything.  we live in the high desert so there is not much for ground cover....Lots of juniper trees but just sand underneath and we could not find any disturbances of any kind.  so now what are we to think??  and by the way, my husband has felt totally fine every since the incident and the sensation has not reoccurred so wed feel a bit awkward going to the doctor about it.  i wish we could know what the heck we had seen.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":38380,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.308572916977035,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05222012-0020","longitude":-121.32401199849697,"occurred":1337410800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oregon","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,   Rectagular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1337726603000,"summary":"We noticed two glowing lights behind our house. thought someone maybe camping out on the blm land but to make sure, my husband went out to make sure.  he got not even 1/2 way to the lights when he was zapped on one side of his head and knocked to the grnd","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"97756","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":3,"locationName":"Redmond, Oregon","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:3731"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Dover","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was at work (dover downs hotel & casino) on my lunch break along with 2 other coworkers, sitting on the bench out back of the hotel. one of my coworkers said why do they only have 1 light on, on the track, the other coworker and myself looked, i said thats not a light from the track, the other coworker said it just a plane, the coworker who first saw it said thats not a plane its not moving, i said it the aliens coming to get us like i was joking did not want them to think i was crazy. we sat an starred at this large bright white light in the sky, i pulled out my phone to try to get a pic of it it came out fuzzy i tried to get video of it it came out as static. i could not make a phone call, they checked their phones, theirs were not working as well, our two way radios were not working as well. we watched it from when it appeared to when it disappeared for what seamed like 3 to 5 mins. it was like a large spot light that just shut off and it was gone, we did not see it again. the coworker who first saw it said where did it go, the one who said it was just a plane said it went behind the clouds, it did not it was just gone. the coworker who said is was just a plane went into the building, myself and the other coworker sat outside and talked saying you dont think im crazy right it was there you did see it, it was not a plane, she then started telling me about other experiences she has had. i also told her about experiences i have had. the next night myself and the coworker were sitting outside on break again when another coworker from another department came out and over heard our conversation and started telling us he has been working there for 15 years and within the past 3 months he has seen strange lights outside over the track.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Me and my brother were coming back from reno nevada at about 12:00am. we stopped to let our dog out to run on gold lake highway. we went up the road and turned around less then halfway up the hill so we could see a-15. as we started to look down hill we noticed a car parked below us.I thought it was a cop car following us. it was parked above the road we came there on but below us and we never noticed another road. as we began to watch it, it began to look as though it was trying to make a 3 point turn. then it would shine its headlights at us then back away it did this several times. as it countinued to do this it started moving sideways and diagional very fast. it backed up and it looked as though it hit an invisable wall and the whole body of the car vanished leaving just the two headlights.The two headlights then began to chase each other. we watched this for about ten minites before one of the two lights flickerd and vanished leaving one light. the light that was left began to get brighter before shooting off leaving a tracer behind it.\r\nthen they came back. they started chaseing each other again before smashing into each other. when they collided they shot the smallest thin stream of red light into the air and one blue thin light into the ground. after that several red lights came down from where the first red light was shot. then a large light came from where the first two lights were. as we countinued to watch it it began to move in large circles around the vally as if it were searching for something. we could see the outline of it because its light was so bright. i told my brother to flash it with his high beams in the truck to try and get its attention. he refused because he dident know what it was. i then took my lighter and flicked it twice at it. it turned at us very fast and took what we thought was a picture with a fast bright yellow flash then it just turned and went about what it was doing before. as we sat watching this thing and wondering what it was several hundred small objects in the sky began coming into view. as we watched these objects come from either end of the sky we noticed that they were flying in formation. each side had a large half circle formation. as these two formations got close to each other they broke off into smaller formations and started chasing the other group. they seemed as though they would rush up to them with great speed and then back away almost like a jellyfish moves through water. but if the other objects dident move they would shoot blue tear drop shapes at them. when these would hit it would implode the object into a red dust. as these were in the sky the large object with the light was still searching the ground. my brother waited for it to come into view and flashed it with his brights. the object turned on us and came at us so fast. as it came at us the object would vibrate violently and then burst forward and then move back a little bit. it did this until it was very close to us and we could make out some detail of it. it was a ship with a neck on it. on the neck was a light that turned and looked at things. as the neck would turn the body would turn with it as one. the metals it was made out of was something i have never seen before. as it was coming at us we got a feeling it was warning us to leave. it felt intimidating as though if we dident leave something was going to happen. the vibrations from it was not something you can hear you can feel it through your entire body. we panicked and drove out of there as fast as we could. as we made it back down to the main road we stopped on the side of the road to try and pull ourselves together. i told my brother that we had to go back to try and see what that thing was. reluctantly my brother agreed. we got back to where we saw it all at and it was still there circling the valley ahead of us. we sat and watched all the ships in the sky and the big one with the light in the valley all night long. once morning started to come objects like shooting stars were falling out of the sky right to where the big thing was circling as though it was collecting the stuff falling out of the sky. as we were watching it collect stuff another one came up next to us atleast 20 feet away. it came over the trees and looked down the road all along the road and then it looked at us. its light was so bright that it light up everything in front and behind us. it kept looking at us then it just turned its head and left.\r\nconfused and a little scared we dident want to leave again incase our headlights got its attention again. we watched them all night until the daylight started to come. as light came they just blended in and vanished with the day light. as we sat thinking about what we saw we heard ssomething behind us we looked and thought it was a bear. but as we got to looking it looked like a man with two large dogs. but he walked on all fours. we waited and watched and he would walk over to piles of brush and lean over keeping his legs straight he would dig. it would start ripping the brush up with its hands. we rolled down the window and yelled at it. as it heard our yell it stood up, looked at us, and just turned and walked away like a human. so we started the truck and turned around to find it but it was gone. too many weird things happend that night to be just chance. a meteor shower, lightning storms and an eclipse.","distance":"21-100

because it was warm enough to sleep under the stars i'm pretty certain i was about to turn 9 years old and at the time was taking horse riding lessons from the lyons approx 1/4 mile up on the left from my grandmothers property.She had a son about 3 or 4 years older than me an a daughter a few years older than him.(please keep in mind i am 30 years old now and don't have a-lot of exact details i wish i did)i remember i was excited to have a sleep over, because of my constant relocating/moving i was able to make few long term friends as a child, estacada was the only place i lived frequently as a child, so i don't remember much about that particular day until we were laying in the sleeping bags staring at the clouds, very evenly covering the sky with small gaps not very thick at all infact i remember watching them pass in front of the moon and still being able to see the craters an the moons white glow coming through, theres a name for these clouds i just don't know it, i remember talking with them until they both fell asleep , now 7 miles out of estacada in the hills on the edge of the skinner loop valley elevation around 3000ft so these clouds are close like i wanna say 100 ft. maybe a little more above my perception could be off but i could recreate exactly what i saw with the right tools,so i'm just watching the moon n clouds wondering if its gonna rain when a large round green light zips over just above the clouds completely silent, it didn't even break wind, the light /glow strong enough to come through the clouds and its moving faster than anything i've ever seen, it does a straight line across the horizon ,which i can see for miles on the hill, disappearing behind the tree line, if i had to guess i'd say it was approx. 100ft wide perfectly circular and somewhat sphereish but more disc shaped. it crossed the horizon in less than a second. i have always been very aware of my surroundings and the way the world works i can remember cursing god at the age of 4 for the things i was going through at home, by the age of 5 and none of my prayers had been answered i swore him off all together, in the second grade i can remember the counselors walking the halls with me asking me why i spoke the way i did and acted like someone well beyond my years and was never able to connect and play with children my age,by the 7th /8th grade they wanted me to take 12grade reading and english to prepare taking college classes in high school i imagine i could find witnesses to all of this, but not to that night, i woke both of them extremely excited and tried to explain what i saw, they both insisted i was dreaming and told me to go back to sleep. that might have lasted about ten minutes and i remember being angry that they did not believe me and now i could'n sleep i knew what planes looked like and i had seen shooting stars this was absolutely neither, as i was laying there stewing over there disbelief the same object at the same speed  came directly overhead again just above the cloud line this time doing a perfect 90degree zigzag, there was no change in speed when it turned and this time maybe took just under 2 seconds to cross the horizon. at this point i was completely convinced i saw what i saw, i knew no aircraft known to the public could move like that, i didn't bother waking up the lyons children again i layed restless an somewhat afraid until sometime in the early morning when i fell asleep, when i awoke the lyons children had gone in the house an i was really wet, turns out it did rain later that night and they went in and left me out there which was poopy because i was very prone to swimmers ear with horrible infections, i told many friends about that experience and even the next morning went and asked my grandfather about ufo's. my grandfather jim lyons was a retired marine merchant mechanic that served full term in the military and served in japan in ww2. he killed many men the only reason i know that is because i heard him scream about it in his sleep every night, my grandmother n him slept in separate rooms because of this, blood curdling commands an screams for help, telling people to leave other people and on and on. he was always the authority and never joked unless he was telling an actual joke, i always looked to him for moral guidance as my father figures were less than worthy and i knew it, and when i told him what i saw his answer floored me. all he said was \"o yea they used to land in the valley when i was a kid\" in his slightly raspy calm voice i asked what they where doing and he did not answer. we never spoke about it again. he passed on 2 years ago. so 5 or 6 years past and who would become one of my best friends moved to town in the 7th grade his parents baught the property next door closer to ours. being my age and close by it made sense to hang out. i kept my distance being a towny and knowing everyone a little i wanted to see how he faired, sure enough his first day another friend of mine beats him up for a comment he made to a girl after she had said something rude, anyhow his folks took initiative and invited me to go skating with him (through my grandmother) and i agreed, that night was interesting aswell but long story short we became good friends and i got my buddies to lay off him as much as i could (anyone from a small town knows outsiders have to earn there welcome)so this movie comes out a few years ago called \"the fourth kind\" and its not the best movie ever but it gives me chills to my core like i've never felt and then i get curious an start seeing all this ancient alien stuff and want my friends to see this movie to see if anyone reacts the same. well my buddy watches it with me and he sais \"he's not to convinced an it was ok but - do i remember that night in the orchard (we used to sleep over an stay in a tent so we could smoke cigarettes n chew tobacco with out the grandparents seeing or his folks) in the tent an that light filled the tent\" i replied \"no?\"he then proceeded to tell me about a night when we were up late talking bout girls or whatever and a light so bright filled the tent he could hardly see me , he checked outside the tent afterward and saw nothing, when he told me that i got the same feeling i got during the movie and tried to remember and it hit me, i did remember the light but only the instant it came, and discussing it after with him was a blur, he said we talked about it in length. i could'n get much more information out of him but i know where the tent was and were 7 miles out of town on a rural road on 20 acres in an orchard 300yards from any driveway or road. the light i'm trying to describe is more intense than a dozen event spot lights. i would really like to under go hypnosis to try and remember this night i feel like there's more to this story. i can show exactly where i was for both these events, unfortunately at this time for legal reasons my buddy will have to remain anonymous but i am absolutely certain in the near future he would tell his side if i asked neither of us really care for attention outside our close circle of friends.   thank you

happened, perhaps on the 8th of the month.\r\ni was messing around with the tourist pedestal binoculars made of metal especially one which was working and not accepting coins. i was looking towards the falls and trying to see if i could see the falls and ny but its was to dark. \r\ni then shifted my interest on the stars. with in 2 minutes of looking at the stars i was panning the binocular and saw orange lights. i paned to quickly that it took me about 45 seconds to find the orange stars. only problems the orange stars were moving. one orange star was stationary while other stars were coming and going. i tried to follow the moving stars but they were moving too fast and it was difficult to pan back and readjust back to the stationary star. \r\ni yelled to my brother gabriel and ask him to use our 7 x 35 binoculars and look at that region of the sky and see if he can see what i was seeing. he did not see anything. i told to come here and look through this pedestal binocular and tell me if you see the orange triangular stars. he did not see them, and i re adjusted the pedestal binocular again and he did not see any orange triangular stars. he went toward my mom.\r\ni then took the black 7 x 35  binoculars and saw more of a wide field and saw the orange triangular stars. i said to gabriel come here and try not to move the binocular to much and tell me if you see them now. he did not see them. he thought i was messing with him. i took my 7 x 35 binocular and looked over the tree horizon of new york and the view was a bit much better to view but it was to dark. i did not see any lights that might had been reflecting onto the binoculars from the new york side. i took my 7 x 35 binocular and continued to view whatever they were since it dawned on me that i was not looking at stars. \r\nthey were all of the same size. one was always stationary then one would arrive next to the stationary object then another would arrive with in half of a second or less next to the stationary object, then one would leave from next to the stationary object, then three would arrive next to the stationary orange object and at the same time one would leave. they were doing many other incoming and outgoing patterns two leaving one would stay next to the stationary orange triangle. at one time i counted six triangle objects that came next to the stationary objects and remained for about 3 seconds. i switched to the pedestal binocular and continued to view these objects behaving the same way. about 30 seconds later the stationary orange triangular object was alone for about less than half of a second and disappear, i paned the pedestal binocular for a while about 40 seconds and found them. the stationary object moved because i remember i had to readjust the pedestal binocular slightly to my left about 1 inch or 1 and 1/2 inch at the most, and slightly upward. i switched back to my 7 x 35 binoculars and continued to view these objects for a short time no more than two minutes when my mom said that we have to leave. i do not think i was there viewing these object for more than 7 minutes. since my brother and mom were eating something they purchased at the area.\r\nthese objects were to far away to estimate there size. they were triangular in shape or cone shape. at times they seem to shift appearance more towards a cylinder and oval shape but it may have been my eyes getting fatigued, but for most of the time the shape was triangular. its colors was orange red and it remained only in that colored for all of these objects. i could certainly say that there was six of these objects, at the most perhaps 10 or more. the triangle looked larger and appeared to be more still with the pedestal binocular. i did not see these objects with my naked eyes, i needed the binoculars. the angle was some where about 60 deg. or 78 deg.  \r\nwhen i arrived at home i went to the neighborhood library and looked at books about stars, space and moon missions. one book mentions unidentified object. \r\ni was for about 2 months trying to understand what i saw. while in the school library i found a paperback book with kind of a black cover. i was looking at the drawings and pictures. i was shock to find hand pencil or ink drawings of the triangles. as i could remember the book stated that the triangular orange objects were report back in the 1800's. this even shocked me more because age 10 going to 11 years, i could not truly comprehend. i never saw the paper back again in the library. i have tried to look for these drawings again on the internet.\r\nwhich brings me to you! so i may tell you what i saw. maybe some other person, or people have seen what i have seen. perhaps maybe you can find the drawings of the triangular images with orange glow. or the pocket paperback book. what i do not understand even now is the time difference in years from the earliest 1800's description of these objects to 1975 when i saw these objects.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

which faces west-bound toward the coast of california.  we were sitting at my square table, i was facing west bound, 1 friend east bound and 2 northbound! we had been in a conversation when i noticed what appeared to be an airplane floating through the sky in the corner of my eye, had a green light on it, possibly a red and white light on it, but didn't really notice because it seemed like just another plane on a dark night! it was definitely multiple lights grouped together though! a few minutes later i notice a plane like structure in the sky again, possibly the same one before but noticed this because it didn't move like a plane! this object or objects were approximately across from me in the horizon of the ocean at say a 50-70 degree angle, moving rapidly east bound in my direction! by the time they were out of sight, i was looking up and could no longer see them because my house was behind me and i couldn't see where they went! these objects had shot from one end of the sky to the other in a matter of 1 to 2 seconds, they were moving fast! it is hard to tell an objects location at night, but it is to my knowledge that these objects were extremely high up, in the upper most parts of the atmosphere! one thing that leads me to believe they were at a high altitude was the fact that they made no noise! it was only me and the friend of mine sitting across from me who saw the objects, but my friend didn't realize the significance of the sight because he only saw them for a few milliseconds as he looked up and the objects shot over my house! what had made my friend look was, as soon as i saw the object at one end of the sky to the west, i said \"what\" and he looked up as my head had been turning to an upward position! the objects started as looking like one object of multiple light balls (like the multiple lights on a plane,only not blinking), one light being green which is the most memorable color to me, and another ball red and another being white! the few moments before the objects flew over my house, the objects split into 3 or 4 individual ball clusters abruptly and shot into their own directions! this is the main reason i knew it wasn't made by the standards of the aircraft as we know it! it was those few moments that the appearing as one object split into 3 or 4 objects at extremely high altitude moving at extremely high speeds that i knew what i saw! a ufo! a little more information, by the time the light balls had separated, they had changed into a white light!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

may 22 2012 around 8:35pm five of us walked out of my house in stouffville, ontario, canada (just ne of toronto) it was around sunset - don't remember seeing the sun setting & think it was already below the horizon. the temperature was comfortable - probably at least 20 degrees celsius. no wind. the west sky had a red-orange glow to it. the 5 of is witnessed what we feel was a ufo sighting. two brilliant red round objects emerged from the north, flew towards us in unison, and then changed direction to the west. i first thought the sun was reflecting off the wings of an airplane, but did not see an airplane shape nor did i hear any airplane sounds. i started a process of elimination & felt strongly it was not an airplane, a helicopter, a comet, or a balloon. the five of us were trying to figure what this was, but only figured out what it was not. my wife wanted her glasses so she could get a clearer view so i ran back inside the house, couldn't find her glasses and came out with a digital camera instead. i started filming at 8:36pm, but at that time there was a small penny sized white circle getting fainter - just like someone started to dim its light, and it disappeared. two minutes later the 2 bright red lights appeared again in same place that i saw the 1st set of two - in the north. i was thinking that what i saw did an elliptical type track - from the north, headed south, turned towards the west, and then circled around to its original position. i also thought that as an alternative this 2nd set may be a completely new set of lights (and not the 1st). i started filming it at 8:38pm.  the 2 objects appeared to take the same path as the 1st set of objects. i only saw bright red as the dominant colour. did not really notice the green until a replay of the video, and the white only when it started to fade in the west. i wasn't sure if the objects were fading because they were getting further away or the lights were dimming.\r\n\r\nafter the sighting we carried on walking, looking around and hoping to see more of what we saw. there were two other people in our neighbourhood who i asked if they saw that stuff in the sky. the acknowledged that they did & we spoke about ufo stories.\r\n\r\nin total, 6 adults & an 11 year old witnessed this event. \r\n\r\nthe attached video, by the way, is in its original form except that i removed and smoothed out

a little closer but not too close and i got two separate videos. i could hear it coming, it sounded like a jet, that is flying at a high altitude, but far away, the sound seemed strange,(there is always a lot of air traffic over my house and i am very familiar with various common aircraft, by sight and sound). it came steadily over the treetops toward my back yard and stopped just for a moment over a large tree near the woods behind my house. it was the very spot i had envisioned the triangle craft would show itself to me. //i had an encounter a few years ago a hundred miles away, with a huge triangle craft, which seemed to follow the path i was taking home from work,(over 30 min drive).\\\\ this one was not even close in size but was very fast and speed away at a quick pace as my camera got a lock on it. it seemed to have multiple sets of lights, each in triangle formations. it speed off, over the treetops in the same direction it was headed in and seemed to amplify its color significantly, glowing like fire. several minutes later as i was still filming, i noticed blinking lights, in a triangle formation. it was over my house, behind me, reflecting on my vehicle. my dog was acting very jumpy at first and then very calm and docile. i have to admit, i only try to draw good things to me, positive things but i was very nervous. my heart was racing and i was a little

while driving in timberlea near halifax, around 4:00 am today (may 21st, 2012) me and 2 friends all were startled by an extremely bright green light in the sky. we saw a long green trail of light going downwards as if it were crashing, and then the light flickered as if it slowed down some and now looked like a green fireball. the light trail lingered for about a minute but the object itself was only seen for about 6 seconds. we continued driving to the home of a friend who was there, and excitedly discussing what that interesting spectacle could have been. we all felt uneasy, sort of creeped out. the two of us that werent driving stared out the windows at the sky the entire time hoping to see more of this green thing, but instead we noticed a large number of lights moving overhead. they were the same color as the stars, but there were over 5 of them clearly moving in sight at one time, and they were all going seemingly random directions. some of them seemed to change direction at times. we thought for a moment that all these things could just be an oddly large number of airplanes going over, but after staring at them for longer, we could see that they were each only one light, withoud any blinking lights around them. they looked oval shaped. as we looked at them, some of them would become dramatically more bright for about 3 seconds, as though we were looking into a spotlight. it seemed to me like they were searching. by this point we were all extremely uneasy. the two friends i was with went inside to get food and a laptop incase something crazy happened where we may have been stuck somewhere on the way back to my house. as they were inside, i stayed in the car keeping watch on the sky, which was very abundant with stars. the oval shaped objects that seemed to be searching converged and then stopped moving. they seemed to be really high up, but quite close together at this point. their lights then began to pulsate sequentially, which they did for at least 15 minutes, and they then ascended. today through talking to other friends, i learned that 3 other buddies of mine happened to be out ridiculously early this morning too, and they also saw the brilliant green light fall from the sky. this isnt the first peculiar thing i've seen up there, so i decided i had to record the incident somewhere. ever since the massive rotating pyramid i saw in the summer of 2010, i've have aliens and whatnot on the mind all the time. its getting to me i

ascended. then, the 1st descended and the second ascended. i was entranced. this pattern repeated over and over for about 4 minutes. then, the two objects ascended together to about 200 feet above the
