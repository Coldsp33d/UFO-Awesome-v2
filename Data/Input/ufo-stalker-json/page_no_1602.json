however, i did not have my glasses on and could not see anything through my view finder, thus i only took a 19 second video clip from this vantage point.  the friend i was with suggested, i take still photos rather than video (which can be heard on the video) and then look at them when i get home to see what the object is by zooming in on the object if i actually got it in the picture frame. at first, i thought...Maybe it is a star...But i love looking into the sky at daytime and night time and i have never seen a star in this location at this time during the day.  due to the brightness, maybe it could be a meteor...But this had no tail, nor did it appear to be moving.  then the idea of a plane was in my mind...But again...This object was hovering...It was not flying in any direction when i first started my observation.  eventually, i thought it could be a balloon...But again...The object just hovered....It did not move up or down nor did it move side to side...It was stationary for at least 10 minutes.  i then thought...Maybe it is a weather balloon...But again...It did not move and it appeared to be too low for this type of activity.  additionally, the object was too high to be a hot air balloon.  the object itself over the 40 minute time frame appeared to be round but could change shape to triangle,square or diamond shape.  now over the next 40 minutes, my friend and i walked from mt. rubidoux across the bridge and to a fast food place (baker's) on mission blvd and up to limonite.  during that walk, i took 12 still pictures from different locations and 2 separate videos...One being 19 seconds long and the other being 39 seconds long.  i personally would have watched this object even longer and taken more photos and videos if my friend was not wanting so much to get home before the heat became unbearable...After all, we were on a 6 mile walk. yet in the time we did look at this object it did eventually move northward very slowly...In fact, we went into baker's and when exiting  about 10 minutes later, we could still see the orb.  also, during our viewing, i saw at least 2 airliner (jets) fly by...So commercial jets did have an opportunity to witness this object as well.  as far as making any noise...Neither of us heard anything.  eventually, i lost sight of the orb once i got to limonite and the sun was in my eyes...Making it too difficult to see at this point.  however, i do have to say, when i got home and looked at my photos something interesting appears.  remember, at the time, i saw only one object...And that is also noted in the first 19 second video; however, in my first still picture...There is a second object off to the right and when zoomed in you can see a very solid object and yet when i took my second still picture...The second object is gone.  we are talking literally seconds from picture to picture and i did not see or hear anything at the time.  yet for this object to be missing in the video and then in the first picture but not in the second picture it had to be traveling so fast that we just could not have seen it.  that is it.  so yes, i do have pictures and videos from different locations and i used trees, telephone poles, light poles and the mountain as reference points...So it can be verified.  i also did not erase them from my camera so if real scientist want to observe it and get the data from the original pictures and video they have that to reference as well.

performance of the thunderbirds around 4:15p.M. on sunday may 20th. \r\n\r\nthe show was due to end at 5:00 p.M. we intended to see what we could from a distance as not to become involved with an after-show traffic jam at the base.\r\n\r\nabout 4:20 p.M. we exited the north bound 215 freeway at ramona expressway and pulled onto a closed road, which led into an open field, to observe from a distance.\r\n\r\nthe thunderbirds were in action. six of them. they would fly in formation then break off from each other and perform spectacular flying maneuvers.\r\n\r\nwe stood aside our car and watched, as other cars and observers continued to join in, and park around us, to watch.\r\n\r\nwe were mesmerized and awe struck as time and time again the jets would fly over head, and around us, as the pilots re-aligned with each other for their next trick.\r\n\r\nat one point 4 jets came at each other from the 4 points of the compass- then went vertical together- and once again headed back out towards the 4 points of the compass... their contrails were visible... and at great altitude they were. i would have to say well above 7,000 to 8,000 feet in altitude. and then i saw them.\r\n\r\nat an even greater altitude above them i saw a fleet of at least 14-16 black spherical objects flying in a staggered but steady formation together, flying slowly in an east by south east direction above them.\r\n\r\ni know what i saw. and i know how easy it is to lose sight of an aerial object in the bright blue sky. i am also familiar with dead skin cells floating atop the eyeball and causing visual distortion effects. prior to this i had tried to observe with my sunglasses on. my vision was clearer with out them. the sun was to the west at this moment. i had no glare to fight as i observed what i saw with the naked eye.\r\n\r\nin my mind a fleet of black unidentified flying objects cruised slowly above the show, at extreme altitude, to make their presence known, as a show of force.\r\n\r\ni yelled out to my wife wife, and my son, if they saw what i saw but their eyes were elsewhere, and their response was that my eyes \"were playing tricks on me\"...\r\n\r\ni saw this distant, and distinct, black fleet around 4:45 p.M., above the air show, on sunday may 20th 2012----    and i just want to know if anyone else saw it!?\r\n\r\nas the thunderbirds split into 4 different directions at high altitude, in the center, above them, higher up in the sky, i noticed this fleet. i can only say that the sighting lasted for maybe 10 seconds at the most-then they disappeared from view, and i could see them no longer.\r\n\r\ndid anyone else see what i saw that day? did the air force or norad have them on radar?\r\n\r\nobserver sun city, ca\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

because this time was so crazy. \r\nthere was five of us outside when we noticed a huge, glowing orange orb floating from behind the trees and it appeared quite close to us. we considered for a second that because it was the may 24 weekend it was probably something from a firework, but very quickly it was extremely clear it couldn't have been. it came from the north and continued slowly along a straight path, then turned smoothly and went west, the direction we were facing in, into the distance until it was out of sight. it was in our sight for a little over a minute. \r\n\r\nupon observing these ufos, i had tears rolling down my face and spotting a ufo had never emotionally overwhelmed me like that. it was a strange feeling that i felt was neccessary to include.\r\n\r\nabout three or four minutes passed, and a second glowing orb comes from the exact same place but it was a bit closer, making it seem faster as well. it was orange and red, almost looking like a huge fireball. in the center of the orb however the ufo seemed to have a strange shape (almost like an hour glass/two triangles. it continued along the same straight path and then turned and went southwest until it was out of sight. \r\n\r\nthe last orb that we spotted was the closest and it was bright red. it appeared about three or four minutes later also and it this one was b\r\nvery frightening. it had a wild glow to it that was extremely red, a bright mezmorizing red and then it began changing colours between yellow, orange, white, blue, violet and red. it was absolutely insane. it quickly continued along the same straight path headed directly south from the north like the others, and also like the others it turned but continued going northwest until it was past the clouds. \r\n\r\nthey seemed to be below the clouds at first, and all three seemed to slowly go up after changing their paths. after the last one was out of sight, there was strange rumbling/roaring/nearly staticy noises that are very hard to explain. i felt scared for the rest of the night. there were no airplanes in the sky during the time of this spotting, but afterwards there were what appeared to be strange helicopters.

myself passed it off as a boat or something as im kind of a skeptic to ufo's. about ten minutes later it disappeared. later that night around 11:00 another light appeared in the distance. we first

like and intensely bright and mesmerizing. mostly emitted a white light but there where variations of green,red and orange lights around it. it also emitted no sound it was completely silent. we ran back to the car (5 miles through dark woods) once we started to leave we where followed by a strange black car just tailgated us for like 3 miles i dont know if this links to the lights but it was all

around 9:20pm just happened to be looking at a star almost straight overhead but around 20deg due south. object was star distance away, not plane distance. object very small - size of pin head, then got around twice the size venus has been recently - around the size of a small marble, after about 1-2 seconds got small again,  size of pin head.\r\n(at this point i thought i just saw a distant star blow up) but then it started moving due north to just past straight overhead. it moved much faster than a plane moves, and still at star distance but i would say it moved the 20deg in about 5-10 seconds. \r\n\r\nat this point i started to run in to get the wife and a camera but i didn't want to lose it in the sky so i turned around, looked back up and saw it move back to the south but lower in the sky - around 45deg. it went from due south - 45deg to horizon to due west 45deg to horizon in 1 to 2 seconds, during this time it appeared much larger, brighter and longer. appeared to still be at star distance, i think it looked longer because it moved so fast. \r\n\r\nthen it slowed down again (so it got much smaller - pin head size), started moving north and slightly up in the sky, i lost it behind some trees and didn't see it again. \r\n\r\nat this point i was pretty excited - sprinted to get the wife, came back out, didn't see it again.\r\n\r\ni've seen airplanes, helicopters, balloons, meteor showers, the space station and a number of shooting stars - this was none of those. this abruptly changed directions at least 4 times, changed size (closer/further away) at least 4 times. it also could have appeared to change size due to going faster/slower where going faster made it glow brigher thus appearing larger (easier to view).\r\n\r\nhaven't seen any other reports like this, can't believe i'm the only person that saw this but maybe just the first to report it. prior to this i didn't really believe in ufo's, i do now. with the distance and multiple changes in direction, this might be an experimental aircraft, but the speed it moved during some of the flight there's no way it is man made.\r\n\r\nif i left some things out please ask in the comment section.. thanks.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional

awake as the train pulled into the station at cleveland, ohio. it was early sunday morning, may 20th, about 2:30 am when the train stopped. i looked out the window only to see a number of ufos, seen as white orbs, as many as 8 at one time. the sky was clear with no clouds. they were circling around a skyscraper, near the top which ended with a pyramid type tower and a spire. i was totally lucid, wondering what they were as they encircled the spire, moving in different directions, blinking out, then re-appearing. they changed directions, almost as if they were drawing from the energy from a pulsating light on the top. at first, it looked like swarms of insects that would be attracted to light. then, i thought it might be a flock of birds. on top of the spire was ball of light that they seemed to be \"playing\" with. as the train remained at the station for almost 30 minutes, i watched them for almost as long. it was almost as if they were enjoying the chance to make themselves known. they would move in a swarm, then back away with some disappearing.

few years ago. it's the key building where i remember seeing a large lighted key as an insignia. it was way too high and distant for these orbs to be be insects, birds or other phenomena. \r\n\r\ni am a member of a mufon group in chicago, so i am very skeptical of these sightings, but this is something that remains a mystery for me. i looked at other skyscrapers in the vicinity, but saw nothing. it seems that this particular building has attracted them in the past. in my opinion, this was a ufo sighting. i took a picture with my cell phone which only showed the lighted tower in the distance.
