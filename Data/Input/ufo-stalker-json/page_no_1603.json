(the orange light on the bottom of the craft would get bright for 2 seconds and dim. this would repeat every 2 seconds.)\r\n    \r\ni saw that it was passing to my left about 200 feet away just above the tree lines over the alvin golf country club.  there was a break in the tree-line and i actually slowed and finally stopped the car when i saw clearly a black triangle shape passing by slowly.  it was silently and steadily moving about 15-20mph heading north-east.  i had my driver-side window down and watched as it flew past me and my car.  i immediately grabbed my camera and made a u-turn to follow it and attempt to snap some photographs.\r\n\r\ni hurriedly and excitedly snapped 4 photographs before it disappeared into the distance on its north-east path around 1:30am.  i was doing this while driving so the photographs have motion blur.  i have attached two of the photographs of the object where it can be seen as well as a rough-sketch from my perspective in the car.\r\n\r\nsome interesting observations:\r\n-the craft was black- although the sky was dark, i could easily see a dark triangular shape against the dark sky.\r\n-the craft was also relatively thick.  i would say that it was about 15 feet tall at most and about as big as a large car.  by my estimation, it would fit perfectly on a two-car driveway that many homes have.\r\n-the edges were not sharp but rounded.\r\n-i was shocked at how silent it was when it passed.\r\n-the pulsing light gave me the impression that it was a kind of signal to let other flying planes or helicopters see that it was there to prevent a crash.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

least the glowing orange light did.  the light did not blink like an airplane.  it possibly pulsated somewhat, but that may have been the effect of the atmosphere.  it curved gently to the east before it got overhead, and as it did, the light went out, and we saw a dark shape against the still-light sky.  we couldn't really identify what the shape looked like.  then another orange light came from the same direction he first had, and followed the same path.  we saw between 6 and 8 of these objects do the exact same thing.  sometimes two or three were within view at the same time, but all along the same path.  they seemed to move about the speed of an ultralight - on the slower side.  but they were close enough that we should have heard them if they were planes or ultralights.  no sound.  i looked at the objects with a spotting scope, but couldn't see any more detail in the shape.  just glowing, circular light, then a dark shape against the sky.  five of us witnessed the
