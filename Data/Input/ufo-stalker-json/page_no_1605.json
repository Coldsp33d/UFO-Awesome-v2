hoping to see bats in the fading twilight. i noticed a red glow at what appeared to be a high altitude that was moving due north at a moderate speed. assuming that the altitude was as high as it seemed, the speed was consistent with a conventional jet aircraft. the character of the light was nothing like any aircraft i have ever seen. it was a red hazy ball of light with a yellow/white light that seemed to be at the lower extremity of the ball, and which was flickering at an inconsistent pace. the yellow/white light almost appeared like a flame, but the red hazy ball did not seem to vary in it's appearance. as the object traversed the sky it changed course and speed slightly. when i first noticed it, it had just come into view from the obstruction of a large tree. i realized that i had my camera with me, and quickly switched it to video mode. my camera is an olympus fe230. i had nothing to steady the camera against, but some of the footage is pretty still. i also tried to get some trees in the view while zoomed out, but it was almost too dark to capture them. i called for my wife to come out to see, but she was in the bathroom and was unable to come out until it had faded into the north sky. in the footage, i saw two light dots that seem to move in and out corresponding with zooming the camera in and out. i feel that those two dots were caused by the lens, as they remain stable in relation to the frame. i was quite excited to see this phenomenon. the object gradually faded from view in the distance. i am a pilot and am very knowledgeable about aircraft and atmospheric phenomenon, and this sighting was unexplainable to me. i would also like to point out that the sky was perfectly clear. there were a few stars just starting to appear, and they were sharply defined.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

in the to film the movie the lovely bones ) we could see the traffic was stopped up a head. then we noticed that people were out of their cars looking up at the sky.As we looked up there was a giant craft of some kind, i mean this thing was huge as big as the mall and the parking lot all put together. there were a few white lights on the center of the under side and the craft made no sound at all. it just seemed to hoover there in the sky.The craft was a cigar shape brownist gray in color. there were many witnesses to this event. we watched it for about five minutes then continued home. after arriving we called our local radio station to report what we had saw, they were receiving many reports of the same object in the sky.That night it was all over the local news. and by the next day it seemed, it was completley forgotten about and never mentioned again, there was no explanation ever given for what we saw in the sky that night. to this day my sister and i wonder what it was that we saw. the date of the incident is approximate.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

was going on. we drove past the house that they were at past the rite aid parking lot when i looked back at the road and there was a craft above the road. i noticed that it was close to the ground for an airplane or helicopter so i was joking around and said, \" oh look a ufo\". that's when i noticed it had a weird shape for an airplane or helicopter it was shaped some what like a curved rectangle similar to a tel-per ware bowl. it had lights on the side of it with two columns of three yellow lights and then a third column with only the center light. it also had blinking orange light that appeared about every 5 seconds. at first i thought this couldn't be happening , i live by an airport and i see airplanes and helicopters come in all the time so that's what i initially thought it was until i saw how slow it was moving. i pulled over on the shoulder of the road, turned off the radio, and then rolled down my windows and me and my girlfriend heard no sounds. the craft was making no sounds and the usual night time sounds of frogs and crickets was silent as well. after we didn't hear anything we started to get very freaked out watching the craft move south to north. then the craft stopped and was hovering somewhere off to the north of miller road. we were already pretty frightened at that point when it started moving in the eastward direction. after that a car was driving up behind us and i decided to drive away. as i drove away i could see the craft continue it's eastward journey as i turned one last time. we were both legitimately scared at that point and didn't want to see what else happened. i drove her back to her house as we went over what we had both seen. i was very scared driving back home and i didn't know what to do thinking i might see it again but by the

flying insect to see if a light reflection on some kind of flying insect or animal may look the same. this was not an animal, a star, or any conventional aircraft. the sightings were seconds long, the dim, almost gray, single light did not blink or pulsate and did not have any accompanying red light like an airplane. it traveled maybe ten times faster than a helicopter and appeared to be below the rest of the stars. i first noticed the object because i noticed movement out of the corner of my eye and then directed my view towards it. at first i thought it must be a plane but as i had been seeing planes fly over for about an hour, i knew it was traveling much too fast to be any plane and had no blinking lights whatsoever. the light appeared bigger than the lights on a plane. i felt like it was a fluke that i happened to be outside looking at the exact moment these objects flew over. i did not experience anything emotionally except amazement. at first i thought it might be some type of experimental plane but decided there would have to be three in order to appear as it did or the same one disappeared and reappeared within seconds almost at the same spot and then fly off. all three objects just disappeared out of sight. with the first object, i noticed something odd with the dark sky-like some type of optical illusion. it made me wonder if the object was indeed much bigger in size and perhaps transparent or cloaked making the sky around it appear fuzzy or warped.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

weekly groceries. while waiting for a jeepney, i looked up at the sky, remembering another ufo that my mother witnessed last month (april 9) on the exact same spot, and hoping to see it too. (we saw multiple ufos on april 10, including what appeared to be fleets of white orbs moving westward).\r\n\r\nanyway, on april 9, my mother saw what she described as a transparent oblong with what appeared to be four legs with bright black balls at the ends. the entire object seemed to be rolling across the sky, moving from south to north, up in the sky along the exact middle of the main highway.\r\n\r\nat around 12:30 noon today (may 19), while waiting for a jeepney, i quickly scanned the skies and saw floating over the gas station across the street what i first thought was a black kite. it was moving in a waving, rippling motion, much like a snake. it was large because it was obviously very high up because it appeared to sometimes go above the clouds, and yet i could see it clearly and it probably measured about an inch if i held my fingers before my face against the sky. i pointed it out to my mother and we observed the object for a few minutes. we noted that it did not have a main head or body, like a kite has. it appeared exactly like a snake, except that when we observed it closely, we noticed that it actually appeared to be like some type of black plasma that seemed to be expanding and retracting at different points along its \"body.\" it was jet-black and had no discernible lights.\r\n\r\na few minutes later, my mother suddenly exclaimed, \"dalawa sila!\" (there's two of them!) and sure enough, some distance to its right was another object of the exact same type, also jet-black and also writhing and undulating like a snake. this one was much larger and we could clearly see that it was not a kite or a balloon or a piece of cloth. like i said, it appeared to me to be a stream of some sort of jet-black plasma that was undulating in the air. it sometimes also flashed in the sun like something silver and metallic, and my mother thought she saw a light suddenly flash at one end of it, but i did not see this as i was looking at the other object when this happened.\r\n\r\ni tried to take photos and videos of the two objects with my cell phone camera, but my camera is an old model and was not able to capture the objects. \r\n\r\nsome time later (maybe around 15 minutes), i suddenly noticed that there was another object that had come up between the first two. it looked exactly the same and moved in the exact same way. the first two on the left would sometimes roll up into themselves and descend or ascend. the one on the right, the large one, would hover for long moments (around five to ten minutes at a time) as just a straight, rigid black line, without moving or fluttering in the wind. then it would start to undulate again. it would cycle between this pattern of hovering and not moving and remaining rigid, and undulating and writhing, throughout the almost two hours we were standing there at the jeepney stop.\r\n\r\nall this time, we were both crying out and pointing at the sky but none of the people nearby bothered to look, which we both found strange. anyway, apart from a group of men who were working on some sort of electrical repair out in front of their shop, there were very few people out because it was very hot and most people were having lunch, i guess. \r\n\r\nsome time later, another object appeared, in the same general area, making it a total of four black snakelike objects writing and hovering in the sky. some time past one, i suddenly noticed what appeared to be a blurred pink or red light farther off to our right. as we looked, it slowly \"unfurled\" and also became snakelike, also alternating between being straight and rigid and undulating. i also noticed that it was accompanied by what appeared to be a black orb that was circling it at first and then moving beside it and suddenly veering off to the left and disappearing.\r\n\r\nwhen i moved my gaze back to the black \"snakes\" to the left, only two remained, and suddenly i noticed that there was an object to the left of the largest snake. it was aligned perfectly with the straight line formed by the black object. it appeared to me to be a small triangular object that emitted a pink light. when i first noticed it, it was hovering along with the black snake, but then it started moving in different directions. it was not fluttering like a kite or wobbling like a balloon. it was moving slowly in deliberate motions. suddenly, it seemed to plunge downward. as it did, it became what seemed to be a silvery disk, and as it plunged further down, it suddenly became larger and became a large, deep black circle with a hole or light in the middle. when it reached a certain altitude, where i could see it right over the rooftops, it moved slowly to the right and suddenly moved up again and become again what seemed like a triangular pink star, or rather, three pink stars connected to each other to form a triangle. we watched this object move and plunge down and up again repeatedly, until we both realized that we were shaking with hunger. \r\n\r\naround 2:15, we hesitantly left our spot to buy food at a nearby convenience store. when we returned, the black snakelike thing was gone and only the pink triangle remained, it still kept plunging and seemingly changing shape and then ascending again. we watched this for around 15 to 20 minutes more but my mother insisted that we need to get going. i very reluctantly agreed because we did need to get back home early. \r\nwe boarded a jeepney and i briefly saw the object again when we passed by an open space between buildings. it was nearer here and i could clearly see that it was three circular objects that were joined together to form a triangle, and it was rolling and falling and moving sideways and just seemingly dancing up there in the sky. it was amazing. i still could not believe we saw all that today. i have to admit i thought instantly of quetzalcoatl when we saw those sky \"serpents,\" whatever they were. i tried to look it up online when we got home but apart from a couple of reports, i could not find anything similar to what we witnessed today.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":38238,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":14.584409,"location":null,"logNumber":"PH-05192012-0006","longitude":121.1216404,"occurred":1337455800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"CALABARZON","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,

sky. assuming it was a bird of some sort, i look up to see what it was. my buddy unfortunately looked in the opposite direction as me but yet still heard the same sound i heard. as i was scanning the sky for a big loud bird of some sort, a dim light caught my eye. heading to the north, was a diagonal row of dim lights heading at a quick and constant speed. the row of lights seemed to appear like half an isosceles triangle heading off in a hurry without a sound. it seemed as tho whatever it was, was spooked and make a honk like sound and hurried away. when i first saw this row of objects, i thought it was a shooting star. as soon as i saw the row of lights, i was rather frightened and hurried inside for about 30 seconds or so. my buddy finally got done emptying out on my house and was rather curious what he had heard and what i had seen. i seemed to lose sight of this object in the same place where the light dimmed out the stars. not more than 45 seconds later, my buddy and i heard the same honking type sound in a different location, then about 5 seconds later, we heard this again in a totally different direction and louder. it seemed as tho this thing was on the move all around us. some of its sound was louder and some was quieter as if it was far away. later we never heard it again. in the audio recording which i hope works has dogs barking in the very beginning and right

county (wa state). my most recent sighting is the one where i witnessed it fly 25 yards directly above my head. this account happened august, 2010. i was driving on a back road going to a buddies house (which is 1/2 mile from the canadian border) when i saw it moving northeast from the southwest direction. it was moving around 10-15 mph. i witnessed it around 9:15 pm, so it was dark with mild cloud coverage. it was making no noise and had no lighting at first. from corner to corner i would compare the size to a 3 1/2 lane road, so it was a fairly large. i witnessed the outline from a distance and eventually when it flew directly above me i saw some solid outlines on it. i saw no windows, in turn didn't see if anyone was operating inside. i noticed all three corners of the vehicle had 3 lights with a diameter of 1 foot. one light was in the middle with a diameter of 2 feet. these lights didn't turn on until the vehicle became very close to the border, the only reason i noticed them in the first place was because of the light reflection they were giving. \r\n\r\nit seemed to have 2 tiers in height, a smaller at the bottom, with a larger on top. the material also seemed to have a micro stone texture with a glossy smudge effect colored in black. as it became half the distance from me and the canadian border, lights turned on to mimic that of a helicopter and sounds were created to also mimic a propelling sound. it eventually disappeared from distance. i tried to pull out my evo 4g phone to take pictures, but the quality was so bad with pitch blackness while above me that i had to scrap them. no drugs or alcohol were involved with my personal sighting.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100

helicopter. the helicopter was circling the area between 17th avenue 4th st and 15th avenue 2nd st.\r\ni looked at it and commented \"that copter is looking for something, he's circling. what's he up to?\"\r\nmy wife then pointed to the center point of the helicopters circled area. she said \"look at that.\"\r\nthe ufo appeared solid black and looked like a slightly bent cigar. it was very close to the helicopter, slightly to the west of it.\r\nthe helicopter continued to circle and the ufo began changing shape into a circle. first it turned into an egg shape then a circle.\r\nafter hovering for a few moments it appeared to drift about in a localized area. then, it began traveling at a regular speed east.\r\ni thought it was coming down but then it started to get a little smaller and looked to be traveling upward. it was traveling only slightly lower than cloud cover.\r\nthere was a thin ring around it like an aura and to me the sky seemed slightly electric.\r\nwe lost sight of it as it traveled behind a building. we continued looked to where it's trajectory would have it appear but it never did.\r\nthe helicopter moved to where the ufo had traveled and began circling that area. it looked like the helicopter was waiting for it to return or re-emerge.\r\nwe watched the sky for some time after that, the helicopter circled the area for several minutes then headed north.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then
