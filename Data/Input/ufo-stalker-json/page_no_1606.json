then they looked like they just melted into the sky they just dissapered. i'm not crazy i hope.I have had 3 other experiences around buna texas and never said nothing before because i never had any

members who were on the driveway with me.  i noticed something glinting in the sky to the east.  we have a lot of commercial air traffic overhead in this area since we are under the path that many planes take up and down the atlantic coast and at first i thought it was a low flying passenger jet, but the glint was stronger than those planes produce.  it was  much lower than passenger jets in this area. i noticed that there weren't any wings and there was a wide black band that went around the circumference at a point slightly less than halfway from the from the front of the cylinder. i still thought it might be an airplane whose wings were not visible because the way the sun was hitting it so i watched as it made it's progress  and it was clear that it was not an airplane since it did not have wings, tail, or any tapering of any kind.  i could not tell if the ends, which were not tapered, were open or closed.  there was a passenger jet flying above and in front of the object, and slightly farther away from me. both were flying  straight north.  the distance between the object and the airplane remained the same during the siting. the passenger jet was flying lower than those we usually see here. there was another passnger jet that was much farther away and much higher that follwed these two, but were all visible at the same time. other planes came and went in the busy sun. afternoon sky shortly afterwards. the cylinder was shorter and fatter in proportion when compared to the passenger jet fuselage that i saw but seemed to be approximately the same size. i regret that tall trees blocked my view after about 10-15 seconds.  my relatives wanted to know what i was looking at, but i just shook my head as if to say nothing because i didn't want to spend my time trying to explain while i could still see it and try to figure out what it could be.  afterwards  i think i may have said i had seen something like an airplane without wings and tried not to make a big deal of it.  i wanted to keep thinking about what it could be and didn't want to be distracted by kidding.  thoughts---somehow it looked \"normal\".  i didn't look menacing.  could it be some kind of device for photographing large areas, with the dark band being a dark \"plastic\" shield around cameras much like security cameras in stores have dark plastic looking covers?  how did it get it's lift and propulsion?  was an airfoil inside the \"tube\"?  was it a lighter than air device with a propeller inside the \"tube\"?  why did it seem to be shadowing a fairly low flying passenger plane? perhaps what looked like a passenger plane was really military? was that plane perhaps an escort, but why would an escort be in front? was it really above 500ft or under?  could civil and military radar detect it?  surely some of the planes in the busy sky had seen it.  there are several airforce and naval air bases within 150 miles and no apparent military planes were checking it out.  a nuclear submarine base is not too far away.  i can only imagine that the skies are watched closely in this area.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This is always my least favourite part, excuse the cynicism. i guess i mean that i always find it difficult to describe a scenario so that someone understands how fantastic the event is as my experience; i'm a scientist, and a graduate nurse, and therefore trained to observe and report. however, there's more to a good story than just the facts, so, i'll do my best to make sense of this experience so somebody will enjoy reading this.\r\n\r\nevery morning and some afternoons i take my 18 month old son for a walk around my neighbourhood, of which includes ring drive (in groton ct). my son has a thing for air-planes and loves to sky-watch, so, i often spend time looking up into the sky with him during our walks. this time, my son pointed at a plane and then i saw an object dangerously close to the plane, it seemed like the plane didn't see the object, as it didn't alter course or anything; i believe the object may have been on the periphery or in back of the plane, hence no change in course. at that moment i whipped out my video camera like \"billy the kid\" and started to video the craft, i didn't get much taping done and the object was gone, at that point i closed the video camera and sighed with disgust because i could not get a better video. then, out of the blue, totally unexpected another craft comes from another direction, this time closer and more discernible. it is totally possible that it could be the same same craft just closer, it was more difficult to make out the size and shape of the first one especially because of the brightness of the sky. however, the second video was shot at a closer distance and i was able to make out more details, this is supported by my less than perfect narration, i did just blurt out the details as the video plays reinforcing my memory and this description. i will say again, the object was circular/spherical and moving around in an unnatural way. and, as you can see in the video, the object just moved out of view.\r\n\r\nit should be noted that this is my second mufon report. but, these to craft don't resemble the last two in the very least. in my opinion, the video quality and duration trump the video from the last report for the following reasons: a)the video camera was a 1080p (without zoom)vs a 720p from the last report, so, i think the object can be better discerned especially after digital zoom is applied. b) this was my second experience & i was not anxious and as jittery as the first video. c) lastly, there are objects in the foreground so a distance and size should be easier to figure out. by no means am i discounting my last experience, in fact i stated before that this area (groton ct) is a hot spot because of the sub base, general dynamics (electric boat), the air national guard, and lastly the airport. when i first came to the area a few people had mentioned the weird shapes and lights in the sky and i dismissed them all until i saw a bunch things in the sky that i could not understand myself. it is of my opinion that these ufo's and such are extraterrestrial in nature and have been occurring for quite some time now. and furthermore, it is also my opinion that these craft seemed interested in our military (especially nuclear) technology, commercial aircraft, and our developing tech (general dynamics).\r\n\r\ni hope that everyone reading this got a good understanding of what happened to me on may 11th 2012. thanks for reading my report.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

it was so large, that a basketball held at arm's length would just barely have covered it. it could have been a top-secret spy drone or something, but i don't think our government has something that

time the light (dim at this time) was seen over hill and was pulsing. kept getting brighter til we eventually started around a curve and spotted it .Very large in size hovering over parking lot. view was momentarily blocked by hillside.By the time we could get clear view it was gone. then we again spotted it at the treeline about a half mile down road. stationary, pulsing ,extremely bright white light. appeared circular. i stopped car to look, it never moved. i tried to take video with cellphone, but it wouldn't show clearly. just a white dot on screen. got back in car and drove on while passenger watched out the window , it seemed to move a little but not much. when i arrived home a short distance later i could still see the flasing that i first saw over the hill. this lasted for an hour or more. i wanted to go back with a regular camera and see if i could get clear video. i suppose fear of the unknown and the fact i would have been alone in doing this stopped me. we both just kept saying the obvious- \"what is that?\" over and over. i tried to tell myself that it was military, but why would they take the chance to draw so much attention? if someone has an explanation i would love to hear a logical one. side note- i travel this road every night from work so i wll be watching and carrying a camera.","distance":"101-500

colors of the clouded sunset i decided to snap a few shots to use as my wallpaper. after a few shots i realized there was something in the sky above the tree line. i zoomed my cell in as far as i could and started snapping away. the clouds were moving right and this dark grey saucer looking object appeared out of them hovering in place, or so it seemed. at first i thought it was just a darker cloud mixing with the prettier light colored ones. starring at it through my camera i could tell it was solid. looking over the photos later i could clearly see that it was slooooooooowly moving against the clouds. the time was 8:26pm and it was gone by 8:29pm. i snapped 26 pictures in that time period. about 5-7minutes later i was on the phone explaining to my bestie what i saw. sure enough as i was describing it to her this big huuuuge dark diamond shaped looking cloud started popping out of the clouds. i stared in awe at how massive it was. it wasn't one solid object. it was several small round, dark gray objects. they slowly started moving across the sky, same direction as clouds this time. a sudden bright flash of light and they shot of in two opposite directions. my son and his father were also starring at this unexplained phenomenon. i would have loved to have got that one on video or pictures. but can't use camera while im talking on my phone, that happens to be camera. lol. i was disappointed i didn't get the big one recorded but i am happy i got the smaller one. i have several over sightings. i live near the airport in roanoke so i see planes go out all the time, along with helicopters. and what i have witnessed the last two months were nothing that has come out of that airport. i can see the planes land and take off. im so close i hear them start up constantly. all 8 sighting this past month were not planes, birds, balloons or anything i have seen on this planet. \r\ni have also included two more photos of 3 round objects in the clouds near airport. if you look above the airport sign near top of photo you will see them in a triangle like shape. might have to zoom. one is the original and one is cropd to show them a little better. they are not birds. there is a bird in the photo but the three objects together are not.\r\ni have seen orbs. stationary, blinking different colors really fast, flashes then vanished.\r\norange orbs that

can promise you that. \r\nevery time i see one of these objects i can't explain, i smile. im not scared during  any of these sightings. im relieved that im not crazy. i know there's no way we are the

a nw below the treeline. it was far off in the sky and slow moving but faster than star. it significantly larger than any start more than 5 times then size of anything in the sky. all the stars moved in a more regular western heading. this had a different heading. it passed other stars which blocked them out. i checked the space station website to verify that it was not it the flight path. several airplane went by in other areas but near the bright light. this light dwarfed the planes in comparison. i do have photos since the object was slow moving. the photos were taken on my phone so are of
