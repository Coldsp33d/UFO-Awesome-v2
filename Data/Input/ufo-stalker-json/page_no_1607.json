field where multiple cars had been parked. while walking to within a few feet of my vehicle, i briefly looked up at the night sky and saw one star-like object moving at an incredibly high speed. the object appeared to originate in the eastern sky and was heading west. the object was a bright gold/yellow color and did not appear to leave any sort of trail.\r\nthe object moved in a slightly erratic manner as it traversed the entire length of the visible sky. unlike shooting stars, the object made small and abrupt deviations from it's path but never came to a stop. frozen in shock, i observed the first object for no more than 15-20 seconds before it disappeared in the west. just as the first object disappeared, i observed two more objects identical to the first one originate in the east at around the same point i originally observed the first object. the two objects, at a considerable distance from one another, traveled across the sky in much the same way as the first one did. they also had the same shape, size, and color as the first object.\r\none of my friends happened to be getting into his vehicle nearby and it was at that point that i attempted to get his attention in hopes he could see the same thing. unfortunately, he did not understand what i was saying at first and by the time he looked up the objects had already completely traversed the sky.\r\ni remained at my vehicle for approximately thirty minutes and monitored the sky before leaving. i did not observe any other unusual objects.\r\n\r\nthe entire sequence of events from the sighting of the first object to the disappearance of the second and third objects was approximately 40 seconds.\r\n\r\ni am just now reporting this incident after 6 years. i feel that reporting the incident publicly could affect my professional standing and i've decided to remain anonymous. it has deeply influenced my views on the world, as the objects did not move like anything i've ever seen before. the objects, in my opinion, acted as if directed by some sort of intelligence. the erratic movements of the objects were inconsistent with the behavior of shooting stars and the incredibly fast movement of the objects ruled out conventional aircraft.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:40","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

dark clear sky, littered with stars! as we got into the car something court my eye. what i seen or what i believed i seen was a light orbiting a star, it seemed so far away!!! i pointed it out to my mum, which she dismissed as just a star. we were now traveling back home, i don't know why but i was fixated on this star! i started to get excited as it seemed to have become a single object which was now looking more like an aircraft in the far distance at night. we are now half way home an the craft was now a lot closer, whilest this was going on i was giving my mother a running commentary. at the time my mum never seemed that bothered about it, she would reply saying 'it was a helicopter or something!'. we have spoke about it many times since and she tells me she was alarmed, i think i was to excited to notice at the time! by now the craft was very visible, and seemed to be following our car, which was very strange! as we turned into the main estate before our own there is a canal that runs parallel with the road, distance between them are no more then 20 meters. as we drove next to the canal the craft was matching our speed and was above the water  which i could make out the shape which was a triangle, with three bright lights on the corners. as we approach the bend of the road the craft seems to follow the canal which goes of in the opposite direction. at this time i stared to quiz my mum about what we seen. we approached the house, drove up the short drive, stopped and got out the car. as i looked towards my mum on the other side of the car i seen the craft fly silently towards us! it must have been 50 60 feet in the sky no sound no down draft. it stops, right above us, in a blink of an eye it shot off with incredible speed. i ran from the car to the back garden, nothing, the dog was going crazy! when i spk to my mum an sister we have slight differences about the end. mine is that my sister was crying in the car but never got out!  when we speak about this she said she was out the car??? when talking about the incident i can give a better account. i have a military background, the years served i have never come across any vehicle with the

my vantage point.  this was no airplane or helicopter.  there was no sound from it at all.  there were no additional lights of any kind that you would normally associate with an aircraft other than the solid orange light. i know aircraft and this was no aircraft that i am familiar with.  i live in the flight path of port columbus airport and i see alot of planes and helicopters. it was a good distance away from me so i am unable to give an actual determination of distance.  it was not a meteor but there was one witnessed earlier in the evening that glowed a bright green color as it burned up.  there was no cloud cover so the light could not have gotten lost in a cloud.  it was about the color of mars in the night sky and it was a steady light, not flashing or pulsing.  it was about the size and intesity of venus in the night sky.  the entire event was witnessed by all three of us.  i nad her son looked for the object until about 12:30 am but it never showed its self again. i am an

will go purchase a tripod, and get my hidef camera ready, as when i drive, i carry my iphone with me. this time it was sunday may 13th. i went out to the dollar store around my street in paterson, nj. it was around 7:30pm, a bit cloudy but still very light, when i spot a craft, it caught my attention because 1. i know automatically how airplane look like, and the manner this craft was flying was extremely off, almost like it was flying sideways in a straight line. i was alarmed as well, because we are a few miles from newark liberty airport and it was not headed that way, as it flew (again very slowly) it gradually slowed down some more. i immediately grabbed my iphone and recorded, my hands were shaking a bit because i parked on a handicap spot and got on top of my sit so that i may record from my car's sunroof. i have added screen grabs of the vide as well to show you key spots so you know where to look following it's path. lasted about 30seconds on the video then it vanished into thin  air. video recorded iphone 3gs, screen-grabs have object circled in red. no way that it was an airplane, a weather balloon or a satellite. i also checked the flights itineraries for that day, no flights were to be expected until 45minutes after the craft appeared. \r\n\r\np.S. i added 6 pictures, they are in order by number as the craft appeared until it vanished. photo #6 is marked

estaba haciendo a eso de las 9:15 de la noche del 12 de mayo de 2012, me sorprendi al ver hacia el sur oriente una estrella roja en una zona que no habian nubes, tenia a mi bebe cargada y le mostre la estrella roja, pense que era marte, pero me di rapidamente cuenta de que no era una estrella cuando vi que avanzaba hacia la direccion donde yo estaba, lo hacia lentamente, mire bien si era un avion, pero nunca habia visto un avion circular y de color rojo todo el tiempo a una velocidad muy lenta, ademas se estacionaba por varios minutos en un solo punto, cuando estaba cerca observe que unas luces blancas y azules salian de lo que parecia una estrella roja, estas salian por tres lados diferentes y parpadeaban parecido a los aviones, pero estoy seguro de que no era un avion, fui corriendo a buscar mi camara pero cuando fui a observar una nube lo estaba ocultando y a pesar de que espere un buen rato, no volvi a ver nada.\r\n\r\nno es la primera vez que observo cosas extra���as en el cielo
