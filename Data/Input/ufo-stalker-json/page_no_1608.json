right (south) to check for traffic i noticed a string of lights similar to how flares may appear, or aircraft in very close formation flight, but these were red lights, were bright, were constant, and were too large to be aircraft lights without their being heard. as i watched them the arc formation of lights began to shift closer to one another. there were 4 lights that moved close together forming a diamond momentarily (indicative of a helicopter or aircraft losing altitude rapidly in formation flight) and one additional light nearer (higher on the horizon). they changed their formation while moving north, toward me. at this point i was out of my car and walking toward the lights, south along the street. the way the lights changed formation they appeared to hover and move slowly as a helicopter might, but there were no white anti-collision lights. all of the lights were a bright red with a slight tinge of orange and after the movement of the lights occurred some began to grow dim. as i walked closer i expected they would soon pass directly overhead or nearby, but by the time i reached a tall group of pines that were obscuring my view all of the lights had vanished. \r\ni am a former army helicopter pilot, chief warrant officer (retired 2007), and what i saw does not make sense. because of the size of the lights i should have been able to hear the aircraft, were they rotor or fixed wing, but i heard nothing. it was a cloudless night sky as many stars shone brightly surrounding the area where i viewed the lights. after walking back to my car i immediately looked at the clock and it showed 2118hrs. i estimated it took me about 5 minutes to walk to the spot where i realized the lights had vanished and return to my vehicle. \r\n","distance":"101-500

and time: approx. 23:10, may 5th (night of super moon)\r\nlocation: ottawa, ontario, canada (suburb of orleans)\r\nwitnesses: 3 saw orange ball of light in the northeast, 2 saw the black triangle fly overhead - heading southwest.\r\n\r\ndeparting friend's home, standing in his driveway looking up at the super moon directly in front of us.  moon was high, quite bright and appeared normal in size.  turning to our left, facing the northeast, we saw a bright orange light - it was hard to tell if it was stationary or not.  i thought it was a satellite being illuminated by the sun below the horizon, but it was not moving fast enough.  i then thought it could be a flare, again, it appeared rather stationary - and, no smoke trails or arc in the trajectory of the light.  the light then blinked out.  my friend suggested it was just a plane - but no plane i know has orange approach lights.\r\n\r\nas we continued to look in the direction of the object, we could make out something approaching.  even as the moon was bright, nothing was reflected off the surface of the object.  as it flew over us, we could clearly see a large black triangle.  it progressed southwest in total silence.  there were absolutely no lights, no strobes, nothing.  i want to say i recall some circles on the bottom side of the object, but my memory  has faded.  \r\n\r\nthe size of the object was hard to determine.  it appeared to be about an index finger, may a bit longer in length.  speed was about cruising speed of an airliner.  again hard to just size without judging altitude.  i am guessing in the 1000ft to 3000ft range. a total guess as i don't have a frame of reference.\r\n\r\nour assumption is that this was some sort of us spy plane, but nothing comes to mind.  it certainly did not appear to be the supposed tr3b - with no lights on the bottom, but who knows.\r\n\r\nwe thought the orange glow might have been the object re-entering the atmosphere, but, it would have had to slow down and decrease altitude dramatically in seconds if that were the case.\r\n\r\ntotal mystery.  ideas or opinions

the english roswell episode and wondered if anyone was interested in what we saw several years ago. sorry i didn't tell you all when it happened but i just learned what mufon is and does from the tv shows. i'm sure there must have been much better reports on what we saw because we seemed to be very far away from this. anyway, the light looked starlike or like a distant flood light pointed our way, over and much further away from the pine trees which were about .5 miles south of us. we thought this light which later ended up being about 3 different ones, well we figured they were several miles away, maybe 5 to 7 making the lights quit and small. anyway this original light would move around aimlessly around kinda a little like maybe could have been something like a fast small helicopter could do from this many miles away but then would hover very still it would traverse on a horizontal plane almost instantly. it also did this in different directions as well but mostly horizontal making it seem like it was having fun and looking at different parts of earth. there is no way anything on earth can do what we saw unless and i mean this is the only way this is earth tech. the only way i know of is if this was done using multiple inviable lasers (most are)at different points on the ground that would triangulate into a visible light and could then move in a way as to make this small light travel almost instantly and stop about instantly. i would think that college kids with the right robotic arms or cnc tech hooked up to the right lasers and might be able to do this so i assume this is what we saw but if not them we indeed saw a ufo. because nothing we have ever put in the sky can maneuver from a deed hover to hundreds if not thousands of miles an hour and stop about and almost but just slightly less than instant but nearly instantly stop and go like which what we witnessed. so again a hologram in the sky is the only humanly way possible i know of to do what we saw. it would also slowly drift around aimlessly at a very slow speed, stop, then zip a to b near instantly. it went to the other light and after a few hours the two left one after the other and the second at different but slower speeds as they accelerated together and then we noticed a third light went with them much much dimmer and i maybe the only one to have seen the third since it was so dim. i will add if these were non earth ufos although they appeared to us to be over the horizon they might have also been much further and in space since it's very hard to judge distance from a small point of light and when they left they did leave in about a 45 degree angle from the horizon in an up/right angle from the horizon and they didn't seem to get much if any larger. these lights did look a lot like the stars around them. so i will search this site now and see if anyone may have seen these things up closer or closer than us. i've never seen anything like this before and have not since and i don't expect to ever see anything like this again unless either the same guys re-run the hologram program prank or the non earth things come back. again these are the only two options because humans can't make air born objects move like this. we can only do this with some kind of hologram laser light show. this was my wife and i and also my mom and dad and uncle on my dads boat on lake huron looking south. we were located about 30 miles or so north east of mackinaw island looking south. i'm the only one that thinks it could have been an earth based hologram prank but when i asked everyone else in the boat no one had any idea what they were looking at my dad originally said...Helicopter. i quickly said do you really think a chopper can move like that. he looked a while longer and said i have no idea what that is. and my dad is a retired air force pilot and has flown everywhere and has never seen anything weird like this before or after. i will add i had a very weird feeling like it since most of the time we thought it was just one i had a weird feeling that it might zip all the way to us and almost instantly be larger and up close and in person to us. so i guess i'm not positive this was a hologram prank cause i think i was joking around and said what if whatever that is zips all the way over hear in a second and is a big ufo and i think as a said that realized holy crap what if it did do that then was a little scary. but it seemed to be kinda playful in nature, whatever it was like it was bored while the second one just stayed motionless mostly. clearly it was the one trying to learn or do something more than the one flitting all over. i'm repeating. sorry ok i'm done. oh and if your wondering what we were doing so late on a boat, we were rock base fishing with jitterbugs casting at the rocks around 11:30 to 1:30 they will bite on them. they usually only bite when it's overcast but i do remember seeing some stars out. thanks for reading this sorry for typos and rambling on, lol.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,
