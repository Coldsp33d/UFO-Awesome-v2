on-ramp to main st/ county 14, we were at the light at the top of the bridge facing southeast. i was in the passenger seat.\r\n\tto my right in the southwest sky i then saw at approximately 10:01 pm, 4 red lights fly up from the horizon, then 3 more a second later following behind. it was brighter than anything else on that side of the horizon. they came up in a scattered sort of line, like a massive roman candle but a little quicker in pace of appearance. they moved slightly east and formed a pattern. one went higher up in the sky, a set of three formed a near equilateral triangle to the bottom right of the first,  and the last set of three formed a very wide obtuse scalene triangle to the immediate right of the first triangle. they were as bright as jupiter was during its peak this year, glowing red with just a little bit of yellow around them, but they were a significantly larger source than jupiter. they were a solid source of light, and they were moving visibly east and began to cross hwy 65. i watched them disappear behind the buildings as we turned and traveled north (my driver needed to get home), but when i got home a minute later i ran inside to get my boyfriend. i was very excited because it sounded a little similar to something somebody i know had seen once before a long time ago.\r\n\twhen we went back outside all 7 were dimly visible from my parking lot due south and much smaller- the light source size was a third and they were just pricks of light, no longer glowing. to be seen from here they must have traveled over at least 1000 feet east and crossed over hwy 65 in approximately 3 minutes. the wide obtuse triangle vanished very quickly as soon as we got outside, as if it just blinked out. the high light and the equilateral triangle began to fade very rapidly and were gone in about a minute, almost as if they were traveling directly away from us. then i became suddenly frightened and went back inside.\r\n\tsurface wind speeds in blaine this

family in palm desert, california. on this particular night my sister and i were walking home (to my mom's) after spending most of the day with friends. at approx 8:00pm we were walking through the indian wells golf course which was kind of like a short cut for us at the time. there is a dried up wash that cuts right through the golf course and while we were crossing this wash we both looked straight up and thats when we both grabbed each others hand out of both excitement and fear and we both started asking each other, \"...Do you see that? do you see that???\". what we were both looking at was by far the biggest craft we have ever seen flying/hovering in mid air.  . we both then decided to lay down on our backs and watch it pass since it was directly over us. we layed down in the center of the wash that runs from west to east where we were located..Our heads were facing east as the craft appeared to be heading in that direction. what kept going through my mind while watching this was, \"...How can something this huge fly that slow?\" ... it was almost as if it were hovering yet we could both tell it was slowly moving east and directly over us.. the craft was almost a perfect triangular shape and was very dark and solid on the surface. it was not shiney or wavey or anything like that at all. infact, i just seen the videos about the arizona lights for the very first time about two months ago and shared it with my sister and we both agree that that was the same ship we seen.. only in the re-creations that the ofohunters made it was shiney and almost reflective looking. i'm going to have to disagree and say that it was more like several different sized rectangular and sqare \"sections\" or \"panels\" that were over lapping each other on some parts of the craft and some were protruding from it meaning there were several sections that were different heights then others so it wasn't a \"perfectly flat\" bottom like i seen in those videos. \r\nagain, the thing that kept going through my mind was how can something as big as this be flying so slowly over us the way it is. i was trying to take in as much as possible but it was just too big. i remember looking to my left and then to my right while laying down there to see if i  could locate the ends of this triangle and was just shocked at how long the span of this was. \r\nthen i seen two lights (one on each end of what would be considered to be the back) that were more like soft, but very large orbs light up, then two more that were closer together then the other two lit up then finally another large orb lit up in the front and then suddenly it shot off like a rocket straight up and to the north without a sound....\r\nmy sister and i were freaked out and couldn't wrap our minds around what it was we just seen. we immediately ran to our parent's home and told them what happened and we all went outside and couldn't find any trace of anything. \r\nthis sighting lasted for nearly 10 seconds. i'd say between 8-10 seconds max. \r\nwe haven't met anyone else yet who may have also seen this large craft in that area. but according to arizona and nevada there were multiple sightings of this same craft so maybe there is a pattern of some kind? thanks for reading and allowing me to share this exerience here. \r\npeace and bright blessings~","distance":"501 Feet - 1

back to enjoy the warmth and looked up to notice a bird flying over (east direction) head and as i looked at it i noticed much higher up 1 x silver star like object that was stationary.  i thought it was odd that a star would be visible in day light so continued to observe it and to my surprise it started to move rapidly toward the south west. \r\n\r\ni continued to watch it not understanding what it was.  an airliner jet flew over from the south east corner into a north west direction toward the airport.  this thing was many times higher than the jet.  \r\n\r\nafter it traveled a little i noticed a second orb appear out of no where - again heading in a similar direction.  the 1st orb was still visible when at 30 degree angle from me (rather then directly overhead being 90 degrees).

as i noticed they were strobing irregularly in sequence with each other. i noticed that the object to the left was drifting closer to the other, i was hoping for a merger, this dint happen. they would brighten to the size of a baseball and then shrink to a size of a small star. i so wanted to get my camera but was afraid that i would miss them. after they disappear i went inside and told my wife what had happened and we both went outside this time i carried my camera but they did not return. my wife noticed that the birds in the area were very active for this time in the morning. a police. officer was passing game by and stopped, i told her i saw two lights in the sky, she thought i was drinking and drove off. i did have a wine cooler around 1:45am but that was it. i have seen a few very strange. objects in the sky my whole life but this was the first time that i was totally freaked out about it. i don't think i will ever go outside with out a camera of some type again.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

back out. about 8 neighbors and a few kids were across the street looking east into the sky. there was an enormous brilliant white/yellow perfectly round light that hung stationary in the sky. it was significantly larger than the moon and more brilliant.  there were two other smaller lights of the same brilliance and shape as the huge center one but the other two were moving in a slow circular pattern around the edge of the center one that never moved. the light was much brighter than the moon but did not hurt our eyes to look at it. the edges were very clearly defined and the light was not a reflection but emanated from the objects themselves. the neighbors had been looking at it for about half an hour before my mother was called on the phone to come and see. she then came to get my brother, sister and myself. everyone agreed it was either a ufo or a new technology from the local space aeronautics company where many of the neighbors worked. after about half an hour of watching i got bored and went home to watch tv. after about 20 minutes back in the house, i could hear everyone outside yell, \"oh!\", and \"ah!\" and then yell loudly, \"oh my god!\"  my mom came inside not long after and said i should have stayed. she said they saw a plane fly near the objects and it suddenly got very bright...And that is all i can remember.  my emotional memory tells me she described an event where the thing either blew up or became somehow larger or more brilliant or some other description that was unbelievable or spectacular, but i was too young and it was too long ago to remember all the details of what my mother described. there was no report in the news or the paper the next day or days after that. i would like to know what the others thought about the incident but

patio watching the sky. we were surprised by what appeared to be a flock of glowing green lights that shot by us to the west in a south-north direction. i've seen a lot of meteors over the years, but this didn't look like anything i'd ever seen. my son turned and asked, \"what was that, dad?\" i simply said, \"i don't know. never seen anything like that.\"\r\n\r\nmy son stood and went inside to get a drink of water. our house was situated directly under the airport landing path, so a couple of large jets flew past on their approach to the runway. at that location, the airplanes were fairly large in the sky. above them was a layer of puffy clouds that extended to where it touched the tops of the wasatch mountains. as i sat watching the sky above me, i noticed movement against the black sky. it was hard to distinguish at first, but as i focused on that part of the sky, i saw a huge black triangular object above the clouds that was moving steadily from north to south directly above the landing pattern. compared to the jet airplanes, the object was massive. it had five chevron-shaped lights, which i imagined must be its engines. they glowed a soft reddish-orange color, and the glow pulsated slightly. there was one at the nose of the object and two more along each side. at the speed the object was moving, i thought there would be a tremendous roar associated with it, but it was completely silent. i watched it move south to where it banked and changed to an eastern course. it crossed the wasatch mountains at a place near mount olympus, and it was still huge in comparison to everything around. judging against the mountain tops, i estimate that it was about a mile long. as the object moved to the south, i could see that it had thickness, but not much.\r\n\r\nduring the time that i watched it, i was so dumbstruck that i couldn't call for anyone to come and look. it was gone in only a few seconds. i knew that it was bigger than any earthly aircraft, and i've seen the biggest on earth. my first thoughts were, \"i've just seen something from outside our world.\"\r\n\r\ni've pondered the sight over and over again for many years. it has changed my view of life. i still hold my religious views, because in my beliefs, we are not alone in the vast universe, but i feel like we're being visited from somewhere else now. i'd desperately like to know if anyone else
