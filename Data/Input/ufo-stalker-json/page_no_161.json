","country":"PL","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I am a 19d cavalry scout in the 2nd cavalry regiment with the united states army currently deployed in western poland. i'm and expert on vehicle identification but what i saw on the night of july 22nd makes no sense to me. during the night of july 22nd my platoon was conducting a machine gun live fire training exercise on one of the local polish army training areas in the vicinity of bemovo piskie poland. that night i was a gunner on top a stryker armored vehicle manning a m2 .50caliber machine gun. i was also equipped with a psq-20 thermal and night vision optic attached to my helmet. while waiting for dismounted members of my squad to set up their m240 machine gun on the firing line, we maneuver my truck into some brush off the road leading to the range. we were simulating a situation where the dismount team would need to call us for support by fire with the .50 cal and we would evac them out. at around 2215 hours we sat in the brush waiting for the team to call us. i stood in my turret getting my equipment ready. part of that is adjusting my thermal and night vision optics. the psq-20 is one of the latest issued optics to be given to soldiers. \r\nas i flipped through the night vison settings i noticed a bright ball like object appear about 100 feet above the tree line in front of me . no of course i just figured it was an infrared flare fired from one the motor platoons training a few km down the road. those types of flares are highly visible to night vision and thermal optics. how ever they also give off a dull red light which is visible to the human eye quite easily. since the psq-20 is a monical type optic it only covers one eye. so i closed my eye which i was looking through the optic with and used my unaided eye to see if it was just a flare, but their was no red glow. \r\n\r\ni looked back through my optic. the object was still their moving slow down and left. i turned the thermal viewing option on and the object was still there. this object descended for about what seemed like 60- 90 seconds between a part in the trees. once it was below the tree line it seemed to disappear, but that's when the second object appeared. it was in the same intensity of brightness as the first object. as this all happened i continued to scan the object with my optics flipping through the thermal and night vision setting. in night vision it both objects appeared spherical in shape. and glowed bright light green as anything appearing in the infrared spectrum would using night vision. i know this cause we have ir lasers on our weapons that emit beams of light the same in color and contrast. in the thermal setting they glowed a bright red. these objects where extremely hot. how ever both were completely invisible to my naked eye. \r\n\r\ni wont lie to you i was scared how ever i did my upmost to keep my military bearing. so as the scout i am i kept observing. they did nothing to interfere with our equipment or radios, they made no noise. no wildlife in the area was disturbed by them. \r\n\r\nonce the first object disappeared in the tree line the second object continued to follow the same path as the first. for about 60 seconds this object descended into the tree line and disappeared. at that point i assumed it was over and that it had to have been just a flare and that i just couldn't see the glow of the red light it would have given off. but i was wrong. from the same spot in the tree line from where the objects disappeared from, one object illuminated its self in my night vision setting again. this time the object rose straight up into a parting in the trees. it did so slowly. it took about 30 seconds for it to ascend what may have been about 200 feet and what seemed like 500 meters in front of me. but do to the night and the angle to the object its difficult to gauge a distance. this one object just sat their hovering. as if it was observing me, my weapons, and my armored vehicle. i knew now what i was seeing was no flare. it wasn't a military aircraft, american or polish. it sat their hovering, only visible to my thermal and night vison still. then its brightness in my optics increased in intensity. it got brighter and brighter as if for a second a laser was being shined in my optic. and then it simply disappeared. \r\n\r\ni sat there stupefied as to what i had just seen. i scanned the tree line, the night sky trying to see if the second object would appear. i stood their griping my .50 cal nervously for about 15 minutes trying to find a trace of the objects again but to no avail. i wouldn't see the objects again. i would keep silent about this. you wouldn't want your nco's to assume that the man they have in charge of several million dollars of army equipment is losing his mind seeing ufo's. i didn't know what to do about this until i heard about mufon. i want someone to listen to my story, someone i can talk to about this. which is why i turn to you.  \r\n\r\none of the fundamentals of reconnaissance for army scouts is \" to report all information rapidly and accurately\" i have served the army for some time now and i can honestly say i have no idea as to what it is that i saw that night. but i do know it wasn't man made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

see airplanes , both civilian and military , helicopters and satellites passing overhead. directly in font of me over some trees i saw a dim lit orb, then it pulsed to a very bright orb. it did this 4 or 5 times without any pattern, maybe once every 15 to twenty sceonds then approximate once a minute. it appearing to be stationary. i had no idea what this was as it did not have the characteristics of any plane or helicopter or satellite that i have ever seen. then as it glowed very bright again it shot out beams of what i can only describe as white/ red flames out of both sides. they flared out approx 5 times the width of the orb then the orb went dim until it disappeared. i have seen satellites ,even the iss pass overhead and at times glow bright as the solar panels reflect sunlight but this was not the same. it looked as if this orb was going to explode when the beams shot out of both sides. when they shot out it had almost the characteristic of intense electricity as the beams fizzled. when i saw this i felt very strange,almost dizzy. i'm not sure if it was because i have never seen anything remotely close to this and felt as if i was witnessing something extraordinary  or if the energy affected me in some way. there was no sound until the energy beams came out and it sounded like static/electrical fizzle. the energy beams only lasted about 10 seconds but the entire sighting from start to finish was about 10 minutes. i remained outside for several hours but did not see it again.

around before exiting the apartment property and went back for the remote. i was also riding my smart balance hoverboard to speed up my travel from home to car, and back again. upon returning i saw some lights in the air and thought it may be a helicopter because i thought i heard the sound of one nearby, but the lights did not seem to be illuminating the surface of the object. i thought this was strange and had the sense that this may be some sort of stealth or covert aircraft that was not meant to be seen. so i pulled out my phone to get video. i was also concerned because it was directly over the center of the complex and it moved fast and made unusual turns and rotations in vertical ascent. then it began to hover above the buildings and parking lot right in front of me i could tell it was good sized and looked robotic and was cube shaped about the size of a half the length of a car and may have had 1 to 2 appendages on the leading side. as i filmed it, the object noticed me and reacted as though startled like it wanted to hide or cloak. but then it stayed in place for a moment like it realized the futility of hiding since i had been watching/filming. i could hear a soft hum or swishing sound and audio emissions similar to pilot or police type radio chatter and the audio then changed through a staticy transition and i thought i could hear faint playback of my wife saying my son's name 2 to 3 times as though a threat or warning, then it made an evasive move out of my view behind the buildings in front of me. i was shaken and could hear interference in my car audio and had issues with my phone right after. when i returned from purchasing our dinner idid see a real helicopter flying over our area possibly to search or investigate the object but i wasn't certain. later that night i could not get the swishing sound that the object made out of my mind as though it may be projecting the noise at me from outside, to the point that it drown out the sound of my wife's voice. the feeling uncontrollably led to drowsiness and i was out asleep rather abruptly. \r\n\r\nthe object moved and behaved intelligently and may have been a heavy duty drone of a type not seen publically, a fully robotic military or extrestrial object or a midsized craft large enough for 1 or 2 smaller pilots. if it was a commercial drone it was not a type that i have seen as a  commonly known hobby drone due to size and flight capability but may be a cutting-edge technology explainable possibility. i could not confirm what it really was, but the experience shook me.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s), Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

seconds. the light appeared to be rotating on an axis that was parallel to the ground. it was not a strobe light, this light appeared to shine directly into my binoculars as it rotated in my direction and then away. to the naked eye this beacon effect was not visible, only a change in brightness from invisible to visible and then bright(as the light scanned past me).\r\none other observation...I live out in the country...Its quiet. there was no sound detected.\r\n  \r\n regards,\r\nstan simpson    ","distance":"Over One

opened the back door and called to my wife who was actually asleep. she came outside and she too observed the light and it's behavior. after about 5-6 minutes of staying in one position straight overhead, it started to move slowly to the south east. i estimated that it took the object about 15 minutes to travel from about 90 degrees (straight up) to about 45-40 degrees south east of it's original location. after that period of time, i could not see it flash or pulse anymore. i still had a clear view of the sky, which was completely clear of cloud cover at the time. during the event, i

that i saw and at my age at the time (10) i have not made any assumptions in what i saw.  \r\n\r\ni was outside playing in my back yard.  low in the sky (i have no idea of the distance) three round objects appeared.  i can not say that they were explosions.  i do not think so because the outside circumference was round and smooth.  it was more like a rapidly expanding circle.  there was three circles, red, yellow and blue.  the circumferences of the circles did not overlap not touch each one however they were real close to each other.  once they appeared in the sky, they grew in size.  if you would put your hand in the sky, your thumb nail would cover one of the circles.  (i actually did this from a measuring technique i learned in scouts.)  the time frame from the circle's appearing to the time they reached their maximum diameter was about 2 or 3 seconds.  once they were at a maximum diameter, they hung in the sky for about 5 minutes and then disappeared.  their disappearance was sudden.  i can not say if they collapsed and disappeared or vanished at high speed to a point of their own center.\r\n\r\nthe only people that i know who saw this (at the time) was my sister.  \r\n\r\nthe next day at school, i heard of other people saying that they saw if and did not know what it was.\r\n\r\nthe next day, in the evening, on a local radio station, i heard a news article about the three circles.  the explanation was simple... a weather experiment but what agency was conducting the experiment was not given.  to the best of my memory, we had had no unusual weather in the areas at that time or the periods before or after.\r\n\r\nsince the event, i grew up normal, i obtained advanced education (bs undergraduate and bs masters with experience in aviation - i am a pilot.)  i have been reading and studying the ufo claims and now believe there are elements of truth in some of these reports.   additionally i have learned of multiple incidents where the government has lied to its citizenry in many areas.  this plus the conversation with my sister about my observation (which was very similar to hers) has lead me to file this report.  additionally i have never before or after the above event ever seen this type of phenomenon.  nor have i hear or read of a similar event anywhere else.  these are the reasons and events (or lack of events) which has lead me to file this report.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":86059,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.05955469274007,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08192017-0022","longitude":-78.91696192505785,"occurred":-206668800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North Carolina","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1503177721000,"summary":"Three round exploding shapes in sky -
