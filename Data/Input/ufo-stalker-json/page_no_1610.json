2am-ish ive seen wat at first i thought was star but the movements convinced me it was a star.It was pulsin and had another which seems to be circling it like orbiting..This was another reason that had me constantly looking up now.So when i spotted this one i just knew and felt a sense of unexplainability in me,sorry! all i can do was pull out my phone and got to snap about four pictures i try to get one as close as possible but really blurry. i would like some feedback i would like to know if i am right or wrong? plane? or ufo? i watched it until they were all gone the 1st two seem to just

been on the ground at one point. it was not confirmed to have landed however because houses and trees obstructed the view at first.\r\noriginally we concluded that the orb was nothing more than a candle or light tied to a balloon. this was instantly rejected when the orb began maneuvering. the orb ascended, then descended, then ascended slowly again. the maneuvering seemed rather unstable at first, but the orb finally ascended much farther into the sky and all six of us were able to observe the orb move from our neighborhood south towards the city of tucson at a speed of probably 90-100 mph in a very linear path. we all watched the orb until it was about the size of a small star and eventually faded in the distance over the city of tucson, about 10 miles away. the even lasted about five minutes.\r\nabout 30 minutes after the sighting, incredibly strange sounds projected from the tortillita preserve desert down the street. the sound was unlike anything we have ever heard, and we are outside every night when we smoke our cigarettes.\r\nthe sound was similar to a dog, but mixed with a high pitched opera singer, and had a slight vibrational low frequency humming during the

how vivid and blue the sky was i saw something of a flash come into my view heading east at about (and i am estimating here) 4 miles out and about 15,000 feet up (much lower than most jets i see in

back.It was the scariest thing i had seen really freaked me out. we took a video of it on an iphone but there is no comparison to seeing it in person. this orange light in the sky was huge bigger then any plane we have seen from our balcony in the same area.We had been livin there fo years and go out on the balcony quite often and had never seen anything like that before.We saw that sometime in december 2011 i believe for about an hour long.It would appear&then reappear every few mins and sometimes would go away for like 15 mins then come back it didn't look like it was flying it look like it would like hover in the same place didn't really look like it was moving and we saw it dart across the sky once or twice the first time i thought my eyes were playing tricks on me but the. me and my bf saw it happen again.Also this big huge orange light was bigger in the sky at that far a distance was bigger then a street light in front of us that we could see off the balcony. we had been looking hoping to see it again ever since.May 5 2012 around 9:45-10:25pm my sister and i were sitting on the balcony having a smoke while boyfriend and dad were at our new place right down the street moving stuff as we were moving out that day.My sister was like \" oh what is that?\" i look up and i was shocked! it was the huge orange ball of light that i had seen before. it really freaked her out because i had told her before what we had seen and showed her the videos.We were both really freaked out because it was exactly what i had seen before. again this huge light was just an orange light no other lights that blinke at all or anything it was almost in the exact location as the one was the last time. we watched it disappear and reappear like it had done previously. the only difference this time was it was not foggy out so it was more clear. i could see a light over top of the water this time not sure if it was a light flashing down or the fact that this light was so huge that it was reflecting off the water. and then out of nowhere a second one appeared and the first one disappeared ! it was the first time we had seen 2 ! i had like no space left on my phone to video tape most but i caught the part on film where the one was there the second one appeared and the first one then disappeared. we watched for about a half an hour watching then disappear and reappear at one point we saw them both side by side in the sky! it also looked like when the one was in the sky&we could see the light across the water we could see this big ball of orange light move towards us slowly it was like in the same spot but would slowly move closer. i called my boyfriend when i saw this and told him to get back over here to see as he had seen it before with me. by the time he got back it was gone. as it was disappearing and reappearing when it was gone it would just simply not reappear. we have videos though we made sure of that. we moved out that day though so i doubt well ever see it again this building blocks the view of where we had seen them twice before.","distance":"101-500 Feet,

felt wrong. so i decided to look out my window, and sound got louder. i looked up and saw the typical stars in the sky that dim in the distance motionless. only one moved to the right and was sort of glued to the other, it is when i went to my room and got my iphone, i needed to record it. while im getting camera ready i look up, the stars was triple the size and getting bigger as it got closer descending to our neighborhood. \r\nthe sound got louder, fellt and sounded like pulsating waves of sound, i immediately felt scared because the object got closer and i saw a clear look as it hovered pass my apartment, did not look nor sound like a jet, plain, helicopter or any other flying vehicle we know. it was definitely ship like, huge, the pulsating lights were under it, like 3 light circles pulsating and as it pulsated emitting the sound. it was disturbing, ship hovered by, then i saw more coming and recorded, i captured about 2 minutes of the sound very disturbing, as well as the light strobes, and on the video u can see the one that moved, hovered and disappeared out of nowhere. im uploading a video here, but i recorded about 8 more i'll upload today. i am still shaken, scared, couldn sleep, noises and hovering stopped at around 3:30am eastern time.\r\n\r\ni know for a fact it's ufo, objects behaved like stars first then moved, ascending, descending, fast, then when passing by each other, hovering for a second like communicating then continue moving in opposite directions.\r\n\r\nsound were very loud, coming and going as ships were hovering back again. i spotted at least 5 ships that hovered back and forth. and 3 specific ones that were together on a straight line, they would hover a bit and move but always in formation, those were white center, and outer glow was yellow, blue and red.\r\n\r\ni have more video footage, hopefully usa releases an official statement, if not i need to submit this info, i want the world to see we are not alone, if we are in for an invasion, last night was definitely a test. as they went and returned for about 3 hours.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

to the parking lot, we noticed an old couple standing on the walking bridge. i stopped to see what they were looking and pointing at and noticed a bight light in the southeast sky. i was looking at what appeared to be a light that was twice as large as any star that was in the sky. suddenly more lights appeared. at this time the park had shut off all of their lights and the bridge was full of people heading to the parking lot. the light appeared to be just above the tree tops across the lake from where we were all standing. this light then disappeared. a few seconds later more lights appeared at about a 45 degree angle from us and more in the southern sky then when the first light appeared. there were a total of about 4-5 lights at this time and they all would get really bright and then dim. during this whole time we could not hear anything except the frightened people on the bridge who were witnessing this event. these lights formed no certain pattern they had just appeared in the sky and were going from about a star like size to about the size of a penny. these lights held their position for about 30 seconds until they started moving around in the sky. these lights chased each other in weird patterns going from the southern sky to the southeast, then to the southwest, the whole time they would get really bright and then dim. they also would gain and loose altitude in just a matter of a few seconds. it reminded me of what i would think a \"dog fight\" would look like. the difference being the fact that these lights would appear and disappear and change direction and altitude too quickly to be a jet. everyone watched these light for a few minutes when they all just vanished. after looking for them for about 5-10 seconds, someone noticed that they had moved behind us and were now in the northern sky and were acting same way. they were in the northern sky for about 20-30 seconds when they vanished again and then reappeared back in their original spot in the southern sky. we watched these objects and never heard them make any sounds. after about 10 mins of watching this event, we could hear the sound of jets coming from behind us (the northern sky at this time) and 3 military jets flew right over us (about tree top high) and headed right in the direction of the lights. these lights then shot straight up in the sky and were gone.\r\nwe waited on the bridge for about 20 mins to see if anything would return but nothing did. but as we were heading back home, my sons mom (who was in rochester at the time on lake manitou) called to ask us where we were at and if we had seen anything weird. my son told here what we had seen and she said they were out on the pontoon and seen the same thing. rochester is about 60 miles from where we were at and she had seen them.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":38068,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.7515669,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05112012-0003","longitude":-86.7611543,"occurred":1216796400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1336723461000,"summary":"Various

i saw a single bright red light moving in my direction (west). at first i thought it was a landing light from a jet aircraft taking off from cleveland hopkins but the light was very red and bright in color. object was moving slowly and continued west until 45 degrees above the horizon, where it stopped moving. i immediatley saw another red light moving in the same direction as the first object , red in color and bright. this second object stopped about 30 degrees above the horizon . at this time both objects are not moving. occaisionaly, the objects would abruptly and i mean abruptly ,change to white  and then back to red. i then saw the third red object approach from the same direction and then stop and hover about 30 degrees above the horizon. from my vantage point they formed a somewhat triangular formation. not a perfect triangle ..The lead object then moved south stopped, then northeast back to towards the other 2 objects. then it stopped again. the three objects then all moved back to the east, i lost sight of the last 2 objects as they went below the tree line in my line of sight. the lead object then went dark. about 30 seconds later the lead object again began to light up with a red color. at this point i ran into the house and got my binoculars. coming back out i saw these 3 objects again were taking  the same path as i described ,for a second time. all were staionary and then the lead and second object began to move towards one another. i looked at them through the binoculars , got  a good focus and could see the objects plainly were round, sphere shaped. these 2 objects were moving together and i thought they were going to collide. i could barely see any space betwen them when they quit moving together. now the objects bagan to move east again and i lost site of the trailing (3rd) object. at this time my wife came out because i was yelling for her. the 3 objects again moved west in our direction my wife was able to see all 3 objects at this time. the objects then began to move away to the east . the lead object stayed behind and hovered while the 2 other objects disappeared from view behind the tree line. this lead object then began moving laterally again to the south and began to dim. i watched through the binoculars and could see there was a definate shape as the light faded to black. conditions were clear sky, no moon, no wind , temp about 50 deg f. no light pollution , as my back yard is pretty dark. i'm 59 years old, i hold a commercial pilots liscense (i do not fly for the airlines but am an active and current pilot). this was a good sighting. the objects never moved at a high rate of speed, but rather slowly the whole time , except when they were stationary. they were not airplanes, as no acquistion strobes were seen. the entire object gave off light. the objects did not travel far in any direction, they seemed to stay in a relativley confined area of the sky .Not sattelites, as they they reversed direction several times.I know what sattelites look like in the night sky. i saw no low flying aircraft before or after this sighting. i did see high altitude jets , however. these objects appeared to be fairly low. i can't gauge how far they were away or how high they were. but these had to have been seen by other people. they were bright and very obvious..Call me at my home if you would like to chat. i will make sure i read the local newspaper to see if anyone else saw these.

plane at first, but it was too low in the sky. then i realized i couldn't see wings. i decided to try and speed up to get a better look and saw that it too was speeding up slowly then moved to a high rate of speed over the school. as a tall tree passed my view for half a second(i was driving 55 mph) the object was gone. there was no clouds in the sky and no obstructions. this is my first daytime sighting. from the time i saw the object to the time it vanished was approximately 15-20 seconds. i was perplexed at first, then just intrigued and wanting to see better detail, by the time the sighting was over i was in awe and excited. it definitely solidified the existence of these unknown objects for me.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

eye contact with the ufo it took off faster than a fighter jet. i believe it was hovering before i spotted it, but it was not in my line of sight for more than 2 seconds. i looked above the tree line and saw a very bright red circle of light with two beams of yellow golden light coming off each end (looks like this shape basically -o-) only about an inch across in the sky. it was like literally as soon as eye contact was made from me it knew it because it zoomed off to the right behind the treeline. it was a very solid controlled movement like it had no problem changing directions and accelerating. didnt look like solid matter either more of just light, there was no texture almost as if a spotlight was making a very strange shape on the sky (no clouds this night either). i spotted it and it was 100% some object accelerating at extremely high speeds out of my view as soon as i saw it. very strange encounter i didnt really know how to respond afterwards. i was with my brother and a neighbor both of them were facing me so it was behind them. after it happened i got crazy goosebumps and my body was shaking, felt like my head was playing tricks with me but im positive it was something. about 30 seconds after it left i think there was a slight rumble like thunder from very far away im not sure if that is related to the ufo or not. thanks for this website im glad i can share some solid information with others who care. this has really changed how i look at things now.... man, i cant believe i actually saw a ufo ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

a man-made object until i see the object do something that is unnatural to man-made objects.\r\n\r\non may 9, at approximately 8:00 pm mt., i was in my jacuzzi for about 10 minutes when i noticed a bright object starting north of me heading south.\r\n\r\nthe object did not appear to be too far away.  it was approximately 20-25 degrees about the horizon looking east.\r\n\r\nthe object was was solid white, very bright, with no flashing at all.  it was shaped kind of like a mushroom top.  flat on the bottom and curved at the top.  i was watching it travel north to south at a fairly slow speed.  i watched it for 10 seconds.  it made no sound or left no contrail.\r\n\r\nthere was no other low level aircraft at this time.  there were however light high altitude aircraft flying at this time\r\n\r\nat that moment, i took my eyes away for a split second and looked back and the object was gone.  i am not sure if it just disappeared or took off somewhere at a high rate of speed.  all i know is that i kept looking for the object and would not see it again.  \r\n\r\nthe sky was clear and calm.\r\n\r\ni live about 6 miles south of the colorado springs airport and about 2 miles east of fort carson and have seen several different kinds of aircraft.  this object did not act like any aircraft i know of.  i am 22 years retired from the air force so my background on aircraft is pretty

anything like it. i live in rural northern michigan and there is no light pollution and the moon wasn't up yet. my wife advised me that there was a freeze warning and i should cover the strawberries since they had started to blossom. i had my led coonhunting light on and i was dragging a tarp across the yard to cover up my strawberries. i shined my light on a tall pine tree across the road and saw 3 bright orange objects shining back at me. they looked just like raccoon eyes only bigger and brighter so i turned the light off and they stayed on, then they went out for a few seconds. i shined the tree again and they shined back at me again only much brighter this time. i turned out my light and they stayed on for a few seconds and went out again. i was dumbfounded and confused because when eyes reflect they go out instantly when you turn off the light source. then they lit up again only this time they weren't behind the tree, they were to the right of it and i could tell they were much higher in the sky than i originally thought. this time they stayed on and hovered in the shape of a triangle. then all 3 lights rotated and stopped then went out. i ran into the house and grabbed my video camera and got my wife. when we got back out two orbs lit up a little further south for just a few seconds and went out again but there were two other twinkling lights (didn't look anything like planes) moving north very slowly. they stopped then moved back to the south one following the other making no sound at all then left over the tree line. i managed to catch a few seconds of the sighting on digital video. the \"twinkling\" crafts didn't appear on the video since they were so far away at that point.\r\n\r\ni posted my sighting on facebook and two of my friends also said they saw it but had not planned on telling anyone until they saw my post. one friend was in his house 10 miles west of me near m-68 and m-33 and his wife saw it out the window. he went outside and saw it clearly. he saw 3 bright lights (red, green and white) hovering about 100 yards away then they went out. he said the lights were definitely not an airplane. it was close and made no sound. \r\n\r\nanother friend was traveling east on m-68 near m-33 east of afton, michigan. he saw 4 bright orange lights out the window of his truck. they appeared to hover then moved toward onaway. he tried to keep up with it but lost sight of it over the trees. he also saw two \"craft\" following the lights but they appeared to \"twinkle\" like a star. he is a fire chief and very credible.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional
