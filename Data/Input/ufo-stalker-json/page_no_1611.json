years old. i have seen three ships as ships, up very close about a hundred feet from them. i have seen  cars do very odd things which in all probability they were small craft instead of cars. i have seen portals in broad daylight. i have seen kiwi birds in nacogdoches as well as mule deer, none of which are here in this part of texas.\r\n\r\ni am often psychic and sometimes i see the future. i know nothing of coming disasters they haven't told me anything like that.\r\n\r\nthey have saved my life eight times that i know of. one of the incidents was saving me from an exploding cannon. someone got hurt in my place. there is lots more stuff. this is just a brief overview. they come one or more times a month. they have been very active the last two months.\r\n\r\ni believe at the

thought i was crazy, and they helped me through some rough spots. i always thought that guardian angles were doing stuff to me.\r\n\r\ni'd like my case investigated further by mufon if possible. i will take lie detector tests, x-rays, anything. i want the truth revealed to and understood by the public. i do not like having a secrete life.\r\n\r\ni also had cancer when i was 2.5 years old. i had it for over a year before they found out why i was sick. it was a sarcoma. the doctors didn't have a clue as to why i lived long enough for them to find it. sarcoma is the most invasive cancer there is. most still die from it. i may have been the first to live from

stars. i was sitting in a chair near my heating stove at 4:00am to punch the fire up and put a little coal on it, and all of a sudden through what used to be a door on the backside of the house, i saw a light that i thought might have been an airplane. i thought, ���that was strange looking���. i went to my living room window to look up and see if the object was flying overhead but i couldn���t see it anywhere, which i thought was strange because by then it should���ve been right outside my window where i could see it. i decided to go outside to film it. i keep my camera in my pocket all the time. when i got outside, i couldn���t see it, and the reason i couldn���t see it was because it was straight up over my head about 1,500ft in the air or possibly further. it almost looked like a tiny ant from where i was standing. i could tell that the top of it was spinning around and the bottom was too. the top dome was spinning to the right and the bottom dome was spinning to the left. the entire craft was glowing except for the inner part, which was dark.  you could see little lights rotating around from the middle of the craft. there were also lights flickering from the bottom of the craft. if the craft would���ve been 100ft in the air from me, i believe it would���ve at least been 75 to 100ft in length and about 40ft in width. it was a huge craft. it wasn���t stationary but most of the movement on the video was caused by me trying to keep it in view. the craft was somewhat wobbling. the reason there are two videos of it is because i got excited and i was going to take snapshots of it while i was recording but instead i pressed the wrong button and caused it to stop recording. when that happened i had to start recording again. by the time i zoomed in on it again it took off in a split second and disappeared right before my eyes. when it took off, all the lights (pole lights and house lights) in the holler shut off for a second and then turned back on. it turned off my camera, which is why there is no more footage after it left.  the sound you hear at the end of the video i didn���t hear at the time i was filming. the entire event lasted for about 40 seconds. i have included the original videos and an edited version of the videos.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

where the light was coming from and it was then that i saw the really bright lights that were just there , in sky , on this object that made no noise. the object seemed to hover and then move in a straight line, then back again. it would decend a little, then go back up. it would continue like this. it looked like an airplane was in the area, and the object seemed to go crazy with its lights.

driving north on m-65 between twinning and whitamore, noticed pressure changed in cab of truck, felt the engine noise was louder than normal and was looking at computer display when noticed lights in the sky around nnw (11:00 to due north on road). three equally spaced white lights that seemed like big stars, oriented in a horizontal line just above treeline. then a orange ball, 2-3 times the size of the white lights, appeared equally spaced to the left of the three white lights. the orange ball was darker at its center and brighter at the edges and was roughly the size of 1/2 my pinky finger nail held out in front of me. all of these lights glowed continuously without flickering and without moving. then the white lights started to turn off, in sequence of left, right, then middle, leaving only the orange light on for a small amount of time before it too went out. no fading of lights, all just turned off like switches had been tripped. at this point, the pressure / sound difference in the cab of the truck stopped abruptly. overall, i estimate the experience to last 5-10 seconds total. \r\n\r\nmy travels continued after the first sighting with me going north on m-65, through whitemore, until m-55 without noticing anything else. i turned east on m-55 and continued until sand lake road, noticing that 3-4 cars of people were stopped at different points of m-55 along the sides of the road (going either direction). this leads to the second sighting:\r\n\r\n2) at 10:25 pm edt: turned north onto sand lake road and immediately noticed a single orange ball above the tree line at nne (about 1:00 oclock from due north on the road). this was identical in type to the orange ball from earlier, but about 1/2 the size. roughly 2 seconds into seeing the ball it simply turned off, at which time i looked straight down sand lake road and saw two orange balls of the same style appearing to be over sand lake itself. i believe there was actually 4-5 lights, as a 'leap-frog' sequence of turning on and off started going horizontally across the sky (with numbers indicating position of lights going left to right). when i first saw them, lights 1 and 2 were on for about 2 seconds, after which light 1 went off and 3 went on; then two went off and 4 went on; then 3 went off and 5 went on; then both lights 4 and 5 remaining lit simply turned off in unison. this whole sequence of on and off lasted roughly 5-7 seconds, with each newly lit light remaining on for only about 1 second. \r\n\r\nafter the second sighting i was able to make it to my cottage (around another 5 minutes of drive time) for the evening and am now creeped out and not wanting to go outside again. i told my daughter of both incidents just after each of them happened and she encouraged me to report this as she reported extremely similar lights and behavior in 2008 outside of west lafayette in where she went to grad school.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":38046,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.2341852,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05092012-0027","longitude":-83.7233171,"occurred":1336625700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1336632738000,"summary":"Blinking star-like lights and orange balls in sky","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Twinning & National City, Michigan","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:4846"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Tawas City","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Almost exactly one half hour after another sighting.\r\ni was not the first to see this event. i was sitting inside and my mother called out the family. she was smokeing and she sees 4 lights that are all flashing at the same time and that are about 10 degrees apart. these all moved at the same rate (about 10 degrees per second with one flash every second) we followed the lights from north west to south west. they suddenly stoped over the tree line and then stayed in place for a good minute. they then suddenly dropped out of sight behind tree line. \r\nabout ten seconds after we got outside (15 seconds elapsed time from first sight to four members outside) we heard the roaring start. the roar continued for about 10 seconds after the objects sppeared. aproximit elapsed time 3 minutes. \r\nall members saw same thing.

but the roar lasted a good minute or two then faded rapidly.\r\n\r\n(side note) out of the corner of my eye i saw a light appear and then dispear to the south very small and dull, probablly no importance. miles away another family member heard explosions that woke her dog at the exact same time.

was camping with friends in penticton in a camp site within city limits. i was sitting on a picnic table having a conversation with my girlfriend. i looked up at the stars and saw what i thought was a flashing satellite. as i stared t it it disappeared. i stood up and began searching for it, inadvertently annoying my girlfriend for ignoring her statement. as i searched i found another flashing object on the other side of the sky. unsure if this was the same object i observed it's behaviour. it was flashing in a random pattern with random colours as far as i could distinguish.Over the course of 3-4 minutes it did this several times, flashing, disappearing and reappearing covering vast distances in a split second. at this point i began to shakes my friends tents saying \" get up! you gotta see this! i managed tor rouse 5 of my friends from their tents. by this time a second object had joined in. they would pair up on opposite sides of the sky directly above us flashing almost in synchronization. they would carry on the same routine; flashing, disappearing and reappearing. eg. if my field of view was a box with side a on the left, side b on the right, side c on the top and side d on the bottom; object a would start at a and object 2 at b. flashing for a few seconds then disappearing to reappear with possibly object 1 at side c and object 2 at side d. this went on for approximately 5 minutes. then the pattern changed. they would sway back and forth across the sky, like they were playing chicken or something. again after a few minutes the pattern changed  to swirling around each other, gradually getting larder and smaller diameters. then at the end of a large diameter swirl they raced towards each other stopped simultaneously and shot of in a east and west direction away from each other in opposite directions. the rush of energy i felt after that was exhilarating. i had never felt so alive. good luck getting sleep after that. so we sat around for a few hours after that talking about what we had seen, bugged the people who missed it, and swapped stories of other people we knew who had encounters to one extent or the other. i feel very lucky to have witnessed it and hope to see others, though i had seen a type of pink wormhole or an orb of some sort in 2007 but have never found anything close to the description of what i saw. for several years after this incident i was obsessed with tracking ufo sightings but as time carried on i graduated and got focused on my career so until now i haven't been involved. that is until i discovered the tr-3b flying triangle which was reversed engineered by usaf from roswell. it uses a magnetic disruptor field to lower the mass of the craft by 88%! check it out guys the future is now and we are not alone in the universe! thank you so much for allowing me to finaly report this and thank you for your

apx. 7pm 5/8/12. \r\n\r\non the corner of presidio and pine i noticed the sky. it was a rare and beautifully temperate day, a rarity as sf is frequently enshrouded in clouds and i felt i had to take note of what seemed like endless blue above me. i noticed something flying in a straight line high in the air hundreds of feet away. \"a bird\", i thought. it had to be a bird, it was too small to be a plane. i called upon my common sense and admittedly small pool of zoological knowledge and thought again. \"why would it be flying alone so high up? it can't possibly be hunting, it's too high. it can't be hurt, it's too high.\" it didn't make sense. at this point i literally giggled out loud to myself and thought of the gullible suckers who would have immediately leapt to identifying this thing as a ufo. mid-chuckle i became a sucker myself. \r\n\r\nit changed course suddenly. not violently, not totally drastically either, but it started taking turns faster than any flying object i've ever seen. it sounds crazy, but as fast as it was going it's movement was still graceful - like a leaf falling sideways. i am confident in saying that if this was indeed a tangible object it completely defied the human grasp of aeronautic physics. my smile faded and i stood transfixed. the light dimmed and grew stronger. a pin-prick of orange swelled into a glowing orb and then back down again. it seemed to calm it's turning a bit and stayed bobbing at a relatively fixed point in the sky; it's size still inhaling and exhaling light. with my head cocked like a dog that's heard a noise it doesn't understand, i was jolted back into reality by the shrill honk of a car. i looked down. a friend of mine who happened to be driving by waved and gestured for me to get in - \"i'll give you a ride\" she mouthed. i looked back up at the sky and there again was the endless blue - the orb had vanished.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":38021,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.7844495,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05092012-0004","longitude":-122.4113455,"occurred":1336528800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1336551759000,"summary":"A small orb of orange light flying straight at first and then started erratically changing direction. it then appeared to hover briefly and disappeared.","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"San Francisco, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:4867"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82757,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1611}
