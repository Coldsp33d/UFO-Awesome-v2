thought i should go in the house and get my phone to take some pictures.  i grabbed my phone and turned it on and went back out onto the deck and continued to stare. when i looked at my phone to get the camera on i noticed that it had frozen so i started to shout to my neighbor who was just inside his house to come out and take a look.  he didn't hear me.  it was then that i noticed my other neighbors car coming home so i went through the house and out the front door to get them to look up at the sky. by this time the last of the orbs that i had seen had just started to head up to the clouds.  my  neighbors did see it and as i was telling them the direction that they had come from another one started to rise above the trees and follow the same path as the others. we all wondered what they could be?  thinking that maybe it was military or some type of fire work or flare, maybe even metiors.  there was no noise.  not until the last one disappeared above the clouds did we hear a plane.  they were mostly red orbs with what appeared to be orange or yellow on the right side. they rose up from the south and continue rising up through the clouds on a northern direction. i saw them for at least a few minutes.  they were moving at a steady pace with no sudden bursts of speed or change of direction.  what ever they were it was a pretty cool thing to

order us a pizza for supper and decided that we would go and pick it up instead of having them deliver it. my aunt lived in a suburb, we were leaving the suburb to get the pizza when we noticed something very low in the sky above us, hovering over the center of the road. we stopped at one of the stop signs and rolled down the windows to get a better look at it. above us was a dark (black-ish, near the color of the night sky) object, triangular in shape as far as we could tell. three lights went along the bottom of it, one in the front and two in the back. there was no sound, just the lights and faint outline of the craft. it was low...Really low...Probably just a few feet above the houses on either side of the street. it simply sat there. a few minutes after we had been stopped to look at it, another car pulled up beside us. it was crammed full of people - most looking around their mid-twenties to mid-thirties. they stopped and rolled their windows down as well to talk to us. they asked us if we knew what it was, we answered that we didn't. and a short conversation between my aunt and a couple of guys in the car went on about it for a bit. at one point a couple of the people in their car got out to look at it. eventually we noticed the time and that the pizza place would be closing soon. so we left and hoped that the craft would still be there when we got back. it took us about 15 minutes or so to go get the pizza. and when we turned into the suburb we kept looking in the sky, but the craft was gone and the other car full of people had left as well. we then headed back to my aunt's house and told my dad and uncle, who, of course, thought we were joking and had made it up. my aunt was never someone who believed in the paranormal, and this was the only time i got to talk to her about such things without her laughing. in fact, not once during the whole encounter did she make any jokes or chuckle.","distance":"20 Feet or

my crayons in a butterfly-shaped notepad. the only light was a dim street light that was a few yards behind me and slightly to my left. i could just barely see to draw and was mostly just trying to get constellations in the right place in my drawing. as i was looking at the sky, i saw what i thought was a star. but it was moving across the sky. so, having seen plenty of helicopters and planes in the night sky before, i assumed that's what it was. it was just about as big and bright (and even looked about as far away) as the stars around it. there were no other lights like most planes have, it was just the single white light moving across the sky at a steady pace. it had almost crossed the entire sky, when it got near the treeline...And then shot rapidly across the sky! it was as fast as a shooting star, but i had never saw a shooting star move so slowly across half the sky and then shoot like that. i thought it was strange, but continued my drawing. then, a few minutes later, i saw it (or a different one) come back over the treeline. it went slowly across the sky until it got right over head, then it shot across the rest of the sky as fast as the first one/first time. i then got scared, grabbed my notebook and crayons, and ran back home. i kept the drawing in that notepad that i drew for several years after that.","distance":"Over One

washing my sister's hair. from that window you can see an upward hill, my uncle's house, some trees; very little sky from that window is visible. as i was gazing out the window, i noticed that i could no longer see the ground, in fact, all i saw was the night sky. in the center of the sky was a large 4-pointed star. i remember at the time thinking that it was the star of bethlehem, as it looked exactly like the drawing on the back of a cross my mamaw had given me. i made a wish on it for a barbie doll that had just came out for my birthday that year, which was a month or two away. i do not remember what happened after that, it was as if i was no longer in my house during the episode. even the window panes were no longer visible as i was looking at this star-like object. i do remember thinking however, that this is home. i didn't really think about it much after that until a month or so later when i realized that through that window (or any window in my house really) i cannot see that much sky. and there are not stars that normally look that big. i can, however, remember the event vividly even today.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,
