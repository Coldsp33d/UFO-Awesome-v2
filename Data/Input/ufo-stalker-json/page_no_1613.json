patio. our apartment is a little over mid way up a 22 story high rise. i looked out the windows and saw an unusual orange light slowing moving by. i had no idea what i was looking at. when i first saw it, it had just come over the top of our apartment building moving south to north. our apartment faces west and north. it was a bright orange glowing orb. there was no physical ball or shape apparent, just the very bright orange glowing light. when i first saw it i could see what i can best describe as an aura. it was cloudy outside, but the ball was just under the cloud cover. according to an online weather site, the cloud cover was 800 feet. at one point it appeared to go through a small batch of clouds, but not to a point it was not visible. i watched it move along a straight line to the north until i could not see it any more. i would say the distance traveled before it went out of sight was 10+ miles, probably due to the cloud cover and light pollution. it had a very graceful glide to it and it was probably a little under a minute before i could not see it any more. we are in the city and there is an enormous amount of light pollution. we have to look very hard just to see the couple stars that are sometimes visible. when the orb was closest to us it appeared to move around or bob a little bit, but not veer off it's course.\r\nwe see a lot of helicopters and smaller planes fly around, but this was not a helicopter or plane. it was too orange to be any aircraft and it was silent. i am a night owl and it is not unusual for me to be up at 3:00 a.M. we have lived in this apartment for almost 4.5 years and have never seen anything like this before. my husband saw it as well. he went to get the unready camera and binoculars for viewing. we did not have a card in the camera and by the time i got it in it was too far away for a photo. if i had it when i first saw it, i would have had a great photo.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

night. i could see only a few stars in the sky. and they seemed to be in pairs of two. the red-orange \"star\" that we first spotted then started to \"wiggle\" around, more like hover around in a \"u\" shape. not just a little but an obvious amount of movement. that's really when i noticed the other objects in the sky. the one opposite of it, (same color and size) started up and that one stopped (for a few hours), and this new one started doing the same thing in only a matter or ten minutes or so. then we saw it jet off to the left of it. holding your hand to the sky a whole finger away. and not just hover over there it was fast! then it just continued to hover and move around for awhile. now two out of five people that were outside that night, saw one of the \"stars\" drop a small white looking light. they each saw it a different time in about an hours time. i am not sure exactly what these are, and i am not sure any one else knows either but i have a good feeling that these were not man made. i can go on about this for ahwile but here is the short n sweet verison. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*note: this is a small town so there are hardly ever any helicopters, airplanes, or

when we called to verify the time and found out that it was too late to go and visit so we turned around.   heading back towards the capitol on state street between walmart and the park/golfcourse near i believe veterans memorial way.....Not sure the exact name of the road.  the sigh ting all took place in between that area.  as we where driving my mom said \"oh my god, what is that?\"  i looked up from concentrating on the road and traffic around me to see in amayzement a very large distinct flying redish orange orb.  this orb was hovering in the vecinety above the power lines to the left of the road.  it was atleast 100 to 200 feet above the ground.  it was still light outside well enough to easily see what it was.  i was surprised that the other traffic on state street in that area didn't stop or slow down to get a better look.  i found it odd.  this took place for maybe a minute or two before all of a sudden the giant unmistakable orb vanished into thin air.  just as the orb had vanished my mother and i saw this tiny round disk shaped object float over the foothills.  it didn't have a normal trajectory that most flying objects tend to have.  it seemed to randomly move in a jagged motion as it maid it's way over the foot hills.  shortly after it had vanished over the foot hills the sky quickly became dark in a matter of minutes.  i found it quite odd how quickly it got dark after the sighting.  i don't recall any lapsed time while observing this event, but am contemplating having regressive hynosis done to me to try and recount the event in greater detail.

house. we sat on a hillside, overlooking the park, and at the edge of someone's yard.\r\nthe sky was bright and full of stars, but there were some low clouds covering the western sky, which were getting closer to us.\r\n\r\ni was looking almost straight up. the edge of the clouds were right above us. suddenly below the clouds a boomerang shaped craft \"appeared\". it was getting closer to us, coming at us, and getting bigger.\r\n\r\nit seemed like it dropped out of the cloud. it descended towards us for a couple seconds, then it stopped. it started moving south east in a slightly curved line and then it suddenly stopped made a 90 degree rotation (the whole craft turned like a steering wheel- staying flat)and then turned back (the turn seemed to give it propulsion to take off at an incredible rate of speed.)\r\nthere is only 1 tall building in town. it disappeared behind the building, but got noticable smaller (further away) as it did so. \r\n \r\nas i was watching, i tried to get my husband's attention, but i was in awe and by the end he was saying \"what?\" but it was already over..\r\nthe whole thing lasted maybe 10 seconds but that was long enough to get a good look.\r\n\r\ni thought it was a smaller craft at first, but i calculated the distance of the cloud cover and realized if it was truely that far away (about 1000ft feet) then it must have been huge, for me to see the details i saw.\r\n\r\nit blended in to the night sky. the texture reminded me of what you would see on a movie space ship. metal came to mind. (in my included pic, i have put a sample of a ship online in the bottom left corner as an approximation)\r\nit had 4 red \"lights\" on each side (i think the inner side, but it may have been the outer side, as it was 6 years ago) and what looked like a trap-door in the middle. the \"lights\" were not turned on.\r\n(like i said, the whole thing seemed to blend in with the sky)\r\n\r\ni tried to discount it as a plane, but planes don't move that fast or turn the way it turned.\r\n\r\nafterwords, i said to my husband \"did you see that?\". he said \"see what?\" so at first i thought maybe i was hallucinating. i explained to him as we walked home. i was now losing the awe and calm and excitement of the initial sighting and i began to get scared.\r\n\r\nit came down right on top of us, so i entertained thoughts that it wanted to abduct me. i was so terrified after that, i slept with the lights on for 4 days.\r\n\r\nonly about 10 people knew about this, until now. i decided to tell before the memories get too hazy.\r\n\r\n\r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,  Other","flightPath":"Hovering then

to urge to smoke a cigarette, so i went out the back door of my home.  a storm was rolling in and i could feel water droplets against my forehead.  i decided that it would probably be a better idea to sit in the swing on our front porch.  so i put them back in my pocket and withdrew inside.  my mom was sitting in the recliner next to the television and my father on the sofa to her right.  i told them that it felt like it was going to rain and where i would be if they needed me.  i walked through my house and onto the front porch.  it had not yet began to really rain but just sprinkle.  i usually put my headphones on and listen to music when i go outside to smoke when i'm at home, not at work of course.  i was about to turn my mp3 player and just happen to look up out skyward.  at night i like to look at the stars and the moon, but there was nothing but clouds, the radio tower across the street, and a strange red light.  i put my player back in my pocket and let my headphones dangle around my neck as i was trying to grasp what i was looking at.  there is a cellular tower perhaps a block away from the radio tower.  there is a beacon on top of it that flashes at a constant rhythm to warn any aircraft that is flying through the area.  the beacon's light is almost like a light blue, white color.  the object i saw i assumed to be a plane, but its pattern didn't match that of an aircraft.  it was as bright as the beacon, but with aircraft you can sometimes make out their shape by the distribution of the lights.  this thing was almost entire composed of red light.  at first i thought of flares and the airshow that is going on at mcas cherry point.  the base is in havelock, which is a good distance away, and with the coming storm i doubt they would have been flying any planes.  i stepped out onto the side walk to get a better look.  i cannot say for certain that it passed in front of or behind the radio tower, but it looked to be some distance away.  i was overcome by curiosity and excitement.  my first thought was to get my camera phone, but given my phone's camera doesn't work that well, i decided to observe and maybe get some close by to help me evaluate just what i was seeing.  so i rushed to the front door and called my parents to come and see.  i kept looking back to keep it in sight.  the lights path took it from the point where i first observed it, passed the radio tower, and some distance away before it finally disappeared.  my view was not interrupted by any buildings or trees, but i did move around in front of my home to observe it.  before it disappeared, it seemed to dim a bit almost out of sight but then brighten almost to full intensity.  then it began to slowly blink until finally it was out of sight.  i called again to my parents to come and look, by this time my father was making his way slowly up the hallway.  by the time he and my mother made it to the front porch, the object was out of sight, presumably gone.  i told him and my mother about what i saw.  he said it could have been a plane, but then he also mentioned that planes would fly in this weather.  they assumed it was my eyes playing tricks on me, so they went back inside.  the storm was really picking up at this point and i could see the lightning streaking across the sky.  i decided to stay, under the shelter of the porch for a time to see if the object would come again.  after a while i gave up and went back inside.  i went to my room thinking about what i had just seen and that i wanted to tell someone that might listen to me.  to be honest, i texted my friends and told them i just might have seen a ufo.  my friend and his wife that live close by said that it might have been a chinese lantern.  i do know that these kinds of lanterns might be kicked up by the wind, but they do not shine with the intensity of the object that i witnessed.  i tried talking to my coworkers today about it and asking if anyone had seen a bright red light in the sky last night.  none of them claim to have seen what i saw.  i'm sorry that i do not have any photographs to submit, but they would have been of poor quality as the object was emitting light.  the way i figured it would have been best to tell you of my experience.  maybe you can make some sense of what i saw.  thank you for

sky.  \r\n\r\ni noticed a white round balloon, or at least thats what i thought it was at first.  i thought i would just watch it until it drifted away by the wind, but it didn't.  it was breezy on the ground and i thought it should drift away from sight after awhile.  then i noticed another one close to it.  after about ten minutes these objects didn't move.  stay equil didstance apart, did not drift away. \r\n\r\nmy eyes were tired of stairing up.  so i looked away for alittle.  a friend of the family asked what i was doing.  i told him what i was looking at.  he joined me at looking up.  they were hard to see, but we found them lookin 90 degrees overhead.  now there were more.  in groupings of 3, at least 3-4 sets and a count of 14 total.  you couldn't see all at once.  i really had to focus on one small area to see two groups of three.  light blue sky in background, soft white disk.  3 out of 5 people were able to focus on the objects and confirm what i was seeing.\r\n\r\nthey appear to be the size of a bb at twice an arms length.  so my estimate was it was small and local or large and far.  my guess was large and in upper atmosphere.  this was arround 5pm and the sun didn't set until 8pm.  i was guessing the under side was being elluminated by the reflection of the sun off the pacific( just a guess ). \r\n\r\nthe sighting happened for about 45 minutes.  slowly disappeaing.  never changed location in sky.  always equil distance from each one and equil distance from each grouping. \r\n\r\nthe exact date has been forgotten since it has been 25 years ago. mid 80's summer time.  hoping that others might have info.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":37962,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.8673483,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05062012-0020","longitude":-118.0631971,"occurred":493282800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

was a third visible planet or so i thought. i noticed it because of how huge it was, how incredibly bright it was, how close it seemed to be to me, and the fact that every night i watch out the same window to see the stars and any planets that might be visible. i use an app on my phone so it tells me what constellation i am looking at, and what planets that includes. this particular object has not been in the sky before and my app could not pick it up as any known object. at first i though it was a planet. maybe jupiter, just based on how large it was.\r\n\r\nit was perfectly round, extremely bright, so bright i could see clearly in my bedroom without any lights on. i laid down in bed at 10pm and just laid there and watched it. it never moved. about 4am, i woke up to use the restroom, and when i went to get back into bed, i stopped at the window. the object was still there in the same spot. all the other stars, and natural heavenly objects in the sky had moved, but not this one.\r\n\r\nright as i was thinking to myself, how odd that was, the object took off. from a dead stop it took a south eastern direction. i was in a straight line, quiet, and moved fast, but no soo fast that i could not keep up with it. i did not even try to get a photograph, as night pictures of the sky just turn out blurry.\r\n\r\nduring the sighting i was at first not alarmed at all just curious. then when it was still there 6 hours later, i was concerned, and when it took off, i felt like calling everyone one i know to tell them about it. i was not scared. i have seen strange things in the sky before. i lost sight of the object because i live in a canyon surrounded by hundreds of pine trees. the county i live in has been reporting ufo's for years. as a matter of fact, 3 days later, i picked up the local paper and read an article about a family who live maybe 1/2 mile from my house who saw a ufo roughly the same day i did. i found this web site because they said they had reported to your site. i also reported it to the local newspaper, but did not contact local law enforcement. i did not feel the need to, as far as i can tell it never touched ground.\r\n\r\na couple of days after the event, i did notice that my body felt as though all my bones were fused together. and i was in a considerable amount of pain. i did see my doctor and he said my spine did seem to be locked tight, but i do have a history of that. i did joke with him that i thought that the ufo did it.\r\n\r\ni keep watching the skies, but have not seen  anything yet. i will keep trying.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

at the \"supermoon\" when i saw this reddish-colored round object (star-like in shape) moving at steady high-rate of speed (over 200 kts) from east to west at about 20 degrees above the horizon.  the des moines international airport was about a half-mile away from my position and aircraft would not be allowed (nor would have a reason) to move that fast that close to the airport.  the object had no position or strobe lights. the object was not descending as to land at the airport.  the east to west object was momentarily shrouded by lower altitude clouds moving south to north and by trees south of my position but did appears a few moments later and was still on its straight line path westbound.  being a private pilot, i do not believe what i saw was an aircraft of any kind, despite its proximity to the airport.  my first reaction was, i had seen red-colored chinese lanterns before and had been fooled into believing that they were a ufo.  however, this object did  not behave like a chinese lantern.  it moved much faster and did not flutter like the chinese lanterns do.  i lost sight of the object as it reached the western horizon about 2-3 minutes later.","distance":"Over One
