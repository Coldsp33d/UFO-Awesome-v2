move like helicopters or any planes i could think of.  for the next few minutes we peered out the windows as we drove and watched the lights slowly drift from the north to the south in a chain that drifted closer and farther from each other.  they also seemed to get brighter and dimmer, though i wouldn't exactly say they were flickering.  eventually as we merged onto 205 the lights grew dim as they headed south and soon after merging they disappeared altogether.  whether they disappeared rapidly or we just lost sight of them is hard to say.  \r\n\r\nhonestly, at first we just sort of

moving. i immediately had my friend (fellow witness) look up to make sure what i was seeing was not just a star and that it was actually moving. we both noticed a more triangular shape to the bright

moving through the night sky as well with the usual airplane lights and size, however this object seemed to be about 4 times the size of a commercial airliner when observed from the ground.We both tryed to capture it on video with our cell phones but when we tried getting it on our cell phone cameras nothing appeared in the sky. i am not sure what exactly this was, i am not saying it was an

almost 12 years this coming november 2012. i rode the 6 train down to brooklyn bridge. i sat on the first car by the doors of the train where people can change from car to car. the train ride itself was of no event. it was smooth, good, i prayed, chanted om, listened to a meditation cd on my iphone, i ate a zone bar, and balanced my check book. the train arrived to brooklyn bridge stop. i got out and walked towards the plat form across and made a left to walk upwards towards the middle back of the pending on coming train  4 or 5 towards atlantic ave station. due to the fact the stairs to get out are towards the back at this time, then off to star bucks for a cappuccino. the sign said 4 train in 13 minutes. there was nothing unusual about anything. i seen some people still sitting on the 6 train and wondered why they did not get out, it was the last stop. usually the conductor gets everyone off. but no conductor and people were just sitting. \r\n\r\ni lean up against a rail by the steps, and lean my back against the handrails, my right body leaned up against the steal larger bar from floor to ceiling. i observe a man across on the up town side of the tracks, homeless, older gentlemen, i think, \"poor guy, all these years of mental illness ( the field i work in) and still this man has no help. so, i see another man, checking me out. i look at him, he is wearing shorts, carrying a large duffel bag. i look back again, and still all the passengers are sitting waiting for the same train-down town brooklyn 4 or 5 train.\r\ni lean my head against the steel beam while i look, observe, and then closed my eyes and began to chant om to the music. i hear the train coming, i look up number 4. all the people behind me get up and enter the train. i feel relieved, its here on my way to work, coffee, get notes and paper work done. \r\n\r\ni get on the train, and i walk and find a seat. then i am lost when i look up i see i am at the astor train stop. i am confused, i become scared, i can't understand why, how, did i get on the 6 train up town to the bronx. conductor says \"next stop 14 street union sq\". now i say wait, \"how did i cross over the other side of the tracks to catch the 6 train?\" i am dazed, confused, frightened, i want to cry, but i cannot, i am like in shock, i am in union sq, 14 street, how did i get here, i cannot remember anything,i am confused, but at the same time i feel i have been dragged back and forth in time. i feel my mind, 'here and there.\" i am supposed to be on the 4 train headed to brooklyn, i got on it, i saw it, i waited 13 minutes. \r\n\r\nnow i am on union sq, 14 street, and i keep saying what happened how did i get here, tears welling, questions, i am light headed. i am confused, train sign says 9 minutes

looking up facing east when i noticed a bright orange ball/sphere looking object moving from south to north at about the same height as an airplane would fly, but traveling faster than an airplane.  it had no blinking lights, and no other colored lights.  it was just bright solid orange.  it moved in a straight line with no sound coming from it.  i pointed it out to my husband and we both watched it till it disappeared behind some trees.  i ran through the house to the front porch hoping to see it again, but it was gone. approximately 90 seconds long.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

for 'them' i see them. have had two sitings like yours in this area (st. albans) and one not too far from your siting. it's a wondrous thing. the reason i logged on today was an experience that i had last night--for reasons of brevity---will not go into now but i wanted to see who was in the neighborhood last night and bingo--there's your siting. i'm not saying our experiences were related but i'm here to tell you dude---you ain't alone---we ain't alone. the pisser about this is---it makes some people very nervous. it threatens their well ordered world. some people can't see beyond their own noses. it upsets the judeo-christian concept of things. i base all of my present belief system on one incontrovertible fact---space is infinite. no wall with a sign that says, \"the end.\" the question here is can the human mind truly grasp what infinity is? i'm not tethered to this universe and now neither are you. there's so much juicy food for thought here. go with it. and, right on, my brother.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:07","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

4/27/2010. as i approached the light i noticed an object at about 40 degrees elevation that was rapidly approaching and dropping in altitude heading in a westerly direction along thunderbird rd. the most notable feature was the cycling color shifts from white to grey and back to white. during the actual observation this appeared to be a single object possibly 5 to 15 feet across. the second most notable feature was the apparent intelligent movement. the object approached rapidly, then stopped and hovered at what i would estimate to be around 200 ft. altitude, and 100 to 200 feet away from my location as i was stopped at the red traffic light.\r\n\r\ni was surprised at this object hovering right in front of my lane of traffic, and i looked around to see if other drivers were noticing the same object nearby. as i was pulling out my phone to take a photo i noticed the driver in the truck to my left seemed to be watching the same event. i could not find the object on my phone screen, so i just snapped a couple of shots hoping to be able to capture something.\r\n\r\nthe object hovered for approx. 20 seconds as i sat in amazement watching the color shift back and forth from white to grey, and back again about every half second. i was observing the object from between power lines at this point, so i was able to see that the object stayed completely locked in position and motionless during its hover, except for the color shifts. i got the impression that the object was making observations of some kind just by the way it froze in position for a time.\r\n\r\nafter about 20 seconds the object set off for the north/north-east at a very rapid pace. it seemed again to be moving under intelligent control, but it didn't look like any kind of remote control vehicle i can think of, and the distances covered during its approach and exit would rule out any kind of toy remote control vehicle. no sign of any exhaust or trail were observed.\r\n\r\nafter i saw this i began searching the internet for similar sightings. around this time there was a rash of sightings of what were described as \"silver orbs\" around this part of town and to the north around the 101 freeway and 35th ave. there were also several orb sightings around south mountain during the surrounding month or so.\r\n\r\ni went back to look at the photos i took with my droid eris phone (poor quality), and at first thought that i had not captured anything. i did discover, however, that i did catch it in the right corner of one of my frames. i also discovered from the photo that the object was not a singular triangle-shaped object, but was rather 3 visible \"orbs\" forming a triangle. it seems that the color shift was due to individual orbs flipping from white to a grey color in a repeating pattern. i am uploading the original photo as taken with my phone, along with the same photo with some enhancements and notes. i'm also including an animated false-color gif file that helps to see the three distinct orbs.\r\n\r\ni would like to have contact with others who have had daytime sightings of close-up orbs or objects in the phoenix area.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500
