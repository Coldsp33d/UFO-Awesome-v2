much faster than i���ve ever known an airplane or helicopter to make alone, let alone two to do perfectly synchronized.  i watched the craft fly off to the north until they were beyond the one-story roofline of the building i had exited before witnessing these craft.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":37890,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.280068,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05032012-0004","longitude":-71.597227,"occurred":1334115900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Hampshire","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like,   Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1336063403000,"summary":"Triangle with orange lights at points and red pulsating light/beam of light from center. loud deep throbbing hum noise. two possible crafts.","tags":["triangle","lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"03303","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":22,"locationName":"Concord, New Hampshire","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:5432"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I have had 4 sightings over the years the one above was in the mid 60's. was sleeping out w/friends,not really getting any sleep. was laying on a sleeping bag on the ground looking up at the sky, it was a very clear night.  all of a sudden i saw what looked like a star moving across the sky, it appeared to be as high up as the stars. it went a short distance across the sky and then just stopped. i watched the spot until i fell asleep. i didn't say anything to the other guys due to it happening so fast, and trying to pick out the light in the sky with all the stars would have been pointless. and they would have said your seeing things.\r\n\r\nthe other sightings i had were in the 80's while on patrol.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I'm a grown man who still feels a little bit like a little kid every time i see an aircraft in flight. if i'm outside and one goes by, i've never been able to keep from diverting attention to it. in his day, my grandfather was in the air force, and so instilled in me a deep appreciation for aviation/aeronautics at an early age. it's still with me today. all i'm saying is, although i'm no expert by any stretch, i've always paid an above average amount of attention to passing aircraft, and up to this point i have never seen an object in the sky, even passing satellites, that i couldn't positively identify.\r\n\r\nwhile driving through a neighborhood just after sunset, i noticed an object in the sky, to the west of my location, headed east. at first i thought it was a helicopter, because through the trees, it's perceived size, altitude, and speed, matched that of the common medical/news/misc chopper you see frequently in the area. we also have frequent, often daily fly-overs of military apache helicopters, but this object seemed to move, at least at first, a bit faster than the typically observed apache cruising speed. \r\n\r\nintrigued, i exited the neighborhood and got a better look, with no obstruction from trees. although with rdu very close by, and the area not far from a large commercial flight path, i ruled out fixed wing aircraft immediately because i noticed the object was clearly round, or egg-shaped. within a couple of seconds, a light coming from roughly the center of the object became very bright. i originally mistook this light for a typical forward facing nose or wing-mounted 'headlight'. but, as the craft got closer, and also slowed down very rapidly, and began to hover, the light began to burn bright like fire. \r\n\r\nat this point, i turned on to another neighborhood street and immediately parked with the object in clear view. it had slowed to almost a complete stop, but with some slight drifting. it's shape was somewhat oval, like an up-side down egg, and had a bright light burning in the center. on a quiet evening with almost no noise pollution, i could hear no sound from coming from the object. all of these characteristics combined to remind me of the many hot air balloons i'd seen growing up in the midwest. however, when it slowed down, it's size and structural shape where much smaller, darker, and solid in appearance. based on it's distance from me, i assessed it to be roughly the size of the average mid-sized suv. \r\n\r\nthe light quickly grew so bright and firey that i realized it was not being put out by the object, but was actually a reflection of the sun, that had just dipped below the horizon. over about 10 seconds, it slowly drifted out of the waning sunbeam, and went completely dark. it had no lights of it's own, but was still very visible in the still back-lit light blue sky. \r\n\r\nso, after pursuing it's original course when i first sighted it, which i perceived to be eastward, and then pausing to drift for 10-15 seconds, it begin to move and pick up speed in a north-west direction. i pursued it through the neighborhood, but came to a dead end, and the object quickly disappeared behind a treeline. when i was able to get out to the main road, and searched in the area i thought it to be headed, it was nowhere to be seen. i attempted to capture it on my iphone, but the video is not worth watching.\r\n\r\noverall- just after sunset, near the intersection of high house and 55 in cary, nc, i observed an object that appeared to be several hundred feet up, and at it's closest, several hundred feet away. it appeared rounded or oval-shaped, suv-sized, with no lights of it's own, and no sounds that i could hear. i observed this object traveling in my general direction, slowing, for a brief time intensely reflecting the waning sunlight, hovering, then traveling away.

brightness it appears that the object has a physical form, and it also seems to have multiple colors. it is possible that the colors are an artifact of the digital photo process, but i believe the object is made of sufficient pixels to reveal that it actually does have shape, and color. the red and blue colors on the enlarged version do not appear to be the typical fringe colors you would find in a digital photo from my experience.\r\n\r\ni also found that with the artificial color enhancement the pixels below the object were significantly different from any other pixels on or near the

dismissed it thinking it was a helicopter flying low. about ten minutes later it flew back the other way. just then i came into the room and she mentioned the light and what did i think it was doing. i noticed that it was coming towards our house so i ran outside to see what it could be. when we looked up there it was right over the house. it was about 100 ft. up,triangular shaped with rounded corners and the sound it had was a low hum. the speed was about that of a slow moving helicopter. it had three red lights, one in each corner, a large white light in the center and a strobe light on it's front. the bottom of the craft had a lead/gray color and appeared mottled. we watched it moving back and forth as it proceeded down over our neighbors pasture. my wife says it seemed like it was looking for something or maybe like it was mapping something. it was 20 degrees below zero that night and we were standing outside without jackets or shoes. we didn't persue it and wish we had now. \r\nthe next day there were several people who called into the local radio staion asking if anyone else had seen this thing. we also saw an article in a little newspaper in the northern part of our county which talked about several people observing a similar flying object two weeks before. one person said they saw it hovering over the community medical building late one night and the other person said they were at a different angle on a hill and saw windows with some beings inside. we are not sure if it was the same object we saw, but the description sounded similar. a very exciting

arizona. was an interesting ride. \r\n\r\nwe were at the south east rim of the grand canyon, navajo point is it's name. there are a few parking spots there, and small observation spot. this just a very small spot on the canyon, the more popular spots are down the road. the sun had set and there was no moon. we were all in our own little worlds enjoying the amazing night sky. i live in the citu and i'm lucky if on a clear night i can see 15 stars.\r\n\r\ni was in total awe of the night sky out there, it is totally amazing. for the first time i understood why they call it the milky way, the sheer density of the star field, incredible. so we were all enjoying the sky, you could easily see \"shooting stars\" and satellites. there i am alone but not far from the others when i hear a loud, \"what the hell is that???!!\" i went over to where it came from, we all gathered there in a line, and there they were in the sky.\r\n\r\nin the southern sky at about maybe a 50 degree angle were 2 large lights. a big one following a smaller one. they appeared as large lights in the sky. to give an idea of how large they looked, the larger one was like 25 stars put together in size. they both were bright with a orangish color, the smaller of the 2 had more of a uniform color, whiter. the larger one had a whiteish center surrounded by an orangish hue. they moved across the sky from west to east in a slight arc/downward angle. they didn't just move in a line though, the surged and stopped, surged and stopped. it was very fluid though, the pauses they made were not jerky, the motion was smooth. they continued across the sky until the smaller one, the one in front appeared to stop moving while the other continued, but it didn't stop. it started to get smaller, and fainter until it disappeared straight off into space. then the other did the same. we all watched it as it got smaller, and smaller, until finally it was gone. the entire time i was the only one who spoke, and i repeated the same thing over and over, \"what the @#%$ is that??!!, can anyone tell me what the @#%$ that is??!!\" none of us had an answer. now we're not rocket scientists, but we we're not morons either. we tried to figure out what it could have been, plane, helicopter, weather balloon (lol) and no matter what rational explanation we came up with, there was always a reason why it couldn't have been that. we concluded that there wasn't an explanation, and we didn't know what it was.  5 people including myself all saw the same thing. \r\n\r\ni can't sit here and say that it was for sure, 100% an \"alien\" spaceship. there was a \"craft\", or vehicle, and it definitely disappeared right off into space. so i'm basically at 2 conclusions, either it was \"aliens\", or someone here on earth has technology hundreds of years ahead of anything the public knows about.\r\n\r\ni didn't believe in ufo's before this happened, i was a skeptic. i figured that life had to be out there someplace. i don't even consider myself to believe in ufo's now either, that's like saying that you believe in trees, nobody believes in trees, they are there. belief is for santa, god, and leprechauns.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional

was north and saw that the object was traveling south. it was a bright yellow, red, flashing pulsating object with organize structure to it within the pulsation and flashing in itself. i cant pin down the description of the structure but there was something that was structure within the flashing and pulsation. \r\n        the flying object was in a sense floating smoothly in the sky but traveling at a high speed in the sense of the altitude that it was in (approx 500 feet to a mile). any aircraft would have been recognizable and heard at this type of altitude and a falling  rock from space would have travel in one direction and left a trail of smoke behind its path. the flying object made a left and right turn within seconds apart, the pulsating  became brighter as it flew north in our direction then the pulsating and brightness diminish to a small star type of light and immediately at a high speed ascended in a 90 degree angle higher up into the sky and disappeared. within approx 6 min later a airplane and helicopter appeared in the area. theres a airport 6 mile west from were the sighting took place. \r\n       during the sighting i felt excited and surprise, i couldn't believe

spakrly lights. they were moving so no stars and were moving way to fast to be planes.  but we stopped and got out to watch and could here this noise not like a jet but louder and it was moving fast and would get quite thats when we would see the orange lights. heard it twice and never heard a sound in the sky like it before. ive always been a skeptic but im a believer now after witnessing this.

thing about this craft is it started to descend towards a part of town that doesn't even have an airport! i was in complete shock and i didn't know what to think of this. my only problem is that i was so shocked, and it happened so fast, that i didn't have the chance to take any pictures or video. i just want to know if anybody else from my area seen the same thing.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

bright star in the sky. i figured at first it was the planet venus, as venus passes through where this object was.  but, i noticed that venus was about 30 deg west of this object. then i noticed the object was moving towards me.  the object was coming in from the nw, heading south towards where we live, which is about 15 miles se of temecula, ca.  it was moving slowly, but steadily.  there was no sound from it at all.  even the commercial jets that fly over us at a good 10k ft, still make sound.  this object was even lower than any of the planes fly over here.  it had no blinking lights, or colors besides white.  it was slightly larger than venus, and was definitely as bright as venus, if not more.  where we live is rural, so we have little light pollution.  part of the reason is because the palomar observatory is above us, we are in the foothills of the palomar mtns.  \r\n\r\nthis was at about 9:28-9:30 pm, and the object took about a good 5 minutes to move towards me.  i wanted to get my camera, but was afraid it would disappear.  so i waited until the object was directly above my house.  then i ran inside, grabbed my camera, and was gone a minute or less.  however, the object was already to the far southern sky, and then it just disappeared.  the object had to have accelerated. it should have just been going over the other side of my house, due to the speed it was going at, but instead was now a good 40-50 miles away.\r\n\r\nalso, to note...We have many different types of planes that fly over our house.  there are many military bases around here, and they fly helicopters, planes, and jets.  plus, commercial aircraft fly over our homes.  planes can definitely be made out as planes, with flashing red & blue lights.  provided we have a clear night, which is most nights, you can even make out the detail of the planes.  i couldn't make out any detail of this object.  it looked like a flying venus, but a bit bigger.  \r\n\r\nthis is also not the first ufo sighting i have had at this location.  i have had at least 3 sightings now in a little over a year.  there are also many other questionable objects i've seen, but none of them were as distinct as these 3.  also, when this object was flying towards me, and then overhead of me, i got this sensation.  perhaps like a magnetic sensation, hairs standing on end, like you would feel when a storm is coming.  it's like you could feel the electricity in the air, and it was coming from this object.  \r\n\r\nmufon should do an investigation of this area, as i believe it is a vortex.  i was told before i moved here, that the area was known for ufo sightings, there is a high military presence, and the area gives off a higher than normal electromagnetic reading.
