sunlight through the clouds (redish). she went to the front door next to where my chair is located and went out side. i asked if she could see it and she said she did. i lost sight of the object as it passed above my sun shutters above that window, so i also went to the door to see it. as i aproached the door i noted my wife was standing almost in the door on the porch, but under the overhanging area above the porch. she was watching the object now moving towards the wsw towards the horizon. it had changed direction (she did not see it change, nor did i)between the time she got to the door and the time it had moved above the sun shutters.\r\n\r\nexcept for the time when it was above the roof of my room, i had a direct view of the object for about 3-4 minutes at the most. it was quiet outside that night (i'm in the desert) and there was no noise from the object.\r\n\r\ni inquired of several other residents of the resort to see if anyone else had observed the light. one person unknown to me mentioned a light moving to the west to a friend of mine who was in going into the hot tubs. this man was already in the hot tubs and from that position would have an unobstructed view of about 180 degrees. his description of the object to my friend was a bright orange/red light moving to the west very fast, but without the usual tail made by a meteor.\r\n\r\nthe object:  size: venus was in the western sky at about two slats up on the sun shade (i could see it through the slats) and the object was at least four to five times the diameter of venus.\r\n\r\ni can send pictures of the inside looking out, the tubs, etc. if you want. these would just be to set the descriptions, not views of the object. i should have had my wife bring the camera, but the object was not there that long.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

very bright, very distinct reddish orange lights in a, roughly, round formation.  i looked twice to make sure that it wasn't a reflection from lights inside the house.  from the brief look i got through the window it appeared to be hovering, but i cannot be sure of this as i only looked for a few seconds.  though if it was moving, it was, at this point, moving very slowly.  from the look i got through the window, i'd approximate that it was less than a few hundred feet away and relatively low in the sky (if i had to guess i'd say maybe 1,000-3,000 feet).  i got up from my chair and went to the backdoor of the house just a few feet away.  by the time i had opened the door it was just a single, extremely bright point of reddish pink light speeding due east and possibly gaining in altitude (though not much).  it was just after 8pm and the sky was almost completely dark.  there was one star visible just to the right of the object that was considerably dimmer.  this did not look like a planet or star, it was far brighter.  at no point did the object(s) make a sound.  i never saw any of the typical white, red or green strobe lights you normally see on standard aircraft.  the lights never pulsated at all, they were constant.  i also never actually saw the shape/outline of a craft, only lights.  the total sighting lasted about 30-40 seconds.  it was really strange, and unlike anything i've ever seen before.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:45","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then
