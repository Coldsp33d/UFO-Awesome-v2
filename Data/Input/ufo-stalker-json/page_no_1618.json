for at least 20 mins. for some moments they were close enough to be counted (by all four of us) to be 12. they followed a very smouth pattern and moved at an almost unchanged formation. people passing by got also interested and at a point there must have been at least 20-25 people stirring at the sky watching the objects. they were not a bunch of mettalic helium baloons got loose, nevertheless one could have mistaken them for such had they not been travelling so fast and being so large. actual size of objects cannot be estimated, but they were clearly viewed to be spherical and mettalic, 12 in

event is not the one i would have prefered to report but this report page does not give much leeway for much else as it is suited for one particular sighting and i wanted to report multiple sightings on almost a daily/nightly basis for the last year or two. my area where i live is a virtual hotbed for ufo sightings, we sit on lawnchairs on our front lawn at night and observe the sky and always they show up, sometimes they sit still and flash a light so bright it blinds us, this i believe is to make sure we notice as before the brightness they appear as a red light, almost looking like a distant star. after this show of light they begin to move in an upward fashion as we can clealy see them heading out of earths atmosphere and entering into space, at this time they begin looking like a satellite crossing the sky. this sort of behaviour is common, we witness it everytime we have an inkling to go out and sky watch the colours we see most are red, blue, green and white brightness, 2 nights ago we saw an orange one following a plane, this morning was the first we have seen in daylight hours which is the one i reported in the form here. most of the sightings are in the eastern sky but, they do appear in all other parts of the sky, we observe with telescope, binoculars, our naked eye and we have captured film footage of one ufo, unfortunately my friend had the camera and took the footage, they are in denial of what they witnessed but told me they will keep the footage for me so i may see it myself, when we viewed it at time of filming it looked good, when they got home with it and watched on thier tv they said it is too blurred and cant tell what it is but, its very bright and is moving. i have witnessed a dimensional door open in thin air above my roof on night, at first it was not there, it was around 10pm and i was only steps away from my front door when a bright light in the sky caught my eye, it was very bright, as quickly as i noticed it dimmed to a bright red light and then proceeded to move slowly vertically across the sky, aproximate hieght i would guess would be 1000 feet up mayb less, as it moved slowly across the redness of the light began to dim. i followed it with my eyes, i was transfixed on it, after roughly 30 to 45 seconds i noticed movement to the left, i looked, it was in view of the ufo, i could see both things in my range of vision, i was not staring at the ufo directly now, this other object that appeared was not moving, it was not an object at all. this is right out of a science fiction novel but i swear its the truth, the sky peeled back, like a blanket being pulled back as you climb into bed, stars disappeared from the night sky where this opening in thin air now appeared, like a door opening, i looked at the ufo, it was getting dimmer and dimmer and then it passed into this black hole left from this phenomena, this hole or doorway in the sky, as it disappeared from sight the sky folded back into place and the stars in that particular area of the sky reappeared. this is my most exotic sighting ever, i am in my 50's and i have been seeing ufo's for 36 years, this is my first report, it's too bad i cannot express myself better here the way i can if i told you personally, having witnessed this i firmly believe these are interdimensional beings and not extraterestrial, i witnessed a dimensional door opening above my house in thin air and this craft passed into it, i can go on and on, i have many stories of sightings but this much is good enough for now. as i said earlier, there are sightings on a nightly basis here and all you have to do is look up and be open about what you are seeing, peace

struck me as very odd. my house faces south, and i was looking southeast when i saw it. i tracked it visually until it was blocked by neighboring houses and trees. it seemed to be heading north. i don't know what it was, it flew like i would have expected a normal aircraft to fly (no crazy speed or turns) but the lights on it were very wrong. was it trying to look like normal aircraft traffic that goes over this area a lot? i have been taking my camera out to smoke with me and actually had it with me at the time, but i couldn't convince myself that i was looking at anything other than a wierd airplane (because of the familiar light pattern). i won't make that mistake again! i have seen multiple odd things in this area, mostly towards hilliard and dublin. everything i see is either heading directly into downtown columbus or heading north north-east towards powell. in the last two months i have seen an orange ball flying west to east directly towards downtown and a silver shiny

branch marina in northwest arkansas.  \"rocketman\" has a friend taking care of the land and the rv, we'll call \"porterhouse\". the weather was nice and with such we will often spend saturday out at the rv, full of fishing, friends, and a good campfire. without much ado, i was looking up at the stars, just kinda staring and noticing how much easier it was to see them now that the city was further away.  looking straight up,i noticed a star slightly brighter than the other three that were around it (i will look up the constellation in a bit).  this \"brighter star\" then went out!  from outside in, it got dark. just as it went out another \"brighter than the other stars\" came on!  it was located about where one would say the the other corner of a triangle would be. to be more descriptive, the nose or front of the triangle was pointed south, the tail to the north.  the eastern corner light went out first, then the western tail light came on. the object was parallel or flat with the ground and these lights were on the bottom of the object. that light came on for about four seconds.  i laughed, and said out loud, \"hahaaa, you guys screwed up, i saw you change your lights.\"  i thought to myself that if it was the military or perhaps some other foreign entity that surely they could hear me and that i should make fun of them. this seemed perfectly rational and humorous to me at the time (not really giving any credence to their actually being anything over my head.)  the object immediately turned off that light and with a very powerful yet powerfully muffled or silenced \"wahooom\", the object shot off to the south... i could see a black jet trail against the black sky, like a darker shadow on top of the dark sky... the trail was only four or five times the length of the object and quickly dissipated.  it reminded me of looking at the sun briefly then closing your eyes and you can still see that burn mark or tracer...Except this was black on black.  anyway, none of this would be known to anyone other than me if...Just a few hours ago, \"rocketman\" and myself just got back from the rv, friday april 27. \"porterhouse\" said, that thursday april 26 at approximately 12:00am, he woke up standing, naked, about 65 feet from the rv in a field, looking up and thinking to himself how did i get down.  there had been no drinking or other intoxication.  he says he feels like it was supposed to be a dream, like he was not supposed to worry about why he woke up there...  i can only say that what i saw, i feel was real.  i did not share what i saw with anyone until after i heard \"porterhouse's\" story.  the three of us jokingly figure it must be military espionage or manchurian candidate type implant because \"porterhouse\" has recently been employed by a senator from another state whom owns rental properties in the area.  \"porterhouse\" says he does not notice anything different but does feel really weird about his memory not working appropriately for that one evening. also, as an aside,he witnessed a bright white hypersonic craft while in the military, out at sea..He refused to sign the report of the incident for fear of losing his career, there were other witnesses to that incident.  this is my first report, and, the first thing i've seen.  what i saw really was right out of the x-files, and i'm gonna be really pissed if \"porterhouse\" ends up pregnant!!!  after we get done laughing of course.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

stop lights ahead some lights well above the horizon that at first glance looked like burst of lights... perhaps fireworks (color of bottle rocket fire).  then noticed looking ahead and above that the lights were more of of \"orb like\" but glowing almost like a candlelight color.  they did not blink, they didn't flash... just glowed.  they were in a slight loosely shaped v-formation as they crossed the highway... but as we moved down highway they seemed to change positions with each other.  i asked my father (in vehicle with me) if they were maybe a large number  (appx 20 or more that spanned across the highway and extended out on each end) of helicopters??  didnt seem to move fast enough for planes... but he's a retired faa  radar technician and said no... not plane or helicopters... he would know this  i'm sure after 35+ years at jan airport.    we were within a few miles of the airport, so i assumed it was some training exercise at first.    as we moved down highway slowly,  a few cars slowed down to look but no one stopped (busy road)  we thought the lights were moving slowly but we rushed to get home and see if they were visible on our farm in the night sky, and they were disappearing so fast we had to pull over on side of road to watch them disappear into the night sky.  they all seemed to \"float\" off but rather quickly.... then one last light trailed behind and then was gone.   visible for about 5 minutes.   if i could describe a reasonable explanation,  they looked like very large glowing balloons that were in some weird purposeful formation  (perhaps like light glow you would see on large hot air balloons) that changed positions with each other as they continued on their path.   but seemed to leave view just too quickly when we pulled over to watch them leave.   too fast for balloons,,, but not supersonic etc... too slow for planes....\r\n\r\ndad said he's never seen anything like it... he's 75, retired navy radar technician

left as if almost in between looking in the direction of johnson city, tn and elizabethon, tn. there was 4 white, hazy lights (approx size--size of each light a grapefruit). the 4 lights as if starting from a center point (disappear for an instant) then geometrically expand out in 4 separate directions without leaving a trail of light or beam of light as if a square of 4 lights in each corner on full expansion (approx full expansion a beach ball) then all 4 lights would go back into center point and disappear for an instant and then repeat the same pattern.\r\nnow i know what a lighthouse light will do and usually there is a start point from the ground with a beam of light projecting and circling. i did not see a source of light as if coming from the ground. the lights described above was well above the tree line and horizon.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
