saw the light it was at around 45 degrees ne and appeared to be moving to the south. i got my sony camcorder from my vehicle, which was parked right behind me in the driveway and began recording at 9:29. i then proceeded to film the object for about five minutes or so. i estimate the object was around three miles, approximately from my location. it appeared to be on a steady course to the south as it moved across the sky and did not appear to be changing altitude as it traveled. at first there appeared to be four lights with one of them blinking but as the object moved to the south it began to display more lights. soon there were six lights,two of which were blinking,the color of the lights were blue, white, and green. soon there appeared to be eight lights with two of them blinking. the object continued on its southerly course. at around 9:32 a red blinking light appeared as the most forward light and a third blinking blue light appeared behind it on what looked to be the center of the craft.At this point it appeared as if there were four blinking lights total with the rear lights blinking at a different interval than the red a blue lights at the front of the object. the object was now at about 100 degrees e and still on a southerly flight path. the number of lights visible were still the same. the craft continued on its course to the south and i lost sight of it behind a bank of trees at around 180 degrees. the whole sighting lasted around five minutes.I had just finished parking my vehicle when i felt compelled to look to the north east, if i had not done so i would not have seen this object nor been able to film it. this is not the first sighting of unidentified objects i have experienced, i had submitted a video clip of a ufo sighting to mufon already from a sighting i had in 2009. i was not excited so much as i was curious about the nature of the object.","distance":"Over One

shaped object moving from east to west at tree top level from my perspective and line of site.  it moved at a slow pace and was very, very bright.  i do not know how far away from me it was but i do know that it was nothing close to me.  i assume it was a mile or more away.   the light was white. there were no flashing lights observed, no sound could be heard and white was the only color of light that the object emitted during the sighting. the object itself was shaped like a star on a christmas tree, not like a star in the sky. the object was well defined with six points and did not appear to rotate or change altitude at any time during the sighting.  the object appeared to be larger than the moon as observed in the night sky.  the object did not seem to be transparent or see-through. the edges of the object were well defined and appeared to have a solid structure. i observed the object for about three minutes before i lost view of it behind some trees (wooded area).\r\n\r\n1.  q:  where were you and what were you doing at the time?  \r\na:  i was in my front yard letting out the dog when i observed the object.  i actually walked out into my front yard and over to the side of the house during the sighting in order to continue viewing it.\r\n\r\n2.  q:  what made you first notice the object?\r\na:  how bright it was.\r\n    \r\n3.  q:  what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\r\na:  it was so bright and beautiful that at first i thought of jesus.  the bright white was very white. it was whiter than any white i have ever seen.  \r\n\r\n4.  q:  describe the object and its actions and motions in detail.\r\na:  star shaped with 6 points.  the entire object was a bright, white light. it moved slowly from east to west in a straight line.  i could observe it through the tree tops.  the trees are about 50 feet from my house.\r\n\r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object.\r\na:  i was in awe.  for lack of better words i was \"star struck\".  it was just so beautiful i had never seen anything like it in my life.  after the sighting i went in and told my husband about it.\r\n\r\n6.  q:  how did you lose sight of the object?\r\na:  it moved behind some trees in the woods behind my house.","distance":"Over One

radio on my sailboat...And through focusing my frequency i asked ufo's, inter-dimensional beings, et's and beings that are here to help the planet come join me on/in my sailboat to help me heal the world.  there is a lot more to this, as \"just believed they were there\" and \"thanked them for their time and for coming.\"  \r\n\r\nafter about two months of calling them through my radio and then \"holding a healing service for the world,\" i was directed to begin photographing the inside of the boat...And to my surprise, there were many beings, orbs, \"things that i cannot explain\" and phenomenon of all kinds showing up in the photos.  after a while, some of these things began to be visible to my naked eye.\r\n\r\nsoon \"i was told\" that the inside of the boat had become too crowded\" and that \"they\" had moved outside.  in short, i believe that i opened up a portal to another or several other dimensions...But that is not the point.  i knew what i was doing and i knew what i expected to happen and it did.\r\n\r\ni asked beings and ufo's and entities and \"things\" from many dimensions to come and help me pray for the world (again don't laugh...As the photos speak for themselves).  \"we\" held a \"service\" for one hour every single day for five months...And every single day many unusual beings and ufo's and entities came and either i assisted them or they assisted me.  soon, \"they\" allowed me to take their pictures.  and within three months...Thousands of beings and \"universes\" of all kinds began showing up in, on, around the boat.\r\n\r\nit will be difficult for me to describe each photo (as i need to do) in this forum.  so, someone from mufon please contact me with an email address to send the photos and the descriptions to.  i will include a few photos...But here is the point:\r\n\r\n\"they\" came to my boat because i asked them to...And they kept coming back because i thanked them for taking time out of their busy schedules and for helping us here on earth.  we are not alone.  we have a lot of help...If we ask and if we are appreciative.  further, these beings are very real as you can clearly see by the shadows they cast.  but more interesting is the fact that our physical reality is a tiny pin prick of the incredible reality that exists in other dimensions...And i have been allowed to pier into those realities.  i guess they showed themselves to me so i can share with the world that \"they are here.\"  \"they are here to help.\"  \"they are very, very real.\"\r\n\r\ni will be happy to share my extensive collection of photos with anyone who requests...And share the rest of the story.  i am putting a website together and will have my photos, experiences and story online soon.\r\n\r\nmost of the photos are self-explanitory.  however, the photo of me up on top of the sailboat mast-you will need to look for the black object just below me and to the right of me in the base of the clouds and bring that object in by blowing up the photo.  my experience with these ufo's is that they are either drones or some different type of life form...A living entity very different than an organic life form we are used to seeing on earth.  anyway...This guy came around a lot.\r\n\r\nas for the black/greyish being that is in the photos...Most of him is sort of in my refridgerator.  i have two photos of him.  he is very real as noted by the shadows cast on the floor and walls.\r\n\r\nas for the rest of the rockets and tiny universes and energy beings and light orbs and ufos (those are the bright lights in the busy photos)-that will take a lot of explaining...Some of the phenomenon i could clearly see with my naked eye and some was/is (i still have the phenomenon around me) when i photographed them.  \r\n\r\nnote: the first photo of the orb inside my boat was the beginning.  if you load this photo on your computer and blow it up and look around, you can find over 25 light entities in just this one photo...And this is just the very beginniing.  subsquent photos have hudreds.  please let me know where to send the rest of the photos.  enjoy.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

stopped the car to observe the object. i rolled down my window, to make sure that it was not a glare from lights or anything else. the object was roughly triangular in shape; i could see some light from the city reflected off of the clouds, and the object appeared as a black triangle. there were four lights: a red light near each corner and a somewhat larger white light in the center. my car was on the cd function, but there appeared to be radio static just before i observed the object. the object drifted to a point slightly to the left and ahead of me, before hovering for a few seconds.

9:30-9:45pm. we live in the vicinity of mccoy park , around 24 highway and pleasant. two triangular objects flying fairly low and no sound were side by side, with reddish lights on each corner...Then appeared to merge into one and glide off toward truman library. another small white light was seen stopping and starting around the same time, very high up, then an orangish light flew over making no sound.\r\n \r\nthis was witnessed by several in the circle drive.The night before, a huge triangular object drifted overhead at treetop level in the same area, no sound appearing to be grayish. this is the second time in a couple of weeks this neighbor witnessed this object. no lights.\r\n \r\nabout a week ago, my son and i saw a neon colored orange orb moving at a high rate of speed around crysler and scott. we pulled over and turned off the car. the object made no sound -flew toward the west and into a cloud and disappeared.\r\n \r\nabout three months ago, i saw the same colored object -only it appeared to just drop straight down out of the sky.As it fell, it slowed down and hovered, looking somewhat like a flame on a gas stove right after it is turned on. then, it narrowed down to smaller orb, neon orange. it hovered briefly, then began to float away to the south. it hovered again, then turned to the west, entered a cloud and faded. it was also soundless, but this one higher up than the last one we saw. i saw it around 10pm, and called my son out to also see it as it drifted to the west.\r\n \r\nplease let me know if there have been other sightings lately! i appreciate it. call me with any further questions.\r\n \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then
