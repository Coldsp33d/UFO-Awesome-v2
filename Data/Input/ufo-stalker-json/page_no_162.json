view the the santa catalina mountains, i noticed two orange orbs slowly moving together in a west/northwest direction right above the santa catalina range (northeast of tucson, az). i would guess the distance between the pair of orbs was somewhere between a quarter of a mile to a mile apart. the two orbs were pulsating very slowly, a pulse wave that slowly shifted from an orange hue to a white hue and back to orange again.  the pulse rate interval was about 1 second.   as i was taking pictures of the event from my apartment balcony,  i noticed that the two orbs that were moving (floating) along the range had suddenly stopped and were now hovering (roughly 3-4 thousand feet) over an area between mt. lemmon and the santa catalina foothills for about 40 seconds.  then the orb on the right side begin to slowly descend (straight down) into the trees along the santa catalina ridge (15 second descent).  the orb on the left side also descended (straight down) at roughly the same speed into the trees along the ridge, but about 10 seconds after the one on the right side had already landed or disappeared into the trees. the orbs landed at different points on the mountain (maybe a mile apart from one another). from my apartment building, i would guess i was about 10-15 miles away from this event, as mt. lemmon is about 15-20 miles northeast of tucosn. about 20 minutes later, a blue pulsating orb appeared on top of the range (near the mt. bigelow radio towers).  it pulsated for about 30 seconds.  it looked a little like a transformer blowing up in the distance, but without the bright flashing quality. about 20 minutes later, i noticed an orange orb reappearing at roughly the same location that the orb on the left side had landed.  i could see the orb moving (way faster than the speed of a car) through the tree lines (to the east) on the mountain for a few seconds. then it was quite. i watched the mountain for another hour after the initial event, but i didn't see the orbs again.  note: this event occurred on a very clear and dry evening, a couple of days into a break from the monsoons (no clouds, rain, and/or lightning in the area).

moved the camera but if i did move the camera during the exposure there would be more streaks, or atleast more movement int he image, but there is not. there is only this one streak. i wish i would have kept the shutter open longer to see how the streak would have evolved. fro some reason when i look at it, at least from what is visible it reminds me the way a sound frequency looks when it

sky was clear when i first sighted  a strange object in the sky to my east. immediately as i saw whatever it was, i knew that i was seeing something special. it looked very far off and a cloudy bluish hue surrounded it while still having clear boundaries, not really edges at first. initially i thought it was some cosmic event like a comet or supernova until i saw it moving. it looked like an angel or angels hand in hand gliding toward me at first. it was a pale white and blue mixed with hints of violet. as it came closer i saw  orange yellow tails being emitted from the bottom of the object and that it was more solid and structured than i thought. it flew right over the top of me. it sounded somewhat like an  airplane but had distinct features that made it look unlike any plane i had ever seen in my life. the object had a rather small square  fuselage accompanied by two or more straight appendages hanging below the center.  the appendages below the center of the object extended down longer than the object was front to back.  it passed nearly directly over my head and as it did so i noticed a pattern of many red lights on the back and underside of the body.  i also noticed the orange projections coming from the bottom of the appendages appearing as gas vapor or some sort of flame. as it passed overhead and continued away from me who it was backlit by the light from the moon and i was able to see more structure. when first seeing it i had initially had suspicions that they were orbs or other objects moving around the main object but couldn't tell for sure. when it went over my head and  started to move away from me i could clearly see  small white orbs moving around and to and from the craft.  i watch the object for as long as i could as a continued away from me

zoomed off in the same direction.  since, i was under a shelter, i moved closer to the edge and looked up, but it was gone!  but, then i saw a black thing, just as high as the clouds, moving in the same direction, but in a different area, and it was \"tumbling\"... i mean, it would flip over, stop, flip over, stop, again and again... that one looked more like a bird being blown away by the winds, but still, birds were born to fly, shouldn't they know better?  come to think of it, it didn't have any wings... it was in the shape of a shoe, that's what it reminded me of... a shiny dress shoe tumbling through the air, but able to right itself... i don't know if the white thing was some sort of meteorological phenomenon, but i'd like to know...\"","distance":"101-500

Genevieve","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On the evening of thursday, august 17th, i had just put my 2 children to bed (a kindergartner & a 4-month-old). i then finished cleaning up from dinner & after sitting to rest for a few minutes, i walked outside with my husband to share a cigarette. we strolled over to the side of my house to lay on my hammock, which i have suspended between 2 ash trees. the air was temperate, approximately mid-70's, pleasant but a bit on the humid side with a few high clouds. we watched the sky as the sun set, and then my husband walked inside to retire as i lay on the hammock, looking up into the sky over my house. i often do this after the kids are asleep, as i enjoy looking at the stars & constellations, and i also get treated to the occasional meteor or falling 'space junk' when i gaze up at the slice of dark sky that is above me when i relax on my hammock. i am lucky to live in a rural area, so the light pollution is greatly lessened, despite the few annoying dusk-to-dawn lights that are scattered around our small lake development. we live in northwestern ste. genevieve county in missouri, about 50 miles south of st. louis. \r\ni watched the stars getting brighter as night fell, when i thought i noticed one of the 'stars' move. i shrugged it off & continued to gaze at the sky, when i saw the 'star' move again! it was darting quickly in a rather erratic way, up & down, then in one direction in a kind of jerky, stop/start way, then loops, then back. no real pattern to the movement best i could tell. i fixed my gaze on this object or light & tried to focus. it seemed to have an vertically elongated spherical shape, with what appeared to be a yellow/red/blue/green 'band' of lights around the center of the object. it was distant, but after watching it for around 10-15 minutes and making 100% sure i wasn't imagining this, i hobbled back over to the house (i am awaiting a hip replacement) to call my husband back out. we walked over to the side of the house & i spotted the bright object again standing right beside my hammock, looking just over the roof of my house & just above the middle of the horizon in the western sky. my husband spotted it right away, except he wasn't looking in the same direction; he was looking at the southwestern horizon & spotted another object that looked & behaved very similarly. i pointed his head in the direction of the object i had spotted & he instantly saw the anomaly. i don't think it could have been a drone based on apparent distance & erratic behavior plus the unusual shape. it was definitely not a helicopter, plane, or other typical flying craft. i see high-altitude jets, we occasionally hear the test pilots flying military craft at high speeds in the vicinity, and the local air evac life rescue have flight paths near me. i can easily recognize those day or night by sight and/or sound. this craft was silent as far as we could tell, and it's fairly quiet out here in the country, but we never heard a sound. since the object was kind of 'star-like', it was hard to see any lights at first, but after approximately 20 minutes of both of us watching the object(s) dart & dip around erratically, i noticed the one in the western horizon suddenly seemed closer & less star-like, more 'craft-like'. it seemed to start zooming in then back out as it darted around but it zoomed in & out sort of slowly as it darted back & forth and all around. i turned to my husband & asked him \"hey, if i can see it, can it see me?\" he paused & said \"probably not\", but i could hear he wasn't totally sure about that. suddenly i felt very uneasy about the whole experience, and advised we gather up & head in. we did so in an unusually rushed way. my husband went in first and i got mildly  upset with him for going in a few feet ahead of me, citing that 'something potentially scary' was out there with me. this is unusual because i spend a lot of time outdoors & unusual phenomena or anomalies don't normally affect me in such a way. i just observe & appreciate if i see something u usual, because i know i'm lucky to see anything that could be classed as such; the universe is a beautiful & strange place and i believe anything is possible. i'm as far from being a skeptic as i am from being a believer in ufo & other phenomena, but i know that we both saw something we had never seen before last night. we have been talking about it all day, so we decided we should submit this report today while it was still fresh.\r\nit seems relevant to mention that i felt uneasy the rest of the evening & night, double-checking all the door and window locks, restless, and looking in on the kids more often. this is very unusual for me as i grew up in this house & i'm totally comfortable here, but last night i was so shaken by what i saw that i found it hard to sleep until daylight. this morning when we took my daughter to school, we both looked up at the exact same spot on the horizon as if to check & make sure the craft was gone, then caught each other looking & laughed. definitely a very unusual sighting for me, as i'm 45 years old & have never seen anything like this before, something i would definitely call a totally unidentified flying object. \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:22:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":86027,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.90993974157614,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08182017-0016","longitude":-90.33882439046077,"occurred":1503005400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1503066808000,"summary":"Saw an erratically moving light/shape in the sky shortly after dark. called husband & he spotted #2.
