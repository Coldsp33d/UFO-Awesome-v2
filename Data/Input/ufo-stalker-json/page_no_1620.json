straight path across the sky east to west (maybe se to nw if so, only slightly). it probably would have been flying over trees, and/or river, and/or over a bridge or power lines so theres no way it was being towed by something from the ground. it was very hard to tell how far away it was, if it was close it made no noise, if it was at a high altitude it was very large (im leaning closer towards close,small, and noiseless, if thats the case id have to guess i was under a kilometer away horizontally). it was a clear night with no clouds, i could see there was a body of some sort because it coverd stars as it passed them. it looked very much like this image i found on the internet (did google image search) [link removed/cms/tg] \r\nbut the lights i saw were dimmer and more red. it

in the first minute or two of the movie during the credits, an apparent ufo flew right over top of the camera and over top of three horse riders. just as the riders turned left to cross railroad tracks the ufo flew over the riders and turned right without appearing to slow down. the object seems to be elongated as it flies overhead, but after it caught my eye i hit the pause button frame by frame until it does a 90 degree turn to the right. at first it appears black obviously because the sun is above. as it turns right it clearly looks like a classic silver disc, but not the plate on plate kind, but the kind taped in abundance in mexico. the sun is apparently behind the camera which is the reason it doesn't appear silver until it turns, and takes sunlight broadside. as it flies overhead you can see a wavy disturbance around the object. i have since researched the making of the movie, and i found out that the movie was done on a tight budget, therefore it was likely that the insignificance of the scene would not warrant a retake. this is no prank, and i hope you have the time to investigate this film and email me as to your conclusions. also, the cinematogrophy is supurb

and pointed out these two objects in the distance. at first glance i realized that these were not fixed wing aircraft; the two objects were following each other too closely and in tandem with each other. so, i whipped out my camera and was able to video both objects, unfortunately i only have a few seconds of far less than ideal video because the objects started performing odd manoeuvres and zipped off before i could get to a different vantage point. plus, i was pushing my son across the street in his carriage and with a chihuahua in tow.\r\n\r\nof what i could see prior to video taping and during the taping was two flattened disc like objects that were very bright, they would move vertically up and down quickly, but with syncronisity to one another. once i tried to stop video taping in order to gain a better perspective, but, both objects moved at an upward angle with a very fast rate of climb, interestingly enough neither object tilted during the high rate of climb. \r\n\r\ni guess my feelings are that we are not alone in this universe, i've been living in groton ct for a few years. and yes we live near an airport, but in no way, shape or form was this a conventional aircraft. we see dozens of planes that fly by our house and this looked nothing like any of them. i believe this is a ufo hotspot and have been taking notice for quite some time now; recently, i've been packing my video camera along for my walks with my son because of all the activity that i noticed. i think that some of the supporting factors for the high activity are related to the fact that the groton nuclear sub base, general dynamics (electric boat), and the military installation (national guard - located next to the groton airport)are all located here. i'm sure it can be said that historically groton ct isn't a ufo \"hot spot\", i can't argue with the facts; however, it is my personal belief that at this present time, it could be, and maybe someone will read this and start observing the skies whenever they are in this town.\r\n\r\non a side note, it would seem that these objects have some sort of curiosity regarding us, and, after a bit of research i found that technology and nuclear weapons seem to invoke a curiosity or affinity on behalf of these ufo's or dare i say: extraterrestrial beings. as i said, i have a video of this instance as well as a few pictures and videos from the last month or so regarding different instances.\r\n\r\nthank you for reading my experience.","distance":"Over One

lights that at first appeared to be airplane lights, blinking in the sky (red and white lights). i just saw those lights for a few seconds, and assumed it was an airplane, although i thought that it was moving slower than an airplane. when i looked up again to take another look, the lights were gone. (i'm still not sure whether this was part of my sighting experience or not; it's possible that this was an airplane.)\r\n\r\na few minutes later i was at home, unloading my groceries. i made a few trips between my car and the house, and closed the house door each time, to keep the mosquitoes out. when i opened the house door to go back out to the car, i was confronted by some lights in the sky, directly in front of me. i felt frozen in place while i stared at it, trying to comprehend what it was. it looked like a disc shaped object, with three lights that covered most of the surface. the object appeared to be black; i saw a black outline at the outer edge of the lights. the object appeared to be really close and low in the sky; the size appeared about 2-4 inches in width (like thumb and first finger held apart at arm's length). the lights were incredibly bright, it's hard for me to describe the vivid quality they had. the light in the center was taller, oblong shaped, and a deep red. this light gave me a really frightened feeling. the  other two lights extended off to the sides: a vivid bright blue on the left, and a white-ish blue on the right. these lights were so brilliant and vivid, but didn't appear to be shining onto the treetops. i only stared at it for less than 10 seconds (i think), while i tried to figure out what it was. it was completely motionless, and made no noise. finally i realized it wasn't an airplane or helicopter, and i had a strong overwhelming feeling that it was watching me (the lights were pointed directly at me). i got extremely scared, said \"oh sh*t\" out loud, and closed and locked the door. i went to get my husband, who was in our room at the other end of the house. i told him i'd seen something, and when he got there i opened the door just to peek outside, but it was gone. my husband went outside to look, and stayed outside for about 5 minutes, but he didn't see anything. he did see an airplane, which is normal since we're in the flight path for the rdu airport. \r\n\r\nthis experience really scared me, because i don't know what it was, but i think that it was watching me and wanted me to see it. that really frightens me; i honestly just don't know what to think. the sky around our house is almost completely obscured by tall trees, except for one spot where there's a break in the trees next to our neighbor's house. this object was in the only spot where i would be able to see it in the sky, from the house. i almost wish that i'd taken a picture of it or watched it longer, but at the time that didn't even occur to me; i was just really frightened and wanted to get away from it as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nnothing unusual has happened since then, although i've had dreams about seeing ufo's (objects and lights in the sky) several times since then. i'm also kind of scared to be outside at night, because i don't want to see something like this ever again. i wasn't sure whether to report this or not; i almost didn't want to, because i just didn't want to write about this or think about it. but i've been looking at the ufo reports on this webpage to see if there were any other sightings near here, and i saw one from last night (24th) in cary that sounded similar, so i figured i'd report this in case anyone else in the raleigh area has seen something like this.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":37741,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.781516,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04252012-0017","longitude":-78.6318745,"occurred":1334376000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North

is a second story porch, having a smoke. i sat down in a chair and just happened to look up at the sky. i was looking at a star, it was a very bright star so my eyes went right to it. but i also noticed right away below it and a little to the right, was what i thought was another star. but this star was a little smaller and it was twinkling. i felt my heart rate pick up speed a little bit, because i noticed that the twinkling i was seeing was actually lights. i pointed this out to my friends and they noticed it also. at this point we established that this was not a star. it appeared to be round, and it looked like the light would start out on one side, like the right side, then go to the middle, then move to the left. this pattern continued thru out this sighting. sometimes the lights would be a bluish- white color, we saw green a few times, and on occasion red. this object slowly and in a zig zag motion moved to the right a few inches. it was now no longer next to the star it was originally under but between two large trees. it was sort of hovering in one spot, but then it would slightly move up a little bit, then come back down. then it would go to the left slightly then back to the right. we watched it do this continuous moving for 30 minutes straight with out taking our eyes off of it. there was one point when we saw it disappear, we aren't sure if it was just behind a cloud, because eventually it did get extremely cloudy, or if it actually went away somewhere. it vanished for about 5 seconds and then it came right back into sight. by this point it has moved a little bit further over to the right. so instead of being between the two trees, its now on the right side of the right tree towards the top. it continued to hover there for several more minutes before it vanished again. the sky got extremely cloudy and we could no longer see the object. we thought at first it was a plane, but ive seen many  plaines in the sky and that was no air plane...\r\n\r\n\r\nthis started at 2 am in the morning and continued for about an hour or so. so technically the date was 4/25. seeing how it was after midnight.

the front deck of the house with two of my friends. the house faces north. i had my back to the house, facing my two friends and they were facing me. my view of the sky is clear with no tree obstructions except the one story houses across the street. i noticed a light in the sky, from my peripheral vision.\r\n it was  at about my 11 o'clock direction. at about 45 degrees off the horizon. i immediately thought it was a meteor. i looked up, it was white, as if it was glowing, it did not pulsate. it was solid looking, oval shaped, and it had no tail. it was traveling south, southwest. \r\nit passed to my 9 o'clock  still at 45 degrees, then it changed direction.\r\nit looked to go in a more downward fall, like it was going toward the ground but since it was high off the ground, i thought it might just be turning in a more west direction.  at this time, its location off the horizon was dropping and it now was heading toward the tree line next to our house, on my left. i wasn't going to say anything to my friends but it did not disappear right away like a typical meteor. i stood up and shouted \r\n\"it's still going!\" as my two friends looked up, the ufo zig zagged many \r\ntimes like /\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ as it was going, from my view, into the tree line, but not crashing into the trees, it was still high in the sky. i could see through the first of three trees that made the tree line.\r\nthen it disappeared behind the thicker trees and the neighbors house. my friends never saw it. it all took place within a matter of three seconds.\r\ni don't claim it to be any aliens from another planet. for all i know, it could have been the latest us air force, top secret, air craft or space craft. i know what i saw and it was cool. it was silent, white in color, oval shaped, it had no tail like the meteors do when burning up in the atmosphere, and it changed direction many times.\r\n\r\n           i have heard of many peoples stories of ufo's all throughout my life and its cool to finally see one of my very own sightings. remember, i don't claim it to be any e.T.'s. i don't know what it was, but i do know it was no light show, it was no bird, no jet, no airplane, no air balloon, no kite, no glider. at this time, it is unknown to my knowledge.    \r\n\r\n

out. i noticed this twinkleing and thought ...That was a bright star.  i came in the house and got my binoculars and realized that it wasn't a star because of the red lights so i figured seeing that we are close to an airport that it must be a plane.  i sat down and just watched it and after 10 minutes it still didn't move. so i looked thru the binoculars again.  the object seemed to be jerking almost like doing little circles?? this object stayed for about 45 minutes. it never went away it just seemed to go farther away up and then just disappeared.My wife did take some pictures which i have included for  you. it was really freaky.  \r\nlike i said this might have been a plane and i wouldn't have even filled this form out but my wife did see something about 5 months ago.  \r\nshe said she was sitting outside late one night and saw these red lights and to her it looked like 2 planes piggy backing and they moved really slow right over our apartment building.  i didn't think anything about it until i realized planes never fly over our building.  like i said we live by the raleigh airport and we see the flight pattern of the planes all day long...The ones that went over our building just never ever happen.\r\nif you want the pics she took this evening, let me know where to send them.  you have much better equipment and i am sure you could probably tell if this is a plane or not.  thanks for your time.\r\n\r\njon  ","distance":"501 Feet - 1
