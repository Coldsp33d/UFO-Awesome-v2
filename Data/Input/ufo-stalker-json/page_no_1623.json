right now! when i went out i saw four red objects floating across the sky very close to venus. they all looked exactly alike, except that the last one was bigger than the others. i watched for several seconds before i ran inside to get our digital camera. it was close, so it could not have been more than 30 seconds before i began filming. by the time i came back out with the camera, one of the objects was already gone. while i watched, another of the objects moved quickly out of my sight, blocked by a tree. i filmed the last two objects. one of the objects disappeared very fast after i started filming, the last object slowed down. i got a good look at it. it looked like it was on fire, almost like a giant flare, or maybe a chinese lantern. it looked like it was glowing from the inside. but, it was very big, very far away, it did not fall, and it did not move at the same speed as the others. they all moved horizontally across the sky, almost floating, except they changed speed. all these thoughts went through my head as i watched. the last object moved much slower than the other three, almost stopping, and it pulsated much brighter than the rest. at it's brightest, it was almost as bright as venus (which is really bright at this time). it passed venus, moving north to south, and grew dimmer and dimmer until it disappeared altogether. after they had all disappeared, i called a friend and finished making dinner. about ten minutes after the first sighting was over, i went back outside and saw another of the objects moving across the same path as the last four. i ran inside, again, to get the camera, but it was gone by the time i got back (less than 20 seconds).  it just disappeared. i have lived near airports and military bases for most of my life. i have seen some very strange things in the sky, all with perfectly plausible explanations, but i have no idea what i saw tonight. it was a very nice day, and we had been outside all day and night. we saw nothing else strange in the sky, only the regular plane traffic. several planes were even in the sky at the same time as the objects. i don't know what they were.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

yard (beach facing eggmont key and the skyway bridge) and notticed a bright light above eggmont  key. i watched it for a while, and noticed a boat fishing near the island, the light house and the green light from the dock as normal. there is also a street light type light on the island too. it was very bright, just above the tree tops and just hovered. it kind of swayed slightly back and forth(left to right) i have seen weird things flying in the sky here at least four times, but this time was different. a beam of light came down, it was faint, bc it was over on eggmont, but it was a clear beam over the island. it lit up the trees below as it moved. i hollered inside to my boyfriend to come see it, and to grab a camera. he couldn't hear me so i ran to the downstairs window where he was. by the time he came out, the beam was gone, but the light was still in the sky. so he stayed on the beach and i ran up to look for a camera and get my sister. she woke up and went down to the beach. i couldnt find my camera but i found my cell phone. we all watched it for a while and it hovered in the same position. i ran upstairs one more time to grab the telescope. when i came back down stairs, my sister and my boyfriend wre screaming and hollering that they had seen the beam while i was upstairs! i was so thrilled i wasn't alone in this, so someone would believe me!  we saw the beam at least two more times after that.  i tried to get pics and they wouldn't come up on my camera clear or bright. i took a video, you can see it faintly over the top left of the screen, over the street light. the flashing light to the right is the light house on eggmont key. i rested my hand on the table to get a steady aim. i eventually went inside around 4 because i was exhausted. my sister and boyfriend went in before me, i was kind of shocked about how casual they were about it. the light was still in the same position. when i woke up the next day, it was gone. that light wasn't there the night before or the night after. i'm here a lot and i've seen things fly over that were strange shaped that made no noise, etc, but this was the only time i've seen it for this long and shine a beam down... crazy!!!","distance":"501 Feet - 1

exact outline since they are very far. \r\nwhat striked me though is that they are very dark, like black. they are moving very fast. and then i realized these could not be the usual, ordinary ones that you see in the skies!\r\nthe objects were in a formation of 1 following the other. until the 1 behind started to move faster and it is curious because it seems that if the 2nd object continues at its speed it might hit the first 1! \r\nso i looked intently to see what will happen, if it will explode or what. and then the 2nd objec's bottom hit the top of the 1st and they went into a another dimension or a plasma was created. momentarily they vanished except for the brilliance of the \"plasma\" and then, after several seconds, they reappeared again with the 2nd object now overtaking the 1st and taking the lead. i followed them with my sight until i could not see them any longer.\r\nthe whole incident probably took not more than 4 minutes.\r\nto me it's like an \"encounter\" bec. this

lehi, utah. we were talking and i just happened to look up and i saw a dull orange object appear in the sky nearly directly over my head, what seemed to be a few hundred feet above me. it slowly flew in a straight line in a westward direction over and across the freeway toward the hills. it was visible long enough for me to acknowledge that it was an odd sight, say something to my friend, and have her look up and see it just before it seemed to vanish in direct line of sight as if it cloaked itself. i thought for only a moment that it might have been a slow moving shooting star, but after thinking about it for a few moments, i came to the conclusion that it couldn't have been one. it had no tail or streak to it. there were no flashing or blinking lights. it simply appeared and slowly flew across the sky right over our heads. i was excited to see it because i've never seen anything like it before. i've seen plenty of shooting stars and it was nothing like the ones i've ever seen. there were obvious airplanes in the distance which fly in and out of salt lake airport all the time. they were even in the background as this orange object flew overhead seemingly much closer then the planes but making no sound whatsoever. i seemed to see depth in the object, but i can't seem to place the exact shape. it was... a sideways oval shape with indents in the front and back. honestly, it looked as if i was watching a video of someone superimposing a smaller object in the sky trying to make it look larger than it really was for some special effect gag... but this was real life.
