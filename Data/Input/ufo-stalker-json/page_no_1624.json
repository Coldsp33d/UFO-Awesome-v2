(did not reset for daylight savings time).\r\n\r\nstepped out on the front porch to catch some fresh air and noticed a large white bright light directly west/slightly south west. first thought was, \"wow, venus is really hugh looking tonight\"! object looked at least 20 times larger than venus, then noticed it was slowly moving south. then realized it was pretty low because it was below the low cloud deck. second thought, \"it's a large aircraft with landing lights on?\". due to the slow speed moving across the sky to my left, it just looked too slow to be a jet. watched the object for a minute or so, until my view was blocked by a tree a hundred yards down the street. at this time, i went inside and retrieved my binoculars and video camera.\r\n\r\nwhen i returned, the object was in a space between two trees. i looked at the object with binoculars and saw the most beautiful object that i have ever seen in my life! the object appeared to be about a mile away and was huge. it was at least twice the size of two 747's, and possibly 10 times larger! the best i can describe it in real time is that it looked like a giant atom. at least, what a picture of an atom looks like. it had a hugh bright white light center that looked like a ball of energy. around the middle, moved rapidly moving red lights that gave the object a saucer appearance. however, no structure could be seen between the \"nucleus and the outer band\" of red lights. even more to the atom appearance, were more random lights flying around the nucleus at 30 degree angles to the more prominate center band of red lights. then, between the \"nucleus and electrons\" was a bluest electrical \"field\". not sure what a \"force field\" would look like, but guess would have looked like one.\r\n\r\nstarted videotaping with my sony camcorder just before the object went behind a second tree. at this time, i jumped in my truck and headed west toward the object. never saw the object again, but proceeded to the area where it was last viewed and found myself at the entergy power plant on houston river road west of westlake.\r\n\r\nwill send freeze frame photos of the object taken with my phone on a tv

southeast to northwest. it proceeded to go behind some low clouds and i lost sight of it. i grabbed the 10x50 binoculars i had just put away and when the craft exited the clouds again i was able to get a good look at it. it had a strange light configuration with three unevenly placed lights on the leading end and two small dim lights located at what i believe was the tip of the wing ( or the two rear points of the triangle shape) no tail light was visable at anytime. located near center mass was a large ruby colered light that did not flash or blink at anytime.\r\n\r\ni was able to get a freind to come out and see the object before it slipped behind the cloud bank and was out of sight. their was absolutely no noise coming from the craft. my freind is former military , and estimated it to be not more than 20,000 feet up. also their was a small prop driven plane passing to the northeast at the time of the sighting. i could hear its engines , but they werent that loud due to the

since it seems to be visiting the area i may see it again and i will take video next time. i just don't know how to explain what this was it was maybe five to ten feet above the power lines and not

the photos?\r\n\r\nthe camera i used to take the photos was a sony cyber-shot with a 12x optical zoom model number: dsc-h2 digital still camera.\r\n\r\n2) what was the camera setting used?\r\n\r\nthe setting was the auto adjustment setting.\r\n\r\n3) did you actually see the object or was it just noticed in the photos?\r\n\r\ni saw the object myself prior to taking the photos. the object was closer and larger before i went inside to grab my camera. the shape had not changed when i returned, however the object had moved slightly and was farther away. i saw the object through my viewfinder and after i downloaded the pictures onto my computer as well. the photos represent the same shape and color of the object i saw with my own eyes.\r\n\r\n4) where was the exact location on the coast where you took the photos?\r\n\r\nthe exact location where the photos were taken is high rock terrace in gloucester, massachusetts. it is right on the water on long beach in gloucester.\r\n\r\n5) were there other people and activities going on in the area at this time?\r\n\r\nthe photo was taken in the summer so there were people on the beach at the time. the beach was not particularly crowded and i was taking the photos on my deck away from the people on the beach. my deck is approximately 4 to 5 stories higher than the ground level of the beach. the object itself was not located over the beach but rather over my home which is on a small peninsula.\r\n\r\n6) in what direction did you see the object?\r\n\r\ni saw the object approach from the right side of my home, the west side, although i did not see it's origin. i saw it as it was approaching my location. it definitely had directionality and control. \r\n\r\n7) in what direction was the object travelling?\r\n\r\nit hovered over my location for a period of time and then headed on an easterly path towards the open ocean. as the object made its way from west to east it appeared to get farther away from the ground, as if it was ascending into the sky.\r\n\r\n8) what is the estimated speed of the object?\r\n\r\nit was slow moving, slower than a small plane, but faster than a balloon or kite floating. it was within my field of vision for approximately 30 minutes. it was very smooth in its trajectory with no wobbling at all.\r\n\r\n9) how far above the horizon  did the object appear t be?\r\n\r\nwhen i first spotted the object it was closer to the ground. it was about as high as a large bird might fly, definitely no higher than a mile off of the ground. as it headed east it continued to get higher on the horizon and smaller as if moving upwards rather than away from me.\r\n\r\n10) what object, i.E...A penny, dime, quarter held at arms length would compare to the size of the object?\r\n\r\ninitially the object was about the size of my thumb nail if my arm was fully extended. as i mentioned the object appeared smaller as it moved away from me. it gradually got smaller and smaller until i could no longer see it. at the time the photos were taken the object had reached the size of the head of a q-tip if extended at arms length.\r\n\r\n11) were you able to visually see this \"morphing?\r\n\r\nyes, i saw the object both with the naked eye and through my viewfinder appear to bend in shape and then return back to its original hollow \"donut\" shape. the object, when close appeared to be more of a hollow hexagon or octagon with clear edges and a hollow interior. the shape, when close, was easier to observe and there were clear walls on each side of the hollow hexagonal or octagonal cylinder.\r\n\r\n12) did the object seem to reflect light?\r\n\r\nthe object was matte black with no lights and no reflective surfaces. i also saw no windows. \r\n\r\n13) were there any other witnesses besides yourself?\r\n\r\nmy mother, who was on the deck at the time, was also there to witness the object.\r\n\r\n14) what were you doing at the time of the sighting?\r\n\r\ni had gone onto the deck to check on my father who was taking a nap when i saw the object hovering off on the west side. i watched it for a while before going inside to grab my camera.\r\n\r\n15) how did you first notice the object?\r\n\r\ni caught it in my field of vision off the side of my home. i didn't draw attention to it, but i did call for my mother to come and witness it.\r\n\r\n16) when and how did you lose sight of the object?\r\n\r\ni watched the object for as long as possible. i was taking pictures as it was slowly ascending into the sky, eventually (not suddenly though) the object became too far away for me to see.\r\n\r\n17) did you notice anything else in the sky like aircraft, birds etc...At the time?\r\n\r\nno, although there was some cloud cover.\r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over
