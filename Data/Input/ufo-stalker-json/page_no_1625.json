and something caught my eye that was extremely bright and it was stationary almost directly above me right under a layer of clouds.\r\nthe object was mostly white giving off even brighter reds, blues and greens on the fringes of the glowing white light the object was giving off all these colors where extremely crisp and very bright.\r\n\r\ni am not sure what the altitude of the cloud deck was but it lower rather than higher and the object was between a dime and an aspirin in size.\r\n\r\ni only had the privilege of seeing this object for a few seconds then it shot straight up so fast that i was amazed. i pondered what i thought i saw and what it could have been and i couldn't come up with anything that i see out at my house on a regular basis. i do live about 5 miles from the pittsburgh international airport and see planes all the time and what i saw was nothing like what i see out here on a regular basis.\r\n\r\ni did call the sighting in just in case there where any other people seeing anything as well and have heard nothing about it.\r\n\r\ni wish i would have had more time to look at what ever it was that i saw. it was very exciting for me and i find myself looking up more now than i ever did.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

a very old and remote road with little to no traffic at that time of night. we were travelling in a southwesternly direction and had just crested the height of land and was beginning the decent into the warren area valley. the road has many sharp twists and turns, i was used to driving the road at night was was travelling at a speed of aprox. 40 mph. my girlfriend had fallen asleep.\r\n\r\nsuddenly, as i rounded a curve, i saw a sharply defined object (diamond shaped with a flat top very similar in shape to a cute diamond such as one that would be used to set into a ring. i was glowing in what i can only describe as a muted greenish orange color.  while illuminating the object itself very clearly the light did not cause any sort of beam or glow, the edges of the object were visible and very sharply delimited. the object did not appear to be moving at all or making any noise. the object dominated the night sky which was cloudless with no moon.  at first i thought the object must be the moon, but the shape and color soon caused me to dismiss that possibility.  the object seemed very large, taking up to one quarter of the night sky that was visible through my windshield.  because the road in very narrow and there is no place to turn off the road safely, i continued to drive, but slowed down considerably to continue observing the object.  i was able to keep the object in view for about 30 - 45 seconds before losing sight of it due to a sharp dip in the road.  when i rounded the next curve, i caught a quick (10 seconds at most) of the top part of the object with trees and part of the mountain visible in front of it.  after that i saw no more of the object, but continued driving slowly, hoping to get a better look at it,\r\n\r\ni was startled by girlfriend asking me \"what are you looking \" from the passenger side of the truck.  i said something like \"oh nothing\" and started to pick up speed a bit.  then my girlfriend said \" are you looking for the ufo?\". \"did you see it too?\" i said, surprised that she had been awake and had seen what i say.  i had her describe what she saw and it coincided with what i have described here. i should mention here that my girlfriend was very much a skeptic on the topic of ufos and for her to confirm what we saw is significant evidence of the veracity of the event.\r\n\r\ni had been keenly interested in ufo earlier in my life, but at this time had not been actively interested for close to a decade. i had pretty much filed ufos under \"well, i just don't know what the heck is going on.\" and had let it rest at that.\r\n\r\nat any rate, i dropped my girlfriend off and drove back to north woodstock over the same road we had seen the ufo on and did not see anything on the way home.  my interest in the ufo phenomena has been rekindled in the last couple of years and i wanted to get an account of what we saw that last fall night. over 20 years ago.\r\nthanks for reading

through trees directly behind me.  my first reaction was that it was a planet (though it did not have the characteristic \"twinkle\")  observed object remaining static for around 2 minutes through trees, then repositioned myself in back yard to see object unobstructed.  object remained still for several more minutes, then began to track east, very slowly at constant altitude.  object again appeared to stop, then track the opposite direction (west).  this occurred within the span of roughly 5 minutes.  intensity, shape, and color of object appeared to remain constant throughout.  at this point, i got in my car to reposition myself once again, following it toward the auburn auction park from leo area.  at this point, i could see the object clearly, and it appeared to be moving away from me in a west heading.  i continued to follow the object through laotto on highway 205, at this point, it appeared to be north and west of my position on the highway.  i maintained intermittent view of the object when trees did not obstruct.  i lost sight of the object about 5 miles before reaching churubusco.  last sighting was at approximately 12:30am, somewhere on 205 between laotto and churubusco.\r\n\r\nduring road pursuit, flight path of object was difficult to judge, but the object was remarkably brighter, lower, and more \"yellow/orange\" than other aircraft i had observed in the sky.\r\n\r\nwhat struck me about the object was the intensity of the light.  it did not flicker, pulse, or display any other observable color than white/yellow/orange.  i've lived under airports and been near aircraft landing patterns all my life and have never observed anything like this.

best description of the sighting.\r\n\r\n      i was outside having a smoke before going to bed when something caught my peripheral vision, at first it looked like a huge bird gliding but it was a craft that looked somewhat triangular,  best i could tell.  it made absolutely no audible sound, nothing, dead quiet.  i would guess it was anywhere from 300 ft -500 ft high, was flying very low and fairly slow.  it looked as though it was gliding or floating effortlessly.     a couple of things that really threw me were, the two lights, one on each wing tip, looked as though you were shining a light thru a dense fog or haze, there wasn't a cloud in the sky, the lights did not look vivid or stark in contrast like you would normally see on a aircraft, these had a sort of cloudy glow to them.   misty looking is a good description and possibly why the craft itself looked cloaked or almost transparent to me, although, i could vaguely make out a triangle shape it was not necessarily definitive as such, it also made it hard to judge altitude and size of the craft.   my best guess as to the size of the craft would be roughly  40ft -80ft in width and it seemed wider than it was in length.  the sighting only lasted maybe 10 seconds, my back was to the craft and i didn't see it approaching.  i did not see it until it was right above me.  it disappeared very quickly and not by speed, almost as though someone turned out the lights.  i was not able to visually track it like you can a normal aircraft on a crystal clear night.  it took me a few minutes to process what i saw, \r\n\r\n      my gut feeling is that this is military and not a alien craft,  whatever the technology was that i saw, it has definitely not been made public.     tinker af base is fairly close and the flight path was similar to other craft i have seen in the past.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line
