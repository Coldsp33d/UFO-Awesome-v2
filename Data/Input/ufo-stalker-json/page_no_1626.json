think anything when i noticed the first one.  just instantly thought how odd to see an f15 fighter jet fly over so low and no noise. then i was thinking how neat to see that but then i questioned myself...Was that a military plane? next thing i knew i saw a second one flying along the same path roughly 30 seconds later. they didnt fly very fast just a steady paced glide almost. i tried to listen for the noise and couldnt hear anything other than the cars going by along the street. f15s make loud noise & dont fly that low.  if i didnt know better they could've been low enough to fly under the bridges or just overtop.  then to my surprise i saw a third and then my eyes were glued to the sky to see if there would be another.  no more appeared. i'm a skeptic but i sure will say this really intrigued me to investigate if any planes were in the area etc. i could find nothing & found nothing of any other people reporting to see them. i was excited & yet shook up about the whole

2007.\r\n\r\ni lived in fayetteville, nc from 2004-2006.  shortly after moving to the area i began having night time encounters with beings.  i first noticed bright lights in the bedroom windows, then found myself unable to move or speak.  i saw several beings around the bed. they did not speak or move, but seemed to be projecting images into my mind.  they flashed colors and images that varied from the humorous to terrifying images of war.  as suddenly as they appeared they were gone and i was able to move again.  this happened several times, even after we changed residences.  we moved from fayetteville to crestview in 2006, and there have been no incidents that i remember specifically since.  \r\n\r\nthe entities were similar to the \"typical\" alien, with a grey sin with an almost metallic sheen and large black eyes that didnt blink.  they were smaller than an adult human and appeared to hover around the bed.  \r\n\r\nafter these encounters, i began to have debilitating anxiety and personality issues as well as some physical issues that may or may not be related to the encounters.\r\n\r\ni have always attributed these events to the phenomenon of sleep paralysis, and kind of laughed them off.  i wanted to share this information just in case it could be helpful.  it may well have been a physcological or physical issue, but the memories of these events are so vivid that i really don't know if it is real or not.\r\n\r\ni briefly discussed this incident with a mufon investigator while describing a group of objects that i saw, and again at that time, i blamed it on sleep paralysis. \r\n\r\ni discussed these events with my family and it kind of became a running joke, but in the back of my mind, i have always had a feeling that something sinister had been taking

towards due west. i say sphere-like because it did not appear to have any defined boundaries, and was the whiteness of the whitest portion of the clouds, yet it held sphere like shape. the blue sky was very clear between clouds so we saw it very clearly for a short period of time. it did not \"shine\" as in reflective. it was simply cloud white.\r\nwe first spotted it at about 45 degrees above

luis resevoir i saw a bright light above the hills on the west end of the lake.  my first thought was that it was a reflection of the sun behind me off a low flying silver airplane.  the light was not moving so i thought it might be a reflection off the tip of a radio tower.  i was not aware of a radio tower in the area so over the next couple of miles i looked hard to see if i could spot on underneath the light.  as i drovealong the north side of the lake and over pacheco pass for the next five minutes or so, i lost visual contact with the light.  as i descended the pass, i noticed a white car parked along the road and a man standing next to it with binoculars.  around the next curve i saw 4 cars pulled over, with people out of the cars looking upward to the south.  i thought they had spotted a california condor or some other rare bird.  around the next corner were 6 cars pulled over.  i had to know what they were looking at.  i pulled over and looked up.  there was a large metallic rectangle perched in the sky.\r\n\r\ni got out of my truck and immediately began talking to the man & woman from the next car.  over the next 15 minutes we talked about everything we saw, so i know we all saw the same thing and had the same questions.\r\n\r\ni saw a large rectangle floating in the sky at roughly 60 degrees up from the horizon.  i extimate that the rectangle was half a mile or less from us, 80 feet high and 50 feet wide.  the side facing us was silver metallic\r\nin color.  it was highly reflective, like mylar.  it was silvery except when it reflected the sun at us.  the bursts of reflection were sporadic as though there was equipment or a texture of some sort on the surface.\r\n\r\nthe object was stationary and silent.  we looked for wings and balloons, and listened for motors.  we saw no means of propulsion or levitation with which we were familiar.  after a few minutes, perhaps 5, the object began to rotate.  as it rotated 90 degrees, we saw that the side was very narrow and black.  it rotated a little more and we saw that the back was also black in color.  the narrow side showed us that the overall shape of the object was similar to a mattress or paperback book.  the corners and edges were crisp like a book rather than rounded like a mattress.  given my estimate of a 50x80 foot object, i estimate that the thickness was about 5 feet.\r\n\r\nonce the object rotated we observed that it was moving slowly toward the southwest.  the winds were blowing gently in that direction, so it is possible that the object was drifting with the wind.  we continued to look, almost compulsively, for evidence of a helium-filled balloon.  the object did not appear to change its elevation.\r\n\r\nafter 10 minutes the object had moved far enough away from us that it was a small black speck with one small bright reflective spot.  at this point the man and his wife left.  i watched the object 5 minutes more, until 8:00am, and then left.  its appearance did not change again.\r\n\r\nthe object could have been a giant book shaped balloon filled with helium made of silver and black mylar.  the hurdles to this possibility are: 1) a very odd shape and orientation for a balloon, 2) object did not appear to flex or otherwise react to the wind, 3) there is no apparent source of a 20,000cf balloon that would only have risen to 400-800 yards near san luis reservoir (closest towns are 20 miles east and 20 miles west) 4) object rotated 90 degrees then stopped rather than continuing its rotation from angular momentum, 5) the edges appeared crisp like metal rather than puffy like a mylar balloon.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
