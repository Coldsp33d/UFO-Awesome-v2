States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was approximately 1340 est in afternoon on sunday april 15th.  i was at an open field flying a kite with my daughter.  the weather conditions were partly cloudy and breezy.  i was less than 100 yards from rt161 (4 lane highway) south of the highway.  the sun was shining on my back if i was looking north at the highway. the wind, since i was flying a kite, was usually blowing from the sw to ssw, which put my kite usually between where i was standing and the highway. there are two high power transmission lines with towers approx 200 ft high running parallel to each other separated by approx 350 ft.  as i was flying the kite the wind lulled for a second and the kite fell to the ground.  i walked to retrieve the kite and began to wind back up the string.  as i was doing that i looked up in the sky.  and that's when i saw it.  it had already passed over the transmission lines (assuming) to the west of my position and was heading almost due e to ene, almost parallel to rt161 but less than 1/5-1/6 mile north from my position and 161. at first i thought it was a helicopter, but with it being that close i could not see rotors or blades.  with the traffic on the highway all i heard were the vehicles.  as i stared more intently i noticed the object, which appeared to be the shape of a taller hockey puck (the radius was longer than the height {about twice as}) was spinning.  i could definitely make out the spinning (sunglasses helped filter sun light) and it seemed to spin at a constant rate.  the sun, which is still low in the sky and was shining at my back and thus i was between the object and the sun, reflected very brightly on certain sections of the spinning object.  there was a section that was dull then the object would spin some more and hit a highly bright reflexion and spun some more and would be dull again.  the pattern repeated.  judging by the size of the object (about 40ft-50ft in diameter/20 ft high) my guess there was two highly reflection parts and two dull parts spinning.  revolving on cycle in about 3/4 sec.  since i had the highway traffic as a reference, the object was moving much less than the highway traffic.  possible 25 mph.  the object continued spinning and moving almost due e ne where it passed over the next set of transmission power lines to the east of my position.  compared the the height of the transmission tower, the object was around 10% of the height of the tower over the lines (it was very close about 20-30ft). after that point it traveled beyond my view. the object was in my view for what seemed like a minute (due to shock) but in reality was in my view for around 30 sec.  it took me 10 sec just to grasp i wasn't watching a helicopter.  it was in almost entirely in my field of view (if 0 deg is my left arm out to my side and 180 deg is my rt arm out ... saw it at 30 deg and lost sight at 150 deg); and there were no trees or obstructions in my way at all.  i left my house without my camera phone. getting a kid and dog together to leave i forgot to put it in my pocket.  witnesses?  my wife and a friend was 100 ft south of me talking to each other and watching our and their dogs playing (the dogs were south of them so they were looking the complete opposite way).  i should have yelled for my wife, but i was just staring and couldn't get my eyes off of it.  i was studying the object, trying to gain as much info and detail as i can. the highly reflective part shining back at me fascinated me. man i wish i had my phone. man i wish i yelled for my wife.  but i just stared. i probably wouldn't have grabbed my phone anyway.  i was locked on it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the light pollution, i was able to see the blackness of this object. i'd say it could've been a few hundred feet from wingtip to wingtip. it was also flying very low especially for an aircraft and judging by the height i am positive i would've heard a sound. as i watched it fly for about 6 seconds it seemed to just vanish, almost ghost like(about 30 degrees south/west). my best guess it was flying at an altitude of around 300-550 feet. there was no lights visible to blinking and behind the whole wingspan seemed to look distorted almost as heat waves come up off a road on a hot day. never

house where my daughter lives . as we started to walk down the street we noticed a light on a telephone pole . the light would pulsate for a few seconds and then stop only to start pulsating again . as we walked we saw the light move to the cooler on top of a neighbors house and then move to a tree in the next door neighbor's yard . at first we thought the light was coming from a police car on the road but the light we saw was not red and blue . we continued to walk towards my mother's house and we watched the light move from the next door neighbor's yard to another neighbors tree . each time we passed a tree the light went to another tree . as we approached my mom's yard we saw the light near the top of two italian spruce trees that are in my mom's yard . we went into the back yard to see if we could find what was causing the light but we could not see anything that would cause the lights . as we watched though we saw the light move on to some trees that are across a horse pasture from my mom's yard . while we were standing on the porch we realized that there was no sounds coming from anywhere . there are dogs in nearly every yard and the dogs bark anytime people or other dogs walk passed but they were not barking at all . we live on a hiway and there were no sounds coming from there either . i watched until my daughter was in the house and had locked the door and then i started walking home . we couldn't explain why but the light we were seeing made us very uncomfortable . we were getting scared . but, as i walked home i took one more look to the street to see if there was a source for the light there but again i saw nothing that would have caused the light . i looked back at where the light had last been and the light was gone but just then i heard what i can only describe as a whooshing humming sound .The light has just disappeared when i heard the whooshing humming sound . we were so startled by what we had seen that we didn't think to take pictures of it but today my daughter went out to see where the light had been on the spruce trees and there is a hole in the branches of one of the trees and the branches are hanging down as though they had been bent over or broken . i don't know if that was caused by the light or whatever made the light but we never noticed that hole in the tree before .","distance":"21-100

City","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Date:  april 13, 2012\r\ntime: 2030 (approximate)\r\nlocation: bethel church road (between chesapeake city, md and route 896-s)\r\n\r\ndriving home from dinner my family (mother, sister, father) and i drove south over the summit bridge on 896, and exited right toward chesapeake city, via bethel church road.  at open space at the base of the summit bridge, on the south side, a memorial service was being attended by approximately 100-200 people with candles to remember the fatal car crash that had occurred early that morning.  almost immediately after passing the memorial service and turning onto bethel church road, i noticed out my window 7-8 bright white/yellow/orange lights in the sky ahead, in sort of a zig-zag, or w like formation.  they did not appear to be moving.  they were obviously brighter and closer than stars.  they had a bit of a twinkle to their illumination, but were not blinking.  the color was mostly yellowish-white, but a bit more orange at times.  \r\n\r\ni pointed out the lights to my family, and they all saw it.  we all tried to decide what they might be.  our first consideration was:\r\n\r\n1.  many helicopters doing some sort of formation flight training.\r\n\r\nwe ruled this out because they did not appear to be moving, and there was no noise.  i rolled my window down to listen.\r\n\r\n2.  candles attached to balloons, sent up by the people at the nearby memorial service on the highway.\r\n\r\nthis seemed possible, however the lights seemed much brighter than would be possible from a candle in a cup, or lantern attached to a balloon.\r\n\r\n3.  flares attached to balloons, sent up by the people at the memorial service.\r\n\r\nthis seemed less likely.  flares might give the flamelike glow we saw, but to lift a flare, the balloons would need to be very big.  or maybe 10 balloons to lift a flare?  it seemed unlikely that the people at the memorial service would do something like that.  \r\n\r\nadditionally, the lights appeared to be approximately 1 mile west of the highway, were the people are, and not moving in their positions.  it was not especially windy at the time, so it didn't seem likely that a balloon (or many balloons) sent up by people would travel such a distance, and then remain in a formation in the sky at an altitude of roughly 500-1000 feet.\r\n\r\nwe continued on our way home, watching the lights in the sky.  at one point, we actually drove underneath the formation, so that when we looked out the window to the right, we could see the line of lights in the sky above.  this was when we were closest to them.  there was no apparent sound, and no helicopter or plane or anything but the lights were visible.  \r\n\r\nas we turned into our development, the lights were behind us, so we could not see them for 1 minute.  when we pulled into the driveway and got out, only 1 light was visible now.  my father raced into the house to get a pair of binoculars.  while he was gone, the light slowly began to grow more dim.  by the time he got back, it was not very bright, and before he could look through the binocs, the light was gone.  \r\n\r\ni was very excited during this whole time, because i had seen footage from ufo reports, in which a formation of lights is in the sky, sometimes for many minutes, and then disperses, or disappears, or something like this.  this seemed similar.  \r\n\r\ni have sketched a diagram of what we saw when we first noticed the lights from the car.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

oscillate and move erratically at which point i immediately recognized that they were signaling to the other craft to leave the area, and i knew instinctively that these same two were about to disappear and they did. as the two from the south joined the remaining four of the first group of six two more disappeared and the were four left continuing due north two more of the group disappeared and the two remaining continued on course northward until they left from the line of sight.","distance":"Over One

passed under hwy 95 and was attracted by flashes of light moving to the west just in front of me.  at first i thought it was a plane in distress since it looked like it was in a slow spiral.  as it turned i could not see any wings.  as it came closer to my left i could see yellow flashing lights at each end of the object flashing one then the other.  it really looked like a flying boxcar.   i was watching the road and the object and saw it move (like doing a figure 4) in the sky.  it was just under the clouds.  the sun was out and when the object turned i could see flashes of sunlight hitting the sides of this object.  the yellow lights flashed at each end as the object turned (rotated) end to end.  the flashing lights were definitely yellow.  i was in a little traffic and was obstructed by trees losing sight of it as i passed the shell station on my left.  i turned the corner but could not see the object any longer.  hope more reports are received by you.  i feel calm and would like to see it again.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

to my right and i saw a  burning yellow orange object come down about  100 feet or so flaming to be exact i thought for a moment this was a shooting star but quickly dismissed as they are white then within 10 seconds 2 more came down i was in disbelief i ran to my room and grabbed my iphone when i got back or was gone. i tried to reason withy self to what this was and just said wow what was that no sooner then a minute later is when they just started dropping from the sky i thought it was parachutes. but the way these came down were as if they were , but parachute jumpers don't  have flames on there parachutes i was in shock and facetime my sister she seen them to the best of her ability there were about four at that time she hung up and i started to record . i also thought it might have been meteor shower but they don't fall from the sky and hover then dissipate and make a right turn into horizon of gulf.\r\ni also asked any residents in building of they say anything and they said no. i really don't have an explanation for what i these were about 10 or more or so  but i do know what i saw.\r\ni am a type of person to have facts or reason and do not just say oh i saw a ufo i
