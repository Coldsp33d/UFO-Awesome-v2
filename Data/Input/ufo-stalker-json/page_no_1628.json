trying to take pictures as i told my niece that there were a lot of ufos in the sky. as i was watching this object in the eastern sky with my great-niece and her boyfriend, they walked in the house and i stayed to watch all the aircraft in the area. i live near an airport that is about 3 miles away but, i have never seen it like that night since the 70's. as i watched, a star came from the sky in the southeast looping around toward the front of the building which faces west. it must have been a couple hundred feet off the ground. i ran to the other door. this object was barely more than treetop high and moving very slowly over an area maybe as far as two miles away. i shouted to my niece,'do you wanna see a ufo'. she and her boyfriend came to the door and watched as the craft was spinning and hovering over the treetops. they asked me how far away it was and i said i thought maybe a mile. it started to loop around toward our direction as if searching and then headed north slowly. i was filming with my camera and turned the camera lights on to see if it would make a difference,[i really wanted them to see the light and come to investigate]. my niece and her man ran back in the house screaming,'turn that light off'. laughing, i watched as the craft headed north which took my eyes past the location of this object i am talking about today.It was the brightest object in the sky except for the full moon and from february till now is in relatively the same area of sky. i actually did think it was a star or the new planet everybody is talking about until after posting on facebook about it, i went immediately back to look at it and of course it was gone. this was the around end of march and since then i tried to photograph it many times to no avail till last night. previously, i had found a nice spot and as soon as i turned the camera on the image started to to fade out of view but was still sitting there in my vision as if they knew i was filming. this really made me work a little harder to get these images. my cheap camera doesn't do well in the dark so for this to show up at all is exciting. i have had experience with this sort of stuff all my life and have been an abductee repeatedly since i can remember. i am not concerned about publicity or fame from this, i would just like to see more people come forward without shame. i started telling people about this stuff in the 70's and even my family berated me for telling then. i am sure i will get more tuff words, i can handle it. if you want images, i have a few as, my computer keeps destroying itself and i lose all my stuff.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

mountain area. elevation 3500ft. i had just lyed down for bed and heard a low rumble and it started getting louder and louder until i sat up in bed to try and see what was going on outside. i had never heard anything like this in all my life. hundreds of small blueish white beams of light began strobing and flashing all around out side of my house. like a thousand flashes of a camera in only ten seconds. i could seem the beams scan around as if under control. my heart is pounding so hard and i feel like i am going into shock at this point. i couldnt comprehend what was happening. the last several beams came through my window and i had a very close look at them, about 15 inches away from my legs. the beams were 10 inches around with a darker blue core and a brighter blueish white outer. like a beam inside a beam is the best i can describe it. i peer out the window and see this 500ft long craft flying directly over head, only 200-300ft above me and traveling in a north east direction very slowly. looking directly up at the craft i could see a huge square red light a dozen smaller white lights in rows around the outter edge in a triangular shape. i know the craft was flying super low because i could now see the rear of the ship. from the rear i could see large circular red lights pulsating from left to right then right to left and so on. slowly disapeared out of sight. the whole incident only lasted 15 minets but when i checked my clock it was 11:59pm. strangly i went calmly to sleep with out getting out of bed to go and check on my 16 year old cousin who was right outside camping in a tent only 25 feet away. i awoke the next morning with no memory of this sighting and neither did my cousin untill later that evening at the exact same instant we both remembered and became so flustered we couldnt find the words to describe what happened we both just knew and tears came out of our eyes for a second. then words came out and he said he saw the exact same thing and even more than i had seen due to the fact he was out in a tent looking straight at it during all the beam flashes. he told me it looked as if it were searching for me and when it found me the beams stopped. we both drew pictures in seperate rooms and compared them both were almost identical. i still have the drawings. i always wanted to tell my people about this incident but i dont want to

tree came a white orbish thing, but it was so close i could have sworn it had disk-like morphology (it seemed to glow around the edges but was dark in the middle). when the craft was approximately 5-10 degrees west of the star polaris (it was travelling to the north of me, west to east, straight line and no zig-zagging or hovering), the sound stopped altogether - another thing jet engines can't do, at least not if they don't want to fall out of the sky. it got steadily dimmer in approximately a 10 degree arc, until it disappeared from vision altogether, before it passed the tree line.\r\n\r\nain't the first time i've seen weird stuff while ufo-gazing either, but didn't report the other incidents because they were a lot more ambiguous. i do seem to see a lot of weirdly shaped planes which make no sound and hover, as well as helicopters flying with no lights at night, 2 meters above the freaking ground. not bothered to report because as of yet, no completely reliable method to tell holograms from actual human aircraft. i suppose it's worth mentioning i've witnessed and/or accidentally caught on camera at least 7 separate incidences of unidentified objects, and more than one sighting has been unambiguous enough to report to mufon (though i only thought to report the red orb incident).","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

40 minute drive) i observed a set of three lights shaped like a football on its end. the top light and bottom light were about a fourth the size of the middle light and were red and randomly blinking (i believe they were randomly blinking but i was driving and unable to watch the object continuously until i reached home.) the middle white light was longer and vertical. when i was about four miles past morehead i was able to see the sky unobstructed. i noticed it because it appeared huge compared to flying planes in the sky. i had seen on the news that the international space station was visible the night before so at first i thought it must be that. however, i realized the description was just a round white light of the iss and this was not at all round or just white. it was probably 25 times the size of a normal airplane flying in the sky and at first was stationary. as i traveled northwest it appeared in the sw sky and was not visible unless i looked behind me but several times it appeared in front of me. as this could have been because of the twists and turns in the road i find it hard to believe it remained stationary the whole time. us 32 is not extremely curvy therefore, i decided it must have moved west at some points during my drive. the white light did not blink. i was amazed that this was so large and kept appearing in front of me. i was quite mesmerized by it and felt like i was seeing something quite unique and special. i would have stopped to look at it but i was extremely tired from working 12 hours and honestly wondered if my eyes were playing tricks on me. i do not believe my eyes would have seen this from being tired for a full 40 minutes. when i reached home, it appeared to be farther away and maybe higher in the sky. i watched outside for a few minutes and did not see it move. while i was watching i saw a plane(?) or some other object with white and a red light in the configuration of a normal airplane appear to hover beside it. however, when i went to my bedroom about to lie down for the night about 20 minutes later, i noticed it still in the sky in the same area. i decided i wanted to take a picture of it with my cellphone and turned my tv and my light off. when i tried to get it in my viewfinder, it suddenly descended below the tree level. it may have landed somewhere. it went from being above the treetops to almost on the horizon within seconds. i looked for it for about 10-15 minutes and saw the white light through the trees but not enough to see continuously. as i live in a rural area and do not normally see a light at this level, i feel it may have been the light still shining. finally, i could not see the light anymore at all.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

the east side of the street.  it looked as big as a 747!  i watched in amazement as the object continued south-southwest and crossed briarglen drive.  as it went over the houses and trees there it began to descent sort of to the southeast towards the lake, and i lost sight of it.  it was elongated with 5 to 8 amber-colored lights located horizontally along the midline of the
