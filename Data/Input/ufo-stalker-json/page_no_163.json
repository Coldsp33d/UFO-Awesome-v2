big thunderstorm move through a hour or so before so the sky was clear in all directions. as i was waiting on the dog i happened to be looking at the tail of the big dipper and noticed a very bright white light above the handle of the big dipper and noticed it flash. i was kinda taken back for a second and it flashed again this time in different spot not far from where it was at first. as the ufo continued to do this in a irregular pattern i was just stunned by what i saw. no sooner then i had seen this it moved, flashed very brightly, and then it was a huge orange slightly yellow almost like a ball/explosion very bright very pronounced. at this moment i had relized what i had just seen and tears almost came to my eyes in disbelief.I watched it morph back to a white bright light and what happened next was very unnerving. it seemed far away like a star the light faced me even though it seemed far away like when someone shines a flash light towards your direction at night ,and i felt watched as hair stood up on my neck. i called the dog down to the basement stairs and after getting us in the house ran back to the upstairs bedroom in a panic and told my wife what had happened. she could testify to me having tears in my eyes and being panicked asking her to come outside to see it for herself. we looked for about 5-7 minutes and saw nothing. we live near a airport and im very educated on almost every type of aircraft the world over.(son of a navy vet). i'm 34 years old i have always believed in life else where in the stars. ive watched all the shows t.V. and internet vids. i never thought i would ever have this type of experience and tonight was the night that as im typing this a hour later still cannot belive what ive seen with my own eyes. a part of me feels like they were watching me watch them. like the south carolina sighting.Thanks mufon i feel a little better now. i got to tell someone other than my wife who belives me.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

work was being done on the road i normally took. i was driving my car to take the back roads, as i was taking the roundabout near my home address i could see what i thought was an aeroplane from a distance swerving round as though it was circling to land. i then see it slowly descending very near where i was going round a bend. the reason i had a good look at the object was that i thought the front beams were extra bright and also there were lots more lights around it, so thought it was too many lights for an aeroplane. the thing was, it was very slow circling and descending as the airport would be in opposite direction and it was very low in the sky. it was already dark at about 8.20pm, so noticed it easily. as i got round the bend slowly still with the object in my sight, i saw it hovering above some houses on my right side, which is the drive side of my car. i immediately pulled over to the side of the road, not believing what i was seeing. i can't explain what i was seeing but it had lots of lighting on board, what looked like windows at the side, hovering over houses, it must have been about two and half roofs long just sitting there no sound what so ever. people further up the road were in their garden and i was thinking (can't they see this). i was looking at the object for a good few minutes, it was about 200ft away from my car and hovering about 100ft above the houses.The lights were not as bright as they were when it was in motion, mainly red and whiteish lights. i couldn't see any life inside it but it must have been piloted by something.\r\nanyway the people up the road had gone in doors and now i was sitting in my car on my own, looking at this thing. i now started to get very nervous as i felt it was watching me so slowly started to pull away, as i did so the craft went slowly off the opposite way to me. i felt it was watching me as it's weird how it started moving away as i did. \r\ni'm sorry that i can't explain in more details of what i have seen but i do know that it was a ufo.\r\ni don't really care if people don't believe me, i don't know exactly what i saw but it was intelligent and definitely not a plane

vision.  i focused on that area for a few more seconds to see if i saw what i thought i saw and as the plane flew by, in the planes headlights i seen a black shadow move very fast toward the plane and then seen a light glow and flashed off again.  it was much too high to be a street light and no indicator lights like a plane should in this area.  \r\n\r\nthe lights had no specific pattern either

like light in the distance and asked \"is that a tower light\"? my son in law said no.\r\nthe light was tree line high and kept coming towards us on the dock.It stopped over the lake. we could then

\"vortex\" the wind was whirling around us, the grass and the water. it had a ripple waves in the water under it,  and when the fifth ripple came to the dock we heard the sound. it sounded like a sonic boom or lighting striking the ground. it was traveling real slow,but very loud and the air was swirling around us. after it flew directly over us and away, my daughter had been running to check on the infant and she felt as if she had been violated. an intense feeling. i asked if we were still in the present time and we were.\r\nalvin lake is not that big only about 115 acres. \r\nmy

the backyard taking the dog out.  we live on the north shore of lake whatcom in washington state.  it was a beautiful, clear night and the temperature was comfortable enough for a t-shirt.\r\n\r\nthe view of the lake and sky at this time of the evening is always spectacular and i especially enjoy looking at the star field, which suffers from little light pollution. facing south, i noticed to my right at about 30 degree above the horizon and, judging by the angle from my position, due east of the lake, a brightly lit orange strobing object. somewhat larger than a star. my initial assumption was an aircraft. the flightpath from seatac passes over the hills in that direction. i looked for the usual navigation lights, but only saw orange flashes. what was obviously a plane was approaching from farther south, and easily identifiable as such. i concluded that this was something else. the plane was perhaps a few percent larger, in relative terms.\r\n\r\nduring the approximately five minutes i watched it, it strobed about three times per sec. \r\n\r\ni also detected what i initially thought was movement relative to its general, very slow, northward movement. it appeared to jump back and forth a short distance, relative to my position. less than 1% of arc, but at what i concluded was a distance greater than the seatac flightpath, which was a few degrees lower than the object, this would be a significant distance. as it moved, left to right, the apparent size increased, giving the appearance that in the rightmost position it was either closer or larger. it moved back and forth several times: larger on the right and smaller on the left. always strobing. an additional detail is that the movement appeared to leave a trail between the two positions, also orange and distinctly narrower. in the right position, it appeared as two objects: larger on the right, connected by the “trail.” it never changed color, always a light orange with no other colors present. during the time i observed it, it moved slightly north relative to the peak of the hills to the west.\r\n\r\nat the beginning of the preceding paragraph i say “initially thought was movement” because in the rightmost position, there was still a light at the leftmost position.\r\n\r\nthe distance between the positions of the lights would eliminate any convention aircraft explanation. it was too great unless the aircraft was massive in size.\r\n\r\ni went inside to get my wife for verification, but when we returned it was gone, or at least was not exhibiting the previous behavior.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then
