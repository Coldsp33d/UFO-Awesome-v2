i happened to bring my laser pointer along so i directed a beam of light near and around the object while carefully avoiding any direct beam-shot just in case it was an aircraft. immediately the object began to slightly pulse. confident that this was no airplane or helicopter, i hit the object with one quick direct burst. instantly, the thing vanished into thin air as if a light switch was turned off. suddenly, a bright white object appeared over the motel traveling due north at a swift and steady pace. knowing that this was no aircraft either, i hit that object with a quick burst and witnessed a bright flash back at me. once the flash was delivered to me, the object rapidly, yet un-instantaneously disappeared overhead. this was a new confirmation for me which adds to the list that these objects or the beings inside them are: 1:intelligent. 2:attracted to laser projections. 3:communicate with light. 4:appear and disappear through portals. 5:able to maneuver unlike any know human craft. 6:hear, understand and act upon human thought processes 7:able to apply maximum covert maneuverability. i have been witness to unusual events mostly occurring over my home and now at other destinations. there is a fear associated with these events. a fear of the unknown. who are they? what are they doing? what are their intentions? these are honest questions that deserve honest answers. but does anyone really know the answers?

appear.\r\n\r\ni immediately got into my van - as i tried to start my van the side back seat doors opened and closed by themselves before the van was even started.\r\n\r\nthis made me a bit nervous.  drove to my home in rochester, mi about 15-20 minutes from my friends apartment.  \r\n\r\ni kept my eye on the object the whole drive home.\r\n\r\nwhen arriving home my husband and 2 teenage sons (14 & 17) went outside with binoculars.  the kids who have been non-believers in the past and having better eyes observed more detail.  they also saw the object change shape and brightness levels along with the red and green occasional lights appear.  but what they could  also see was  a light tail appearing from the bottom of the object and windows.\r\n\r\nalso present in the night sky was 3 faint red/pink round shapes that did not move.  \r\n\r\nthere were commercial airplanes flying higher then ufos .\r\n\r\nwe observed the objects until 10:45 pm - it was cold and getting late for bed.\r\n\r\ni observed the object off and on from house window until 11:30pm.  thought i heard a helicopter fly by around this time - but could not spot.\r\n\r\nchecked one more time at 12:00 am and sky was completely cloudy.\r\n\r\nwhen getting up at 6:00 am next day, 4/12/12, only saw half moon with a clear sky.\r\n\r\nmy husband reaction was of amazement and feels comfortable. he also has seen the same 3 ufos i saw over the last 2 years.\r\n\r\nthe kids were also amazed but embarrassed as it sound like we are nut cases.\r\n\r\ni am usually the one who first sees ufo\"s, third in 2 years.  so it makes me a bit uncomfortable. i am very intuitive with people.\r\n\r\nthe part about the van doors was eerie - at first i thought someone had hid in my parked van or just jumped in - gave me the

april 11th at 10:15 p.M. eastern time) i went to the store for milk.  as i exited my car i looked up in the sky to observe the familiar sight i'd been observing for the past several weeks on almost a nightly basis.  however, tonight was different and caused me to pause for several minutes in the parking lot.  the closest planet (mars or venus) was now much closer and had changed from a white color to a dirty amber.  it's light that it gave off was \"hectic\" - moving about at a quick pace. jupiter was still where it should be and showed no unusual characteristics.  after observing this i went into the grocery store and obtained what i needed.  during checkout i felt that someone should observe what i had just observed if only to break up their night behind the checkout.  i told the women who i'd become acquainted with through my visits to the grocery store that when time permitted she should step out into the lot and take a look at how bright the one planet was.  she followed me out and as i stepped down from the curb i already had my hand in the air with my finger pointed in the direction of the planet.  but when i looked only distant jupiter was visible.  mars (or venus) was gone.  completely.  for the first time in over a month.  i walked frantically around the parking lot thinking i was standing in the wrong spot.  the grocery clerk lost interest and went back inside the store.  i never was able to re-establish acclimation with the object.\r\n\r\nonce arriving home i jumped out of the suv and ran to the side of my house where i'd observed this planetary alignment for the past few weeks.  again, the object was gone.  \r\n\r\ni'm left with a dilemma:  i feel that what i initially viewed over a month ago when my wife brought the planetary alignment's attention to me was in fact a planet.  and all of the nights since.  but what i viewed tonight i only assumed was the planet due to it's location.  but it was bigger, brighter and of different color than the other nights.\r\n\r\nmy two questions are - what was i observing (both tonight and for the past several weeks) if it wasn't a planet and, if it was a planet that it's appearance somehow changed due to atmospheric conditions then why didn't a planet show in it's place in the sky as it had for four weeks prior?\r\n\r\n   ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":37394,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.47175576178994,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04122012-0001","longitude":-77.95372857713572,"occurred":1334208000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"West Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1334214013000,"summary":"Like a large star -
