looked to the sky and saw a moving light. at first, i thought it was a plane or a helicopter plane, but then i saw it descended and then going up again ina very rare way. it surprised me because it happened very fast. i told both of my cousins and they looked up. my cousin then followed his friend and went home. we moved to another street to observe it better and then we walked toward it until we could see it better. we talked about calling history channel and bringing them down here, still kind of not believing what we were seeing. i had seen a lot of ufo videos and always wanted to see one, but i doubted. all my doubts flew away when we saw  it disappear, then we looked around to relocate it and found it moved about 120 degrees in a very short time. i was not scared but amazed. i asked my cousin if she had a cellphone or a camera to record it or take pictures but she did not. we kept walking and as we moved we could see it better. it looked exactly as a flying saucer. the light illuminated a little the shape of teh top of the object. we headed back home and i think we saw another one or two objects similar to the previous, but fastly disappeared. we got home and told

we still don't know for sure what we see but we for sure have this speech recorded and it is loud and very clear. we have no clue as to if we are really seeing this or not,were hoping its just our imagination because this is very frighting and too close to home we know the video on the ipod isnt perfect but we thought we were just going to document toys being moved by what we thought may have been a spirit in our sons room. the speech is what really has me convinced it is alien in nature i would gladly post the audio of this to anyone that wants to hear it. we are weeks away from having a baby and dont know if they are here for that reason or that they were doing something that has nothing to do with us at all,but my sons story a month prior now seems more believable to us all now,were all 6 sleeping in one bedroom together now and are moving out as soon as we can.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":37382,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.99613451828468,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04112012-0018","longitude":-95.22646884430803,"occurred":1333868400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Iowa","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1334174943000,"summary":"In bedoroom we recorded a small disk hovering and decending near the floor ","tags":["video"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/37382_submitter_file1__mufon.aup"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"51566","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":3,"locationName":"Red Oak, Iowa","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:7289"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Del Rio","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Around 1985, a friend and i were sitting on our bikes in the middle of the neighborhood street. we were facing north. it was night time, so there was no traffic and everyone was in for the night. we both heard a subtle noise like an air leak or a subtle swishing sound. for some reason, we both knew to look up. even though the noise was subtle, we could tell which way it was coming from. we saw a large triangle shape of dim lights about the size of maybe a football field. it was hard to tell the actual size because the object was being hidden by the stars. but it was close enough to to hear it. it was moving north west. it wasnt moving very fast. i remember being able to see right through it and see the stars. it was strange that the triangle shape of lights were visually the same size of the stars in the sky that we were seeing form our altitude. its as if the object had adjusted its light size in order to blend in with the size of the stars that we were seeing.\r\nwe ran inside frightened. we came out about 15 minutes later and never saw it again.\r\nin 1993 or 94, i remember watching the larry king show that he aired from the desert near roswell. he had a bunch of ufo experts on the show. it just so happens that someone called into that show and described the exact thing that i had seen and heard but in a different part of the country about 8 years later. i was shocked.

directly south of my house. i was in my garage, smoking a cigarette looking southward. the garage door was fully open and the garage lights were turned off. prior to the observed object, i had been shining a fairly powerful green laser pointer towards the exact same area that the object was observed. a few seconds after i stopped shining the laser in that direction, a solid red orb suddenly appeared over the tree tops. i was looking in the exact same direction as it appeared so i definitely saw nothing in the sky before it appeared. it did not appear to ascend from the ground, or at least it was not lit up prior to ascending above the tree tops. it remained above the tree tops as a solid red color for approximately ten seconds, then moved laterally about 100 feet, then instantly turned a solid green. it remained still, hovering above the tree tops for only 5-7 seconds in the solid color green, then instantly either very quickly flashed a bright white light on and off or even seemed to spin at a very high rate and then disappeared. it did not leave a vapor trail or any sort of trail as it did not appear to speed away from its hovering location. it simply disappeared as opposed to leaving at a very high velocity. the only thing i can offer to explain the nature of the light sequencing is that it simply turned them on then turned them off. also, at no point did i hear any noises coming from the object.\r\ni was astounded at the very homogeneous nature of the red color it first appeared as. i knew right away that it could not have been an airplane, helicopter, blimp or other type of earthly aircraft that have alternating, flashing red and/or white marker lights. it could not have been some type of firework. i look up in the night sky all the time and i am aware of what i see (high and low flying aircraft, shooting stars, stars, planets, nebulae, the milky way galaxy, constellations, man made satellites in orbit around the earth, etc.). i was not able to identify this object as it did not behave as any of the previous objects would behave when observed. the fact that it was able to hover, stop completely, change colors and then disappear was very curious to me. also, the fact that i seemed to \"induce\" this event by shining my green laser pointer in the exact area that it appeared was somewhat troubling to me. did i \"upset\" the object and did it \"retaliate\" by showing itself to me? i don't know but i am 100% sure of what i saw and i have no explanation for it.","distance":"Over One

the exact date and time could have been clarified through cell phone history. so excuse me for the approx. date and time for it was over a year and a half ago.\r\n\r\nin the early month of december of 2010 around 8:00-9:00pm, two of my friends and i were just finishing up a long day of work on his father's home remodeling. the weather forecast that night was predicting rain for the next morning, so it was important that we made sure to protect the exposed walls, surrounding materials, ect. from any excessive moisture expected from the downpour. so us three were tacking a vinyl construction tarp to the roof eave to prevent water entering through the exposed exterior wall. after we finishing wrapping things up, we all met at the tailgate of the pickup truck to discuss tomorrow's plan. this is when the sighting happened.\r\n\r\nfirst i'd like to state the important description of that evening's night sky. yes rain was predicted for the following morning. however, the sky that night was extremely clear and i don't recall the moon being very prominent either(if the moon was even out that night). the location was just outside of the city which makes the night sky even more detailed as you all know. so that said, thousands of stars and star clusters littered the sky this night with not a rain cloud in sight yet.\r\n\r\nso now back to the three of us discussing tomorrow's plan at the tailgate of the pickup...\r\n\r\nas we all stood there looking at each other(not the sky), a very bright-lit object came into my peripheral vision which grabbed my instant attention. and not just mine, i recall all three of us turning our attention to this bright object at the same time. my other two friends recall the same exact scenario which makes it interesting because it describes the action and detail of how powerful this object really was. it had absolutely no blinking lights and the star bright \"white\" was unwavering(constant).\r\n\r\nit appeared to perhaps, enter our atmosphere at a high rate of speed. it made a quick swooping-like angle of direction as if it were leveling out. the speed and star-like brightness was indescribable to anything man made! after it seemed to level out(if you will), it then seemed to slow down at a rate that was definitely not normal. with much enthusiasm in our voices, we shouted to each other things like, \"what is that?!\" \"is it a plane!\" \"no way a plane can't slow down like that!\" \"a plane doesn't emit light like that!\" \"then what is it?!\" stuff like that. (take into consideration that only about 15 seconds have passed now.) \r\n\r\nso this is when things got really weird, exciting, ect! next we heard what sounded to be like a helicopter or train(both of which have frequent routes close to this home). i said to my friends, \"whatever that is it's not making that sound. that thing is way to high to be making that sound.\" that's when a helicopter appeared from the perimeter lying trees of the property. it flew directly over us at about only 1,500 feet(which was obviously the sound we heard). this gave the three of us our own personal gauge of just how high this object really was. think of the object as the size of an aspirin in your fingers holding it up to the sky with a helicopter flying over you. but far off in the distance of the large helo(i assume this object was easily above the 35,000 to 37,000 feet altitude in which passenger jets fly at). at this moment the object was moving very slow(it never stopped completely). after the helo passed and was gone...The slow moving \"star\" began to accelerate from it's sluggish stall. because of the tall trees i mentioned on the property that were only about 20 feet away from us, the object began to fly in a direction in which the trees were blocking it. \r\n\r\ni instantly began running out of the driveway to keep my eyes on this thing. meanwhile my friend jumped the fence and ran through the group of trees to the highway which was a totally different direction i took. me, running down the driveway in a panic i pulled my phone out of my pocket and just pressed send to call whoever the last person in my call history. it could've been anyone. my family friend answered to me yelling frantically \"look in the sky, look in the sky!!!\" i hung up and as i got to the end of the driveway the object was traveling at such a fast rate compared to that of a passenger jet we see in the sky! it again...Made a swooping-like angle of direction this time upwards as if it were leaving our atmosphere! during the quick change of direction it accelerated so fast that it just disappeared!!! i waited for a while before walking back to the truck hoping to see it again. when i got back to the pickup, all of us three could barely talk in turns...Let alone make sense of what we just saw. after about two hours we were able to take turns and describe the situation and all three of us witnessed the exact same thing. my buddy that ran to the highway said he too saw it fly \"upwards before disappearing.\"\r\n\r\nto this day i know that what i saw in the sky that night is something that no one can explain. i've been put down as if i were a whack job. things have been said to me like \"oh you just saw a satellite.\" no i've seen satellites and as well as the space station! we all know satellites don't move with those variable rates of extreme travel, nor does the space station. i've also been told by a website i won't mention here that what i saw was a phenomenon called \"ball lighting.\" well i know the theory behind ball lighting(now) and that theory for this detailed incident is just absurd!\r\n\r\ni understand that many things are misidentified can be explained. but this here, i am one hundred percent sure that what i saw moved at speeds of which man cannot travel(not yet at least). this wasn't man made! it's important too that i mention that this occurred not too far from a military base. vandenberg air force base to be exact. although i am positive this wasn't military activity. far too advanced to be human. that six percent of truly unidentifiable flying objects...This is definitely in that six percent. my hope now is that someone else in my area recalls seeing this dominant object in the sky that night and shares their story as well. all three of us still to this day know we cannot be the only ones who witnessed this thing in the sky that night.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

star-like \"object\" that appeared to be on the move.  i did a double-take, as stars do not move, and realized that yes, this star was moving.  curious, i followed it with my eyes and watched as it turned left.  aware that this was no longer just some anomaly of the skies, and also aware that the \"star\" was going to pass over my townhome and out of sight, i ran inside to retrieve my camera and flew down the steps from my living room to my front door to confront the \"star\" again.  i began filming but was frustrated that i had to zoom in as much as i did just to get it into view.  long story short, there was no backdrop there to confirm it was even moving, so that's not good, and a car started to creep up on my left side... here in my community there is zero room to maneuver and park cars.  i had to move out of the way, and in doing so became frustrated and just turned the camera off.  i wish i hadn't.  for about 30 more seconds i just watched this \"star\" as it continued to glide into the distance... it was strange how, as i watched it, that i realized if i were someone who had just come outside, this \"star\" would not now appear as anything unusual... i could no longer see a flight path.  anyways, as i watched the \"star\" suddenly disappeared.  it just \"blinked out\".  one second it was there, floating across the sky, the second, it simply ceased to exist.  i am troubled by this.  did anyone else in the san diego area see it?","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional
