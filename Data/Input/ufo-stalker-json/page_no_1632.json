side with him driving.We had just left the cinema in kanawha city where we went to celebrate our wedding anniversary. i saw the object stationary beside the interstate overpass(west bound lane) in front of the charleston, wv, state capitol. one week later, again, i saw the same object stationary over the sand and stone pit beside the dunbar interstate bridge(east bound lane) about the same distance away from the interstate as the other one i saw. they were both sighted by myself only. my husband was too busy driving to get a look at them both times. it was late afternoon each time. the one next to the dunbar interstate bridge was partially surrounded by the fog caused by the snowy weather at that time. but i could still tell it was the same type of craft. the one at the state capitol was totally exposed. they both were about the size of a large bulldozer.The first thing i noticed about them was they were so close to the bridges and so beautiful. shaped exactly like a chrome shaped derby hat with christmas type lights moving gracefully along the brim- back and forth. i couldn't believe the newspapers or tv never had any reports of them. there was plenty of traffic both times. i wanted my husband to stop the car but he refused because of the traffic and weather. the crafts never seemed to move.\r\nto this day , i still hope to see them again. i've never seen or heard of any craft of these descriptions in the news, internet, or paper. i'm very surprised. i was brought up a very religious person and you wonder about stories such as this. but i believe what i saw was real and not man made and was really beautiful.\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100

of aircraft and have seen just about every aircraft in our inventory.  \r\n\r\ni brought my family to west virginia for the easter holiday to spend with some relatives.  on easter day we decided to travel(about 25 minutes or so) to cacapon state park at approximately 1230 hrs.  we drove all the way to the top of the mountain(which the road was constructed in 2007)to the lookout point that views the entire valley and adjacent mountain range.  i started to take photos with my camera phone(about a 3.2mp camera).  i took several photos of my oldest son and of the valley and mtns.  i took out my canon t1i dslr to take photos of the landscape and of the family.  i snapped probably around 20-30 photos.  during our visit to the state park we did not hear or notice anything in the sky.  it was a perfect day, about 65 degrees, partly cloudy.  we were on top of the mtn for approximately an hour.  once we got back to my relatives house we started to view the photos on the phone to show some family members.  i noticed something in the photo that caught my attention, an object in the sky.  i zoomed in and it is the shape of a disc-like object.  i am skeptical to begin with(i immediately thought it could be a predator drone from one of our bases not far away) so i pulled out my canon t1i to see if there were any anomalies in those photos.  not only were there anomalies, there was a similar object in several of the photos.  this object made no sound and stayed in the area for a decent amount of time as you can tell by the cloud cover that varies in several of the photos.  the reason i know it is not a drone or something that we fly is because in one photo it is in a completely vertical position(we dont just hover in the vertical position unless it is an f-22 raptor, which makes a lot of noise).  also, in several of the photos there are twin discs, one large and one small.  identical in different pictures.\r\n\r\ni showed these to several people(air force affiliated) and they believe there is something unexplainable in these photos).  \r\n\r\nthe only reason i have contacted mufon is because this is the only organization i know of that deals with these sightings legitimately.  \r\n\r\ni only know of \"mufon\" from an article i read about regarding a 1978 incident at fort dix/mcguire afb which sparked my interest because of how it is very well documented, and how credible it seems.\r\n\r\ni hope these photos spark your interest and if you would like to contact me please do not hesitate.\r\n\r\ni have three photos, that are very interesting and show different aspects of the craft but due to some family members being in the photos i feel it prudent to not include them.  i will send them via email if requested.  the photos show double objects, one vertical, one horizontal(in same photo).  they also show dimensions.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

with little overcast. having a cigarette on front steps by myself. no street noise of any kind like police or fire trucks. it was very quiet can actually hear cars a couple of blocks away. can hear the train a mile away. heard a jet minutes before sighting. then i couldnt hear a train anymore. i was standing outside kind of struck by the silence of the city. so i started looking for a planet and its position. it was in the south direction on the right lower side of the moon. looked for a few seconds and decided i didnt want to stare it was a little straining to look at from my position. so as i was gonna sit down and fininsh my smoke and think about the silence then something caught my eye...At first i thought i was gonona see a bird. no sound for the first 2 or 3 seconds and then i was adjusting my depth perception thinking it was too far to hear. then it was really high and then i noticed a round yellow orangish light  near the rear of it. i thought what is that. next 4 to 5 seconds i was judging its direction and how it was flying. it was going straight and i know a bird dosent fly that way. so i adjusted my depth perception again. it was going straight and i judged it to be like a 1000 ft in the air and it was huge...3 times the size of a helicopter...So i was concentrating real hard to hear it ... and i couldnt hear anything. so it was like a mile away and for sure over 1000 ft away...My perception started adjusting and then i can see that the moon was like 50 to 60 degrees at the time. so it was flying straight and then it swayed...With me facing directly west and it being directly over the city, i noticed it swayed a little and then straighten back to the path it seemed to be following. i concentrated really hard to see any body movement in case it was a bird. but no birds has light on it...But i still tried to see if there was any body movement, and still nothing. it was a solid object...Like it was floating. and it swayed and then went right back to the path it seemed to be on. the direction it was heading  was south. to me it went right over the airport. so for the next 10 seconds or so i was trying to hear it and look for body movement. nothing...No noise or body movement. while i was observing i was looking at the bottom of the object and it seemed to a triangular shape...The top half was hard to see...But the bottom surface seemed smooth like...And to me it seemed to be reflecting the orange light i was seeeing from the street lights which were orange. this yellow light was in the middle near the rear. no other lights and no body movements. it was moving 3 times as fast as a helicopter...It sped up a little then back to its other speed. i got off the steps and walked toward the street to see it as long as i could before i lost sight of it over the house. and then rushed back to the steps and peered between the houses. it disappeared on the right side of the moon's position. it travelled in a perfect straight path with a one more sway off the path and then back again. but very little sway. the most amazing fact of this was the size, the light near the rear, no noise at all, the speed, and the straightness of its path of travel. as i watched i wondered alot about the reflection it seemed to be giving. like the bottom was not perfectly flat but its surface was and it was smooth. but the bottom seemed to be like wings where the far side was bent down reflecting light toward me and the closer side was a little bent. i can see light at the bottom because of reflection of light but i couldnt make out the top of it...The light was near the rear and in the middle. there was no fire contrail or any sort of contrail. if it hadnt caught the corner of my eye i would not have seen it at all. it was gone like in 10 to 15 seconds. as i watched and after a couple of seconds went by i had a sudden feeling like i would never ever see anything like this again. but its vivid in my memory and i wont forget it. it was so strange to see something like it and my best conclusion is that it was object i could not identify. no noise...I cant believe how quiet it was considering how high and fast it was moving....For me an object that size had to be using a loud engine to stay afloat and move that fast...But i couldnt hear anyhthing.

left.Best guess is noon. watching tv. the light through the window went dim, like a cloud came over. so i got up to look outside there is a little porch with a roof so i went out into the yard and looked up there right in front of me. about 100 ft. away and comming toward me was this round silverish thing. it looked to be about 50 75 ft. in the air i ran back  opened the door and yelled to my wife to come see this. we went into the yard and just stared at it it moved slowly very slowly until it was over head. now, if you take a dinner plate and hold it at half an arms lenth over your head. thats about it i don't know the direction it came from or went because i don't know the comppase dir. for that spot i could go there and find out if your interested but it turned slowly to the right and started to cross the river it was in plain sight my wife said \" it is isn't it?\" i said yea, so? she said. \"well it bothers me\" i didn't care. it was just great to me. there was a tall tree beside the river. i said look! its going to hit the top of that tree! but it didn't that when i noticed it was higher than i thought. it moved so slowly. we got tired and sat on the steps seemed to take hours. i told her to get the camera she did but no film. we had just had a baby. so and besides we were on welfare so no money either i started to go across the river to a store to get film plus, tell somone but was afraid i would miss it, and it would be gone, when i got back. so. i looked around for a neighbor. all were at work! there was nothing i could do at all.We didn't have a phone. so we just watched it. it slowly went across the river and we would back up a step watch it move behind the trees then back up another step. until we were standind up on tippy toes. at that point. i said lets drive across the river and park and watch it come across so we jumped in the car raced across the bridge and never saw it again!!! where the hell did it go? also as we looked for it there were small jet planes comming from every direction high in the sky. i said look at all the jets!! but that wasn't the oddest thing if it was 12 i know it took only about 20 or 25 min. for this to take place when we turned around to go back, we were hit with a flood of cars. going home. we got back home and i noticed it was 530 in the evening it was quitting time!! at the time i guess we thought it took that long. but now i know there is no way it was there 5 hours!! at least i don't see how. and no cars at all came by my house for 5 hours? beats me! any way i haven't seen my ex since 87 but i know where she lives..So i guess thats it.Wish i knew the compass points. but i don't sorry.........Eli","distance":"21-100

business trip in the greenville, sc area. it was near 9:30pm on monday, april 27th of '09. i was alone, traveling along us 25 heading toward i-26 and had crossed the state line not long before this sighting. \r\n\r\ni noticed the craft ahead of me; it caught my attention because of the unusual lights, how low it was and how close it was to the road. as i got closer to it, i became sure that this wasn't any type of standard aircraft i'd ever seen before. it was round/ball-shaped with two red lights on either side, center, and a row of at least 3 rectangular light panels on the bottom half which were strobing slowly in vertical sequence, from the top one down. it was about the size of the cab section of an 18-wheel truck. i estimate it was approximately 50 feet in the air, on the right side and just slightly over the road. it did not move at all, and as far as i could tell, it remained stationary the entire time i had visual contact with it. \r\n\r\ni had the radio playing and did not have the presence of mind to turn it off or down, so i am unaware if the craft made any type of noise. i did briefly consider stopping to try and take a picture, but the only thing i had with me was an older cell phone which previous experience taught me did not take decent pictures at night at all.\r\n\r\ni slowed my vehicle quite a bit as i approached in order to get a better look at it, being both fascinated but understandably a little shaken, too. in my rearview mirror, i previously had noted that another car was coming up behind me. i was driving quite slowly, so with that in mind, i sped up slightly to prevent annoying the other driver and finally drove past the craft, which still never moved from its position.\r\n\r\nonce past it, i looked in my mirror again and was dismayed to see that the car i'd seen behind me was no longer there--i'm not sure if the other driver had seen what i was seeing and pulled off or had exited the road somewhere--but i became immediately aware that i was now totally alone on the road, with no cars whatsoever in sight in either direction. this finished unnerving me and while i no longer saw the craft, i suddenly felt the need to at least be within sight of other cars/people, so i accelerated to appx 70-75 mph and stayed at that speed until i finally caught up to more cars about five minutes later.","distance":"20 Feet or

(living near an international airport and a hospitals with helicopter landing zones, seeing aircraft is not unusual. but this was on a flightpath that didn't conform to typical ones used frequently by commmercial or emergengy medical aviation.)the path it took was strikingly smooth, steady, and, again, did not travel in a speed or manner indicative of conventional aircraft. it's size, altitude, speed were impossible to determine with my limited level of instrumentation (binoculars) at my disposal. i can only analogyze it's appearance to a soft, white led bulb glow, steady in both consistency and brightness. please note: the object crossed my line of sight from nearly horizon to horizon, over a time period of approximately two to four minutes, giving me the vantage point of viewing it from several angles, and with contrast of several visible stars, planets, and conventional aircraft. this object displayed no faa directional, formation, or static or flashing navigation lights, as is nearly always seen on typical aircraft, leading me to theorize it could possibly be the solar albedo reflecting off a man-made satellite, or asteroid. (again, lack of accurate size perspective made it nearly impossible to estimate whether it was an airborne craft, or orbiting object). using a pair of barska 10 x 42 binoculars did little to clarify any mysteries, as i found it difficult to get a precise focus on the object, leaving me uncertain if i could see a solid mass behind the illuminated area, or it was merely an optical or atmospheric anomaly. when i took my gaze off the object to focus in on nearby aircraft, stars, and planets for a control comparison, i was unable to reaquire the object, leaving me perplexed as to if it altered course, dimmed, turned off, or changed the direcion of the light, or simply passed through enough atmosphere so as to be rendered unvisible to me. i heard no sound i could attribute to the object, nor could i detect any exhaust, or any other effects on surrounding space, matter, persons, animals, etc. i was unable to find anyone else that also witnessed it to confirm, support, or add to  my report.
