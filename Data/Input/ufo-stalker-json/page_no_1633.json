camp fire. we had just gotten back to camp after spending the early evening hunting. it was about 10:00pm when there it was again. this time it gave me a better view of what i had seen a few months prior. it was two bright yellow orange light, they looked comparable to two vw beetle head lights in the sky and then one more light poped out and now is hovering in level with the other two. they sat there long enough for me to get to my binoculars and get a better look at what now looks like a yellow disco ball. ok so now i'm sitting there in total state of shock. the best part obout this hole light show in the sky is when all three lights ball up into just one light remainig same shape in size. that was the same size for obout 30 seconds and then it got tiny in size and whent from yellow orange to bright ruby red and then all the sudden it looked like this thing was a pin ball inside a pinball machine in the sky. and just like that it was gone and had me and my invites looking into the crystal clear night sky's of south texas. after that that night my invites and me realized that there are some powers of some sort that defiantly are way more advanced than i we

fireworks, as i am an air force officer who has flown military aircraft and know what a flying object looks like versus disney fireworks.  about 5-10 minutes later, they had all disappeared.  we went

similar sighting really close by on the same night! but anyways, me and a buddy of mine were driving to another friends house last night around 10 pm when i noticed an odd colored flying object. i live 30 miles from whiteman airforce base, soo i see lots of different aircraft flying around all the time. stealths, f-18's, military helicopters, lots of stuff. but this light wasnt moving at all at first, which is what caught my attention. that and i have never seen a usa craft with an amber/burnt orange color light that wasn't flickering. it stayed solid one color the whole time we were viewing it. as we approached our friends house we got out of the car to get a better look at it. by this time it looked like it was heading towards us in a slow moving line. it wasnt bobbing, or making any sudden movements. it wasnt giving off any sound! as it crept closer moving in the same line, me and my buddy pulled out our phones and turned on our strobe light apps. (im not really sure why i didnt pull out the video camera app instead)but as we were flashing our strobe lights at it, it made a 45 degree turn away from us and took off faster than i have ever seen anything move in my life! we watched the orb go from clearly visable and rather large, to smaller than a star until it wasnt visible at all. sighting didnt last long at all, 3-5 mins tops! ive claimed to my friends ive seen some weird things before, but this had to have been the strangest thing ive seen personally. considering going to by an hd camera soo if something like this ever happens again, i can be sure to catch it on video.

up, moved down to the first ones position and then made a quick right turn and followed the first into the same cloud. the 3rd light moved down a bit slower (still very fast) and had a trail of light behind, until it moved into the position of the last light. then it moved into the cloud (quick right) and dissappeared into it. \r\nabout 2 minutes later, the cloud(the only cloud in the sky)

shape in the sky in front of me. it appeared to be hovering on the left side of the freeway.  i stared at it because it looked to be the size of a jumbo airplane when it's arriving at an airport and you see it pass over you. except this was not a plane. i tried to figure out if it was a blimp but it had no logos or lights other than two small flashing lights that i could see.  in my opinion one was red and one was orange. the lights were one on the right and another on the left side, both towards the bottom. the kept thinking the shape almost seemed rectangular. it was like an elongated oblong. i drove very slow when i noticed it and noticed that although the traffic was flowing, the traffic slowed down with me.  i am sure many people questioned themselves also what this could be. i tried to get a good view but it appeared to be over the underpass of the freeways so when i passed the underpass, i pretty much lost view quickly. it all happened so fast, i didn't have time to configure my cell to take pictures or video, while driving and trying to make sense of what i was witnessing. it was too dangerous because of the traffic to fumble with my phone. the day was still light but in process of turning dark.  by the time i passed the underpass, it seemed everyone had their lights turned on. it quickly became dark.  this happened at approximately 7:45pm on 4/06/2012. i just kept thinking that i couldn't wait to get to a computer and see if anyone was able to take pictures or video. i kept wondering if this was a ufo or a government craft i've never seen before. the fact that it was hovering first then very slowly moving towards the city of orange on the other side of the freeway was strange and inconsistent with what a military craft would do. i don't think it was a blimp because i've seen blimps. that's not what this looked like. there was no visible cabin that i could see. it appeared very close, just over the 57 freeway. maybe as close as the top of a tall palm tree. i couldn't wait to share my experience with friends.  the thought that this could be a ufo was exciting. i looked for other testimonies as soon as i was able to. to my surprise i found a few but not as many as i hoped to find. a couple of my friends laughed when i mentioned it on facebook. i took it very seriously. i wouldn't joke about something like this.","distance":"101-500
