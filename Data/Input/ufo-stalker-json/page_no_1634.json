 it reminded me of an old cadillac (dart shaped reference)  it was seamless.  it had sides that angled slightly larger on the bottom than on the flat top.  from the front point it gently and slightly angled away from where i viewed it.  the back side had the same gentle slight angle but inward to an inverted point in the middle.  it was all white, windowless, spotless!  it really looked like a dart (wide and thick).  ufo did not enter my mind.\r\n> \r\n> i watched it for a few minutes trying to figure out what it could be, after a few minutes i told myself i would get up in the morning and see if it was still there.  i then went back to bed.  the next morning i can't remember looking but am pretty sure i did.  i got up had breakfast (there was a gentleman i hadn't seen before and he was dressed all in white, i smiled to myself and thought how funny it was i had seen an all white object and then this gentleman was here in all white, there were subtle imaginations in my mind at this point, very subtle)  and listened to the news where i heard michael jackson had just died.  we went home a couple days later and i forgot all about what i saw.\r\n> \r\n> a few months later i recorded some alien shows and sat in shocked silence as i realized i had seen what could have been an alien spaceship and did not even realize it!  it was an episode where the british government and french government had released their ufo sightings and also the american press release on one of the major news cable stations that convinced me i could actually talk to someone about this.  i told my daughter if we ever go back to michigan i will definitely not stay in a location without a lot of people around!  we were talking about going back and renting a house on a lake.  my daughter wants to go back to mackinac island.  i would also like to hear from anyone who has seen an object like this.\r\n\r\ni stayed at the marriott fairfield inn & suites\r\n> 3701 north country drive, traverse city, mi\r\n> \r\n> if you look on google maps there is an open field in front of it.  i don't see the trash dumpster by the cracker barrell restaurant anymore. it's changed a bit since i stayed there.  i can't remember if it was two or three years ago, my daughter is sixteen now and i made an estimate on her age at the time.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":37172,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.20949,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04072012-0005","longitude":-91.8306034,"occurred":1245826800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arkansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1333789919000,"summary":"I saw a pentagon shaped object from my 3rd floor room.  it was large, i compared it to the restaurant and trash bin even the road.  i just couldn't figure out what it was.  at first i though it was a large canopy but i doubt it.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"49684","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1018,"locationName":"Traverse City, Arkansas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:7716"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Marion","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Last night bed time rolled around and i went to sleep as usual. shortly after that, i got a pressure in between my eyes and up around my sinus area \"while in sleep state,\" i've felt it before and am familiar with it. next, i got the very strong sensation of my head rushing forward like i was the hood ornament on a vehicle going 90 mph down the highway.\r\n\r\nnext, the usual kicked in, rigid arms, legs, neck, and trying as hard as i could to force my eyelids open but only getting a small peek. usually, when i peek at this moment, the room looks distorted versus when i am awake and have my eyes open. this is where it got a little more interesting. i actually felt everything around me \"slow down,\" so to speak, like if you were to slow audio down and it got deeper and slower.\r\n\r\nas the slowing down began, i could hear this voice talking in a deep foreign/alien language and it was not nice. funny thing is, i understood this language in my trance like half awake state and knew it was threatening and not of good intentions. next, i felt myself lifting up out of my bed. people, when i say lifting up, i mean i really felt it. so i started fighting back like i always do, i felt myself leaving my body and could see my room clear as day. the only thing on was my alarm clock which gave off a blue glow.\r\n\r\ni was literally outside of my body and self aware, but ready to protect myself. next, i shouted \"in jesus name amen!\" now, i've said this before in similar attacks, and although i don't totally understand the bible and believe we don't hold all the answers, i do believe in the power of faith and that jesus had the best of intentions for us, was crucified with best of intentions for us, and was divine.\r\n\r\nafter this, things took a strange twist. i made it over to my closet door and shouted at this presence in the same tone \"deep and slow,\" and language it had first approached me with. i was actually speaking its language back to it, basically telling it to leave me alone and that i had courage and was gonna fight it. finally, this sounds strange but i shed my skin like a suit and i was something like pure energy, but still similar to the anatomy of the human body. next, i looked down at my hands and they had things in place to fire light out of my fingers, so i repeatedly fired some kind of energy/light beams up at this presence that i can only say was above my apartment in the sky.\r\n\r\ni was filled with love, goosebumps, a measure of healthy fear, and a sense of not being pushed around but grateful to have made it through whatever this was. i then woke up to a peaceful and totally quiet room, thinking to myself how strange this life can get.\r\n\r\njust writing it sounds crazy, but i give you my human word it's the complete truth.
