2011.  three friends and i were enroute to charlotte, nc, from poinsett bridge near travelers rest, sc. i was driving northeast on sc-ll (cherokee foothills scenic hwy) when i spotted an explosion of lights in the night sky to my right.  i immediately called attention to the display of lights.  robin perry was riding shotgun.  she caught sight of what captured my eye as it transformed into a cigar-shaped (cylindrical) object aglow in a bluish-white hue.  although it appeared to be miles high and away from us, it was the size of a huge jetliner lengthwise but twice as wide.  within moments, this glowing object divided into half.  the two equal size objects ... now glowing white ... descended in opposite directions at forty-five degree angles.  they disappeared below the horizon.  time seemed to stand still as i continued driving down the rural highway at 55 miles per hour.  the two occupants in the backseat, shay sommer and nancy queen, didn't see the ufo but they saw and heard robin and i reacting to our sighting of a ufo. as crazy as it sounds, this display was beautiful to behold ... absolutely mesmerizing.  \r\n\r\nrobin and i were excited by the sighting.  we had gone to poinsett bridge on a paranormal investigation.  we were slightly disappointed we had travelled so far and gathered no evidence of a haunting.  the futherest thing on our minds was sighting a ufo.  nancy and shay were greatly disappointed that they didn't see anything due to their seating positions. although we had cameras with us, no one thought to take pictures.  it probably doesn't matter as the car was in motion and it happened too fast.    \r\n\r\ni continued driving until we merged onto interstate 26.  we stopped at the first restaurant we saw, which was a waffle house.  nancy didn't see anything but shay recalled a bright light.  she thought it was emitted from a billboard.  several days later, she realized there were no lit billboards on the highway. \r\n\r\nnone of us are aware of any missing time as we arrived back in gastonia about 9pm which would be about right.

had just left my house to take my dogs to the dog park down the road at 9:15pm. as i left the drive way i called my dad. the dogs leashes got tangled a couple feet away from the driveway so i stopped to untangle them. the moment i finished untangling them i looked up into the sky and that's when i seen the first orb coming across the sky from the south at 9:21pm. you could tell the orb was solid but it was also semi translucent and very dark compared to the rest of the evening sky. \r\nthere was two very small red/orange lights in the center of the orb. the lights didn't give off any glare or shine in any direction, it was a self contained light right in the center. \r\nas the orb passed right above my dogs and i, it split into two identical orbs; when this happened i lost my phone call to my dad. they were the exact same size as before and as each other, they both had the two small red/orange lights in the center of them. \r\nthey continued into the northeast direction, they traveled faster then any conventional aircraft i have ever seen before. when they were 3/4 the way across the sky they speed off into the horizon and disappeared from sight, there was a flash of white light as the orbs picked up speed and vanished. just as they speed off a plane flew right into there previous pathway from the north. two minutes after they had disappeared a black helicopter flew across the exact same pathway as the orbs from the northeast to the south at approx. the same elevation as the orbs as well. \r\nmy dogs even watched the orbs go across the sky as it happened, they got excited and wanted to chase the orbs when they speed off and vanished from sight. the moment i lost sight of them i called my dad back and told him what happened.\r\nhe was surprised, excited, and wanted to know all about it. my dad has always been a believer that we are not alone in the universe and i have always shared this belief with him.\r\nwhen i had first seen the orb i knew right away what it was, i had no doubts in my mind. i have never actually seen a ufo that looked like this before nor have i heard anyone describe one like this before.\r\ni always observe the skies when i am out and about and i have seen many anomalous activities in the skies over the years, day or night, however it has been years since i have seen a ufo so close to me. \r\nyes, i have seen a ufo close up before; when i was very young i seen a huge ufo stop and hover above me and then take off quickly. however that ufo years ago was much different then this one and made a slight hum sound and encompassed the entire sky it was so close to me.\r\ni got excited when i seen the first orb since it has been years since i had seen a ufo so close up. ever since my first encounter with ufo's i was hooked and i couldn't take my eyes of the skies hoping to catch another glimpse of something unusual. \r\nthe orbs remained in sight for 2 minutes but those 2 minutes seemed like an eternity and i got a very good look at them. the image of them is burned into my memory. i keep replaying the events in my mind and everything is so clear. as i kept walking with my dogs i kept watching the sky closely to see if they would appear again but they did not. if i do see them again i will post again :) \r\ni wish i had a camera to take a video or picture..","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

out on 4/3/2012 around that time first thing i notice when i get out of my house is my dog barking (yorkie mix). now i disregarded the barking as this is what i find to be  a normal behavior of dogs. i crossed the street across and walked up the end of that block but throughout the way my dog continued to bark.I found it unusual that there were no other animals outside. on a normal night you see alot of stray cats that come out or just wild birds. it was eerily quiet. the sky was filled with white clouds with blue backdrop. there was only two more people outside around this time. its a quiet neighborhood with no cars passing by and dimly lit. i wear glasses and so i thought i was seeing flashes of a camera and was trying to find the source. the light was bothering my eyes. i couldnt see anything and i just looked up. as i did i was astonished and could not believe what i was seeing. i saw approx 5+ lights in a constant circular motion hovering above me with the blue background no clouds covering it.  it was small in diameter and would remain in a circular motion and these lights would come together to one large circle then again spread out into these separate individual lights. it was an unusual pattern and i tried to identify what it was. the airports are not that far from our town and because so i knew it wasnt a helicopter, plane or anything that was apparent in our usual normal days. my first instinct gut feeling was to get out of there and run home. the duration looking at the lights was for 3-4 mins. i then picked up my dog and ran home. as i was opening the door in a frantic i looked behind me and it felt as if it had followed me. it literally moved from its stationary spot hovering right above the 3 story residential feder building that i live in. i ran up the stairs and woke up my family to look outside. as they glanced outside 15 mins later the lights had expanded in diameter and covered a much wider area. this time over the white clouds. it remained as such for approx an hour. i felt safer at home but was not going to sleep until i did something about it. so i posted it on my facebook, contacted the media via facebook too. i called 311 to report this phenomenona and they said to contact the media. i was so reluctant to call and so i waited those first 45mins to contact anyone. all three of us mom, sister and myself took turns looking outside. i kept my dog on the couch she slepping but began to shake as if having a nightmare or something. i tried to pick her up and she jerked off frightened. i spoke to her softly and held her close comforting her. she was quiet the whole time. an hour later when i looked outside they were gone. we all checked and they just disappeared. no lights nothing......I couldnt record anything because it wasnt clear enough for my mobile device and camera to pick up. sketch enclosed to show pattern of

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At 11:49pm on march 31, 2012 i was sitting around a fire pit at the arizona grand resort in phoenix, az with my husband, two sons and some other people.  i was enjoying the weather (80-83 degrees f) and completely clear skies while on vacation from oregon.  there was a very slight breeze\r\n\r\ni had pointed out orion's belt to my sons earlier in the evening and was tracking it's progress across the night sky in relation to where the moon was.  as i was visiting with everyone, something caught my eye at the top of my field of vision.  \r\n\r\nwhen i looked up i noticed five (5) very evenly spaced but very dim/muted glowing orbs moving in a modified \"arrow or v\" formation (i think from se to nw, but i'm not entirely positive of the accurate direction).  i noticed them when they were about 1/3rd of the way across my view of the sky, and it only took them about 6-8 seconds to cross the final 2/3rd of my view and then they faded completely away just before they would have disappeared from my view behind the buildings.  but they definitely didn't go behind the buildings, they just faded away. \r\n\r\nwhatever it was, it didn't stand out easily from the sky either.  when i pointed it out to the people i was with it took them 1-2 seconds to see what i was talking about.  i'd say that the other witnesses (my two sons, ages 11 & 13 and another boy who was 12) only saw it for half of the time that i did and my husband missed it entirely. it definitely did not look like a satellite, or shooting star - i have seen both.  \r\n\r\nat first i thought that it might have been canadian geese as it was sort of like the v shaped formation that they fly in, but living in the pacific northwest i see geese all the time and they never stay as consistently close, or in the exact shape of what i saw.  not only that, but it was much too high for me to have seen if it had been birds.  additionally, geese are rarely completely silent and what i saw was 100% without sound.\r\n\r\nthe \"lights\" for lack of a better word, were not crisp and glittery like stars, but more like filtered reflection of light off the bottom of something.  almost like seeing mother of pearl reflect light, or animal eye-shine in the dark. each light was very circular by itself, and was a pale, pale white or light grey.  \r\n\r\nthe formation never changed.  it didn't spread apart or get closer together, nor did it speed up or slow down. the path it took across the sky was a very straight line.  in terms of the formation, think of it as a v/arrow with one light in the lead then two more behind and to each side of the lead.  then there were two more lights on the right edge which were behind and to the side.  it would have been a perfect v, but there were two less lights on the left edge - almost like when military jets fly that missing jet formation to honor pilots that have been shot down...\r\n\r\nshortly after it was witnessed(maybe 5-10 minutes later), a plane crossed the sky in a completely different direction, but it allowed for me to compare its speed with the unidentified object and there was no comparison.  it took the plane at least 30 or more seconds to cover the same distance.  also a bird flew around overhead about 2 minutes after what i saw disappeared, and its flight path was not only very erratic, but only about 25-30 ft. off the ground and clearly visible to be a bird.\r\n\r\nafter it disappeared i noted the exact time on my wrist watch to be 11:49pm.  i went back to my room and drew a diagram of the formation i'd seen and asked my sons if it looked like what they had also seen.  they agreed and said that they didn't need to draw anything different.\r\n\r\nwhen it was happening, i was very puzzled as i just couldn't make sense of what i was seeing.  i wasn't freaked out - more like \"huh...What the heck is that?\"  other than ask the people in my group \"what is that?  guys, what is that?\" i remained fairly calm.  it was pretty exciting to realize that no one else had an explanation or idea of what it might have been - definitely one of the most surreal moments of my life!!\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

wrong place and, sure enough i looked around and found the moon just over my house. it was a slow moving, fairly large and very distant funnel shaped object hovering over the trees. the tip of the vortex or funnel was pointing down and to the left so that the top, or opening looked almost like a morning glory flower in full bloom. i called my partner outside to look at it and she got so creeped out she told me to come back inside. i tried to take a picture but the cloud thing, although visible to the naked eye, was too dark to register on the camera. it reminded me of the norway spiral,

and did pretty much the same thing that it did the first time.  20 mins were about all it was for the whole incident. there is no reporting of it and no aircraft were seen in the area.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional

the correct formation.\r\n\r\nall six of these lights were white, non blinking like stars and were sitting in a some what pyramid formation on the right side of jupiter.\r\n\r\ni looked at them with binoculars and got a much clearer view of them, i think they appeared much to large to be jupiter's moons. as far as i know there is no constalation and as i said they were all white and non blinking

was out of the garage, and started to notice a light that moved in the sky, i noticed right away that it was not an airplane or a helicopter or a balloon or a satellite. the light was very bright and was neither too close nor too far, already knowing that it was something strange called my sister and mother ran to prove to them that believe not. the light at one point began to slow, and even though she followed his path to light was everywhere, so the mystery, and soon after i discuss with my sister and mom saying ... yes it is an object that is not human! ... when suddenly we saw him going behind a cloud, and in less than 5 seconds gone!!!.\r\n by the speed that the object was not human any aircraft could have stopped instantly and disappear. we were shocked, simply disappeared, and the brightness is not see anything else. the brightness was a star as seen in the same size as we see bright venus in those days, was light on all sides. i noted the time so i thought of going on air to ask if something was recorded at the time, but i think they'll end up laughing in my face. i can not stop remembering that moment was beautiful and scary at the same time, because if something off the ground what it was doing here '. i'm from brazil vitoria es. i hope you can understand the way they talked.","distance":"Over One
