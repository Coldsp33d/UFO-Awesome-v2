appearance has been the same, tho in the past it was higher in the sky.  on the 2nd, it was observed much closer.  previous sightings were from a moving car.  on the 2nd, it appeared to be hovering approx. within 1 mile of our home...Near an hillside, and below the tree top levels.  during previous observations, the object did appear to wink out at one place and then wink back into view, at a considerable distance from it's former location.\r\n\r\nduring the time we observed, it appeared to hover, then move up or down.  the lights appeared to spin around the circumfrence of the object.  there was no sequence to the lights, just random.  it would, \"wink\", out and reappear.  also while the lights appeared to, \"rotate\", often all the colours of the lights mentioned above could sometimes be seen all at once.\r\n\r\nit was cloudy and rainy that evening.  sighting lasted approx. 20 minutes.\r\ntowards the end of the sighting, we did try to take a picture of the object with a cell phone camera....Resulting photos were of very poor quality as they were taken thru a bedroom window.\r\n\r\nhave no idea on altitude, except it was well under treetop level.  there are homes on that hillside, but a daylight observation, using roof level on a carport as a guide, shows that there are no homes/buildings in that precise area.\r\n\r\nwhen we attempted to take a 3rd photo of the object, it quickly winked out,\r\nand we have not seen it since.\r\n\r\nour cats and dogs both seemed mildly agitated.\r\n\r\ni had a distinct impression that the object was, \"flat bottomed\", as i felt\r\ni could see a line of demarcation at the bottom.\r\n\r\nthe object appeared to be, \"surrounded\", by the haze of the lights, which i\r\nsuppose could have been caused by rain in the area.\r\n\r\nwe had an earlier sighting of what we believe was likely this same object, but at a much closer distance.  we could observe much more detail on the object in that sighting, which occured along highway 5 near albany, oregon.\r\nthat craft had very oddly shaped, \"windows\", for lack of a better word.\r\nif that observation requires a second report to be made, i will oblige.\r\n\r\nduring the observation, the cloud level was above the tops of the surrounding hills, and the object appeared to be perhaps 100 feet below the tree top level...Perhaps more.\r\n\r\nsorry this is not more organized...I'm still rather puzzled that during all of our observations of this presumed same object, that no one else seemed to be taking notice of it.  most of the observations occured after at least 7:30 p.M., several as late as approx. 11:00 p.M.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

noticed the bright objects darting about in the area of the planets. they were moving up and down, sideways and backwards. the flashing seemed to coinside with flying movements as they would disappear

were some distance from each other.\r\n\r\ni look out often at the stars and it was all clear and bright at the time, no clouds to block the sight as what happens some nights.\r\n\r\ni could not tell how close they were but brightness was similar to that of jupiter and almost as bright as venus.\r\n\r\ni watched them in their spurt like movements for about 2-3 minutes, one had dissapeared, the other was still there when i returned to my living room. checked again 5-10 minutes later, neither one was present but a plane was approching from the s.W. and was also identified by flashing lights, it was too high to hear through closed doors- but moving much slower and going in a straight line towards the n.E. therefore verifying that the 2 objects i saw were definately not airplanes or anything i had ever seen before.\r\n\r\ni have always believed in other life in space as it's vastness keeps expanding with stronger telescopes. i was excited and a little frightened but assumed they were some distance from here and would not be landing. would love to know if anyone else reported seeing the same objects...Thank you.\r\n\r\na. edwards","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

to check the progress of the eclipse, which had just started. out of the right side window of the bay i saw an extremely massive and very fast isososeles triangular craft coming towards me over steele hill from the east. i ran out as fast as i could to the ice covered walkway. at almost over head i locked in on the illuminated areas in the back corners ( see dia.) and then it went behind the pine trees. because of the size and speed i assumed it must be only a few thousand feet. puzzled, i came in and continued watghing tv. at 8:25 i once again checked on the eclipse, which was a little over half, and again a craft came over the hill with the same heading, but a bit to the right. as before i ran out and this time was able to pick on a nose strobe light and maybe, but not sure, one in the interior. just over head before loosing it again in the pines i noticed the the sound, which was that of a multi engine jet, lagged the craft by 2 or 3 body lenths. given this, i figured that it must be at least 20 to 30 thousand feet, making it very very much larger and faster than my earlier estimate. each occurance lasted no more than 5 or 6 seconds. there were no further sightings that night or since. i have often thought about it and it has always bothered me as to just what i had seen that night. i am sure that it must be american man made. i really hope that this somehow leads to answering my questions as to just what i saw that night-- and i am sure of that i saw.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

much vantage to the night sky, but i would say that i saw the lights pass for about 7 seconds until they were overcome by neighboring trees. my wife never did see what i was pointing at. the lights were steady, but pale, and i was not particularly surprised that she didn't see them-- but i was frustrated that she didn't. \r\n\r\nthe pale red lights were silent as they passed overhead. a few minutes later some small planes flew by with all the telltale signs of being planes---red and green lights, strobes, noise.. \r\n\r\ni have no idea as to their distance in the sky, but the two lights

black almond eyes, large eyes and i could see another in my peripheral vision.  the one in the door of my bathroom, it almost seemed like he was in charge... he was still and silent, very small movements... a light sway here and there.  he was intense, but i had the feeling he was friendly.  he didn't scare me, but i felt he was the one that was controlling my not being able to move.  i have the feeling he was the one that made me feel calm and after i panicked and became afraid, i think he is the one that gave me the feeling of euphoria.  he was in the shadows but i remember him clearly.  i was surprised that he was so short, maybe slightly taller than my door-nob i think. as i was laying down, i didn't have to look up to see him clearly.\r\n\r\n i quickly closed my eyes and told myself i was dreaming.  i don't know how long i stayed like that, it felt like only a minute.  it was like i could hear them thinking.  the second one, he moved quickly.  he is the one that frightened me, he is the one that has the sing-song voice. i thought he was singing in my mind,  i don't know what he was looking for but i do know he was going through my stuff... i only remember one thing of what he said, but i don't know what he ment by it, i remember hearing the words or impression of \"bad baby\". and that disturbed me.  last september, i went through a 4 or 5 day period of time... i knew i was pregnant.... i knew it.  when i was laying down and i rolled over, i felt the sharp painful pull of the muscle holding my uterus.... sounds funny, but i only had that when i was pregnant and the weight of the baby made the muscle pull, it started in my pregnancies at about the 5th or 6th week and always got worse the bigger the baby grew.  i also had a heaviness or a fullness in my uterus. i kept talking myself out of it, i finally got around to taking a test and it came up negative, but i could of sworn i was pregnant.  after talking with a friend and putting a few time lines together, i think they impregnated me. my friend said it usually only last 3 - 5 days.  i was happy i wasn't crazy and sad because i don't know if i will ever meet my child, is it my child?  i carried him, so i feel like it's my child, even if it was only for a couple of days.  anyways back to last night. when he said \"bad baby\" it upset me because i thought that maybe something was wrong with my baby. at this point,  i still feel like i cant move.  \r\n\r\ni didn't want to see them so i closed my eyes.  that's when i got the weirdest sensation, i was floating, rotating around above my bed.  i was scared this whole time and yet not scared or maybe just this feeling of calm, this deep, deep sense of calm. as i was floating--- how do i explain this--- you know what the pressure you feel when your lying down, that softness of your bed when your really, really tired and it feels so soft and comforting and solid? that's how i felt all around my body.  this soft wonderful pressure surrounding me and it was nice.  i felt no breeze as i floated but i could feel the sensation of turning.\r\n\r\nthen i was back in my bed, i was more aware again and thinking of \"bad baby\" and then i heard a moan and thought it was one of my girls. i felt an intense protectiveness and became upset. i wanted to protect her but i couldn't move.\r\n i felt an intense fear came over me.  i told them no--- or thought the words, it was like i could hear them with no noise.  i felt panicked, then suddenly i got this rush of euphoria.  i was covered in it. i could feel it everywhere in my body, i tingled with it, i could feel myself smiling, even laughing in my head.  it was wonderful. then it was like the \"heaviness\" that surrounded me left, but i felt so good i didn't want to move or it would go away. \r\n\r\nmy body felt heavy but my mind told me to move, so i started with my hands and as i wiggled my fingers i felt the euphoria leaving my body, going up towards my face, which still tingled.  when i stood up i felt unsteady and a heaviness in my limbs, but i still went to check the girls.  they were all sleeping.\r\n\r\ni tried to go back to bed, but i felt surreal and when i just lay there i started to cry.  i don't know what to feel, i don't know what to think, i don't know if it was a dream or if it was real.  so i decided to write it all down on my computer, but when i turned on my computer, it made a series of low tone, loud buzzing noises, twice in a row.  i've never heard it before.  \r\n\r\ni'm really tired now so i think i'm going to go back to bed. i don't know if i like this. i feel a little fear to go back to sleep and that's stupid, if it wasn't a dream... they wouldn't come back again... and yet at the same time i don't feel fear... i think because i believe that no matter what, i am god's child and he is watching over me and because he is god, they were created by him too....  weird.  i do know that i have that image etched into my mind...  of him standing in my bathroom doorway just looking at me... dream or real... i wont forget that.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":37079,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":31.111004779142192,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04022012-0012","longitude":-97.91888775920987,"occurred":1333177200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1333415757000,"summary":"Visitation

the north at daybreak at 1:00. it was heading south slowly just wobbling and flying above the ocean inland (very low) taking its time. as i got out of my truck and started to video and speak the orb winked out. this orb/ufo was very silent, and all you could hear was the small waves hitting the shoreline. at this point i got back in my truck in hopes it would return. it reappeared at 0600 at about 12:00 low once again to the ocean. due south appeared to be its course, and there was a tinge of yellow with white now. once again, i got out of my truck and proceeded to get videos and pictures with my nikon digital camera. this time the orb/ufo stuck around for few minutes and would just hover in one spot as i watched it and snapped more pictures. this object remained silent. \r\n\r\nwithin a few minutes out of nowhere, and i am in the middle of no where a large sounding vehicle was coming down the road from the south east. i am 28 miles from town out in the national forest and a large vehicle, which when it turned to come down the hill and intrude upon my ufo sighting moment was actually a tow truck! yeah, if you can believe that. i was thinking to myself, what in the frick is that doing out here at this time of the morning and out of all the pull offs, this one. there were two men, they both got out not only looking at me, but then looked at the beach and rocks below. i continued my sighting adventure. my ufo started to flash red, white, orange and yellow and start to accelerate and ascend to the south silently. this i had seen many times before with similar objects. as i looked through my binoculars once again i could not identify it and it resembled the others i had seen in prior sightings. it was flat with alot of bright white lights, and red flashing on the bottom, with some orange..Tints of yellow. it like the others, headed towards the small mountain ridge to the south east and then disappeared. just like that it was gone. upon my departure, the two men with the tow truck started to pull some \"dummie's\" truck up off the beach and rocks below the parking area. as i headed home  exhaustion and fatigue would over come me, so i ended up sleeping most of the morning until 1146 . which, sleeping in is not a very common occurance for me.
