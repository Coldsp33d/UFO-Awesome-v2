area so we went to the one location she was most unnerved by so as i can identify the feeling she had gotten many times before. the whole evening i had been observing the stars but as we were at the location that held paranormal interest i noticed a very bright red star-like object in the sky, i stopped and said \"ah would you look at mars!\" a moment passed until i realised that it could not be mars at all for mars was behind me to the left of the moon! it then hit me that the red light this object was emitting was incredibly vivid and growing in intensity. i then reached into my pocket for my phone to take an image of the light. \r\n\r\nas i did my girlfriend noticed the object began moving, i raised my phone and though i doubted that it would even pick up the light from this object it most certainly did. my girlfriend and i then stood and followed with our eyes as this red glowing object had really started to move right past beneath the \"big dipper\" and close to mars, remember earlier i had said mars was behind me opposite from where this object was. then it stopped dead in its track and began dimming and getting smaller which in my opinion mean that it was moving away from the earth now.\r\n\r\ni wish i could say i've been surprised by this but truth is i've seen a lot of craft before including spheres, triangles, and a saucer though the saucer i had unwittingly caught on camera by accident. i've had a history of ufo's being around me as far back as conception. i've also seen hundreds of planes, comets/meteors, satellites, planetary bodies, and of course chinese festival lanterns so i'm quite aware that what i saw with my girlfriend tonight was none of those objects. i have also noticed that when ever i'm with my girlfriend i tend to see things more frequently.\r\nthe photos i've attached show a swirl of red light, that's a result of my motion as its difficult to focus in on a star like object with a smart phone. 3 attachments two are the same photo just one has been blown up and has details of the image and camera on it and the other two are the raw photos. \r\n\r\ni'd also appreciate any form of contact with someone in mufon as i have a

definitely not of this world. it was about 12:30 when i went out into my yard for some fresh air on this exceptionally clear night, not a cloud. i made it about 15 paces into my yard before a light(bright and flickering so many colors so very fast) caught my very sharp and well trained eyes.I am familiar with everything that flies, rolls, or is fired. this object tracked very slowly about due west about 200'-300' about the ridge witch i estimate at roughly 1 kilometer from my position. i studied this thing in complete awe, full knowing where this this did not come from at least, for about 15 mins before i pulled out my bright led flashlight. i blinked the morse code signal for s.O.S 2 times directly at it and it stopped briefly before dimming as it descended(as if it let up on the throttle and killed some power to descend) the it got bright with red on the bottom and shot up about 200' in about 2 secs as it do so it dimmed back to its normal luminosity(as if burning power off as it rose). it eventually track too far west to be seen from my angle. so of course i start looking hard for any more activity and actually to my surprise, i indeed seen another, this one much closer slightly obscured be trees. i got to a better vantage point and flashed sos and included the numbers 1-9 interpreted through flashing my light. indeed it seemed to respond by flashing so bright it must have been pointing directly at me and my brother(indeed at times it seems to use a separate yet from the same source, light witch did not produce a beam but was like looking at a spot lot shined right at your face). i continued with my light trying different things to grab its attention as it gradually dimmed completely out then back again 3 times before continuing due west staggered behind and right to the other object by about 1kl. by 1kl(back and right) until it tracked so far west i could not make it out, it just pin-pointed out of my vision. on a final note, i called some of my friends and 2 of them witnessed the same event witch exactly corresponded with my angle and time!!! i believe this is going to be the year of a forced disclosure, hows them apples

about 9:45pm when i saw a very bright white orb over santa barbara about 10 miles away. it was moving very fast towards my direction along and over the freeway. i knew this was an orb ufo, as i have seen them before. it was too bright and went much too fast to be any known aircraft. it then stopped over turnpike overpass and turned into a huge black triangle with red lights at each corner (as i later saw as i got under it) and then moved towards the ocean. from the side it looked like a long, black line as it had no thickness to speak of. i got off at turnpike and got right under it, stuck my head out the window and got a good look at it as it slowly moved towards the ocean. it was very black. it looked like a void of blackness, unlike any black surface. the red lights at each corner did not reflect any light off the bottom of that blackness, as they should. i thought it was some sort of a space gate that may have been scanning the area. i don't know, but i could not call that blackness an object, it was void of mass. likewise, the ambient light from the city light should have reflected at least something, but it did not. i do tv lighting so i know this stuff. i followed it with my car, as it moved at a constant speed of about 4 mph and spun very, very slowly from it's axis as it faced the ground. i stopped my car again, turned it off this time, and looked out the window at it. i felt safer to stay in my car. it made no sound. it was at least 2,000 feet long and 500 feet off the ground, above me. it filled much of the sky as i looked straight up at it. at least 2 other people in cars stopped and watched it too. one was a cop in a police car. we all had eye contact with each other and made gestures of disbelief to each other as we looked up at it and back to each other. as a joke, i made a gesture with my hand that the cop should shoot at it, but he was not amused and looked disturbed. we were all disturbed. although i have have seen orbs before, those are cute, but this big black thing looked wicked evil. it passed over san marcos high school and covered 90% of the school, it was huge. those cars later moved on, but i later followed it as it descended into a large open space known as mora mesa, into the darkness beyond my sight, so i left. 5 minutes later i told a friend about it, and then we saw a white orbs from his house that went straight up and out. i soon later saw another orb that went over the mountains but my friend missed that one. it was about 10:15pm and that was that. fyi: i think i reported this sighting with nuforc but i don't see it there. but this time i made a picture, it looks exactly like what i saw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nss","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1

tired and just watched it for a while. i thought several times to go and get my camera, but knew that the battery would be low from earlier use with my kids. i kept convincing myself that it was a strange moon. the next day i was talking with an uncle and he said that we only had a quarter moon last night. i could have kicked myself. i realized that this was definatly not the moon. i really got suspicious the following day when i heard helicopters over my home. i went outside because they kept flying over. the helicopter was drab green with no markings. i was further surprised to see paratroopers doing loww jumps out of the back of the helicopter (long duel rotor). i ran inside and retrieved my camera snd staerted filming. i saw parachutes opening behind the trees. i had to pick up my kid from school so i stopped filming. i drove around the area that i thought the landed in and did not see them. i at this time stopped and left the area. i have never seen military trainnig in

stars and constellations from memory. out over the salt lake wildlife management area i saw a bright light appear, bright like a shooting star, but flying at what appeared to be a constant altitude. it flew from over the forest to the west, over south lake, and directly overhead. at about 40 degrees above the east horizon it suddenly disapppeared. the duration of the flight was around 30 seconds, and i estimate the distance traveled to be about 8 miles. i spend a great deal of time hunting fshing and ccamping in that w.M.A. and know this landscape day or night, so my estimation of the distance is approximate. my house sits at the top of a hill overlooking south lke and the salt lake wma, so the path of the flight was completely unobstructed from view. when fist observed it appeared to be about the size of a bb. as it traveled towards me it grew in size to what appeared the size of a basketball, and then reduced again in size as it proceeded east and then disappeared. although it was extremely brilliant like a shooting star, it was traveling much too slow, was at what seemed to be a constant altitude, and when passing overhead appeared to be just a brilliant white solid ball. i have no idea of the actual altitude or size of the object, but from where i was able to see it when it appeared from my location, as an educated guess i would say around a thousand feet. the terms

returning home, winter park, fl, after visiting family in tampa. my father was driving and my one brother and two sisters were in the car as well. i was sitting in the back seat looking at the stars. the sky was completely clear and i could see the stars very well. we were outside of any major city, so there were no nearby city lights to disrupt vision. one of the times i looked up i noticed a very bright light that was jumping up and down, and side to side, staying within a specific range of movement. the light was a circle and definitely much brighter than the stars or even venus or jupiter. it was brighter and larger than a typical passenger plane coming in for a landing. it seemed to have a center point which its pattern of movement was centered around. it would move up from that center point then return. it kept 'jumping' up, down, and to each side, left and right of the center point. but it would always return to the center point after each movement before making another move. also, the bursts of movements were always the exact same distance from the center point, and always a straight line, no matter which direction it moved. after watching it for about 10 minutes, i told my father to look at it. my father is a very intelligent gentleman who served 7 years in the army as a computer technision. he was quite amazed as i was, and we pulled over on the side of the freeway and all of us sat in the car watching this light for about 30 minutes. it never changed its location in the sky and it never went away. it just kept making quick bursts of straight line movements from its center point. also, it always moved in one of four directions... straight up, straight down, straight to the left, or straight to the right. and it would usually pause for a few seconds at its center point before making another movement in one of the four directions. the movements were also very fast, almost as if it were jumping to each point. it was probably within a 5 mile distance from us and i would say probably about 10,000 feet up. it wasn't real high above us. it was more like out to our side, low in the sky. also, the movements were short distances from the center point. maybe 500 to 1000 feet. it never went away and we finally drove home. my father smiled and said, \"it's things like that, that make you wonder what else is out there.\" it was something i will never forget, and i thought i would share it with mufon. thanks for taking the time to read this. good luck with your research. i truely believe that there is definitely intelligent life throughout

seconds.  i then got up and looked out the window and saw the above-described object for about 1 minute across the street.  then the object lifted up and went over the house in back and down where i lost sight of it.\r\n\r\nabout 6:00 a.M. that morning 2 helicopters arrived about where i first heard the noise and hovered at about the same location where i heard the noise.  then they turned and came east to where i saw the object and they then turned north and followed the same path as the object.\r\n\r\nmy first reaction was that i was a little scared then that feeling went away and i just looked at the object in amazement.  after the object left, i just stood at the foot of my bed wondering what to do next.  i then decided to go back to bed and deal with what i saw later in the morning. \r\n\r\nnote:  see attachments.  one is an image done by a friend.  it is a photo of the house where i saw the object with a representation of the object superimposed on it.  the second is a recent newspaper article about my sighting.  and the third is a newspaper article about a fatal traffic accident that occurred the morning of 1/12/2012 at approximately the same time the object left my view and traveled in the direction where the accident occurred.\r\n\r\ncan you please send a copy of this report and attachments to chuck weaver.\r\ni spoke with him a few days ago and he asked that i file this report and that he would get a copy.\r\n\r\nthank you,\r\n","distance":"21-100

gorgeous evening when i looked up to see if there were any ufos. too my complete shock there were a group of lights that ran perpendicular over the top of our 40 by 60 foot shop. it took a second to absorb the idea that it was even there.  my response was..Omg omg it's a ufo a mother ship.  there is no way that is was anything else...I believe it was over 300', and with a good mathematician they could let me just how big it was....I tried getting a video and pictures  but i was just so excited.  also tried calling my neighbor , no answer...Ran to the house...But the huge ship was moving over the horizon.  the whole thing lasted 7  to 10 minuted.  my neighbor did see the lights i was pointing out to him  but the angle of the string of lights  was now down to one  which at first he thought was a star  then the light went out..\r\nthe lights on the craft, i could not see anything else , would with a pattern  turn off and on...Reminded me of a movie  where the space ship is on cruse control with crusing lights on.  ran silent and was huge!!! move  toward ironton, mo and belgrade, mo.  to the nw of roselle. mo.","distance":"Over One
