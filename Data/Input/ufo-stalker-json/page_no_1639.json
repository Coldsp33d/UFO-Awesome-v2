went back online and checked the webcam and the streak of light was now exiting the screen.  i took another picture.  i again watched for a while.  i once again checked the webcam again at around 10 pm and this time i was shocked to see a line of round lights.   i have no clue if webcam pictures are useful, acturate or even analyzable ( if that is a word); however, these lights were so intresting i wanted to share them.  oddly,  ufo webcam site as no address to send the pictures you save.  so i decided to send them here.  i was online when i saw the objects.  webcam does not alow for motion, can only reset to refresh image.\r\ni felt intrigued and curious during the observation.  finaly i refreshed once and the lights were gone.","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":37041,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.4101171,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03312012-0014","longitude":-74.3645906,"occurred":1333081800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

a few stills. the sky was absolutely clear of cloud formations except for one large single cloud bank over the moutains to the west. these moutains are right in the heart of the geothermal emissions in lake county, near the georhtermal poiwer plant set atop one of the highest hills.\r\n\r\ni took a series of 4 or 5 photos with perhpas a 2 - 3 second delay between each , due to autofocus and the common delay with digital cameras. i never viewed anything out of the ordinary when taking the shots and observed nothing with the naked eye. \r\n\r\ni headed back into the house with the intention of uplaoding the photos to my computer and noticed the first photo had a very prominant misty globe like sphere, not shown on any other photo. \r\n\r\ni was very excited at finding the object and showed it to my wife who's first thought was that it was the moon, however the moon was rising in the east and could only be viewed at about 45 degrees in the front of the house directly eastward. \r\n\r\nthe cloud which appears in the photo was absoltely static for a good 20 minutes and then within a few minute span completely dissapated leaving a cloudless sky for the reaminder of the sunset.\r\n\r\nthe interesting things to notice about the photo is the sharp detail of the trees and cloud formation compared to the misty globe like figure which has obvious motion blur towrads the cloud bank. i've had friends with photogrpahy experience take a look at it and it seems readily apparent its not a camera flash or reflection and is of a rather large size. \r\n\r\naside from what the camera captured in that 300th of a second frame , there was nothing viewable from the naked eye, no noise , no pet distrubances and nothing out of the ordinary except for the fast dissapation of the cloud 10 minutes after the photos were taken.\r\n\r\na very exciting afternoon that has stuck with me the last 2.5 years and one of only 2 possible sightings ive ever experienced in the area. the third photo shown is the picture with adobe effect applied to it which brings out some interesting charactersitics.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

basically from 1 end to my house to the other very quickly (less than 5 seconds). i don't know north , south, east, west so that is the way i explain it. i have seen and observed local planes pass over and they don't move that quickly (this was not a plane). the blinky lights emitted colors that are not common with a small plane or next size up. i have flown in planes myself. big planes don't emit this coloration. cloudy sky tonight. what i noticed, it seemed the lights stopped when i was vigorous in looking.\r\n\r\ni have been watching my skies for at least a year. i have this feeling. on 2 occasions within the last 6 months, i believe the sky is changing. in addition, i witnessed my soda bottle twice do something strange. the soda in my 2 liter bulged up (as if it were a volcano erupting--it fell over itself-not the bottle but the liquid). \r\n\r\ni have a train track approximately a football field and a half from my house. when a train comes, i get ripples in my soda, not volcanic like transformations in the liquid. the movements of liquid are not geologically or train related. i theroretically (spelling sorry) think that sound is making that happen. the resonance of the sound vibrated, therefore causing my soda to do that action.\r\n\r\noh boy do i have this feeling----i get a lot of ringing in my ears. \r\n\r\nlike elephants, whom emit a sound that human ears can't hear, i hear something that i can't explain. sometimes the ringing in my ears is so loud, i pop my own  ears. it helps but it is depressing. at night, i hear a hum, can't get rid of it.\r\n\r\ni know ufo's exist!!! i know there is something out there. we are not alone!!\r\n\r\ncloudy night--i haven't observed this phenomenon on a clear night. however, i feel stars were blocked by big objects

we lived. \r\ni was 4 years old. it was summer i think because it was warm and i remember only wearing a t shirt and shorts. suddenly  above the tree we were sitting under we noticed a craft hovering above us like it was watching us. it can't have been more than 20 ft above us, less i think.\r\nwe both looked at it and said that must be \"thunderbird 2 \" i can only remember seeing the front of the craft it was the same shape as thunderbird 2 at the front. the back half was hidden by the tree. i noticed it was a gun metal grey color, with a dull shine and small windows in odd and random places. i can't remember seeing anyone inside, or if it made a sound.\r\nthen my father must have come along and i don't remember anything after that. \r\nwhen i ask my brother now if he remembers, he says no but he is very afraid of ufos.","distance":"20 Feet or

was heading south on treat blvd from concord to walnut creek ca. i was at the traffic light at treat and clayton rd when i first noticed it to the south west of my position. it was shining through some pine trees so i thought it was a plane or a street light at first. as i got up to the highest point on treat blvd that's when i noticed it was neither of my first thoughts. the thing that caught my attention to it was how brilliantly blinding the lights on it was. i've seen planes flying at me with the fog/landing light and i was absolutely certain it was not that.When i got to the top of treat blvd there was a clearing from the trees and houses and i could see the lights clearly. it looked like two huge white stars with a red dot or orb in the middle that was slightly lower. the thing that made me notice it is that i drive that way every day same time and roughly the same darkness and it was almost blinding to  look at it. it made the other stars look dull and the size was twice as big as any star in the sky.Plus how close they were to each other didn't even look natural. just looking at it was captivating and i almost drove my car off the road. when i pulled over is when i could tell for sure that it was stationary. there was a helicopter to the left of it over the freeway doing the morning traffic report walnut creek so i know it was not that. i live by the navel weapon station in concord and see them practice military helicopter flights once in a while it wasn't that either. something about it was different then the normal military planes i see (i'm up to date on the new vehicles because i like that kind of stuff). i tried to drive closer to take a picture but lost it behind some houses (biggest regret of my life) and i didn't have time to turn around. when i got to work i talked to my manager and he saw it while he was driving to work on the free way and got a look from a different angle. described the same thing i saw. this is something i've never

ascending over mt. olympus in utah. the mountain is west of my house. at first, i thought an airplane, but then the lights seemed to multiply above and below the mountain horizon. withing seconds there was over 8-10 of them and i realized that the majority of them were actually in alignment moving north east directly toward me.\r\nso i realized there was a \"form\" to them but i couldn't see any actual \"structure\". just pulsating orbs/lights that appeared to have a solid mass.\r\nthe \"floated\", silent, fluid movement still north east direction.\r\ni couldn't believe what i was seeing. i am a believer in ufo's but had never witnessed one. what were these things? was a really seeing a ufo/ufo's heading straight toward me. \r\ni realized they were heading in a direction that would take them right over my house, so i ran to my top deck and could then see that there were even more lights/orbs in a unilateral alignment \"floating\" north east. i ran through my house, grabbing my cell phone and a video camera and headed out the front door to the street. \r\ni though i would be happy......This might actually be a ufo but instead i felt uneasy and a little fearful so i was yelling for my husband and neighbors to come see. no one seemed to hear me.\r\nwhen i reached the corner of 20th east, the object suddenly seemed to make an abrupt shift 90 degree's to the right and immediately vanished. like someone just turned the lights out. gone.\r\nheading back to the house i realized that i hadn't even turned the video camera on and my cell phone only got glimpses of the ground as i was running.\r\ni guess i was so mesmerized, i didn't even focus.\r\nafter wards, i immediately searched the internet for any news that might confirm what i saw. nothing. within 20minutes post the event, i was suddenly exhausted! couldn't keep my eyes open even though my mind was racing. i slept like a rock which is extremely unusual for me.\r\nthe whole experience has me a little nervous to be honest. i have no idea what i saw, so i guess i can officially say \" i saw a ufo\".","distance":"501 Feet - 1

i turn and find mars slightly to the southeast, north east of mars i first noticed a single solid unblinking amber light traveling east to west, then as it nears my location it turned south along 235, kept this velocity(speed/dircetional) till it was out of sight.\r\n\r\ntwo helo come in form the same direction. i think to myself, oh cool they must be following that amber light. they did not, they stayed right in front of me(south of nw50th west of 235, and waited , then there were three comercial passenger p lains appear from the east, escorded by h elicopters, and small mil litery j et, they were farther north, but still east to west velocity. the helo was located between where the single light was and the passenger p lains like a buffer or sort of barrier.  i know they were passenger p lains, because at least one of them had to make two passes before landing, one of which went right over my house, silver with red stripes, americain air.\r\n\r\nthen there were five unblinking amber lights ascorted by he liocopters with blinking lights. it was very strange how the lights moved, in a (y) formation. the (y) formation was turned on its side with the top facing the direction they were traveling.  i could see the blinking lights of helo not moving as smoothly through the air. the amber lights were moving in locked positions, almost looked like a moving star constlation.  it was neat having all the other p lains, j ets, h elicopters, in the air at the same time. i mean in comparison these lights were very diffrenet from the amber lights. the lights and following helo came form a north east direction, heading west. at this time, i had to have some one else see this too. i opened the balcony back door and yelled at my fiennce to come look, he did and we both watched togather. \r\nwhile watching these lights, form the south i'm guessing tin ker a ir b ase, a small j et comes by so close got a look up it's skirt, double turb not single.  it was headed toward the lights, looked like it wanted to flank the lights north of my location. these lights come in more north than the first object or the passenger p lains had. i watched these objects move northeast till they were out of sight, kept same velocity.\r\n\r\nthis all happend within 20 or 30 min.  while these events were unfolding i noticed behind me the city was being covered by helo in a grid like fashion. i have never seen so much activity in oklahoma city sky. \r\ni wasn't scared when this was happing, i just tried to rationally and objectively observe.  i went through may be i just saw some new d rones being tested or something milt op, but then why were the passenger p lians involved at all, these objects must of showed  up on ra dar. the passenger p lians were being diverted away from these objects. i heard the j ets, p lains, and helo nothing abnormal. no strange sounds, and another thing the helo that were flying a grid pattern over the city did not have their spot lights on, they were not looking for anything on the ground. oh one more thing there was not a cloud in the sky.\r\n\r\nthats all thank you  \r\n   ","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1
