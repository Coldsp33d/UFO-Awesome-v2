for her documents. she wasn't there because she had moved out of state a week ago. i loved her telescope so i to it to their 180 degree balcony and started stargazing at 9:37pm(western time) portland, oregon. after searching for 5 minutes, i looked up to get an eye break. then, i noticed about 7 airplanes flying to the city airport and when i looked at a flight tracking app, i saw that they were all actual planes. then i decided to go back to stargazing but noticed three additional objects. when i checked the radar again, i didn't see the objects documented and labeled so i thought they were military aircrafts but after gazing for some time, i noticed they weren't moving. that's when i took out my binoculars and looked closely. my jaw dropped when i saw the lights and the shape of 1 of the 3 objects. there were no windows or cockpits and there were flashing lights with about 3-4 colors. the object was hovering like a helicopter. i observed the same thing with the other two objects. i called my dad and explained everything to him but he laughed at me and left after looking at them. i followed them for 3 extra minutes and saw all three of them line up in a straight line and then like a race, they took off in different directions at a very high speed. the other two disappeared behind the hills and i barely followed the third one which disappeared faster . i checked my tracker one more time and didn't see them. i also recorded three 2 minute long videos. i do believe i saw three unidentified flying disks.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

garage. high up in the west (which was sraight ahead of me) i noticed a star sized orb colorfully pulsating. it was descending fast enough where i knew i needed to grab my good camera quickly in order to get a chance to get some good shots. however, it wasn't fast enough at all to be any sort of meteor, airplane, helicopter, etc. i know of nothing of that size, pulsating very bright color, that would be that high up, but slowly come down in a straight line long enough for me to observe it over about five minutes as it lowered about 5-6 inches if i measured with a ruler right in front of me. once i got my camera, i zoomed into this orb pulsating every color of the rainbow very fast. it was so bright that i couldn't see the shape of the object. it finally disappeared behind the house across the street from mine, then i couldn't do anything. unfortunately, the video i got was horrible. yet, i did capture an awesome picture. i moved a bit when taking it, so there was a trail created of the object. yet, that trail allows anyone who sees it to observe the variety of color this object illuminated and just how bright it really was. this picture is a picture my phone took of the display screen of my camera and it still looks cool. i live right by a major airport, within a couple miles. i have airplanes roaring over my home constanly. this wasn't a plane, plus it was a couple miles away, straight ahead (west), high up in the sky. you could argue it was coming in for a landing from miles away. but then it would not be descending straight down without coming closer to the airport which was a couple miles from me to my left (south). if it did land, it would have landed miles away from the airport with that behavior. also, last time i checked too, planes blink at night using two or three colors. they do not pulsate very rapidly (non-stop) between the colors of the rainbow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  ","distance":"Over One

even went out on my balcony to see if it was still in the area, but it was gone without a trace.\r\n\r\ni looked out my window some more, and could see the sky above my building out of my window and over the building across from me. i watched planes go by shortly after this, and watched their flight pattern, to see if i would be able to view them flying over my building and the one across from me, which i could do with no problem.\r\n\r\nas i observed the planes, i noticed that their lights-compared to what i saw- were very different. the lights on the plane looked more yellowish and i could see the two blinking lights underneath and hear the engine of the plane. \r\n\r\nwhat i saw, had three white light, moved very slow, appeared to be round, like a sphere/disc or tire on its side(that type of shape but i am assuming much larger, due to the distance between us)and appeared a bit closer than the planes. even as a plane flew over the building and became closer, it was still quite a far distance away. what i saw was much lower and closer than a plane and had absolutely no sound. \r\n\r\ni felt excited, stunned, and eager to find out what it was that i saw. \r\ni

unusual. i thought perhaps it was a stunt plane but there were no planes in the sky. \r\n\r\nthe sky was beautiful with huge clouds. something just didn't seem right. i took out my camera and began to take a series of pictures. the first picture #107, shows, the vertical contrail. my husband said  he thought it was an optical illusion but it definitely was vertical, not a normal horizontal contrail. \r\n\r\nthe second picture i took, #108,  you will have to enlarge the pictures to see the orbs/lights, you can scan the picture and you will see at the very top, a few objects. the third picture #109, again shows small orbs. #110, is one of the pictures that you can see the orbs going across the highway. my suggestion is to use your magnifier on your computer to look at these objects as they are scattered across the clouds. #111 is now clear, nothing to see however in #112, if you look to the right of your screen, the picture shows a multi-colored object in the sky where i had originally seen the vertical contrail.\r\n\r\nas i took the pictures,  i couldn't see anything but the clouds. once i uploaded them to the computer is when i saw the objects. they were headed north, towards lake erie. we had left sandusky and were approximately near a city called vermillion when i began to take the photos.\r\n\r\ni have found that people that can stand right next to me, can't see the objects, but i can. it has happened numerous times.  for anyone searching the sky for the ufos, i would say look when you see a rainbow or a sun dog as the ufos seem to appear then.\r\n\r\ni have

to my husband who watched it with me. his distance vision is impaired, but mine is not. we watched the object and my husband agreed that it wasn't a satellite or a high altitude plane.  after approx 30 more seconds of observing the whitish blue glowing dot, it took an abrupt 90 degree drop, as though it was a rock falling off a ledge and it was no longer visible which is odd because the horizon

because my grandmother crossed over.  \r\n\r\ni headed out back to ground myself a bit because i was in a state of shock.  when i got to the end of the building, i noticed a black object in the sky moving eastward.  the sky was full of relatively low cloud cover.\r\n\r\ni had just captured a metallic object on video the week before, so i started to wonder if someone was playing games with me and setting off balloons in the neighborhood.  i decided the pull out the iphone and record it anyway, just in case.\r\n\r\nat first i seriously thought it was a clump of black balloons, but it seemed to kind of change shape a bit.  \r\n\r\ni began recording it and immediately felt it following a different flight pattern.  it seemed to move and then hover.  at one point i moved to my left to make sure to keep it in frame, and it literally accelerates out of the shot.  \r\n\r\nat this point i was fairly sure it wasn't a balloon, but i ran out front to make sure.  i figured if it were a balloon, it would be long gone...Or at least much higher in the sky.  by this point i had experienced at least a couple of ufo sightings, so i figured if it wanted to be seen, it would still be there. \r\n\r\ni ran to the front of the apartment to see if i could capture anymore.\r\n\r\nby the time i got out front it was still there, and i was able to get about another two and a half minutes of video.\r\n\r\nit did seem to flip and dance at times, and then would suddenly start moving in the same easterly direction.  \r\n\r\nthe curious thing were the people standing by.  there were at least two people on the sidewalk to the north of me.  one of them actually looked up and saw me holding the phone up towards the sky and filming… both stayed focused with their heads down looking at their cell phones.\r\n\r\nthis is by far one of the most usual, vivid and relatively ‘close’ realtime video captures i've ever knowingly encountered (i've caught quite a few by accident) this happened in broad daylight in public, and i’m still not certain anyone else saw this.  \r\n\r\nin one of the video clips provided, another ufo crosses in and out of the shot doing an almost 90 degree turn.  i looked at an embossed version of the clip in the editor and it clearly flies above the tree.  when looking at the closeups of the 2nd object, it vividly changing shape as well.  also an \"orb\" crosses the shot from the lower left up to the thru the top of the frame.  this was a very busy capture.  \r\n","distance":"101-500

what i was seeing.\r\n\r\n4) straight line , no sound.  but solid white or yellow color...Moving from due south to north.   \r\n\r\n5)  i felt dizzy after, but probably just from nerves , from seeing what i saw.\r\n\r\n6) it finally went out of sight.  \r\n\r\nmy original txt that i sent other outlets -\r\n\r\ni live out here in the mountains (2000 feet up) , so it's perfect for night viewing and there's always interesting stuff out here it seems.   i've seen meteors burn up several times.. but this was no meteor.  \r\n\r\nit was a lighted object , just as faint as some of the stars out there.  but it was moving.   i couldn't believe my eyes at first, because it literally looked that far away , like it was one of the stars that are hundreds of light years away, but was moving from due south to due north.  and then out of view.   i got my cell-phone but the light from it was faint, and wouldn't even come into view on there.  it was definitely not a meteor or asteroid because it moved in a straight line from south to north and never was there any fainting of the the solid light.  it was of the same solid color  (white or yellow) the whole time.  no blinking or blinking lights of any kind either.   planes fly through here all the time, and this was no plane from this planet.    it honestly just looked like an orb of light moving from south to north....But it was very far away it seemed. the light on the object may of been from the sun setting as well, as the sun set like an hour (or more) ago , but up that high , i could see how the sun could reflect things from that angle. there was also no sound.  this was amazing and my first official ufo sighting.    \r\n\r\nyou can email me back if any questions, but otherwise i prefer to remain anon.

the annual meteor shower for a few minutes. i was looking directly above me and facing north. after seeing one meteor i saw a white light illuminate just a little brighter than the stars visible in the sky. i saw it first out of the corner of my eye so moved my eyes to the spot in the sky i saw a another flash of light but much dimmer than the first that caught my eye.  after it dimmed out a couple to few seconds later i saw the original brighter flash of light followed a couple seconds later with a dimmer light. this pattern of a bright light then a couple second pause the a much dimmer light went on for about 10 minutes. the light remained in the same position in the sky long enough for me to go dig binoculars out of a closet. when i went back outside i thought that the lights would've gone but when i came out they were still in the same spot in the sky. i was unable to see or track it with my binoculars. after probably 12 minutes it started to slowly move east. i watched it for another 15 or so minutes until i could no longer see it. an airline flew across the objects flight path. i got the impression the lights were higher in altitude than the airline. i also got the impression the second dimmer flash was offset a small amount from the actual location of the brighter flash. no sounds made by object. sky was clear and sun had set much earlier so. full night sky was visible. light was first seen a couple of degrees south of the big dipper where it was in the sky at 10 pm. flash of light was just a tiny bit brighter than the stars in the big dipper and the size of the flash was the size of visible star. second flash was much duller light and size was smaller than stars in big dipper. you really had to be focused on the spot in the sky to see the second flash. i have no idea how long the item was stationary before it started to slowly move east. my neighbors and i have seen numerous strange occurrences in the night sky in this location. we seen a spectacular one about 8 years ago that lasted over a minute which was very low very bright. i felt compelled to report this as there is just too much activity going on to not report it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:25:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

about 15-20 feet in diameter pop out of thin air and shoot down the street from my left to my right. it was just above the houses and trees. it made it about 250-300 yards in what seemed like 2 or 3 seconds, made a hard curved right hand turn and disappeared. we thought we were insane, so we kinda let it slide after we gave each other the \"that really just happen?\" question. until we made it down to the park and it flashed in front of us again. this time it was only about 70-80 feet away, as before it was across the street and above the trees. the second time we spotted it was just a flash. honestly thought my head was messing with me because it was so fast and so close. the orb was maybe only 60-80 feet way from us, and about 10-15 feet off the ground. both were quick and close.
