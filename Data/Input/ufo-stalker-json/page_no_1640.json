towards local busniess called tecumseh stamping ( i think that was its name).I stood there for what seemed like an hour just watching it. i could make out a silouette that the craft was triangular on the base with 3 triangular lights at each of the peaks of the shape. i could also see sillouette with the factory lights in the skyline that the craft also had a pyrimid shape on top but not straight, more of a flattened and slanted pyrimid, its hard to describe in words but i can see it as if i just saw it last night. i will include my best rendering of it as i can, i'm not the best artist but i can still pitcure it in my head any time. i saw no lights on it other then those i could see on the bottom. my first thought when i think about this craft is maybe was some kinda stealth fighter like the b2 bomber or something but the slowness and silentness of it make me think otherwise. i dont claim this to be alien but judging from what tech we as humans have and are experimenting with i dont think it was man made.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

old mining town of jerome on mingus mountain towards the west when i spotted a single white cloud, about the size of a golfball at arms length, and the cloud was moving in my direction towards the east at an unhurried rate of speed. what struck me as odd was the fact that there were no other clouds in the sky at all as far as the eye could see. the cloud was also bright white, almost luminous as though shining from the inside from some unknown source. i continued to watch this cloud coming closer and i stood up to walk to the back wall so the patio roof would not obscure my view never taking my eyes off the cloud when it suddenly stopped moving. i remember thinking inside my head \"a ha - gotcha ! because at that point as far as i was concerned this was no longer a stray cloud but a ufo that was cloaked in a vapor/cloud cover to conceal itself. no sooner had i thought this and the 'cloud/ufo reversed it's course and started to ascend in altitude a bit, it stopped and hovered again and then resumed it's original course heading to the east crossing over the top of the house. my friend came outside and wondered what i was looking at and i explained what i was seeing and she just rolled her eyes and went back inside to watch the idiot box. the entire event lasted about 4 minutes or so and it struck me as funny that the ufo/cloud panicked and reversed course once i realized what it was and than just continued on course as though to let me know that i can't prove anything other than telling about my experience here on mufon for others to read. i have had several dozen sightings of ufo's here in arizona over the last 4 years of different types of crafts like diamond shaped, golden bell shaped, disc and star-like as well. i know that they can 'hear' my thoughts because they almost always react to me saying in my head \" i see you !\" and they will either brighten up if i ask them to or quickly and instantly disappear before my eyes which is kind of spooky. we are not alone and i for one look forward to the day when they allow themselves to be known to us other than just lights or crafts in the sky that we can't touch. keep looking skyward and hopefully you too will see what so many of us on the planet have witnessed. it's pretty awe inspiring to me to know that we are not alone in this wonderful universe.

turn them back on.\" i guess i had hoped that they would listen to me. i then yelled out \"i knew you were real!, i'm so happy that i could see you even if this is the only time.\" it was so amazing. i kept watching out the window as we got farther & farther away from it & it stayed there until we were about a mile away from it. it then began to ascend into the sky & i lost sight of it. my cousin was in the backseat in complete shock. he remained quiet the entire time & just watched. he wasn't sure what to make of the object we were seeing. he was a skeptic prior to this experience & it took him a few weeks to admit what he saw. my fiance & i had discussed the encounter frequently after that & to this day still talk about it.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":36999,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.9311595,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03302012-0003","longitude":-75.8286037,"occurred":1300170600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1333097019000,"summary":"Object rose up over the tree line & hovered for 15 mins, appeared to see me, tilted in my direction.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/36999_submitter_file1__ufo.png"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":381,"locationName":"Coatesville, Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:8467"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Burbank","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Saturday night march 24,2012 at 11:52pm i took my dog out to do his business and i noticed right over my tree in burbank wa. and at about the same hight as small air plain would fly was a 8'-10' glass ball with what looked like a ark welder in it but it was putting off orange-red light instead of white. it was traveling east 100 degees at about 20-30 miles an hour. too slow for an air plane unless it was an ultralite but this ball put off so much light that it would have illuminated any craft around it. i knew no one would believe me without evidence so i ran back into the house and grabbed my video camera and got 5 min. of video of it going away from me until it went out of sight. it's an analog hi-8 and i have been trying to find someone that can put it on a dvd so i can upload it on the internet. i have talked to our air port and they said that they would not have record of radar because they shut down at 10:00pm. a few days later doing the same thing with the dog i saw a white orb come out of burbank hights arleens addition across the river towards finley wa. it was traveling very low and like a rocket. i haven't seen anything move that fast. it moved so fast i didn't even have time to turn on the camea i was holding. the object that i did get video of was right over me and it was putting out so much light that it actually would hurt your eyes if you stared at it to long. i had my camera in night vision mode so that it would film it at night so it looks white-green on film but it was really orange-red and maybe a hint of yellow. i didn't have time to grab my tripod so it's a bit shaky. i ran over to my fence and tried to stabilize the camera but it still moves around on the screen.

seeing anything like this).\r\ni was in my apartment on my laptop when i heard what sounded like a plane flying low and close. i went to my door and opened it to see what was happening, and i saw a kite-shaped object flying east over town. it looked familiar (most likely from tv programs about ufos) but certainly not like an airplane, so i was not alarmed, but i was extremely curious and interested while watching it. the sun had set but the sky was still royal blue, so i could clearly see the gray shape of the object and could tell that it had no discernible wings, just a solid diamond-like shape. there were several lights along the front, and i believe the ones at the corners flashed. some were white and others were slightly yellowish. as the object neared the hills that would block it from my view, it turned slightly to the north (left). it flew slowly and smoothly, and sounded much louder than a plane. the whooshing hum was higher in pitch than any plane or jet i've heard before.\r\ni live south of an airport, and i've observed several airplanes flying tonight after seeing this object. they all go north and have lights in a plane-like configuration. the kite-shaped object was lower, louder, and definitely not flying toward the airport.\r\nafter seeing it, i returned to my laptop and researched what i may have seen, and found ufo sightings very similar to mine. i'm a smart and logical person, and i am 100% sure i did not see an airplane. i will now keep my camera close and try to get evidence if this happens again.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

quickly noticed that it was not from a car and when i looked up there was a metallic disk in the air rotating and tilting as it was slowly moving upwards in a spiral type path.  i was able to clearly see the shape and surface of this craft.  it was a perfect metallic disk with no seams, lights, glass, or doors of any kind.  it was made of a very reflective silver type metal.  as it continued to move it suddenly stopped and vibrated.  at this time i was still seeing the metal shine from the sun hitting it.  it sat vibrating and tilting before suddenly moving in a  horizontal direction approximately 40 feet.  the speed it moved was extremely fast and almost instantaneous. it hovered again shaking with a strange pulsing motion before moving a small distance again horizontally. i was on the phone with a co-worker and i was trying to describe what i was seeing while in complete shock and amazement at what was going on.  after hovering for a couple seconds it disappeared  into thin air.  it seemed to vanish from the outside of the craft inwards at a very fast rate.  it did not fly away.\r\n\r\nthis whole event took approximately 27 seconds.  i had enough time to describe what i was seeing to someone on the phone and get a very good look at this object.  it was about 700 feet from me and roughly 50 feet off the ground.  the size of this disc was about 16 feet wide by 6 feet at its thickest middle point.  there is no doubt in my mind that this was a very solid disk and was made of a extremely reflective metal type material.  the shine coming off the craft was striking and can be compared to a bright shine off a chrome part of a car in the sun.  that shine hit me in the eye twice which made this experience very real and disturbing.  i have seen multiple ufos in my life but nothing this clear or close.  i will now keep a high definition camera handy because i would not believe this unless i had seen it.  this is reality and i wish there were answers.

they were just stars, but on the third night we observed flashing and brightening and dimming and color changes from white to red to green to blue and then reddish orange then back to white.  always in the same order.  so we began watching every night for the next 4 nights.  this evening ( march 28th) we once again observed the two objects.  one was always bigger than the other and the smaller one was always directly below the big one.  tonight that was not the case.  we saw both objects in the western sky but the smaller one was below and to the right of the larger one.  we observed the color change much more brilliantly and in the same pattern.  the smaller one kept moving in a inclined pattern and pulsating bright to dim to bright again.  the larger object seemed to do the same and had a wobbling up and down motion.  as it would brighten the smaller object would move away and then would move closer again when the big one dimmed.  we all felt amazed and a bit shocked by this sighting, but also a sense of wonder and calm.  myself i felt a sense of knowing it was watching us and reacting to our movements as well.  i am a true believer in scientific proof but also believe we are not alone in this universe. after we had watched for around 30 minutes the objects started to fade.  we noticed the littler one of the two began leaving a whitish/blue \"tail\" or streamer behind it as it slower drifter to the north and out of sight.  the larger object just sort of faded out of view as if it was leaving in a direct line with our sight.  it just kept getting farther and farther away until we could not see it anymore.  these sighting have occurred every night for the past 8 days except on day 4 but has returned every night since.  i will report again tomorrow if they show up again.  when they do it is always two objects.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with

that?\" when it disappeared behind the tree line to the right of the highway.  i never recovered a visual off it.  it was moving very swiftly and was almost the same color as the grey cloud cover.  i

the craft was triangular in shape, except the corners didn't come to a point, instead they appeared to be blunted. the craft was around 200 yards or so away from me, above the hill. it was a dull tan color (like sand color is), with a thick glossy black strip down the side of it. the surfaces appeared to be perfectly flat and smooth, i noticed no seems on it at all. the craft was about 100 yards plus in its width and length, and four to six stories in thickness.( i could only see the bottom, one blunt corner and one side of it from my point of view ) suddenly i noticed the craft had began to very slowly float away, over the hill moving out of sight. i stood there watching it, when suddenly i noticed that i was waving at the craft in a goodbye manner. i don't remember starting to wave, only that i was waving. as it passed out of sight the day light suddenly became very very dim all at once. i looked to see what had blocked the sun, but the sun wasn't above me any more. instead it was on the western horizon about to go down. i headed down the shore back home as fast as i could, it was dark when i arrived, it was after 8pm. a good seven hours of my life and memory are still missing from that encounter. a couple of days later i found two bright red dots' inside the hair line above my temple and located an odd bump on the back of my head toward the base of my skull.(they are both still there) it should have only taken me three or so hours to complete that trip, instead it had taken me over ten hours. \r\n   i am hoping to be regressed, and will make public any and all memories that i am able to recover from the encounter. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  ","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"07:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":36977,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.0380899,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03282012-0026","longitude":-92.7115732,"occurred":11732400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1332991621000,"summary":"Triangle,lite brown,glossy black stripe,silent,floating in mid air,150 yards length,four to six stories thick,seven hours time and memory missing.    h","tags":["triangle","floating"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"65052","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":15292,"locationName":"Linn Creek, Missouri","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:8487"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82757,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1640}
