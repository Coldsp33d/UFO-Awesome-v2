 it was completely silent, and was round, disc shaped, and had a few degrees of height, being more in surfaced area on the bottom, and slightly narrower at the top.  it was the size of a medium airplane, meaning maybe 80-100 feet long and wide, and maybe 15 feet high. it was internally lit, and that light seemed to radiate outward from the object.  i decided to light it up with my q-beam.  i hit the switch, and nothing visibly changed in the scene.  within 5 seconds, the object was gone, and all lighing was also gone.  i searched the air with my spotlight and found nothing.  less than 10 seconds later, the object appeared again, at the same altitude (as nearly as i could tell) about 2 miles away.  there was no noise from any motor or engine.  the next three times i saw the object was at a distance of 2-4 miles, and was with anglers on the boat.  one was a pilot who looked at it and observed that it did not look like a plane, helicopter, baloon, satellite, ect.  i have told a very few people about this, but i did check with a friend who is an officer with the fwc, our local on water law enforcement.  i ran into her a couple of times within a few days of some of these sightings, and asked her if they, or dea, or customs had anything going on back there.  she said for sure, no.  i thought later about being out there in the dark with this object and questioned my judgement, particularly the times when i moved closer to it.  funny thing, when it is there, there is no fear at the time.  i do not know what it is, but look forward to seeing it again. i would like to remain anonomyous for now, but would welcome any inquiries directly if it could help explain what i saw to me or others.  i will gladly supply a sketch upon request.  thank you    ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":36973,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":24.9262743,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03282012-0022","longitude":-80.6206564,"occurred":1321362000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1332981985000,"summary":"I have witnessed this object 7 times now over about 2 years, twice with other people, one of whom is a pilot.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"33036","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":134,"locationName":"Islamorada, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:8522"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Mt Pleasant","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I went outside to watch a thunderstorm that just went over clare mi to the north of me. i seen something in the sky to my left so i started to watch it. it was phasing from red to yellow and had no sound what so ever. i realized it wasn't a plane or a helicopter so i ran inside and grabbed my camera. my girlfriends son was on the computer so i told him to come check it out. he came i started filming then he said there is another one. i told him to get his mom. she came out and seen it too. they were moving from east to west just below the edge of the storm clouds casting a little light on the clouds. they seemed kind of egg shaped not round. sorry i didn't upload the video but not sure how to yet. i was just blown away by what i seen because i usually can put some kind of explanation to things but this i am drawing a blank.

there were no clouds in the sky and the sun was out.  what i saw was triangular in shape and had lights at each corner.  the main body of the object was invisible and only the 3 lights at each corner were visible.  the lights were so bright that they compared to the brightness of the mid-day sun.  i watched the object rotate and hover for several minutes while driving.  at first i thought i must be seeing things, so i slowed down and stopped in the breakdown lane.  i watched the ufo slowly rotate and hover for serveral minutes.  then it accelerated at a speed that nothing man made can do!  it took off straight out of the earth's atmophsere in a fraction of a second.  i have seen just about every flying vehicle man has to offer...I have been to space shuttle launches...And after that day it was clear to me that...Someone/something out there can move around the galaxy/universe as easily as we drive to the corner store!  this experience scared the hell out of me and i did not tell anyone for years for fear of ridicule.  my best guess is that this ufo was just watching us.\r\n","distance":"Over One

there was a light rain earlier about 10:00p.M. this was my third night in house and same room without curtains. this night however was different, as the previous two nights had been dark enough you could not make out objects other than occasional stars. this night 3/22/2012 when i turned out the lights and adjusted to dark it appeared as if flood lights were coming from below, the trees were so lit up you could see full detail of each one. you could also see clouds some very white others darker varying colors of grey. the room i was in i believe faced mostly east toward lake tahoe. i then noticed a flashing which at first seemed like a lightening flash but not exactly. the longer i watched it appeared to be a constant faint flash every few seconds. i ran into my sister in - law's room and asked her if she ever experienced lightening without thunder, she said only in summer. this was on 3/22/2012 far from summer. she said she did not see it on the other side of the house, so if i wanted to sleep in her room i could. i felt stupid for being scared so i told her no, i think i will be okay. i have never seen anything like this before, it was nowhere near the full moon and so i could not explain the bright light so far from town. i asked her if there was an airport nearby that might have a rotating light. she said yes to airport, no to any lights. she also witnessed what i am describing. when she went back to her room i tried to convince myself that it must be lightening. i must admit though i have never seen lightening that held a steady pattern of frequency like this. as i lay there suddenly i heard what sounded like very loud humming, almost like a military jet. yet, it was not moving it seemed to be directly overhead. at that point i jumped out of bed and ran across the house to her room (large house)and told her what was happening and that i was going to sleep in her room. i had such horrible dreams when i finally did get to sleep that i woke up in a sweat, my palms were filled with water. it took me forever to get back to sleep because when i got up and went into her bathroom i saw something i don't know what..I really did not want to know what outside on the deck. she has two cats and the big male went into the bathroom and just stared out as if he saw something too. he the went into the living room and looked outside again from that direction, still looking at the same area of the deck. i have never been so afraid in my life, and i have had headaches everyday since. normally all i have to do is take a couple of ibuprofen, but this is not working. my fore head and sides of my head just throb. i have no idea what it was, but i know it was not lightening. i never saw any type of object in the sky just the light followed by the noise.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet,

and it was really far away, but the oddest thing is it was dripping red fireballs every time it would appear then disappear. also i actually had this happen two more times that year and was able to get people from the complex to see it as well. and each time it seemed that two planes would always show up flying very fast before it would blink it self across the sky. i just need some feed back.
