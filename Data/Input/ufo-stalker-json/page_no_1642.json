morning potty break.  while waiting on him in my front yard, i looked to the sky as usual.  movement of a fairly large yellowish-white light flying from west to east caught my eye.  there was no noise, no cloud cover, and the sky was clear with some stars still visible, and the eastern sky was just beginning to lighten at bit.  (however, i could hear that the birds were beginning to softly chirp in the neighborhood.)  as this \"object\" got closer, the yellowish-white light turned out to be nine squarish to rectangular shaped soft glowing, yellowish-white lights in an upside down cross shape or formation. as they passed right over me (maybe several thousand feet above me??), the only way i can describe what i saw is this:  the rectangular lights were arranged uniformly, two side by side in the 1st row, two side by side in the 2nd row, three side by side in the 3rd row (these 3 lights were a little longer than the others, with a little more space before and after them), and two side by side in the 4th row.  like i stated, the color was a soft, yellowish-white glow, similar to what an encased light source would look like, with soft corners on all points.  i could not see anything between the lights nor outside the formation of lights.  i could not see any wings, tail, body, shadowing or mist like you would expect on an airplane or helicopter.  at one point, it looked as if from the side, these rectangular lights may have had some depth to them, something like a shoebox shape.  maybe this was a formation of individual objects flying together.  (looked like something out of star wars!) the lights never blinked, pulsated, or changed color.  the sound i heard while it was near me was a wobbling, pulsating strange sound, with a slight percussion of air (???).  nothing about this sound was similar to that of a jet, prop-jet, helicopter or anything i have heard or seen in my lifetime.  it was flying perhaps about 30-40 mph, not slow, but not fast either.  as it got further away, the sound dissipated quickly, and the lights returned to looking like one, fairly large yellowish-white light flying in the sky again.\r\n\r\nif our military has anything like this, wow!  if not, what is it??!!

report these but\r\nit's easier to explain. the first sighting occurred in august just before\r\nschool started it was 11:11 at night and me and my 2 friends were sky\r\nwatching on st.Pete beach when we didnt c anything we started to look down\r\nand our breaths were taken away as we saw this blue orb coming towards the\r\nbeach and it stoped just above where the waves were breaking on the\r\nshoreline and as we looked underneath it we saw this small almost glass like\r\nchild sized figure and it paced the beach for about 15 yards till one of us\r\nspoke to see if the others were seeing it and it froze where it was and\r\nlooked at us and the hole time the orb was above it... but as we saw it turn\r\ntowards our direction the orb strobes 3 times so bright that it was\r\nunbelievable and after the light it was just gone... and we were scared\r\nshitless, we sprinted all the way to my car and went straight home & i never\r\nremember running that fast in my entire life. then the second sighting\r\nhappened when it was me and my same friend from the 1st sighting (mike) he\r\nby the way is always there too. we this time were sky watching at jungle\r\nprada and we witnessed these massive orange orbs that came from no where and\r\nat first there were just 2 the a 3rd showed up in the blink of an eye. they\r\nhovers rotated and flew over the area we realized was the first place we saw\r\nthe child figure and blue orb ( st. pete beach). this all happened for\r\nruffly 4 minutes till the orbs just dispersed. then my next sighting\r\noccurred ���in seminole and this is the one that terrifies me to the core of\r\nmy being... me mike and 2 of my other friends had just pulled up at a bridge\r\nnear osceola high school and we were waiting for another kid to show up. and\r\nonce again right around 11 my friend mike and i noticed that every thing was\r\nearily quite and the street lights started to just turn on and off but we\r\nthought that was normal. but then they started going all spastic then they\r\njust stoped and right as mike looked down at his phone to say \"weird it's\r\n11:11\" a very loud rustle and thump came from the waters edge and i locked\r\neyes with a massive being that was 7 to 9 feet tall skinny, slender and it\r\nwas dragging a massive bag. one that looked like u put a christmas tree in\r\nbut what terrified me were its pure white glowing florescent eyes and then\r\ndipped under the bridge... tears still come to my eyes when i talk about\r\nthis and i'm absolutely serious that i had to draw it to just get it off my\r\nmind because it was just burned into me as an image\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, Over 1

looked out of place, so i walked out on the back deck and noticed these 3 lights spaced like a triangle but almost on a vertical plane and not horizontal.It was over my neighbors house to the south, i called to my wife because i could not believe what i was seeing. my wife stepped out on the deck, i asked her do you see that? she said yes what the heck is that. i said i don't know? she said should we get the binoculars, i agreed and told her to go get them i was not taking my eyes off this thing. then i noticed intermittent flashing lights behind this triangle traveling about the speed of a helicopter. these navigation lights were following this floating triangle. we could not tell if the triangle was solid or translucent because of the angle with the horizon. with the binoculars i could see more clearly the flashing navigation lights and could tell they were not a plane because it was moving to slow. about this time the whole thing became obscured because of the street light behind my house. \r\ni have never been witness to anything like this before and i am still trying to wrap my mind around what we observed. i have no answers only more questions but would like someone to explain to us what we witnessed. what was strange was that we live under a couple of flight paths for mci and some smaller airports in the area and there was no planes in that area until after the objects had moved out of sight. then we started getting flight traffic again. which is unusual for that time of night because we spend a lot of time on our deck.\r\nthis is the first time i have ever thought about putting anything in writing for fear of ridicule, but i know what i witnessed and cannot explain it. i have witnessed satellites and meteors before.  it just does'nt make sense.
