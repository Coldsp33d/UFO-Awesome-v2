surrounded by a neon whit aura traveling toward the earth at a very slow rate of speed. it was literally leaving a trail of light behind it. i thought perhaps a falling satellite until it did something extraordinary. it changed directions. not just once but multiple times. it was not uniform at all however but very erratic. it fell for a while and then shot back upward then beck down at another angle leaving a trail of white light behind it that did not dissipate for about forty minutes. while speeding home to tell some friends i noticed a second one to the left of the original making a lightning shaped pattern through the sky. it scared me so i rushed home. i have benn delivering papered for two years now and have seen just about everything you can see in the night sky. but never have i seen anything like this. it was amazing yet terrifying at the same time. there were reports of this being seen the part few nights over new jersey but now pa. i couldn't get a picture of it. the glow was too dim by the time i got home for the camera to pick it up? anyone out there seen this? i would love to hear from you. my friend matt saw the remains of the glow when i took him outside to see it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

is no light polution coming from nearby cities and towns. \r\n  i occasionally go outside at night to smoke a cigarette and/or relieve myself, i do the latter because it is convenient and so i don't wake up my wife or kids by flushing our noisy toilet as they go to bed earlier than i do. this also gives me a chance view the night sky which i enjoy very much.\r\n  on this particular night in late january 2012, there was no moon visible that i can remember so it was very dark out and the stars shown brightly. about 12:30am i walked out to the west side of my shop which is about the size of a 2 car garage 50feet from my house and proceeded to do my business. as i stood there relieving myself i looked up at the stars as i often do. it was then when something drew my eye and i looked directly above my head... and saw a perfectly circular soft white light about 500 feet straight above me. it wasn't so much a projecting light, meaning it didn't give off a glare or aura or glow or beam. it looked more like a room that was brightly lit up from the inside and the circle shape i saw was an opening leading to this room. the circle shaped opening looked to be about 20 to 30 feet in diameter, and i could see no other shapes inside or the near outside of this light.\r\n  about 1 second after i looked up at this light and noticed it, a single door or cover with a leading edge the same circumference as the circle began to close over the light from the direction of north to south... and soon the light was totally covered. this door or cover took 3-4 seconds to completly close over the light.\r\n  i stood there for a moment and tried to make out the shape of a craft that would house this light, but it was too dark to see any exterior shape of any kind. i listend for any noise that would go along with what i just saw, but i heard nothing. \r\n  the fact that this door or cover closed the very moment after i looked up at the light instantly made me very nervous. it seemed to me that whatever this light was it was reacting to me making eye contact with it. it gave me the feeling that this light would have continued uncovered had i not noticed it... like i was being watched and i caught someone watching me. \r\n  it was then i said out loud to myself and in a way to whomever might be able to hear me speak, \"okay\". i spoke this one word nervously and sarcastically in a regular tone, meaning i didn't shout or whisper. it was in a way mocking the event i just witnessed. it was \"okay\" aliens are real. it was \"okay\" i saw you, you saw me... now what. it was \"okay\" i'm going back in the house now. it was an \"okay\" with multiple meanings, i have to admit it... i was scared.\r\n  i walked back to the house a little faster than my normal gait. i did not look back to see if i could see anything from a different angle. and i did not go out again that night. \r\n  since then i still go out at night to smoke, etc. nowadays however, i make a point to look directly above my head before looking in any other direction. and i have a camera standing by. i hope i don't need to use it. if this happens again it would mean it was less a chance encounter and more a vested intrest in me. \r\n      ","distance":"101-500

coming from the north and heading south-east.  we have lived in the same location 17 years and know the flight paths of the planes - this was not one of them.  he thought it was odd since their color was also not like an airplane's lights, and they weren't really close to one another, but he could tell they were all similar, one after another.  he watched for a while (possibly a few minutes) and then came into the house to get me.  when i had located my shoes, and came outside, looking north i immediately saw one of the orange-red lights since it was pretty bright, but he directed me to look east, where there were 4 more moving south.  they were individual lights - not all part of one object, and they seemed far away to me, although my husband thought they were like the height of what a helicopter would be.  i could tell they weren't traveling extremely fast, since i watched for a few minutes and the last one (which was the first one i had noticed to the north) could still be seen.  they also were not directly overhead, as we had to look east to see them.  my husband expected more to come from the north, since he had already seen so many, one after another, but there were no more - he didn't keep count of how many he saw.  i myself saw 5 in total, and thought they were almost a pink color, although my husband decribed them as orange - and they were not flashing on and off and there were no other colors of light.  i thought perhaps they were some military aircraft or something, but it was out of the ordinary and we didn't hear any sound from an aircraft.  i wanted my husband to video tape them or take a photo, but he didn't.  later, after he looked up on the internet and saw that other people have seen similar things, he wished he had.   \r\n \r\neach of the lights or glowing orbs were round in shape, and from where we could see them, were about as large or a little larger as the largest star or planet in the sky - it was a clear night.  each was an orange-red color, and quite bright.  we couldn't see anything else of them except the glowing roundness.  they were all on the same \"flight path\" - one after another but we could tell they weren't part of the same \"craft\", they were individual \"crafts\", and weren't exactly in line, but were pretty close to being in line.  there were quite a few of them - maybe 20 or more - but by the time i saw them 5 could still be seen and there were no more coming from the north.\r\n \r\nrelative size - each light was about two or three handwidths away from the next light,  and each light was about the width of one of my fingers, maybe 1/2 an inch.  they seemed far away, and we could only see the lights, not the objects so i have no idea what the actual size was.\r\n \r\nit was not natural like a star or planet - they were definately air \"craft\" of some sort, although since we only saw the lights of them that is just an assumption, moving across the sky not overly fast, but at a good speed.  they just \"flew\" until we could see them no longer in the distance.\r\n\r\nboth of us have been checking the skies in the evening to see if we see something similar again - but not as of yet.  we have never seen anything like it.\r\n\r\nsince ufo stands for unidentified flying object that does describe what these were, however that doesn't mean i think they were \"alien\" (from another planet).  i do believe that many of the undentified things and happenings in this world could be spiritual beings, or \"principalities\" manifesting themselves, that the bible talks about.  we normally only see the physical things - but there are other \"dimensions\"  to life.  the comforting thing is knowing that god is in control and he has already told us how things will end up - for those who trust in his son, and for those who don't. \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":36905,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.3104105,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03272012-0009","longitude":-111.8397802,"occurred":1332649800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1332840273000,"summary":"10+ orange-red lights (orbs) traveled same direction/path as ea other headed se, 1 after another like planes on a flight path-they were not planes, or copters (no noise), they just kept appearing for 10+ min.

school. as i was walking i had a feeling something wasn't right. i looked to my left and saw an abject, or i should say a very bright light coming from the end of a blueberry field. i saw it once and then again about a 100 ft down the driveway. i had know idea what i was looking at at the time. the strange thing about looking at it the second time was the fact i have no memory of walking that 100ft. it was as if i was in 1 place and then another. the object looked like a very bright white ball with a blue light at its top moving counter clock wise and a green light at its bottom moving clock wise. i stared at it for a few more minutes and then it glowed brightly and was gone. this took place in the winter. by summer when the grass started growing, i remember the place where i saw the object, the grass didn't start to grow back for 5 or 6 years. all traces of the spot are gone now. i've only toiled 1 other person of what i saw and it was my mom. but i didn't tell her until i was in my late 20's. i've always wanted to tell someone else but people would have said i was nuts. the only thing i have to remember that day is a strange round mark on my right ankle. it never hurt

our bikes 6 houses down to our other friends house . we exited the  house out the back and got on our bikes. then we proceeded to ride down the street with me in the lead .The house opposite to his had a big trees in the front yard ,as we past the trees to our left and continued riding i caught something out of the corner of my eye and did a double take .Immediately i slammed on the brakes as fast as i could which caused my friend who was behind me to do the same .I said ricky  what the f@#k is that and a reflective disk shape object was floating over the houses kind of like it was riding along side us ,about 500 to 1000 ft in the air. as we were looking it continued on for another couple of seconds then stopped, it did not make a sound. the object continued to sit there ,we were speechless cause we both knew what we were looking at was not any conventional air craft we know to exist. and it was a bright sunny day not a cloud in the sky .Then after 5 to 10 seconds the object started heading back the way it came with out turning and from a stand still.It started off very slowly moving back the way it came but picked up speed as it went . while we continued looking at this thing in amazement i realized that i would lose sight be hind the trees we had just passed i jumped back on my bike as fast as i could and rode up the street after it. i wanted to try and see it as long as i could, but as it came to where i would loose it behind the trees the thing literally took off like a bullet and was gone . well me and my friend could not believe what we just saw and sat there in awe for a minute .But knowing there was nothing else we could do we got back on our bikes and continued to our friends house. we told her and every one we saw for days to a week but you can only so many people. i would of reported it then but i was 17 and did not know who to tell and figured no one would believe us any way. but as i watch the investigations on tv i see there are lie detector test and other things that will lend credence to my story .And i am willing to do whatever i have to to prove my story. i am sure my friend will do the same. i don't know what it was i saw ,but i know what i saw .Something strange is happening .

supper and went to bed.  i was laying in bed watching tv when my tv just went off.  at first, i thought that i had rolled over on the remote.  i found the remote and tried to turn the tv back on and it would not come on.  i then thought that the batteries were dead or weak in the remote, and i started feeling a little like someone was \"pranking\" me.  i got up and walked over to the tv and pressed the power button and nothing happened.  there were red lights on my tv and stereo to show they were receiving power so i knew they weren't unplugged.  at this point, i started to really have a feeling as if someone was \"pranking\" me.  i reached over and tried to turn on the stereo by pressing the power button and, again, nothing happened.  that's when i started to get a really eery feeling that someone was watching me and i got chill bumps.  i felt that i needed to look out the window that looks out to the next door neighbors' house.  i went over to the window and rolled open the blinds so that i could see out.  as soon as the blinds opened enough for me to see through them, i saw the object.  it was disc shaped with multi-colored lights around the rim and they were blinking.  the object was hovering near the back corner of my house and was probably about 20-30 feet off the ground.  as soon as i got a glimpse of the object, it took off straight up in the air.  i pulled the blinds up so that i could follow it in the sky.  by the time i got the blinds up so that i could see up in the sky, the object was very small in the sky and then quickly dissapeared.  i stood there for a minute in shock trying to make sense out what had happened.  i then went straight over to the tv and pressed the power button and the tv came on with no problem.  at that point, i knew something very surreal had taken place.  i thought to myself that i must be dreaming.  to test that theory, i wrote a note to my mother telling her that if she got the note to wake me up because i had seen a ufo.  my mother woke me up the next morning asking \"what is this about you seeing a ufo?\".  i knew at that point that what i saw was no dream.  it was very real.  i've told about 20 people that were the closest to me about the sighting.  based on the reaction that i've gotten, i kind of tried to just forget about it.  i have never, though, not even for a second thought that what i saw was not real.  i know what i saw was real and it definately left a lasting impression in my mind.","distance":"21-100

in our area of mid state new york, known as the lower hudson valley. just weeks prior to this \"happening\" reports were generated to the east fishkill police dept. my brother in law was visiting and i was explaining to him what we had been experiencing. i took him into our back yard just after sunset and pointed out those \"lights\" in the sky that appear to be communicating through \" different colored blinking lights\". he immediately agreed it appeared to be as i suggested a form of communications. i believe in was somewhere between 8:30 and 9:00 pm. we joked, kidded about the sightings, and then i suggested half jokingly \"why not try to make contact ?\"....I did. the main unit began a rapid descent, it seem to be on a direct line above our position, it came to a \"halt\" and from the center of the unit a \"light\" dropped. to my amazement after 3 or 5 possible seconds a second light sprung out of the initial one and again in a period of 3 to 5 seconds a third light came forth completely surrounding us. it was \"quiet\",\"warm\", \"safe\", \"soft\", unlike any light i have ever experienced or seen before or since. i never felt fear but rather a sense of security. time was \"lost\". i can't explain.It was about 11:30 when my wife standing on the top step from the garage back door asked \"when are you two coming in ?\"...Neither of us had any idea of where the time went. the entire \"known\" is what i stated and how more then 15 minutes to a 1/2 hour had passed i can't explain. my brother in law was frighten by it, still does not want to discuss it. it's been years now. i've already died once of a \"heart attack\" and just need to convey this \"happening\". i have absolutely no doubt that i was correct in my thought, that we could and can make contact with this \"unit\". it has a level of intelligence beyond anything we can imagine. the \"tracking\" unit is sensitive to voice and actually can detect one from \"space\". the \"light\" i will never forget, i could feel it. everything i'm relating here is true. i've talked about it from time to time and still don't fully understand \"why\" it all happened. i'm into my 60's now and i want \"others\" to

then preceeded to take him in.\r\n\r\ni was inside for a good 3 minutes before i realized that i needed to get something out of my mothers car that i left in it.  as i go outside, i am quite afraid of the dark and the night sky because of what might be up in the sky.  i happened to glance up and see a clear night with stars and a moon.. but out of my right eye, i saw something weird.. i looked up over the underground pentegon which is supposed to be this secret base hidden whith in a mountain side across the street from me.  \r\n\r\ni saw this light.  at first i thought its just an airplaine or something because we are near dullas and bwi.  i then also thought it might be a helecopter or a jet because of the president being at camp david.\r\n\r\nthen i noticed something different.  i used to watch alot of alien movies like close encounters by spielberg.  \r\n\r\nwhat i noticed was a light blinking.. it was whitish orange.. then it would flicker on and off much like what you would see on an airplaine wing.. but then after it flickered.. i saw some other lights flicker that resembled what looked like a frisby shaped round object.  \r\n\r\ni was in shock... it looked like it was big... but i coudent tell because of the distance between me and the object.  \r\n\r\nthe lights then flickered in a wave like pattern like blink... then the wave.. one will blink then the wave.. and it would hover over the mountain.. \r\n\r\ni counted what i saw to be about 12-15 lights in a circle.  it was not flat.. it was on an angle.  \r\n\r\nthe lights lasted for about a good 3 to 4 minutes before i saw it move.. it slowly moved hovering at a slow speed which is not normal for an aircraft because it would crash.  \r\n\r\nit was moving towards camp david which was south east of the underground pentegon.  i do not know if i was the only one who saw this but i know it was not normal.\r\n\r\nwe do get alot of low flying appachae helecopters in this area alot due to the nature of the secret government areas.\r\n\r\ni tried to record it but my cellphone was dead. it was half full but then i noticed it was dead.  when i went inside.. my mother said the power flickered on and off for a few seconds as well which was during the time i saw the moving object.  \r\n\r\ni have kept this to myself and told no one but i am now reporting it because i am watching your show on planet green realizing i need to let this story be heard.\r\n\r\nmy biggest fear is of an abduction by a ufo.  when i saw this.. my enitial reaction was i was scared.. afraid.. and did not know what to do..\r\n\r\ni lost site of the object as it disapeared over the mountains towards camp david.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:08:06","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional
