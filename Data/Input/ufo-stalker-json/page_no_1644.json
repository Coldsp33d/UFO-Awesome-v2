the corrections center were i work as a corporal . \r\nas i was checking on a officer working a gaurd staition outside we \r\nwere both looking up it was a very nice perfect night no wind around 72 temp no clouds and no moon . \r\nthen seen out of the black still night a triangle shape craft around 75 degrees up  appeared not moving fast at all . it was heading north towards ft worth texas coming from the south . \r\ni figure it was around 500ft to 1000ft away and around 4,000ft to 6,000ft up . it had dim rounded lights that could be seen very well one light inside the other  starting at the tip and working there way back for a set of 6 lights .As it moved north , i walked with it moving through the parking lot the parking lot lights will light up as you pass under them \r\n. so seen from above they are turning on one by one . \r\nthe craft started to pick up speed so i moved faster then it moved faster untill i was running about that time it just took off flat and level so fast as a blink of the eye . \r\nas i turned back to see the other officer was right with me we headed back to the gaurd station and there was a squad car stoped  the officer was out of his car asking if we were ok . he had seen us running through the parking lot thinking we were chasing some one . ya we were chasing somthing i said and told him what we had seen . he  was in disbelief\r\nat 1st then frustration like he had just lost the loto winning ticket.\r\nhe said ( we have been getting calls about that all evening ) . \r\nafter getting back inside and telling some other officers what we had seen \r\none officer said he herd people calling into disbatch . disbatch was \r\ndisbatching calls about suspicious activity in the skys . 3/24/12 3am . \r\nto get a grasp of its size do this take your index finger and thumbs and place them togther like a triangle shape and stretch out your arms . that craft was a little larger then that at around 4,to 6, ft up . \r\nmy guess is compearing its size to the building sizes it was passing over to be around 150ft to 200ft wide and 250ft to 300ft long no smaller then this only larger . and it made no sounds and moved more like it was slipping

i happened to look to my left (east) and i noticed three slow moving unusually bright lights that were white and had a super slow extended bright flash and did not have any other colored lights such as the red and green lights that you would see on aircraft, at first i thought that they were perhaps three large individual aircraft's like those double rotor helicopter but i quickly discounted that because they are extremely loud and there was no noise, (not to say that they don't) but in all the years that i've lived here i have never seen a double rotor helicopter fly at night. \r\n  i live directly under the flight path of the reno/cannon airport and am well versed with aircraft that comes and goes in a northeasterly direction. i would also like to mention that i cannot every remember seeing any aircraft travel in the area of the siting  especially at that altitude for that matter.  \r\n  i suddenly realized that whatever i was seeing appeared to be one object because they were moving together so perfectly, the lights were in a staggered or diagonal shape, the first light was about 500-1000 feet above the hills due east that make up the reno-sparks valley, then the second light was approximately 30 degrees up & behind the first and i give the same description for the third light in relation to the second light.\r\n  as mentioned the lights were perfectly spaced and never seemed to loose there spacing and the lights were not typical looking at all in that they were super bright and had a very slow or extended brightness and yet the lights seemed to stay lit unlike a strobe, i also noticed that the highest of the three lights didn't get brighter but maybe once, really strange.       \r\n\r\n  at this point i yelled out for a family member to \r\n\"come check this out!\" then with a serious amount of adrenalin running through me i quickly i bolted upstairs to get my video camera and of course by the time i got back downstairs it was barely visible through trees and the larger than usual high tension power lines that run down sullivan lane.    \r\n\r\n     \r\n \r\n\r\n ","distance":"Over One

inspection it was clear that the ring had equally spaced balls of blue light. after getting a few photos and for a minute or so the objects and the ring increased luminosity substantially. that did not last very long and after 20 minutes total it had faded away and i went back inside. about 10 minutes later my father told me that it was back. i went outside and observed the same ringlike formation and more glowing spots in the clouds much higher than the initial ring. within a minute or so another ring much higher above it had formed. this ring appeared to be made up of 6 seperate balls of light which seemed to be moving slowly and steadily in altitude and direction formed a semi circle. then 3 lights moved more east and the other 3 went west creating a gap and their positions appeared in tandum forming a (  ) pattern. all this time the original ring had reapearred and over the next few hours would dim out then randomly gain luminosity. sometimes there would be no change and appear to \"hover\" for up to 20 minutes before dimming or changing into unidentifiable formations. during form changes the light was too dim to effectively be caught on my camera. i walked a few blocks to get a better view and after a couple hours the objects seemed to form a pattern resembling a parachute with beams that went below my sight due to tree cover. all colors were either blue or blue with a hint of white. the beams of light appeared to be gathered at a cental ground point. this lasted about 10 minutes. the objects did not seem to me to be farther away but were dim during this time. my first reaction was \"did i just get duped by an elaborate light setup?\" i found this unlikely as this was the only period during which any illumination went towards the ground. the weather had a mild cloud cover. a short light rain began after witnessing the initial \"ring\" and stopped before the event ended. the lights appeared to move much higher in elevation and some would move farther outward from view. there was always a noticable central ring of at least 6-12 clearly seperate orbs. very shortly before the parachute formation with \"beams\" i watched a lower flying dual jet aircraft heading straight towards the objects parrarel to me but the same trajectory. the aircraft got to a close enough to think \"this is about to be interesting\" when it made an immediate 180 flew for  several seconds, made a right turn flying for a minute or so then another right. this aircraft clearly gave a wide berth to the objects. sometime between 330am and 339 the \"ring\" formation faded away completely. prior to this even when no orbs were visible and the ring had significantly faded out, the area of the clouds it had been stayed obviously illuminated to some degree. the maximum time between the \"fading\" before a \"fade in\" was no longer than 15 minutes. my camera was insufficiant to reliable capture anything other than when formed in a ring as any other activities reduced their lumination below the capability of my camera. there are a couple pictures that were able to capture the beginning of formation changing. albeit they are not that great.","distance":"Over

i can't really distinguish a real shape at all, seems to be constantly moving or changing or something. also no colours showed up in the pics, but did on video. it doesn't do anything except hover there so i went in after taking pics and put them on my computer, looked at them and wanted to get some more but the 'star' was gone 1/2 an hour after i initially saw it. i'm using a kodak easyshare

see if i could see  the   planetary \"show\"  the news was talking about.  i looked between two treetops  just gazing at the sky.  i ad not been able to see the planets because of the trees. so i was looking at the  open space between two trees where i knew the planets would not be, and wasn't thinking about anything beyond getting chores done.\r\n\r\nthen a light appeared slightly above the treeline  between the trees and it started slightly descending and moving south.  it looked like a closeup of a very tiny meteor falling, only the angle was  slight and the movement was slow.  the  \"meteor\"   went behind the trees and i could see it's brightness through them but then the  thickness  was such in the treeline  that i no longer saw it.   \r\n\r\ni remember thinking  what could that be?  it wasn't a firefly, they blink.  it wasn't a meteor, this was  low to the ground, and so slow.  but the trail behind it was just like that of a meteor.    i went to the street and knowing i could not see anything to the west from there i looked to the southeast.  all i noticed was an aircraft moving west, but it was too far away to tell what it was other than it was man-made and it was not the  thing i saw. \r\n\r\ni felt  a bit  frustrated at not knowing if the little object landed or hit the earth, and not knowing what it was..  other than that i felt nothing out of the ordinary.

airplanes, day and night, fly by. on march 25, 2012 me and my grandfather went out to walk our dog at 11:00 pm. when we turned around to head back at 11:10 pm, when i suddenly whirled around for no apparrent reason toward some trees of our neighbors and in the sky, over the mountains, about 5-10 miles away, 500-1000+ ft. up, were two very close together sets of lights at nearly a standstill, almost a hover. bear in mind, that at this distance, the object would have to have been very large, possibly a mile or more, since the lights were the distance apart of a golfball held at arm's length. \r\n\r\nfar to close for any airplanes to be together, which was what made me realize it was something very abnormal, and not any airplane. \r\n\r\nat their speed, they would have passed over us while we were running. they did not, however, they just seemed to appear where they were over the mountains as i turned around. then the lights slowly started accelerating away, mainating a perfect \"golfball's width at arm's length\" for about 2 minutes and 45 seconds. then, all of a sudden, the lights broke their distance, increased speed, and started rapidly descending for about 1 minute over the mounains until they disappeared, as if they had been found and did not want to be seen. \r\n\r\nas i witnessed the event, and afterward, i had this vague growing feeling that these lights were somehow connected or part of a larger object that was unseen. what compounded my belief that this was an actual ufo sighting was that i believe i saw 2 military aircraft fly overhead just before and after the sighting. all of the commercial and passenger airplanes that fly into bradley int'l airport all have yellow forward lights. these were the very first airplanes i have ever seen to have led forward lights. these craft were also flying significatly faster than any of the commercial or passenger planes that ply overhead. \r\n\r\ni have seen many airplanes pass over while i'm at work, and
