the right of the sighting. another sighting was reported on mufon here and there was video taken. i didn't because i was mesmerized and astonished. after about a minute the object disappeared into the distance as if it exited atmosphere or entered hazy atmosphere. this is my first ufo sighting and i am a skeptical. this was not the iss -- i checked. i can't explain what i saw.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

a.M , and i had been out to eat with friends for food and drinks. i have two dogs who stay primarily inside, however, they started barking at the den window as i watched t.V. and got ready for bed.  when i looked towards the den window, i noticed a beam, or what i thought may be someone with a flashlight behind my privacy fence because my house does back up to about 3/4 a mile of woods, and slightly back to the left, a family/neighborhood park. agitated, i went outside to try and find the culprit, when to my surprise, there was an illuminating, glowing sphere, about six feet above my privacy fence (from the ground, the \"orb\" was probably 14 feet above).  i watched in amazement as my dogs went stoic and didn't take their eyes off of it, then all of a sudden it seemed like it was trying to communicate with me by glowing brighter, then dimming, almost into disappearance.  i watched for minutes, then suddenly, one \"orb\" morphed into two! however, the original one acted as if it was the \"mother load,\" and stayed in front of the smaller one, trying to guide it almost.  it seemed as if they were feeding off one another for energy.  over a span of at least 20 minutes, they slowly, then more quickly, ascended towards the sky, and as they did you could hear them take off.  i added the fact that yes, i went out with friends for food and \"drinks\" because had i not recorded it, the next morning i wouldn't have believed what i had seen. the video does not lie and i assure you it is legitimate.  i am the least technologically saavy person ever!  just please take

west and was moving quite slow.  at one point it appeared to have moved in reverse.  it also appeared to change directions to the north, and then a few moments later, continued east, and we lost sight of the object.  the whole incident took 5-7 minutes.  i couldn't see any shape to the object due to it being dark, and not having any binoculars handy.  i did video the flashes on my phone, but its really not great video.\r\n\r\non 08/12/17 at approximately the same time, the object again appeared and flew in the same manner and direction, for approximately the same time.  this was also

thought i could see a small dim red light to the right of the white flash.  on the bright flash, it appeared to throw off an arc of light.  the object was traveling west to east as before.  this time

10-30 seconds each time. at first there seemed to be two seperate flashing lights but they were following an erratic positions in the sky. staying in one place then moving forward and back then sideways. the overall pattern was like two l's hooked together. i observed these light for what seemed like about 10 minutes. at about 5 minutes in to observing the lights, all of a sudden a large sized rectangular light bluish/white flashed in the area i was watching and went out. it only lasted a couple seconds. then went back to a single intermittent flashing white light. . the lights were very slow moving and erratic in its movements but after the lighted rectangular light flashed on and off it slowly moved straight east and then just disappeared. this incident still has me upset and unsettled. when i saw the large rectangular light flash, i almost ran inside my house because something was so weird about it and i couldn't tell for sure but looked like there was a dark black craft

super moon.  it was clear and the moon of course was bright.  i was facing the east and towards the front of my house with the street behind me. i looked up at the moon and then i raised my iphone up to take pictures. i kept seeing an extra \"spot\" of something shiny whenever i looked through the lens, but took the photos anyway. i looked at each photo after taking them to see if they were good to keep or delete. at first, i thought something was wrong with the camera or maybe the lens had something on it, because these extra lights were in the photos with the moon.  i went back inside to tell my husband that the moon looked great, but i kept seeing these extra spots that looked like orbs. i got a lens cleaning wipe and cleaned both sides of the phone even though i was only using the front facing lens. then i thought that maybe the streetlight was somehow interfering with the photos, even though it was behind me and not centered in front of my house but past it and my driveway.\r\ni began taking pictures a little before 7:00 pm and went in and out of the house to finish dinner and cleaning up the kitchen, etc. i took about 17 pictures with the first one time stamped at 6:57 pm and my last one at 9:16.  i also went into my backyard on the stairs to the upper porch and had the back lights off so it would be darker.\r\ni took more photos facing east/southeast and the orb/sphere showed up again in the photos.  for some reason, i couldn't see this thing with the naked eye, but it would appear in the photos.  at one point, i was told it could be \"lens flare\" which doesn't mean anything to me. &#9786;&#65039;\r\ni did notice the sphere would be in different places in photos taken seconds or a minute apart.\r\nthere are a  total of 17 photos with the orb appearing in 11 or 12 of them. some of the photos have what appears to be smudges of different colors or streaks for lack of a better description.\r\ni thought the blue sphere looked so cool, especially when it looked like it was a little planet orbiting the moon!  i hope you can analyze the photos and let me know if it was something or just nothing.
