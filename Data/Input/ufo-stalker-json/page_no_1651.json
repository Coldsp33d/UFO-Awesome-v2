one of them was particularly bright - about a quarter of the size of venus and about half as bright. it attracted my attention as it was sort of strobing - going from white to blue to white to blue. as i watched, it moved in what looked like a circular pattern.\r\ni rubbed my eyes, thinking i was seeing things, but it moved again - this time in an irregular circular pattern, and the movement was definite, as i could guage it from the edge of the tree silhouette outside.\r\nthinking it may be something to do with the window glass, i rushed outside and confirmed that it was moving from time to time.\r\ni had a sighting just a month previously (fortunately witnessed by my wife) and had not managed to take a photo of that one, so i rushed inside and got my digital camera, zoomed to its maximum and got two shots of it. the image is unfortunately so small as to be virtually useless as the object was approximately 20km away (near as i could tell, but that may be incorrect).\r\nit's height was around 45 degrees from the horizon, bearing plus minus north, north east (i checked my compass).\r\nmy first thought was that it was a star, and because it was low on the horizon, it was being severely distorted and giving the illusion of moving, but then i noticed a star just near it that was not moving at all!\r\nmy second thought was maybe it was an aircraft, as it was hovering above the approximate position of the durban airport - the trouble with that theory is that it maintained its position for over an hour!\r\nthen i saw what i can only describe as an 'auroric' effect, starting about 5km from the object, contracting in to the object. this only happened once. directly after this, i saw 'incoming' golden orbs streaking in from about a 10km radius to the object, and then from the object away from it and disappearing at about the same distance. i saw lots of them and lost count at 41.\r\nthese orbs came in towards and out of the object at all angles or directions.\r\nthe object did strange irregular manauvers at irregular intervals every minute or two.\r\nat 4:31am it dimmed suddenly to a tiny speck for a minute or so, and then returned to its original brightness. i searched for any sign of clouds, but could see none. it should be noted that being near the sea, there is a lot of humidity, so there is a chance there was some fine cloud that i could not observe that may have obscured it momentarily, but it only happened once, so i have my doubts it was cloud.\r\nat exactly 4:44 it moved up to about 22,000 feet - that is about 2,000 feet from its original position. this was a marked change in altitude, and put away my thoughts of it being a star affected by atmospheric interference completely. please remember these distances i have quoted are suspect, as it was difficult to guage any sort of distance in relation to the object, which was too far to make out if it had any particular form or not.\r\nat 5:03am it faded into nothingness and did not reappear.\r\nduring this time i took my telescope outside, but the objects movements were such that i could not track it or get a decent view of it - the telescope is not of high quality, and of the type used for casual lunar observation.\r\ni was quite critical of my thinking during this time as i had seen a very clear ufo about a month previously (also reported on this site), and thought i may be experiencing some sort of 'ufo' fever - where one starts to imagine that any and everything one sees in the sky is suspect. hence the included thoughts i had of what it could rationally be.\r\nnevertheless, the observation does not add up to anything rational, and i think there is a real chance it was a craft of sorts, but i cannot truly say if it was.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"01:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":36732,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-29.805469010747583,"location":null,"logNumber":"ZA-03252012-0019","longitude":30.93785483519285,"occurred":1332414300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"KwaZulu-Natal","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1332716045000,"summary":"Star like -

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On saturday, march 24, 2012, i was visiting with 3 friends in the ahwatukee foothills village neighborhood of phoenix. in the evening, 3 of the 4 of us made a fieldtrip to a convience store to replenish refreshmints, while the 4th stayed behind to watch children. at 7:38 pm, while i and 2 of these friends were walking southbound on 48th street, south of chandler blvd and north of frye road, we observed several orange-red lights in the sky. the lights were low on the horizon and formed a diagonal pattern. this pattern was highest on the east at approximately 35 degrees elevation and sloped down at an angle of approximately 45 degrees. in all, 6-8 individual lights were in this formation. these lights moved together from west to east at a low rate of speed. as we continued to watch these lights, i pulled up my phone to get video.\r\n\r\nwithin seconds of this initial sighting, i and one of my friends noticed multiple additional lights lower on the horizon and further to the west. first we saw 2 lights, then a third. afterward, more lights continued to appear behind and to these. the newer lights did not move in a tight formation but rather were jumbled and appeared to be moving in different directions, ascending, descending, approaching, and going. while we watched the new lights, i continued to fumble with my phone.\r\n\r\neventually, i got my phone to begin recording, and i moved forward, walking into the shadow of some trees, out of the glaring streetlights. meanwhile, my friends stayed behind. one called his girlfriend, who had stayed behind in the apartment while we had made our fieldtrip to the convience store. as i walked forward into the darkness, more lights emerged. i could see at least 4 additional lights higher in the sky than any of the others. these were to the west of the diagonal formation and above the second cluster. like the second group, these lights did not move in a synchronized manner.\r\n\r\nafter seeing these, i darted across the street and continued further down the road to see more. then i observed a smaller group of what appeared to be 3 lights at a similar height but off to the east side of the diagonal. upon making this observation, i noted that a woman who was jogging down the road had stopped about 100 yards south of my position and was also observing the sky. meanwhile, traffic continued to pass by without the drivers seeming to notice our behavior (or at least not stopping in response). \r\n\r\nthe lights on the east side appeared to be moving to the west but also away from me, to the south. however, lights low on the horizon, on the west side of the group, were clearly moving from west to east at a higher rate of speed (at least relative to my perspective). the lights in the diagonal formation appeared stationary or moving away (south). the lights high and to the west were moving from west to east before possibly turning more to the south. i say this, because the lights eventually faded or turned away.\r\n\r\nafter i had crossed over the street and observed the 3 lights on the eastern side, i noted the movements of the lights and returned to my friends. as i was having no luck getting the lights to show on my camera phone, i was hoping my friends were more fortunate. while i was returning to them, i witnessed most of the lights fading or turning away from me. however, a few of them initially continued on their west to east track before appearing to either turn to the south or disappear (possibly behind a mountain). i followed one in particular which was the brightest. it lingered until i was very close to my friends and finally blinked out right before my eyes.\r\n\r\nin all, i believe i saw approximately 18 lights moving around the sky. what we saw did not seem to fit with anything that any of us had seen before. these lights did not match the videos of the original phoenix lights. the lights were potentially over the barry goldwater range but may also have been north of there. from our position we could not tell if they were over the estrella mountains or further south. if the lights were over the range, the aircraft we saw were presumably flying high enough for us to see them over the estrella mountains and/or any other mountains between us.\r\n\r\nthese objects weren't following any of the usual airline traffic patterns and did not have the same lights as commercial aircraft. we could see other aircraft coming in to approach phoenix skyharbor internation airport and other regional airports at the time of this sighting, and these lights were in a very different area, displaying different colors, and behaving very differently.\r\n\r\nthe lights did not behave like military jets or helicopters i have observed, and i did not see navigation lights or strobes. given that we did see the orange-red lights, the activity did not appear to be a \"lights-out\" exercise.\r\n\r\nthese objects also did not behave like meteorites.\r\n\r\nwe know there is a major sailport in the area near estrella mountain. this sailport is popular for skydiving and may have been used for a night jump. along the same line, people also enjoy driving or even hiking to high points in south mountain regional park to parasail. however, these lights lingered for more than 8 minutes, and several moved directly from west to east under their own power. \r\n\r\nat this time, the most likely explanations i have involve aircraft and flares. we may have seen a military exercise in the distance over the goldwater range. perhaps atmospheric conditions distorted our perception of the color and behavior of the aircrafts' and flares' lights. we may have seen a semi-organized aerial caravan of reverse snowbirds flying south for the summer. we may have seen a spoiled group of television labcoats testing eccentric theories for recreating the original phoenix lights.\r\n\r\nunfortunately, neither i nor either of my friends seem to have had any luck capturing them on film. however, i have not tried enhancing my video file, so i would be willing to give that a go. hopefully, someone else saw something tonight and can shed some light on this event. i am sure there is a good explanation to what was up there. whatever it was, it was interesting to watch.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:08:27","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path

passing deskins motors, a dodge, jeep dealership on the left side of the 4 lane highway. i was looking at cars on the lot as i was driving by and my wife told me to look up in the air. when i did i saw at least 8 white/yellow glowing orbs in the sky about what i would guess to be at least 500 to 1000 feet in the air at about what i would guess to be about 1/2 mile away. they were in a random pattern but were grouped together loosely. two of the orbs were moving in a slow counter clockwise motion and a couple more were moving slowly up and down. the rest were hovering. i pulled the car over on the side of the 4 lane and my wife and i got out of the car to look. i am 45 years old and never have seen anything like this. i thought at first the lights were search lights on helicopters but they were closes enough to make noise enough to be heard. the circular pattern the orbs were moving in were too fast to be done smoothly by a helicopter. this display lasted about 5 minutes then the orbs moved into a stacked formation and slowly ascended one after the other into the low cloud cover and we could no longer see them. i never reported this to anyone else except friends because it occurred on 9/11/11 and i could not say if they were some kind of aircraft. i really believe these were not aircraft due to the manuevers these orbs were making so smoothly. my wife and i are not seeking attention we would just like an explanation or to know if we were the only ones who saw this. my wife said others pulled off and looked but i do not remember this because i was a little shaken and still am. i always thought i would be less disturbed because i grew up in florida and have seen rocket launches to the moon while i was growing up.

sky. at first i thought it had to be venus because of its location in the sky to the left of our front porch, but it was pulsing randomly, getting extremely bright and then fading away to blackness before coming up again. there were storms off to the front of the house in the distance, and the sky in the area of the light was relatively clear, with some patchy clouds passing over. the light was so bright that it had no problems shining straight through the clouds where the stars around it appeared dim and were covered completely when the clouds passed over. i also noticed a couple of times that as it grew brighter, there seemed to be projections that came off of it. it looked a lot like the plumes you might see coming up off of the sun, so i thought for sure it had to be some celestial/planetary body and the reason for the pulsing was because of atmospheric disturbances. i stayed out on my front porch watching it for some time while my husband took some 30-second time lapse shots on his nikon d80. at one point, a plane passed above the object. there were definitely no other lights on the light i was seeing as on a plane. the orb was definitely a ways off, but its position was well above the trees where i could see it clearly. it kept pulsing that way for a while before i went back inside. about 20-30 minutes later i got curious and went back out to find that it was gone. i called my husband out and as we stood looking for it, we realized that it wasn't gone. it had simply moved to a new location. it was now just visible through the top of the big pine tree to the left of our house. it had previously been well above the top of that tree and was perceptibly moving around. this was when i really started to wonder exactly what it could be...I haven't gone back out to see if it is there or whether or not it has simply moved, but i'm wondering if there is anyone else in our area who saw it as well. maybe it's a meteor given the fact that it moved to another location? i'm really not sure. can't say for sure that it's intelligent, but it's definitely strange.\r\n\r\nyou can zoom in on the photo and see that the trail of the object does not move in the same direction as the stars around it. the trail actually changes direction in many of the photos that were taken, this was just a sample shot. i hope to get more of them side by side so that the movements might be tracked.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional
