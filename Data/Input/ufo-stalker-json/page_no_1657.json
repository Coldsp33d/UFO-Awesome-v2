oh its probably a car. no.. there are no roads up there, then i started to look at the lights reflection on the face of the lake, which was like a mirror. i could then determine that the light was not on the hill , but rather hovering in front of the hill, hovering over the water with the hillside behind it.At this point your mind goes thru all the normal deductive reasoning and very quickly. oh, its just an airplane, answer, no, its hovering and its not making a sound. i could not see  a shape becaus eof the brightness of the white light emanating from it. it did seem to pulse a little and there did seem to be some smaller bluish or reddish  lights emanating from it at times, but i can't be entirely sure.  it did seem to hover with some sort of cross like movement, a little up a little down a little side to side. judging by the surrounding terrain which was very visible in the moonlight it was somewhere in size between a car and a small house. back to deductive reasoning. oh it's just a helicopter of some sort. no there is absolutely no sound and i would surely be hearing a motor and the whop whop of helicopter blades over water here. i have heard them before. it is hovering and soundless!!  at this moment the thought or possible realization kicks in that i may have called this thing and it may be looking at me with all the intent with which i am studying it. it is there for me to see it as i asked. i immediately start to become very very afraid, almost a paralyzing fear. at that moment it is as if this thing read my emotions almost immediately and responded with lateral movement to the left. for the first 1 to 2 seconds it moved slowly for the next 1 to 2 seconds it gathered speed as fast as a jet, and the its speed exploded for want of a better word and  faster than you can repeat 'oh my god i watched going into a terrain following pattern  curving and dashing over the hillside to the left for a distance of about 25 miles until it dissappeared overhe top of a small mountain still flying low along the terrain. i'm talking about 25 miles in 3 to 4 seconds. no more! i  was out of my mind i ran up to the house and woke up all my family but it meant little to them. they didn\"t see it. i was not drinking at all or using any kind of drugs. i defintely was not sleeping and dreaming. it scared me very much. and then became my wonderful little sanecret. at times my mind still doesn't believe what happened. but a careful reality check says, yes it did. i do not consider myself to be psychic or have much of any special powers, but yes there have been other types of telepathic occurrences in my life. i still don't believe it but i called this thing and it did appear, read my emotions, my fear,and left it did exist and its motion showed intelligence not an anomoly. i have told this story to a few people, but it is just one of those things people don't really know what to do with. sometimes i don't know what to do with it but file it away as inexplicable.I am not a liar and i am not making any of this up or exagerating. it is the truth as i lived it that is all i can say.Needless to say, from this,  i have an interest in u.F.O.S but i have not followed any magazines or articles to date. i don't know of anyone who has had a like experience and i still have difficulty believing in abductions and crop circles. i am not obsessed or possesed by ufos. a footnote to reality.Approximtely 18 years later i ran intob an bairforce colonel of the 6th u.S. fighter squadron. who confirmed for me among other technology things that yes on that hot august night he and his squadron were called to scramble after three unidentified aircraft over mount konokti,. when they got there they saw three glowing orbs hovering near the mountain. they kicked in after burners to pursue and engage and these three orbs took of straight up until they dissapeared at such a fantastic speed it was as if the f15. were standing still. he told me much more in a night of comeradery and drinking. i cannot tell it all here. suffice it to say yes they do exist. he has been very close to them in the cosmos and has no fear of them because there technology is so advanced that an f15 wouldn't stand a chance, but they never attack. he has actually seen the craft.I could still probably find and identify this guy again. he must be retired by now. but i don't know if he would ever talk again. you can contact me if you feel my experiences are important. otherwise i will probably never contact you with this again. i'm 62 years old and going in for heart surgery in about three days. just wanted someone to know.

back yard to throw the recyclables in the bin at exactly 8:37 pm. i was taliking on my cellphone to my sister, and happened to look up at how clear the stars were around the orion system, procyon, sirius, and betelgeuse, which form a upside down triangle in the sky with sirius at the bottom point, procyon at the left top and betelgeuse at the right top, but this time i saw a bright star flash on then off just about in the geometric center of the triangle.\r\nthe flash is as bright as procyon and betelgeuse, not as bright as sirius. it remains on for a fraction of a second about a half a second. it does not flash like a camera flash, but phases in rapidly, then phases back out. i am a life long boater and know how a lighthouse flashes. it's exactly like a light house or airport white flash. but seems to be in orbit above the earth.\r\nthe flashes are timed exactly four minutes apart, i drew a chart of the constellations. i noticed, however as the time went by the flash moved toward the east over the hour, in relations to the tri-star triangle, away from orion. but in relations to the earth and my backyard was stationary. it seems to be geosynchronised with earth rotation and only appeared to be moving as the earth rotates toward the east, leaving the orion system and the tri-star triangle further west in the sky. by 9:18 on march 7th it stopped flashing and it's last flash put it below and left of procyon well outside of the tri-star triangle.\r\nthursday, i did not make an attempt to see it as i worked super late. but friday march 9th, 2012 at 8:20 i got home from work and looked in the same geometric center of the tri-star triangle and sure enough, the flash was back, timed at 4 minute intervals, till about 9:28, then stopped flashing. again it was geosynchronuos with earth and appeared to be moving slowly due east from orion's belt, 15%-22% east of the orion system.\r\nagain tonight saturday 10th of march, it's back like clock work after some lingering clouds blew out.\r\ni also over the past couple of nights called a friend to have him go out and look with my cell phone as we both saw the flashes at the same time and we live about 15 miles apart. \r\ni also got our neighbor sandy to see it last night. my wife as well as my 8 year old daughter also saw it.\r\ni have a detailed chart drawn up with the complete times for wednsday

object on multiple nights. too dark to be sure until one night when moonlight was in position to cast a shadow on what appeared as a 5-story down-pointing arrowhead shaped object made of multiple metal plates. spent many hours over the next few days between 11-5 and 11-17-2011 trying to find it, see it or see it better. on 11-18-2011 as it was getting pretty dark out, i walked out my backdoor which faces west and observed a huge glowing, semi-transparent object that looked identical to a 'standard' jellyfish. including the same natural swimming motions. except for instead of a ocean jf's stringy type 'tails', this ufo had 5 or 6 wildly kicking tentacles identical to a 'standard' ocean-dwelling octopus. absolutely the most unbelievable thing i could ever hope to see after 50 years of life. i was most-likely in shock as i observed it for the first 2 or so minutes. after trying to see something for weeks and then finally see something even crazier, i wasn't totally surprised. but in hind site, i wasn't thinking clearly. a camera/camcorder didn't even enter my mind (???). luckily, at one point i told myself, \"you need another witness\". i went to one of two apartments behind my house and told my neighbor linda vance, i needed her to witness a real ufo. when she followed me out to near my backdoor i turned to her with my back to the object. i pointed to the sky behind me and asked her. \"what does that look like to you?\" she looked up passed me and stated, \"a jellyfish\". i don't know why, but i was so relieved to hear he say that. it was like years of pressure was lifted off of my shoulders. but i'm not sure why. later, i remember telling myself we observed the object for 9 minutes total. but i actually don't recall many of the details of the last few minutes of viewing other than linda went back in fairly quickly as it was unbelievably cold during that november in so california and she wasn't dressed for it. since that 11-18-2011 observation, i haven't seen either object. the jellyfish or the arrowhead shaped ufo. i've found some related info and video on the internet but i plan to keep looking skyward for new sightings whenever i can. i now keep a charged camera with 24/7, too. just in case.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:09:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Appendage(s),  Other,

orlando florida to go to disney world and to visit friends. it was between 8:30 and 9:30am, it was a beautiful sunny morning, no clouds in the sky. we stopped at a waffle house to have breakfast. my mom brought her rottweiler with her, so after i finished eating i went out to the car alone to give the dog some food and water. i stood there petting her, not in a rush to be near my mother's friend's kids. that is when i saw a strange bright light in the reflection of the driver's side window, so i turned to look at the buildings across the street (i'm sorry i don't remember what buildings they were, or even what street we were on.)  that is when i saw this object hovering above the buildings across the street. the light was not actually a light, but the sun reflecting off the surface of the object. it looked like glass but the reflection was bright enough that it was not transparent, on the top and bottom of the object it looked like gold. and the top came to a point, with the bottom flattish round, a little flatter than the bottom of an egg. the first thing that came to my mind was it looked a bit like willy wonka's glass elevator floating there. (the 1971 movie) it also looked to be about the same size as the glass elevator. maybe 12 to 14 feet tall and between 7 and 8 feet wide. i stood there for 4 or 5 minutes staring at it. there was absolutely nothing holding it up, it was hovering a good 20 or 30 feet above the tallest building (which was about as high as a 2 or 3 story building. i also noticed that the building across the street from the building it was hovering over was about a six story building and it had a mirrored glass surface so i could see the objects entire reflection from the side angle. for as long as i was looking at it, it never moved, and i didn't hear any noise coming from it. i heard only cars passing. i looked around in the parking lot to see if anyone was seeing what i was seeing, but the dog and i were the only ones in the lot, and the waffle house's windows didn't face the street. i didn't want to stop looking at it, i was afraid to let it out of my sight. but i also wanted my mom to see it, so i ran as fast as i could back inside to where they were sitting and told my mom to come with me outside, right now, that it was really important. it took her about a minute to get out of the booth because her friend had to move out of her way. all in all i was away from the parking lot for maybe 2 to 3 minutes tops. when we got back outside it was gone, we looked everywhere there were still no clouds anywhere and no trace of the object. i told my mother what it had looked like, she believed me, even though she hadn't seen it herself. even though it has been such a long time ago that it happened, and i was just a young girl, i can still picture exactly what it looked like in my head, and it is something i will never forget.     \r\n\r\ni really would like to know if anyone has ever seen anything similar to what i saw that morning. i have watched stories about ufo's and alien documentaries and have read people's testimonies and have looked at as many photos of sightings that i can find and have never seen anything like what i saw. i could sketch it (well) but i have no way to scan it to attach the file. if you would like me to send a detailed sketch in the mail i can. please feel free to contact me in any way.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":36359,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.5395955,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03102012-0002","longitude":-81.3752065,"occurred":618597000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Bullet,   Missile,   Egg,   Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1331371265000,"summary":"Glass egg-shape (up-right egg-shape) with gold on the top and bottom the glass was almost white or silvery from the sun reflection looked a little like willy wonka's glass elevator from the 1971 movie","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":8249,"locationName":"Orlando, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:11005"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop, Unknown","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was watching tv at approximately 11:00 pm eastern standard. when i noticed a extremely bright sparkling light north north western sky. at tree height level from my view point. i viewed object for 10 minutes before getting my brother in law to view the object as well. i woke my wife as well to watch. we grabbed the binoculars and saw the object was 4-5 lights obviously manufactured not natural. the object started to change configuration form a circular pattern to a linear one.Either moving away or losing altitude slowly the object abruptly changed direction to the north and moved away in a deliberate matter. my brother in law felt this was at a significant speed, i felt it was more slow rolling. i was using the binoculars at the time.\r\nwe live on a river with an island between us and the other shore. this island is fully wooded and was the tree line that we observed the object over.

passing the avondale blvd. exit and approaching the dysart road exit in goodyear, az, i noticed many, many lights in the sky through the windshield. initially, i thought it was planes preparing to land as there is the goodyear airport nearby. they were orangish and moving slowly in some sort of formation from south east direction, above our car on the i-10 and headed north west direction. however, the sheer number of them (about 30 to 50) made me doubt my aeroplanes' assumption. the lights were blinking sporadically. i yelled for the driver to pull over especially when i noticed a number of other vehicles pulled over to the side and some occupants gazing into the sky. the driver pulled over just before the litchfield road exit and we witnessed the lights keep travelling north west. however, when they seem to cross the i-10 and approach the 303 (as i assumed), they would just disappear - as if someone turned the lights off. there was no sound except for the traffic on the freeway and my screaming.\r\nas the driver and i stood by the parked car on the freeway watching the lights move and slowly disappear, my companion noticed a bunch of lights on the east horizon. i tried convincing him that it was a bunch of planes circling and preparing to land at the sky harbor airport. however, it was more than i had ever seen at other times - about 15 of them. that second set of lights just seemed to hover, in no particular formation. this second set had more of white glow to the lights. suddenly, one of the lights grew very,very bright the dimmed to look like the rest.\r\ni kept watching for some more of the first set of orange lights and saw a couple follow the path of the previous ones and just like those before them, they disappeared suddenly just before approaching the white tank mountains. some few more minutes passed then saw another couple of orange lights - flying in tandem and follow the same path then disappear by the white tank mountains.\r\ni got confused. i was not sure whether to be scared or happy i had seen something unique. screamed a couple more times then got in our vehicle and drove away when i could not seem to see anymore at the time.\r\nas we continued driving west, noticed a number of planes (about 3) heading east - like they normally seem to do in a bid to land at sky harbor airport. usually i see one, then an interval before the next one(s). this time, it looked as if they had been waiting. i got the impression that they were waiting for some 'traffic' to clear before proceeding.\r\nstill not sure whether to get

ground.Angle pond grove.  where we camped seasonally for many years, i was 13 going on 14. it was a week night either wednesday or tuesday.  i was walking on the beach going to the restrooms and heard what sounded like a million crickets. the noise increased to quite loud, then over the pond a large craft was hovering about 100 ft above the pond i was on the beach with several people including my parents, sister and about 12 other people who where staying over on the weeks days. it looked like two saucers put together with a dome over the top the craft had a lot of bright lights around the middle and top and bottom primarily red green, blue white lights. it hovered above the pond for quite a while. then the cricket sound became quite loud and the craft took off to the right in the blink of an eye. incredible it was there then not. i did not think much time had past. but when we walked back to the trailer it was 3:30 am about 3  and a half hours had passed. my uncle who was a 32 year navy man witnessed this also. all he would say was it was unidentified. most of the people did not talk about this event. i think it must be rare for almost a whole family to witness this. all that summer there were several siteings around that area. i think i was on the ship. i remember asking someone about where they came form. the individual showed a map on the wall, i think a like a tv screen, he pointed out the location, i remember he got upset that i did not know the star chart. i told him that in school we were not taught this. i also wanted to go with them but told no, i was crushed that is what i recall the most. i do not recall what they looked like, but they liked that i was very inquisitive.I may have jumped around a bit i apologize it was 39 years ago. both my parents are still alive my uncle has past on. thanks for a forum to unload this info.  call me if you would like further verification 617 889 0996","distance":"101-500

force 21 years. we picked my grandmother up at the minot airport, she came in on the last flight.  we headed home to lonetree, nd and we were on county rd 10 and my grandmother noticed a light in the sky an she said \"oh look another plane coming in for landing\", that was it for that subject and we were driving and about two miles before deslacs,nd my grandmother said \"is that the same plane that was coming in for a landing?\" then we all joked that it was a ufo but as we were getting closer we noticed it was not moving and then we stopped laughing. the object had a white bright light in the middle and one red light on the left and two red lights on the right, they were not blinking. my dad said\"should i signal it\" and my mom said \"no just drive\" my dad signaled it anyways with his high beams and all the lights went off except the one little red light. i remember seeing bars of light in the back of the object looked like about three rows of long 8 feet or so florescent lights. my sister says she remembers seeing the underneath of it. we called the mafb flight control tower and they said no planes were in the area, ward county sheriff department came out and asked us questions and went to look for it. we don't know who called the sheriff department because it wasn't us.","distance":"21-100

was sitting by the edge of the water watching the sun starting to set sometime after 8:30 pm, i thought it looked beautiful behind the outline of the mountains and the tree line to the side, walked back to my campsite to get my digital camera then walked back to the lake's edge, the sun was already very low in the horizon and was able to take  one photograph, i didn't like the way it turned out so i try to adjust the camera settings, i took to long, by the time i was ready to take the next photo, the sun had disappeared in the horizon. still i could see the outline of the mountains and trees and decided to take some photos anyway, it was getting dark quick to where i could see a couple of stars high in the sky but couldn't see anything else besides darkness.\r\ni did not see the object shown in the photographs, when i first looked at the photos in the camera's viewer, i assumed it was a star and didn't give it another thought. i upload the photos to my computer a few days later and that's when i realized that it was not a star or the moon or anything i've ever seen in the sky. i don't know what i photographed and would like your opinion. when i zoom in the object appears to be moving, it has a disk-like shape and other features. using the mountains below the object as a point of reference, the object appears to have travel a great distance within seconds.\r\ni don't know what it was and i'm hoping that you might be able to identify the object.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":36349,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":46.05733,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03092012-0010","longitude":-122.299619,"occurred":1311652200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1331339313000,"summary":"Invisible
