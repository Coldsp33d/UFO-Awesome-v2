before i started 12th grade in high school.\r\nlast night was simular to that in some aspects except they did not land as far as know. the first time i ever saw a ufo it landed in the field behind our house. we lived in a lonely location so much so that if a car was comming our way we knew they were comming to see us or they were lost. my father who goes to bed early just about night had gotten up for some reason, bathroom break or something. he spotted the ufo out the window of his beadroom. he screamed for us to get out of bed, that we had to leave imediatelly with out bothering to get dressed or anything he ran out the door and started the car. my father was not a loud person, he was mostly in his home life soft spoken and did not get upset all that much. but that night he was screamming at the top of his lungs shocking all of us in the house. as we left the yard and headed up the hill i looked toward the back of the house and in the field behind the house a large football shaped object sat. it was bright and glowing in a orange color. a person could see trees lighted behind it and bushes and the ground in front of the object was lighted up. at the time i saw it, it was not moving. my father drove us and the car into the nearest town shouting at the top of his lungs there was a uf0 in the backyard and he wanted to leave before they abducted us. my father was a minister and well educated, eaning his master degree in greek and hebrew a few months before. my dog, a german shepherd would not come out from under of the house for three days it took us forever it seemed like to calm our horse penny, and she was not an excitable horse. when we finally returned home the ufo had left. \r\nlast night i went outside to take my dog for a walk, i looked up scanning the horizon which i do escpecially on a clear cloudless night. it was then i screamed. as i was looking up i observed 10 ufos hanging in the sky over my head. they were, all except one, in a diamond pattern. for ease of discription i will describe it like a baseball diamond giving the positions in those terms if thats alright. the two largest objectss were at second base and home plate. there were 7 smaller but they were like the larger objects white in color. these craft spread out from third base past the pitchers mound all the way over to first base. the diamond shaped formation as far as i know was stationary. they were with the larger crafts in a north south position with smaller craft from left to right. the local ufo that i have mentioned in previous reports in the last few days was positioned in the east next to the moon. the others were west of the moon and east of the horizion. i have lived in this area since 1991 and have never before have seen anyting like what i saw last night and i have observed many differnet craft but had never seen anything like that. the two larger objects appeared to be firing white beams of lights at each other, and one was hit they became brighter in color. the smaller craft ranged accross the middle seemed too reflect the light toward the other craft. i am not sure what the purpose for the smaller craft were to tell you the truth. i went into the house trying to get my husband to go and look but he had already seen it. i have never been so scared in my life. i dont know why they were fighting (theyve been fighting all week on and off) but i had never seen anyting this aggressive out of either of the objects. i dont know long to tell you the truth this had been going or how much longer it lasted. we got up this morning to a cloudy sky so you could not see this formation anymore. i tried to report this sighting last night. i could not. my computer refused to come as if it had no power even though i knew it did. i have an older computer that i finially got to come on but the statlite dish internet was down, my phone did not work and the police scanner was all messed up. it was though the ufos were jamming every thing so i could not report this sighting and they were determined to do it. it was later on this morning before my computer was finially back to normal, thankfully there was no permanent damage to anything. i was glad because i do not have the money to replace any of it. it looked like there was a trail of gas between the objects but it might have been my imagination.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"12:28:28","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":36314,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.595944,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03072012-0016","longitude":-93.9577551,"occurred":1331101800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Chevron,

place in a rural area approximately 8-miles south of the town of rainier oregon at 10 pm in the evening while the two of us were walking along a country road that led towards mayger oregon.\r\n\r\nhowever, our being taken was not remembered other than as a fragmented event until 1987 when the two of us again met up at a wake being held for my mother. upon seeing me across the room the other man simply stated, \"do you remember when we lit up\"? that is when we were first able to talk about our being taken with others. more of the event was learned in 2007 when i was hypnotically regressed by a therapist for ptsd and the event was what came to mind and not any event during the vietnam war.\r\n\r\nsince then the other man has told me that when our bodies lit up with a white light that covered us from head to tow but not other nearby objects he said that he was able to see my entire skeleton and it scared the hell out of him. \r\n\r\nafter we were released i did see a large fan type structure that glowed with a blue light which was similar in intensity and hue to the shaft of light that was used to bring the two of us up into the ship.","distance":"20

bright white fixed light hovering just below the ridge-line. it was low enough that at 1st glance, i thought maybe it was just a light from a home or building on the ridge. i then noticed the light wasn't fixed to part of any structure, & that it was moving very slowly towards my location; i sat in my car  at the gas pump to watch the light as it sort of drifted slowly, & effortlessly closer to my position. it moved closer & closer very lazily, to reveal 2 flashing lights (slightly varying in color, sort of off-white & amber; [note] they were not apparent upon initially seeing the aircraft) on it's right side. i couldn't make out a shape at that time, & i assumed that it was just a helicopter, as the altitude seemed too low for an airplane. i rolled down my windows (from cracked to fully open) to see if i could hear any engine noise, there was absolutely no sound; the gas station wasn't busy, so there was no obstruction in my ability to hear it if there were. as i said before, the craft was at very low altitude. as the craft flew (almost) directly over head, it's shape & characteristics became obvious; it was distinctively triangular, & the wing span was at-least double the size of any airplane i've ever seen. there was a singular bright fixed lights on it's nose, a bright amber light in the dead center, 2 flashing lights at the tip of each wing (or where the wings should've been). the craft drifted listlessly, moving as if it were underwater, & as i was observing, it sort of banked slightly to reveal it's underside, & effortlessly flew turned vertically w/a wing pointed towards the sky, & a wing pointed to the ground. it maintained this maneuver for only a short period of time, however it was able to perform it w/an ease that seemed highly unusual. each of these lights that formed this triangular shape were very vivid & not characteristic of any standard aircraft i'm familiar w/. i felt the urge to get out of the car & alert it to the attention the few people around outside, however no1 was paying any attention, nor did the seem like they'd be interested, & my shyness/fear of embarrassment wouldn't allow me to speak up to point it out. i noticed it was flying towards an area i was familiar w/, so i decided to follow it. i lost sight of it as i was making a u-turn in the parking lot to head in it's direction, & as tried to relocate the object, it had completely disappeared. i don't know if i just lost track of it, or what, but the direction it was moving, along w/the apparent speed & size, plus the fact it only took 20 seconds or so to turn around & pull out of the parking lot, i felt like i should've been able to relocate it w/ease, but it was nowhere to be found. it was disappointing to lose track, however it was exhilarating to be

looked up to look at the stars. at first glance i thought it was an airplane flying extremely high. it was approaching a star so i could see that it was moving, then i noticed the flashing lights that i thought were wing lights on a plane. the object then slowed to a stop, stayed there for a few seconds then continued north for a few seconds, then it changed direction as if it had bounced off of something, moved south east for a couple of seconds slowly changed direction again back towards north west. it continued starting and stopping making slight changes of direction while slowly making its way north. at one point it was almost directly overhead. during this time a few planes passed trough the same airspace, it was more than obvious this was not a plane. the types of flashes on the planes were completely different and the planes had what looked like green and red lights and white lights that also did not flash. this object had one orange light on one \"corner\" on the other two \"corners\" it had flashing strobe type lights that seemed to fire off in 3 bursts at a time per light. from the bottom it appeared to be a triangular shaped object, but since it was dark out and the object was dark with no ambient light seeming to hit it or reflect off of it, it was difficult to be sure of the shape. it appeared to pass through a cloud, which was the first time i had any perception of how far it was, as it passed through the cloud, it changed direction to almost completely westward and picked up speed pertty rapidly, then just as suddenly slowed back down. i lost sight of it as it headed west and went behing a tree line. i tried to record it on my phone but i don't think anything came out, it was too small and or far away.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over

initially thought three things; reflection on my windshield, reflection of a street light, or a helicopter or airplane/jet. as i watched the object race across the sky it immediately dived vertically towards the ground at an immense rate of descent. i thought that this might unfortunately be an aircraft in distress, but upon further driving, there was no sign or fire or downed power lines in it's path of motion. it was a steady green streak of light, similar to that of a green colored skittle bag. the object simply disappeared as if someone had turn a switch off. after serving in the air force for almost 22 years, i have found this sighting the most frightening and unexplainable that i have ever encountered. ironically, 4 other people had seen the same object at the same time (including a 3

appeared to be approx the size of a basketball, though i don't know how far away it actually was from me.  the other 2 were smaller, appearing to be the size of softballs, maybe larger.  i stopped in the middle of the street to take pictures and watch them more carefully to make sure they weren't planes or helicopters (though they appeared to be way too low to be aircraft).  one of the smaller ones then faded & dissapeared.  i continued driving, while watching them.  my view was blocked temporarily by some trees and when my view was clear again, only the larger object remained.  i had driven to pick up my son from a friends house and when he came out, he saw it too, though it appeared to have moved higher in the sky.  this all occured over approx a 10 minute period.  as we drove out of the neighborhood, the trees once again blocked our view and when our view was once again clear, the object was gone. i was fascinated and curious about what they were, but wasn't scared.  the photos i took with my cell phone aren't great quality, but when you zoom in you can see glowing yellow-orange balls of light.
