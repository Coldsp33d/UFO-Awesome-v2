for i had a deposition hearing on a business matter the next morning. i was reviewing records, getting my head straight for the next morning and such things, and decided to step out for smoke before retiring in for the night. i frequently do this because there is no smoking in the house. i live in pownal, maine. near the bradbury mountain state park. coastal. 30 mins. to the south your in portland, 30 min. to the north your in lewiston/auburn. pownal sisters freeport. quiet and rural. deathly quiet at 3:00 a.M. live on a back dirt road; lucky to hear a car go by at that hour. anyway, after stepping out that night and off my porch area into the front yard, i lite my smoke and hear a dull audible rumble, kind of jet like when its fairly high. we hear planes and jets and the such for we live not to far from the international airport in portland....And about the same distance from the brunswick naval air station; now decommissioned not long ago. i looked up behind me and overhead towards the apparent rumble and didn't see anything, then up in front of me and saw the craft. at about 80-85 degrees off horizon. it had already passed slightly over and by me at this point. i'm not sure if it passed over as i was standing there...As i didn't hear it until it passed overhead. it sounded kind of like your furnace kicking on when your outside on a quiet night. a muffled rumble you hear out your chimney. i saw a dark triangular craft with a single solid white light on each of its points and a smaller blinking red light to the center. the front light seemed a little further front than the back two were apart. i'd say like a pizza slice. elongated slightly. all lights appeared to be on the bottom. it was too dark to make out any tail or appendages but there were certainly no other lights on the craft. my first impression was that it was a jet of some sorts...Mainly because i could hear it. sounded like a smooth running mercedes of jet motors, quiet with that dull rumble. it was low enough that i could make out the black triangle body against the night sky between the lighted tips. it came from the west and was headed east on a straight line. appeared to be headed directly over the bradbury mountain state park, on course to the naval air station on the coast...About twenty minutes by car. it seemed to me to be with-in the 500 ft. to 1/2 mile up zone. best guess estimate 1,200 ft. fairly low and close. i watched it all the way clearly go off and away for about three solid min. maybe five. until it got to about 35-40  degrees off horizon and the lights on the bottom broke plane where i couldn't see them anymore. it moved (flew), very slowly....Almost gliding i guess would best describe it. the rumble seemed to match the speed as well. low,slow,dull. lived here for about 10 years plus, and most jets and the like where flying out of the airbase in brunswick, especially the lower flights heading in toward that way. i've thought and talked about the sighting these last couple weeks, and decided tonight to check out this site for maybe any other sightings in the area, and to make a formal statement. i know others have seen similar objects over the years and believe them to be true u.F.O. extraterrestrial. i was taken back slightly to see that two weeks to the very day.... that one was reported to the south of here in massachusetts. not far away in flight terms. identical described. this craft does exist... i am in witness thereof; what bites you on the nose you can't deny. there must be no doubt the military knows of this craft. it didn't seem to mind anyone looking at it, all lit up on the bottom with the blinking red light....Seemed close to the speed in between real navigation light blinking as well. my experience with this sighting was that it was for sure stealthy. maybe military. where there's smoke there's fire. this craft .....What ever it may be is traveling the new england corridor right now. i,ve been looking up about every night now when i step out; and so should you all. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":36278,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.6913659,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03062012-0002","longitude":-70.276628,"occurred":1329379200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maine","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1331039973000,"summary":"3 am..Heard dull rumble... looked up to see dark triangle, low speed, single solid white light on tips and a smaller red blinking light center bottom.","tags":["lights","triangle"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"04069","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":19,"locationName":"Portland, Maine","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:11216"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Dartmouth","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was standing at the kitchen window, peeling potatoes in the sink.  the window faces west.   the sky was clear and the sun had begun to set.  nobody else was in the house.   i noticed a small black object on the western horizon (the view from this window is about 3/4 mile, across undeveloped land and marshland).   i looked down to watch what i was doing, then looked back out the window and was astonished to see the object was moving straight towards the house, at an elevation i cannot estimate, but i could clearly see that the object was a black disk, with no visible features, and it was quite large. it did once turn over - which really startled me.    it continued overhead, moving then southeasterly.  i heard no noise, but i was indoors.   my impression is that from the moment i first saw the object until it passed overhead, its altitude lowered.  i did not go to the east side of my home to watch further, as guests were due to dinner and i was busy.\r\n\r\nour location is semi-rural, near the little river on the westerly side of our farm, and buzzards bay lies to the east of smith neck road.  the area has much property in conservation or preservation.\r\n\r\nin the past several years, from time to time after nightfall, 2 or 3 small yellowish lights on the western horizon.  we do not know what they are.   they appear to hover for a time, then move a little. we've thought they must be helicopters - but we could see only the lights the objects made.  we could hear no sound from them, and we can only estimate their distance from our house at perhaps 2 miles.  they were at low altitudes. sometimes they were in view for most of an hour.      i have not looked for those recently.

seen it in my yard, if anything did, because i dont have any memory of going into my house or anything afterwards.But i know for a fact that they exist because i seen one when i didnt even realize

because i wanted to drive for a bit. i was driving down n. lynnhaven road, and pulled into the st. nicholas church parking lot because i wanted to sit and look up at the stars (i have always been very interested in the astronomy.) i was watching the airliners and looking at the planet conjunction of venus and jupiter off to the west, (i believe it is venus and jupiter, dont quote me on that), anyways, planetary alignment to the west, i noticed out of the corner of my eye, maybe ne or nne, a bright white light, and i thought, oh neat a shooting star, but as i turned my head, i saw it make strange movements. the object was right above the tree line from my pov, it shot up at an angle to the right, slightly less than 90 degrees, then made a sharp u-turn to the left, and it squiggled down below the tree line, where i lost sight of it, then it shot straight up back above the tree line, this time at an angle to the left, and dissipated in the night sky. the object was very small, the light was bright white light, sort of like an orb, i could tell it was solid, there is absolutely no chance it was a spotlight of any kind, i could tell by lookng at it, it was a solid object. anyways, the orb had a glow around it, the same color and light intensity as the object itself, with what seemed to be a very short trail after it. for people that know how to measure degrees in the sky, the trail was about 1 degree in length behind it. it stayed that length throughout the whole sighting. again i want to emphasize, it wasnt like a street light color, or a head light density, it looked like a solid, white, solid bright light. the whole sighting lasted less than three seconds, it was moving very very fast, with absolutely no noise, but do not eliminate the noise factor becasue i was a good distance away. as soon as i saw it, i pulled out my phone, and called my friend daniel murguia and left a frantic voice mail explaining what had happened, then called my other friend brian, who also didnt answer. no message was left for him, then i called another friend, rachel, i told her what i had just seen, as i was talking to her, i drove to where i thought the object may have been flying over, that was an elementary school in my neighborhood. i went to the soccer field, named brill field, and walked to the middle of the field, still on the phone, trying to see if i could get another glimpse of the ufo. unfortunately none was seen. i drove home, told my parents, im sure they dont believe me, the friend brian does not believe me, and the friend rachel, i could tell by her voice and attitude, was skeptical. though the first contact, daniel murguia, said he got chills when he listened to the voice mail i had left him. i hope my information was satisfactory, i surely hope to hear from whomever reads this soon. thank you.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On the night of aug31 2011 (although technically it was early sept1, because the time was ~1a), me and my girlfriend randomly realized we were both hungry. we decided to drive out to wendy's (the nearest open-late option). as we were leaving the neigborhood, we both turned to our right, looking down the street the way we were about to turn. it was a very short distance to a stop-lighted intersection, and across it were homes on either side (i think a home on one side had been converted into an autoshop). anyway, there were large bright red and white lights just above the small buildings there. the lights spanned larger than a normal/small house. my immediate reaction was that i was witnessing a jet crash. but as the milliseconds and seconds passed, my brain had to come to terms with the fact that the lights were hanging in place. i said to my girlfriend, \"do you see anything?\" i looked to her as i asked this, and her mouth was open, and eyes wide. we were still sitting at the stopsign at the end of our neighborhood. i turned down the street toward the object now. we came to the above-mentioned stoplight, and stopped. the object was still there. now we were literally across the street from this thing, leaning forward to see up through the windshield at this giant display literally mere feet above the house across the intersection. it seemed disc-like, but it was hard to tell- the surface was the flattest black youve (n)ever seen. in hindsight, i theorize that the surface was able to absorb all light as a way to camoflage itself. however, that is a little contradictory to the only other feature noticeable about this thing: the light-bank that surrounded it. on what would be the edge of the saucer, was a row of lights. they were not necessarily in a straight line; some were a little higher or lower than others. all the lights were red or white. they turned on or off. they didnt blink or strobe, but they were turning on and off- each independent of the others- in what seemed like a non-sense sequence. however, i must say that the feeling i had in my gut was that there was a pattern to it, i just simply wasnt able to understand it. i remember trying to notice a communicative pattern, but couldnt. the thing about the lights was that they didnt create visible \"noise\". they lit up almost like an indiglo watchface or something. the houses and trees- nothing was cast in white or red when the lights shown. now, to the movement of the object. the object was tilted to one side. also it moved back and forth slightly, almost like- imagine if a helicopter was trying to stay in place; it cant stop in a 3-dimensional field of movement on one exact spot; it has to move slightly up, down and then back to stay right at the spot they want, but not right on that spot- thats how this thing moved. but it was very slight. it appeared to be trying to stay right above this one house. it was just at the top of the trees in that neighborhood. there was no sound. we were in my jeep, which had a soft top on, but all the windows uninstalled. we sat at the red light staring at it, nobody talking. then the major light effects seemed to calm down (but there were still visible lights), and the thing lowered down into the trees, down over the house. at this point i said, \"let's go on, and maybe we can see it better from another angle\". however that was stupid, because our journey led us completely away from the site. it was so dumb to drive away, but that was the sensible thought i had at the moment, even though i could have went straight (instead of turning right), and i would have been beside the house! i drove just a little ways down the road, and i realized: how stupid! i said \"we are just getting further away! why didnt i drive into the neighborhood!?\" my girlfriend said \"i dont know\". i said \"why didnt you tell me to drive into the neighborhood?\" she said \"i dont know, i was just going with what you were doing\". \"should i turn back?\" we looked back and could see no strange lights. we continued on. i really feel that we were \"diverted\". im not necessarily taking it to the extreme of \"mind-control\", but i think i was remotely influenced to pass on by the sight. the drive was a strange mix of silence and excited talking. to my suprise, my girlfriend brought up that at first, she thought she was witnessing the crash of an aircraft- exactly what i had felt internally! we brainstormed on things it couldve been. we asked eachother repeatedly \"did we just see a ufo?\". that night i had a strange dream about \"grey\" aliens. i dont want to recount it here. but i will say, that i dont believe it was a \"memory\" of an abduction or something, as the setting was somewhere far away (and from my childhood), and it was daylight in the dream. also, my entire family was in the dream. the next morning when i woke up, i felt emotionally shell-shocked. i thought of the lights and the object, and my eyes watered, like i was about to cry. i said to my girlfriend: \"was that real?\" anyway, that's about it. i have more details and theories, but im with-holding them for some semblance of brevity. if you have questions or helpful comments, i hope there is a way for mufon to put you in touch with me through email.","distance":"101-500

room upstairs and sat down on my bed. i had in my room a small radio but this was shut off. i began thinking about things until the event happened. i started hearing a radar in my head.It sounded like a radar from a sattelite or a navy ship.I then stood up and said 'does anyone else hear that!'my sister was sleeping in her room and noone heard me, because everyone was asleep and my door was shut.I sat back down on my bed as the radar continued.I then looked to my right where my window was and saw very bright lights flashing from a u.F.O. extremely close to my window. it began flashing the colors red,yellow,blue,and green simultaniously.As i witnessed this i stood up on my feet and began to walk towards the window.It was then that there was no doubt in my heart and in my mind that this was a genuine u.F.O..I put my hand on the string to lift up the blinds but was sure that i would be traumatized severely if i lifted up those blinds, because of the fact that this u.F.O. was only 5 feet away from my window.I went back to my bed and sat down.The sound of the radar grew louder. i felt as though i was being challenged with this radar.I looked right at the u.F.O. and began to try very hard to make it bow down to me with telekinisis.This did nothing to the u.F.O.. the one who controlled this u.F.O. and this radar decided to end this attempt. within 3.7 seconds of me trying to do this. the radar jumped extremely loud. i imediately covered my ears and began screaming out of pain from this sound as i fell on my back on the bed.All of these events, i swear to you happened and the attack lasted 8 seconds. the radar stoped and as soon as it stoped my little radio which was turned off came on.The u.F.O. then  left.The song 'let's just kiss and say goodbye' the ub40 cover was playing and was this aliens message to me.After 12 seconds of hearing this song i ran to my sisters room across the hallway.I knocked on her door and told her what had happened.I was shaking and she

for my mother to come outside. she went out to the porch with him, i can still remember the urgency in his voice. i remember them talking in a low excited voices and as a child i wanted to know what was so interesting. i can remember going out on the front porch of our garage apartment and looking up. to my amazement at tree top level was a circular object hoovering above our yard. i felt no worry, in fact i remember feeling very calm, and thinking to myself, oh good they have come to take me home. the object that i was looking at was large and circular with a dome on top and bottom. around the edge of the lip was a band of lights, no not lights, was more like a window that allowed lights to circulate around the edge of the craft. when the lights came on they would appear in patterns. these lights ran around the edge of the object, but in a repeating pattern of two or three different patterns. always in the same colors of yellow, blue, red, or green. but not always in the same sequence. i don't know for sure how long they were there but i do remember wishing that they would take me home with them. i felt like they had come for me. i knew that the object was from another world and could almost feel a link with them as a child. then as we watched the object shot start up so far that it appeared to be about the size of a dime in the sky and off to the west over the airport. we stood there amazed for a couple of minutes and then went into the house, my father called the airport to see if they had picked up anything on their radar. i can remember him asking for the control tower and then after they picked up he kept asking why do you need to know that and hung up the phone without giving them any information. as soon as he hung up the phone i can remember he yanked the phone cord out of the wall and we did not plug it back in for a few days. i felt sad that i had been left behind, but also seemed to feel that they would be back for me.
