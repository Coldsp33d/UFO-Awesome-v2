was unusual, because at first there were no cirrusclouds in front of it and still de brightness changed. perhaps it was a sattelite or the iss, but it stayed stationary in the sky. after about a few minutes some cirrusclouds past in front of it and although the 'star' was a bit less visible, but you could still see it changing in brightness. i therefore tried to focus on it -after the clouds where gone- with my camera (200mm lens) and took a photograph. the first photograph showed on zooming in on the camerascreen just a bright dot. i therefore took a second photograph and at zooming in i saw that it had a shape. \r\n\r\nwhen i looked up again, some more cirrus clouds passed but the object had dissapeared. i later saw some more aircraft flying past, but the appeared lower in altitude

showers on 8/12/17 at approximately 10pm est. she had the camera facing ne toward where the showers were best viewed. i was sitting down behind her watching her set up the camera when an extremely bright light flashed in the northern night sky toward polaris. i saw this out of the corner of my eye and when i turned toward it, it was gone. i asked my wife if she saw it and she replied she didn't. it was by far the brightest light in the sky.... by far. approximately 5 minutes later i saw the extremely bright light flash on, then off again this time more to the west. i asked my wife if she saw it and again she did not. i then asked her to leave her camera and come watch with me. another 5 minutes or so passed and this time we both saw it. it was back almost due north but lower in the sky. the main difference was the light this time was not as bright as the original brilliant flash but appeared as if someone was operating a dimmer switch because the light started out faint then glowed brightly, then off. immeditaly following this sequence, a much smaller (secondary) flash would instantly occur, always to the right and lower than the initial object - possibly a side view of the object? the initial brilliant flash of light that i mentioned originally may have been a front view because we could not see the secondary flash of light when this occurred. we watched this object for well over a half hour always following the same sequence of no light to dim light, to brighter light always followed by the smaller secondary flash of light. it seemed to go back and forth from a front view with the brilliant light to a side view with the light acting as if were being operated on a dimmer switch. the secondary flash was only visible on the side view theory. when the \"side view\" light glowed on it appeared there actually some sort of shadow behind the light. possibly indicating an object behind the light? when the light disappeared, you couldn't see anything where the object may have been and when it reappeared with the flashing sequence it was always in a different location in the sky. initially the light started out to the north, high in the sky, then to the west at different altitudes, back to the north, then southwest until it turned to the east, flashed one more sequence then disappeared. my 21 year old son came out and got to see about 15 minutes of this event. i have been an amateur astronomer for many years. i know what planes and helicopters look like at night. \r\ni can also easily pick out satellites passing overhead so i know what they look like as well. this object was unlike anything i have ever seen. this object was very high in the sky. it followed no type of flight pattern. once it went dark you wouldn't see it again until it flashed the light in a completely different part of the sky from when we last saw it. i have never claimed to see a ufo before but this was strange enough that i felt i needed to reach out to someone else.  very strange. please contact me if you would like to discuss further. my wife was able to get several pictures of this object on her camera. we viewed these pictures and you can clearly see the light and the irradic behavior of the flight of whatever this object was.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:35:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other, Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

was not moving, but pulsing on some cadence.  the pulsing was more like a lighthouse.  the light would be off and slowly pulse to a very bright light and then off.  the pulse was probably 3 seconds worth total each time, from nothing to bright to nothing.\r\n\r\nit appeared quite high.  many airplanes flew under it while we watched.  after 5-6 pulses, it began to very slowly move east.  it would stop occasionally, move north a bit and then back east.  we could only see its direction by watching for the pulses.  there was no visible craft or flashing lights like an airplane would have.  only the pulse.  over the course of 30 minutes of monitoring, it only moved a total of 1ft of our visibility of the horizon, not very far.  no aircraft i'm aware of can do what it was doing.  \r\n\r\nafter

out, but then it reappeared again, zig-zagging around. as i panned across the sky during the storm i picked up another orb, which i didn't see until i reviewed my video and zoomed in to take a closer look at the green orb i had seen initially. it was more white and also made similar movements going from high in the sky, sideways, up and down, even visible during lightning flash. during the sighting, i couldn't believe what i was seeing, i even thought i was misinterpreting a speck of dust on my cell phone or after affects of lightning on my eye, but i had my fiance watch it when he got up and he saw them both as well without me pointing out what i saw. i was very excited as i have never seen something like this in my entire life, but have always believed ets to be real and very present. after seeing it i feel truly blessed. i felt very happy and oddly enough \"playful\" is the only word i can think to use to describe what i saw and how it made me feel. soon, i didn't see the

and there were a number of them quite low to the ground.\r\n\r\nat this point i thought: advertising stunt of some kind (we get those a lot in la too). it wasn't until i got back to my door that i saw a whole \"fleet\" of them coming in on what looked like a flight path (disclosure: we are close-ish to lax and the santa monica airport and i'm familiar with the flight paths - you'll see a number of planes in the video). as if they were coming from the upper atmosphere (over the pacific) and down towards pico blvd essentially. at this point i thought \"skydivers\" or \"flares\"... and went inside and grabbed my binocs.\r\n\r\nwhen i looked through the binocs (i have two pair, one with a stabilizer one with extra magnification) i expected to see lanterns, flares, balloons, or even drones or skydivers. instead what i saw were sparkling rings of smoke that had some shape and apparent structure, but they spun like tops in the sky as they moved. they almost had a jellyfish type body that seemed to pulse and was translucent. once i pulled out the binocs and saw this, four \"zoomers\" (what i called them) buzzed down from the sky (above the palm tree in the long shots for reference) and skimmed above the roof of the building directly in front of me (only a couple hundred feet in altitude). they were silent, and moved incredibly fast (way too fast, as you'll see) to be a lantern or balloons - and then they climbed in elevation after buzzing the roof.\r\n\r\ni was alone, though my neighbor saw it as well. i should have gotten more people outside to be honest. mistake on my part. but these clips in the video are broken up because i was going back and forth between filming and watching through the binocs. i stated this in the video, but will say it again, this video does not do justice to how many of them there were in the sky. it was a constant flow, on a \"flight path\" seemingly of these things for 30 minutes or longer. it lasted a long time, and had to be seen by more than me.\r\n\r\ni slowed some of the clips down at the end, the one zoomer i got and another slow motion vid of how they move in the sky (you'll see it tumbling @ the 1:51-1:57 mark).\r\n\r\ntime stamps:\r\nfirst thirty seconds are kind of tough, showing the higher altitude ones that had just buzzed me\r\n:40 second mark you see some new ones coming in, lower and closer.\r\n:55-:57 mark you can kind of see the movement (like balloons) as well as the pulsing.\r\n1:51 - 1:57 mark you will see one moving across the top, spinning, it gives you some of the shape\r\n2:11-2:17 mark you can see more movement (these are new ones, not the same as the ones above)\r\n3:15-3:26 mark good shot of one close, moments after it buzzed the path i was standing on, moves like balloons... but way faster and they're glowing.\r\n3:33-3:52 mark has another one dipping low, then a zoomer (the only one i got on film, but there were several others) that flew past real fast. this one is slowed down at the end and zoomed in as best i could. \r\n*4:35-5:21 mark has three more coming in on the \"flight path\". by that i mean, you see how they're high in altitude and moving lower. that's how most of them came in, in a straight line from that high altitude and then down where they spread out, then reformed into a line and moved on at a lower altitude. this also includes the description of these things.\r\n\r\nthanks for your time.","distance":"101-500 Feet, Unknown","duration":"00:35:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":85905,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.0254243,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08142017-0003","longitude":-118.4821512,"occurred":1502391960000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1502676002000,"summary":"Orb like sighting of 50+ objects over santa monica ca on 8-10-17.

8:19pm. she asked me if i could see the bright light that she and her boyfriend were observing from their back yard as we spoke. i put my glasses on and stepped onto my north porch while still on the phone. i asked the direction to look and they said it was almost directly above them, which is to my ne. i then observed in the sky at about 70 degrees, a very bright light in the direction of their location, edmond. \r\n    at first, i thought it was venus, but it was in the wrong location. the sun had just gone down, but no stars were visible and the sky was blue. then i thought it may be a reflection of an airplane, as i have 3 small and 1 international airport within 25 miles. although the sky was clear on that half, the curvature of the earth was obstructed by an on coming storm front, and the sunlight could not pass through it. \r\n    at this point over a minute had passed as the object moved very slowly in a westward direction. the speed was too slow for conventional aircraft, it was nearly hovering,  it had no flashing lights and was not on any of the regular aircraft flight paths. i continued to watch the object while talking to my 2 friends on the phone as we three witnessed the event from our dual locations. \r\n    after observing the object for approximately 5 minutes, the object started to fluctuate slightly in light intensity. the object, in all this time had not moved more than 3 degrees off origination point. a total time of over 5 minutes had passed by now, when the object started to blur slightly.  over the next 20 seconds the bright object faded from view, as if it were pulling away at high speed. \r\n    the event was over at 8:25pm. i then observed the sky and discussed the object on the phone with co-witnesses for another 6 minutes.There were still no stars visible and no aircraft in the area at that time. \r\n    i live outside of town were it is relatively dark at night, and this not my first ufo sighting. on the contrary, i have seen many and i am an expert in light and photography.  this one has at least 3 observers so i decided to report it.

30 miles north of nashville.  the sky was mostly clear with a few stray clouds and contrails with no thunderstorm activity within a hundred miles of the area.  at approximately 21:40 on 12 august 2017, i observed a bright white flash of light in the north, northeast portion of the sky at approximately 45 degrees.    it appeared as if a star had flashed on and off and the size comparison of the light was the same if not marginally larger than a star.  as i continued to look in the sky i observed a couple of more flashes over the course of a minute or so.  i walked back into the house and told my wife what i had seen.  i asked her and my children to join me on the front porch to see if it continued and if possible to record and hypothesize what it could be.  at approximately 21:45 the light flashes had moved from the original point in the sky to nearly directly overhead.  as we watched the flashes continued in intervals of several seconds.  a couple of the flashes appeared as strobes or camera flashes.  at one point a streak of light appeared in what i could only explain as a bluish white laser or fluorescent bulb in the sky in the same vicinity.  the entire event lasted only about six or seven minutes from start to finish.\r\nthis is not the first time that i had observed an occurrence like this.  approximately a year ago in the same general area and the same time of year, i saw what appeared as a star flashing on and off every few seconds.  a short time before this i saw a similar event take place on the southwest horizon from our property.  researching several videos on the internet to find a reasonable explanation for what i had witnessed, here is what i found:\r\n1.\tiridium flare – while a solid hypothesis at first, upon reviewing videos online and reading the description of what it is and how this appears, this does not look at all like what we witnessed.  the flashes we witnessed were brighter, crisper, and strobed while the iridium flare “warmed up and cooled down” over the course of a few seconds.  the lights we saw literally were like camera flashes.\r\n2.\tair traffic – we witnessed several air craft traversing the sky while this was occurring, and since we are in the flight path of traffic in and out of nashville international airport, it was another good hypothesis.  however, the aircraft lighting, many of which are now led, did not appear the same as the lights we saw nor did they have the same characteristics as the lights we observed.\r\n3.\tlightning – there was no lightning in the area and no thunderstorm activity.  the sky was mostly clear and mild with good visibility.\r\n4.\tmeteor – while this was the reason that i was outside watching the sky in the first place, this was not meteor activity.  the flashes were predictable and were easily distinguishable from meteors.\r\nas i continued to research other ufo reporting sites, i came across a few others who observed similar flashes.  these reports were from michigan and louisiana.  interestingly, the location where we saw the lights is nearly at (within a thousand feet of) the line of totality for the upcoming eclipse.  coincidence or not, this was very strange.  we are very curious to know what this was and to know if more saw the same thing.  meanwhile, we will continue to watch the sky for more examples of this and will report our findings.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:07:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path then

about before.\r\ni saw a ufo hovering in a tree above me.\r\ni took a picture, then returned to my tent...Somewhat afraid, but not terrorized.\r\ni fell asleep, and experienced weird engineering dreams. when home, i looked at the images i took, and the ufo was clearly above me, yet the sky seemed to have a cloud around...Several orbs were visible in this fuzziness, as well as the moon.  the orbs had geometrical patterns inside, and one looked like it was a link to another world, as there were building inside, but after boosting size/contrast, it was hard to identify.  after that, i've taken photos near my home in the city, and have many shots of orbs appearing. \r\none of the photos has a sort of white geometric netting that would fit perfectly over a circle...If you look closely, a faint object can be seen under the white overlay.  the other photos shows two close orbs, and one further away.  i have other photos of the orbs.\r\ni also thought i saw the same lights from the original ufo on a clear night while in vancouver.  this seems to be interested in me.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),
