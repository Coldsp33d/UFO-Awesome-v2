(recommend checking the con altitude for this day, time and location.  this will help determine altitude.  i think it was well above the cons).  the light brightened and then dimmed and brightened again, changing reflectivity.  appeared to be a reflection from the sun on some type of object, similar to aircraft glint, but not quite the same and much brighter.\r\n\r\ni called my family outside to look at the object.  the 4 of us tracked it east until it disappeared from sight at 1801 cst.  object was observed for approximately 5 minutes.  using a simmons spotting scope on 60 power a definite object was spotted.  spotting scope was used when the object was well to the east at approximately 30 degree inclination to the east.  the object was somewhat translucent, wavering, with reflective properties.  i was only able to see the object through the scope for about 1 min due to the distance and now getting lower on the horizon and beginning to fade away. my teenage son also saw the object through the scope.\r\n\r\nmy first words when spotting the object were, \"its one of those sky snake ufo's!\"  the object appeared to have a spherical center with 5 tentacle like  tubes that flexed out to a flexible tubular ring around the outside.  the entire object wavered and slowly changed shape as if it were blown by the wind.\r\n\r\nmy thought is that it was some type of weather ballon, but some of the facts did not add up.  personally i've witnessed strange shaped weather balloons while flying in the usaf.  i've seen them pancake, wobble, flatten and once even look like the martian mothership.  i even hit a buzz lightyear mylar ballon at 22,000 feet while flying in mexico.  though the translucent coloring was similar to a weather balloon, there were no ribs, nor payload like most weather balloons.  speed and track was consistent with a weather balloon, but the shape did not make sense.\r\n\r\nthis object was similar to thy sky snake ufo's i've seen on the internet.  this was basically a saturn type object with 5 spokes reaching out to the ring.  the ring and spokes were tubular and flexed, changing shape somewhat.  the sphere did not change shape.  reflectivity depended upon shape.  the object did appear to slightly disappear and then reappear, but this could be because of distance, coloring, and shape.\r\n\r\nmy 13 year old younger son stated he saw a very fast moving light moving toward the object and then disappear.  the remainder of the family had looked away for a moment and could not corroborate that particular alleged event.\r\n\r\nthe object was spotted by my father some 40 miles east of my location, in rockwall.  he was unable to get optics on the object, but definitely saw the bright and then dimming reflectivity from the object.\r\n\r\nthe object could only be seen to have form while viewing through optics.  definitely structured, reflective object with unique shape and flexible properties.  this sighting falls into the classic definition of a ufo...An unidentified flying object.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

divides gladewater/clarksville city and white oak right next to lake divernia(spell check). my wife and i noticed a bright white light in the rear view mirror of my vehicle, thought it was an aircraft of some sort.  as we crossed the bridge on divernia, just prior to beginning a hill to come into the city of white oak, the light went from what seemed like miles away to over my vehicle.  it resembled a helicopter spotlight and was directly on my vehicle.  thinking it was some form of law enforcement, we pulled the vehicle over and rolled my window down. it hovered right above the tree line and just over my vehicle..50-100 feet above the vehicle as a guess. i stuck my head out of the window and looked up and was absolutely blinded by the light. my wife was screaming at me to stay in the car and just go.  i remember her telling me j***** just go...Go go go. i used my thumb to block out the brightest light and noticed 4 white lights, north/south/east/west on the craft.  i opened the door to my vehicle and stepped out.  standing as if you were to be looking at an object in the sky during the day, shielding my eyes with the back of my right hand, right hand palm facing the object.  it felt somewhat like warm sunlight.  no burning sensation, just a warm feeling.  im not sure how long i was standing outside the vehicle...And this is where i begin to feel like i am going crazy.  i remember getting out of the vehicle, i remember being in total shock and awe at the site of this craft and then i remember what seems to be a snap back like from a daydream and a huge amount of fear set in.  i was telling myself, \"get back in the car and go\".  at this time i looked over the roof of the car and noticed my wife doing the exact same thing i was doing.  i yelled at her and she did the exact same motion i did.  almost as if you're concentrating on something and begin to daydream.  someone says your name and you snap back and she literally said \"huh\".  i told her to get in the vehicle with me and we then left the scene.  the object returned to the same area we initially saw it and was then gone.  i feel like i am a crazy person.  i know what i saw...I am of perfect mental health and have no issues with seeing little green men or even believe in aliens.  infact i want to believe this may be something of ours.  i know beyond a shadow of a doubt it was no helicopter and last i checked, no plane in east texas is able to hover.  it made no noise minus a small electrical discharge sound..The same form of a \"hum\" that you'd hear from a transformer on an electrical pole.  please, please help me understand what this could have been and help me find someone that can make sense of this.  i am scared..Excited..Worried and thrilled at the same time.  i cant believe something like this has happened to my wife and myself.  we had what seemed to be minor sunburns on our face and the palm of our hands were red.  no blisters or scars/marks.  just a light red/sunburn tinge to our face, neck, palms.  mufon is the only avenue i have found to go to.  please, we need your help.\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\n   j\r\n\r\np.S. i have had a gentleman contact me twice about the purchase of my vehicle.  he's seen me twice now at a gas station once and a shopping mall the 2nd.  i drive a 2001 saturn l200....It's nothing flashy and nothing special at all.  i am unsure as to why this man has talked to me twice yet wont give me any information of his.  he only asks for contact information for me so he can call to question if i've considered his offer for the vehicle.  said his name was jeff thomas if this helps at all.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then

backyard. i immediately noticed a very bright object that i thought was a star. but when it moved i realized it wasn't a star. it appeared to have about three to five lights. it moved back and forth in a zig zag way, and then hovered and wobbled. i began to think perhaps i was just dizzy and maybe i wasn't actually seeing what i thought i was seeing.  i asked my 18 yr old daughter to come out and look at it. she said it was not a star, it was definitely moving and hovering and was not an airplane. she said it must be a ufo. as time went on it moved further north, would zig zab a bit and then hover and wobble some more.  it was very cold out and my daughter was recovering from a bad cold so she went back in.  i came out about every 15 minutes and watched it. then i decided to see if i could get a better look through binoculars. i sat in a lawn chair and once i got it into focus, i kept my hands very steady.  i got quite a good look. it was a spherical object with many lights on it.  the lights were in a grid pattern. the object was a dull metallic color. i realized that what i thought had only been about three to five lights was really many more, at least 15 to 20.\r\n\r\nfrom the time i first saw it, it must have been between 2 1/2 to 3 hours that i could still see it.  at about 10pm it was still visible and had moved north toward ventura county.  at 11pm it was gone.\r\n\r\ni regret that i didn't take video or was unable to get a closeup photo through the binoculars. \r\n\r\ni live about 10 miles from the pacific ocean.  from where i live, the object appeared to be following the coastline north.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with
