6:30 pm on friday, february 10th 2012.  i told joshua to put his seat belt on and he said \"no\", then he said he heard very distinctive  voice in his head that said \"you are moments away from something significant happening\", but he still did not put his seatbelt on. he laughed and said to himself, that would be a bummer if we got into an accident and mom will tell me \"i told you to put your seatbelt on\"! we were now just on the st. petersburg side of the bridge at 6:35 and we were heading south towards st. petersburg on i275 traveling about 65 mph.  i was in the far left lane, the fast lane, and as i looked up in the sky i noticed 3 odd looking lights. i tried to slow down a bit but there were cars on the right of me and behind me and i was afraid to cause an accident.  i said to joshua, look at those lights honey, what do you see, he said yeah, those are......And then he said oh my god, those are not lights from a plane mom, i said \"i know\", i was looking at them as we approached them. i noticed it was exactly 6:40 pm on the car clock. it was 6:42 pm when we were right up near the object. they were on our right on the passenger side of the car. joshua put his window down for a better look, other than the noise from the wind and cars next to us, there was no sound like engines or anything coming from the lights themselves. there were 3 lights on our right side (west) of the car just off the interstate coming towards us. the farthest light was a normal headlight looking light, that would be on a plane, big and round, the next one closest was however bigger and still round, then the closest one to us was smaller in size and again, round.  there was a very small blinking red light between the first and second light and a white blinking light between the second and third light. very odd looking for a plane, we both agreed it was not a plane or a helicopter or anything that could be identified.  i was traveling now just near the sawgrass lake area of st. peterburg. it then came to a complete stop in the sky and hovered just directly across from us, about 20 degrees off the horizon and just over the tree line, we could clearly see as it began to shape shift and turn towards us counter clockwise, into a large black pewter looking triangle that had several lights on it. there were many, many white lights. i'm not sure how many. we were about 250 feet from this object. joshua was now hanging out the window, i was trying to drive in heavy traffic at 65 to 70 miles an hour, everything was happening so fast. i tried to hand joshua my cell phone for a picture, but i could not get it out of my purse easily and stay in my lane driving so fast, joshua said pull over mom, but there was no way as i was in the fast lane and i could not get over to the shoulder safely. i handed him the camera phone and he tried to take a picture but it was getting darker and the trees were now in the way, he could not get a good focus on the craft. i quickly made a call at 6:51 pm to a mufon fi to tell him what we saw and to report it while it was still fresh in our minds. i tried to give him as much information as i could so there would be a new set of ears on this investigation.  we drove on a bit and i was able to maneuver to the exit at 38th avenue north and then we re-entered the highway once again heading towards tampa (north) to try to get another sight of the craft.  as we passed where we had originally seen it on our left, (west) my side of the car, we could no longer see it. it was just gone. but we had not seen it leave as we watched the area as best we could as we were exiting and re-entering the highway.  we then got off the interstate on the 118th avenue exit towards clearwater and drove to 28th street no. heading south again we then pulled the car over to the shoulder and got out of the car to watch the sky and see what we could. we did not see the craft again.  we headed back home after about 10 minutes and re-entered the southbound lane on i275 again.  as we past the sighting area on our right (west) we noticed a car crash in the exact same place as we had seen the craft. there were 2 vehicles involved pulled over on the shoulder and two emergency type vehicles gathering the cars. they had yellow lights on the emergency vehicles. we then headed on towards home","distance":"101-500

with no lights.  at that time, craft dropped several colored orbs over the water which spun for a brief moment and then took off at a high rate of speed.  the craft then hovered over the home in a westerly direction to a point directly over the wolf river.  the craft hovered for a short time and again dropped several colored orbs which took off at a high rate of speed following the wolf river upstream.(north)  the craft then also followed the river upstream in the direction of the orbs at a slow speed until the witness lost sight of the object.  deputies from winnebago and waupaca counties were contacted and dispatched to the scene.  they were unable to witness any of the events.","distance":"101-500

quite the norm lately. i will list the description of each sighting so you can understand this isn't the normal thing...\r\n\r\nalso please keep inmind that this has been taking place in differrnt

you know this isn't what most are willing or wanting to hear to give advice or to help us understand. ever since(and i posted this here after sighting took place) we had our close and i mean very close sight of this firey translucent looking shape shifting craft, it was scary, that warped our reality since. and yes i have photos of this firey looking object. its not verry clear but can draw what we saw through our binoculars. man it was mind trippy, the kind of stuff you see on movies...\r\n\r\nbut anyways here you go.\r\nfirst is which my closest friend seen while i was way.\r\n2 white star looking lights, what was thought as first but brighter, right next to each other and close to the horizonish. then boom one just drops out of no where, then a few after the nexts just drops out of the sky.\r\n\r\nme and her seen, close to the horizon like really low. a white star streak across the sky at really high speed and vanish. other times we've seen similar events but can't remember exact details. other times we've caught lights that seemed close just disappeared. other times we've seen white translucent cigar oval shaped objects disappear slowly as if it was going into an invisable tunnel.\r\n\r\njust the other night i seen what i thougt was a plane high, dot size, up above me kind of. going at an up angle untill the light was gone.\r\n\r\nand durring these strange

one night) on the last two nights. the smaller of two objects is spherical in nature, i have had daylight sightings of it before. it hangs out over our area on a regular basis. the larger of the two objects is chevron shaped with three bright lights on the edges of craft. i could not see the top or bottom it was two far away to see much detail other than the the bright search type lights along the sides. it appears in our northwestern sky about the same level of the moon visually. it was not out of the atmosphere last night because i saw a aircraft pass directly between myself and the object probably 35,000 feet up or so. tuesday night the larger of the two crafts was just hanging out not doing much it was further north and west than the smaller local ufo. wensday night the larger of the two crafts was back with the small one and it started out higher and further north and west of the smaller objects. it was shooting red and bright blue light beams at a unknown or unseen object west and south of where it was hovering, this was about 7pm. smaller object seems to be there for an observer it did not particpate in light show other than its normal white lighting appearance. although i did not see a third object, i have seen the larger of the two objects around before and was firing at a third object and apparent had smaller possibly fighter craft out doing their own shooting of lights and i even have seen it with large explosions possibbly small craft exploding but no proof. i saw it launch the smaller crafts. i did not see any of the smaller crafts last night though. about 10pm i took my dog out for his walk before bedtime. i observed the larger of the two craft swiftly desending toward the horizon. i m not sure what caused this to happen although my scanner reported no crashes of any crafts in the area, it has happend before though i never did find out if they found it or not. it could have landed under control. we are surround by the mark twain national forrest area and there are plenty of remote unpopulatted areas. i took my dog back out about an hour later and they had both had left the area and i went to bed.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"03:30:17","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then
