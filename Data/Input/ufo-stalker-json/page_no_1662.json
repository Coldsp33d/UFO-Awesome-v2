a wrap around the house deck, ending on each side at the carport. the time was at 6:40 am est. i know because i had just taken my daughter to the bus for school and got back home. i always make a cup of coffee and go out on the deck when the mornings are nice. the weather was abnormally calm and warm. \r\nwhile standing on the far left of the deck , leaning on the railings , i felt someone to the right of me. my husband hadn't left for work yet.I wasn't frightened. when i turned my head to look this human shaped solid black , very dark black , being was standing on the other side of my deck. it was turned towards the field , leaning on the railings, seemed to be looking into the field. i was speechless, but not scared. when it turned it's head to look at me it began slowly moving backwards. the legs moved as if it were walking backwards, yet it was floating very slowly. cat like movements, like when a cat is stalking it's prey?  the being dissappeared behind that side of the house and i am still standing there like an idiot dumbfounded. then it peeked half it's body back around and stared at me for a moment. when it left this time also slow it dragged it's hand across the wood. the black hand is the last i saw of the being. i ran to the front of the deck. across the carport and looked, there was nothing there.    while it was first moving backward i got a very calm warming feeling. then i felt guilty because i had interupted this beings peaceful morning? i never felt in harms way until it came back and peeked at me. nothing was said but i got the feeling that it relayed the message,\" i'm not going to hurt you today, but i could if i wanted to.\" \r\nso, now i am terriffied to be outside after dark alone. mornings on the deck are not happenning. i keep every light on all the time. \r\nthis being was so dark black that there was a huge contrast between it and the morning light on the deck. there were no facial features at all. it was not another human standing there. i saw another being.\r\n02/29/2012 evening presented the most amazing lightening storms that i have ever seen in this area. i think there is a connection.\r\ni never heard any plane or helicopter or anything else flying overhead.\r\nseveral days earlier my daughter and i did see what looked like a huge metorite or \" falling star \". it fell from west to east. didn't associate that with anything. we see \" falling stars \" a lot in this area.  i will pay more attention from now on, maybe they aren't stars?\r\nso , that is my \"i saw an alien on my deck story.\"   it is true. i am scared. i now believe that they exist and will start preparing to defend myself against them since i did feel threatened in the end. like i know how to prepare for something like that? the light weren't on. on that side of the deck that morning. and why was it at my house!!!!!!!!","distance":"20 Feet or

presumed it to be venus because of it's large size and brightness. it was bluish white. there were no aircraft flying around and it was quite silent. then suddenly, i realized that the 'star' was kind of 'wobbleing', moving to the left and to the right and changeing it's altitude slightly; going up and down a few degrees. my friend and i watched for at least five minutes as the object suddenly appeared to display three or four, smaller, secondary lights that were basically 'orbiting' the main, central light, but not in a fixed manner. the overall impression was that of a 'amorphous' or 'shape-changing' structure. i remember thinking that object could not have been more than a mile away because its lights illuminated the small clouds that were nearby. at one point the object was inside or behind the clouds but was still very visible because they were so bright. the object slowly moved up and away from us before vanishing completely. the objects location was seen approximately

or causing it to hover (like helicopter blades), that this thing was different, it was powerful (to be kept aloft like that) and it was, to at least this layman, unidentified, for sure.  \r\nmy first reaction was to pull over and listen for jets, etc, as i couldn't see anything of the sort, but once i realized the craft was not a helicopter, i had to slow, pull off and roll down the window.  it was a fairly windy night and i cannot accurately report if the craft emmitted noise or not.  i have the feeling, though, if it was that close to me moving that slow, i would've heard something.  so if it wasn't 'silent' it was at least 'quiet.'\r\nafter making the turn (and again, not seeing any sort of propulsion means from what i would guess is the 'rear (?)' of the craft and trying to track it on the highway (thinking of travis walton, famously saying, 'i should've stayed in the truck), i realized it had gained too much distance between us as i was waiting on cars to pass, etc.  this did allow for the observation of the \"rear\" and no visible means of propulsion. \r\nfeelings were that of awe.  a large, slow moving triangle, with no visible propulsion means was new to me.  the triangle seemed to be fairly \"thick\"\r\ngut tells me this is government owned/operated and hasn't been disclosed to the public a la the stealth bomber a few decades ago, as i was in the vicinity of the military bases, described above.  the flashing center light was also reminiscent of commercial craft/public craft. \r\ndimensions: triangle.\r\nlights: 4 visible.  one pulsating in the center, (maybe a little off center) and three yellowish/white lights at the points of the triangle, but not flush with the points, the craft continued approx. 2-3 feet beyond the lights\r\npropulsion: no helicopter blades, flames emmited from afterburners.\r\nsound: unsure.  seems i should've heard something.\r\nno additional evidence -

my husband and i assumed there might be a fire in an old farm house, as there are a lot of older farm homes in the area we live in.  we were wathcing a movie in our living room in front of a large bay window.  about 15 minutes after we noticed the last emergency vehicle drive by, at 10:03pm a very large, glowing green object seemed to shoot across the sky in the direction that the emergency vehicles had headed.  there was no sound.  my husband and i both stood up and i turned off the tv immediately.  we listened for about 5 minutes for a crash (we both assumed at first that it must have been a plane \"falling\" out of the sky).  we never heard any sounds.  we stared outside for a while and there was nothing unusual.  about 1/2 an hour after that the emergency vehicles started coming back in the opposite direction with no sirens or lights.  we watched the local news at 11:00pm and there was no mention of any of this.  i logged into the news station's facebook site to see if there was any talk about this because it was so odd and several other people posted seeing something glowing/shooting across the sky in multiple other towns.  we went to bed assuming it would be on the morning news, but still nothing and no posts other than the people like myself on the news site.  i have never seen anything like this.  i have seen meteor showers/shooting stars/low flying airplanes, this did not look anything like those things.  i was thankful that my husband was there because the whole thing was very strange. i also don't think we would have believed each other if we hadn't both seen it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
