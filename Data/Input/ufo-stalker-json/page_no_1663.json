(maybe 3-5 minutes.)\r\ni am 51 years old and have never seen anything like it? my parents are in their 70���s and said they have never seen anything like it either. (my dad is a retired police officer.) \r\ni came into the house to watch the 10:00pm news to see if anyone else reported seeing anything like we had but they didn���t mention anything in the news. (our news comes out of cincinnati, oh)\r\ni would be very curious if anyone else in bright, indiana saw the same thing on this evening of february 25th, 2012? \r\nwhen i told my friends and colleagues at work they all asked if i took any pictures. i had my cellphone in my pocket which has a built in camera, but i was so intrigued by what i was seeing that i didn���t even think to take pictures. it is an event that i will never forget. i find myself constantly looking toward the sky as if to see it again.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

i thought ok this must be a collage hoax, so i sped up to observe form the side of the craft then the top of the craft began to rotatei thought wow what great trick but i didnt see the choppers but i could hear them in the didtance the rotation just turned about 30 degrees and stopped. the whole time i was driving slowly observing the craft. it stayed on the north side of i-20 flying in a nap of the earth fassion just then a blue beam of light laser like came through my car it was a pinpoint and came through the car straight through but didnt damage anything the beam centerd in my car then rotated over to me then flattened out from a pinpoint to a flat wide beam. the beam centerd on me then began to go up and down my body,no heat no noise it made an up and down pass then went back to a point then blinked out. then i was just befuttled about thes so i sped up faster to pass up the vehicle and as i watched it i could observe an observation deck which was wide open i cuold see 6 occupants,4 greys and 2 realy tall differant types they were tall with white silver hair and they were observing the road ahead and holding hands with the greys like parents comforting children. after i saw this i slowed down even more the craft kept moving up and dowh and alternating with the elevation of the land and i could still hear the choppers in the distance i observed the craft as we came to a populated area so i stayed paralel with the craft as long as i could. i observed the craft move ove a lighted football field and so i thought ok it is a hoax the craft was larger in diamiter than a football field! the craft then crossed the highway and proceeded in a south/southeast direction,then as more traffic became visible the craft moved in an unimaginable speed leaving streeks of lite as it left. end of report    ","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:30:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),  Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":36122,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.690147,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02272012-0005","longitude":-97.5165449,"occurred":1183968300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1330354804000,"summary":"Observed craft come south then followed i-20 heading east","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"?","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1694,"locationName":"Fort Worth, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:11794"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover), Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Athens","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"1.Leaving walmart\r\n2 i noticed them because of their star like objects were so bright and extremely low\r\n3i thought they were stars at first glance but soon discovered it not to be.\r\n4 first they was stationary around a particularly dark cloud. then one separated itself from the rest and the rest formed sort of a triangle shape but not exactly. at this time they were still at the same altitude as they were when i first noticed them. the last formation they made was a horizontal line. after about 30 mins and then we left. \r\n5 during the sighting i called cnn and made a report. five mins upon ending the call, 20-30 aircrafts were in the same airspace as the starlike objects. to me that was to many to be i that small area of sky. i know that they were aircrafts because of the flashing lights used by plans and helicopters at night. if they weren't ufos then why so many aircrafts to the response. also the cnn woman said i was the only person to report this. i lose sight of the object when all the aircrafts came to the area. we left from the scene after my cousin reminding us of prior engagements.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":36121,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.9564893,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02272012-0004","longitude":-83.3757044,"occurred":1330226400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Georgia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1330344042000,"summary":"This was just recorded on 02/25/2012 over georgia. we witnessed it at about 7:20 it lasted for about 30 mins. contacted cnn and reported it. 20 -30 government aircrafts responded to the lights in the sky but cnn said no one else reported it.
