the west a bright object that looked like something on fire.  we live within the class b airspace of pittsburgh international airport under the outer ring and commercial aircraft are often on the in-bound approach.  my first thought was that it was a plane with an engine on fire.  then i realized this was moving way to slow for any aircraft.  i called into the house for my son to come out and see it.  as he got out of the house the fireball began to dim as it was moving to the nnw.\r\n\r\nhe then noticed another fireball moving at slow speed on the same path coming from the south.  we ran into the street to get a good view.  while we were watching, we noticed another on the exact same path.  then there were more.  in all we saw 7 of these fireballs all on the same path moving generally from the south to the north-northwest.  \r\n\r\nthe area we live in is in the north suburbs of pittsburgh and is in a rural area.  we live in a large golf course development with some heavily wooded areas (immediately behind our house, with the exception of two fairways, it is approximately 20 wooded acres. on this night (2/26/12) there was no measureable wind and the sky was clear of clouds.  planets and stars were visible.  it was 7:05 pm (although in the video i say 8:05 as i misread my watch).  \r\n\r\ni am a licensed private pilot and have been flying with my son for several years.  the area where we saw the fireballs (mars, pa ��� seriously, no joke there, it is mars, pa 16046) is under the outer ring of pittsburgh���s class b airspace with a 4,000 ft floor.  we often fly over this area and are conscious of that altitude.  these objects appeared to be below the 4,000 asl floor (our elevation here is approx.. 1,100 ft asl).  i would estimate the altitude of the fireballs to be approx.. 3,000 ft asl.\r\n\r\nthe fireballs made no sound at all and were moving far too slow to be aircraft.  these did not have aviation position lights, nor were there any lights of any type other than the brilliant bright constant fire red glow.  the glow appeared to be front facing, as it would dim as the orbs moved across the field and the orientation changed, such that as they were moving directly away they were entirely invisible.  however, if the angle changed you could see the light as if from the side.  \r\n\r\nthere was no wind, and temperatures were in the high 30���s or low 40s.  the orbs were moving too fast to be drifting on the wind, but far too slow (and quiet) to be any airplane (an ultralight would move faster, and would be noisier).  all of the orbs were maintaining altitude and trajectory as they flew in a line.  we watched for 5 minutes, as all of them moved across the sky and then vanished.  we thought we saw a line of red lights later moving generally west to east about 5 miles off to the north, but we cannot say for certain that these were the same object.\r\n\r\nwe noticed two aircraft after the incident, which seemed to be general aviation planes.  one was moving to the west, and the other was moving south to north.  both seemed to be under pittsburgh���s class b airspace, and were behind the orbs in both time and space.\r\n\r\napologies for the shaky video.  although we didn���t get the trail of the orbs, there are some solid shots of the orbs in the video.  i attempted to get structures and objects in the foreground to give reference points, but this may have been at the expense of a better video.  at one point my son says he hears a low buzzing noise, but we later determine this to be a household heat pump or air conditioner.\r\n\r\ncheck the video at 58 seconds.  it appears to have structure and almost as if there is something burning off around it. again at 1:00 and 1:15 and it appears to be the same structure.  you have to stop the frame as i was moving a bit.  also ��� 1:16 (structure); 2:05 (appears to split); 2:26 (different orb, more yellow color); 2:32 (same structure); 2:36 (planet in background); 3:18 (different orb, same structure); 3:20 (structure, same ���crab��� shape); 3:31 (structure); 3:47 (wing shape); 4:52 (it is moving away and dimming, has appearance of crescent shape); 4:47 (strange blur and object appears to split).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

while on the internet, looking out the window regularly as usual. noticed a few airplanes starting some chem trail activity,and was talking to my mom on my cellphone, with the head set on, and about 6:18pm or so, i looked out the window and up and saw a bright light. i keep my binoculars close by, [at arms length] and just instictively grabed them while listening to mom talk. the light seemed to stay on like a far away handheld spotlight, but then stated moving away from my direction, heading about due west. the light would seen to dim, like when an airplane catches the sun setting in the evening and you can see the reflection from a long ways off. then as the light seemed to dim, i tried to get a focus through my 10x 50 power binoc's, but could only make out an object that seemed to be vauge in shape. i could't make out the shape. it must have been really high up in the sky, because it was way above the chemtrails, and i can always make out the engine configuration on all aircraft, with those binoc's. then the light became brighter yet again, for maybe 15 seconds, and got dim again, and by that time i knew if i had moved the binoculars away from my eyes, i would not be able to see the object again. i watched it untill it went behing the neighbors chimney.   i have seen this type of light in the past, up in the sky, but never had binoculars with me.  i have seen ufo's in the past, but never have reported them.   my first sighting was on nov. 30th, 2003, i believe. i was looking out the window again, and saw an object in the day time, that seemed to appear out of nowhere, and then did a move that would appear to be about 2 inches, at arms length, very quickly, and then it moved in another dirction, again about 2 or 3 inches at arms length. then it just disappeared. but the strangest thing was the thougt that popped into my head, immediatly after that sighting, and the thought was more like a voice saying to me, \" why so surprised, you've always known that they were there.\"   that was the weird part.     i almost never answer my landline phone. it doesn't work very well.

shocked when we got home after 1am. the house was down a very long driveway and had 3 gates that had to be opened and closed to keep the cattle in. i sat on the hood of the car to handle the gates as we got to them. at the middle gate i saw a flash of light and did not think anything of it. everybody in the car could not stop talking about how long the light lasted how bright it was, and why did it take over 4 hours to get home when it should not have taken more than 30 minutes. i have always told them that they were high and the only thing that happened was a falling star and that i was the

had a scar show up on my thigh, i had an irrational fear of letting the doctor see it. a friend was diagnosed with skin cancer, so i went and had a doctor look at it and he said it was an ingrown hair

lone scar on my thigh. \r\n\r\ni have also had an irrational fear of shaving my bikini line. i started spending a lot of time at the pool and talking girl talk with friends, my daughter and sister.

was new years eve, at around sunset. my husband pointed out a light hovering almost directly in front of us in the sky, though it was many miles away further down the freeway. it was a blue light, light blue like the. color of those led blue lights. i noticed right away what he was talking about, because it was not normal to see that kind if light in the sky. i knew it was something special, nothing manmade though.I was holding my phone, but i didnt want to take a pic cause i didn't want to take my eyes off of it. the light, very quickly moved from in front of us to westbound, within seconds it was over by what i would assume was the water over la jolla, but it remained in sight. it hovered there for a few seconds and started down the coastline, and as it did it changed from one light, into two. the two lights both still the same blue color and size started weaving or what i have been describing as frolicking with eachother, almost as if playing with or racing eachother to the left of us down the coast. i had to turn around to see them because the vehicle i was in was moving freeway speeds. i watched the lights untill i couldnt see them any further. i just want to know if anyone else has seen this or reported it because i can't imagine we could have been the only ones. i also wonder what it could have been, i mean obviously it was a ufo to me because i have never

and my flatmate were stood on our balcony in manly (which faces south west towards mosman / sydney cbd) after a night out and we were looking out at the stars when we noticed an oject which was flashing. our immediate thought was that it was an aircraft (plane or helicopter) but after 5 mins or so it was still stationary in the sky and it seemed to be turning around. then we noticed another much smaller bright orange orb to the right. when the larger object turned around there was a clear triangle/boomerang shape which was flashing blue/white/red lights.. the smaller sphere started flashing back. they seemed to be commnicating to each other. we watched this for probably up to 40 mins at least. i actually have never believed in ufos but my flatmate saw exactly the same. to see other eye witness accounts for the same evening which are near on identical reaffirms that we did see something unusual!","distance":"Over One
