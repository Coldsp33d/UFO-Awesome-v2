glow in the dark frisbees. when we stopped the object got dim and almost transparent then quickly move away from us. we were about 500 ft from it and the building it was hovering over was an old folks home and it was half again bigger than the building which is about 250 ft. long.\r\n5)i was completely confused while looking at te object just trying to figure it out. my mother was with me in the car and was extremely upset and just wanted me not to stop but leave asap. it is just a feeling of seeing something that large and that close to us and not being able to recognise what is it. i have never seen anything before and since that day. my mother is 84 yrs. old and hasn't been very talkative about until reciently and i think it maybe because of her religious beliefs. we got home about a mile from the sighting and the radio scanner was going crazy with reports of a ufo in the area. it was just something we didn't talk about after that but the questions are still with me and it's just something i can't forget. i was 16 at the time and since my mther pretty much wanted to forget about it i really never brought it up.\r\n6) the object just quickly moved away and was lost behind the

was getting dark and to the south west, a golden yellow light (perfectly rounded, not jagged or fuzzy) slowly appeared. it was joined by between 6 and 7 other lights over just a few minutes, at different positions, in a line but not perfectly straight.\r\nafter a few minutes the lights had fully reached their maximum brightness, then one by one, starting with the first light to appear, began to move in separate directions. they would make sharp, deliberate turns and change direction, but didn't intersect each other's paths. they moved slowly but consistently as they went, never stopping, jerking or accelerating/decelerating. there was also no noise. they faded out before reaching any horizons or background structure which would have covered them from view.\r\nat the time, my ex-in-law looked at me and told me if i said anything, she'd deny she was there when it happened. she never talked to me about it again, even denying it in front of my ex-wife when i mentioned something had happened outside.\r\ni hadn't given it much thought since then, until i joined the army in 2009. i have seen dozens of different aircraft since then and flares in combat zones. nothing i have seen comes close to what i saw that night. i do not believe they were helicopters (too quiet and stable, wrong light setup) or plane (held position perfectly without drift).\r\nlast year i reviewed a documentary online of lights in the sky. other than not moving in a similar pattern, the footage was identical to what i saw that night, down to the same golden yellow glowing color. to date i have never heard of anything else being reported from that time, but then again i have only looked online and not in-depth.","distance":"Over One

what most would call \"ufos\" on a regular basis since 2004. there appears to be at least 3 different shapes or \"kinds\" of ufos in the sky at any given time. some appear to be solid objects moving silently and swiftly, while others only appear to be made of pure energy, like balls of light, that can pop up like a shooting star. family and friends of mine have also witnessed this as well. the fact that this has taken place for such a long period of time is the reason i am contacting mufon. im 27, male, and currently back in school working on my general eduacation degree. i have seen ufos on a regular basis since i was 19, but have kept quiet about my situation since the first year of my repeated sightings. i dont want to be known as the weird ufo guy. i do feel that i am witnessing one of the most important and groundbreaking events in human history though, and im finally deciding to do something about it. i feel i need to share this information about my experiences with the right people who will respect its importance, and can hopefully get a better understanding of ufos and extra-terrestrials in general. nothing i have seen on tv or read in books can compare to my experiences these past 8 years, and im pretty sure im doing the right thing by contacting mufon. my situation is extremely real, and extremely serious. a revolutionary event is currently happening, and i feel i need to do my part. if you i could get in contact with someone at mufon about my situation i would greatly appreaciate it. thanks for providing this open service. i feel that if i dont share this information to people who take ufos and extra-terresrtials seriously i would regret it. please contact me!

the object on the opposite side of freeway interstate 5. it was moving northward approx 50-60 mph ( traffic was about 70 mph so object appeared to be slightly slower ). it changed direction sudden left towards the south bound lanes and came right over our car, approx 20-50 feet up at the most. i was passenger, wife driving, i turned in my seat to watch it fly right over the semi-truck behind us. totally clear and unobstructed view of tear-drop, in other words, smaller in back than in front. wife thought the front was shaped like a mushroom...Maybe, because it was larger than back end. no lights, no markings but there was some sort of darker rail-shaped apparatus hanging underneath it. for that reason i told my wife i believed it to be some sort of traffic control drone aircraft taking photos. it changed directions once behind us, veering to right, then to left and again each way. whatever it was it was really flying, not drifting. actually i'd have to say it was one of the sleekest beautiful aircraft i have ever seen. in the very beginning of his incident i do remember thinking it looked like a small blimp-balloon used by car dealerships and tethered to a small line on the ground and may have been momentarily stationary at that time, i just couldn't tell because it all happened in the course of 2-3 minutes and it moved along, crossing over us quickly as i mentioned above. i would really like someone to tell us what we saw if it is a known aircraft please.","distance":"21-100
