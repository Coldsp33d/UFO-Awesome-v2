20 minutes performing my yoga breathing exercises. when i was done i opened my eyes and i was facing my open window. in clear view was a star, aspirin sized and completely stationary. to the slight right of this star was what i first thought to be an airplane due to its slow and steady speed and its straight trajectory. almost immediately after i noticed this object it accelerated to a speed i cant explain or understand. at the same time as its mind-numbing acceleration i heard a sound that i also struggle to explain. i have been witness to a shuttle launching and although this sound wasnt as loud, its the nearest comparison i can make with the exception of what i imagine a sonic boom to be. i was suprised that the windows didnt shake. i literally jumped out of my bed as it disappeared and made that sound, i ran to the farthest range of vision that my window accords. it was completely gone. i was and am very frightened although i never felt any realistic threat. i was so shaken up after this that i ran around my house hysterically and couldnt wake either of parents who are very light sleepers. i consider myself to be an open-minded person but also a healthy skeptic. this

emitting from an aircraft.We were in close proximity to a rural airport, so air traffic is not unusual and at first glance we thought it was a helicopter because of the manner in which it was descending. this particular craft was descending vertically without horizontal movement. the ufo descended over a rural patch of homes and hovered approximately 50-100ft over them. after realizing the aircraft was not going near the airport only sitting stationary over people's homes, we decided to turn the car around. upon reaching the site the craft had been hovering we noticed it had ascended significantly to the point of appearing star-like. we drove around the site of homes to look for any sign of evidence or anything that could explain what could have been seen, but nothing was found. while my girlfriend watched the sky we continued to our home approximately 2 miles from the site. once home we got out of the car and observed the star-like craft that glowed much brighter than all other stars and was much larger. while watching the ufo began to glow and had an orange/yellow aura around it for about 30 seconds after which it disappeared. my girlfriend had the best look at this aircraft because she was the passenger. she explains it as disc-like, larger than a helicopter with a white light and red lights on the sides. the surface of the craft was dark and it was quite cloudy that night because of storms, thus making it impossible to get a good look. after the sighting we were scared and curious. neither of us had seen anything like what we saw that evening. we decided to report the event to see if anyone else had a similar experience.

the bright star i usually see high towards the south was there and this was to the left and about 45 degrees lower.  \r\nas i watched the light, i noticed the light changed colors from the golden

were doing a completely unusaul flight paterns while this thing was lighting up the western sky.  lots of helicoptor activity around as well.\r\ni watched this light move and stop and pulse and change

something else, and went back outside 5 or more minutes later.\r\ni looked again to the west and saw the light still there but now moving slightly north west, still a large glowing light.  then in literally seconds or less, it shot out, going higher than the star that  just previously above  was high above it.  then it was like a distant pin of light, then gone completely from the

is this really bright white light. the light was definetly brighter than the stars that where out so i knew it wasnt that or a planet. so while walking the dog im watching this object in the sky and it looks motionless but the light would get dim then go bright. like it was moving up and down. the object was sitting the western horizon and the stars where stright above me so i know im not seening things. i run home to grab my camera and get in my car to follow this bright light. i drove out of the city to tape this thing. all the camera got was a bright light so so shap can be identified but as got to orefield the light was getting dim again like it was moving west. so i drove 2 more miles to a church parking lot and filmed what i could. i parked in a church parking lot to film this bright light and when i parked there the light now looked like a yellowish-white color, but looked like it moved slowly futher away. so after minutes of taping my battery died and i left i drove towards home and tried to spot the brigh whitelight but it was gone. by this time its around 8:15 on a friday night so i know a planet would not last for a hour in the sky. now this is the 3rd time i witnessed this and it has to be something.I told my friends and dad and they think i was nuts until i showed the video.

the freeway to ventura county. it was between april 93-august 93, or april 93-august 94.\r\n\r\nclear day. i was passenger, my wife was driving. while heading towards ventura county i spot a \"cloud\" forming about 5,000 feet away, at an elevation of about 500-800 feet. it is forming from a small circle and is expanding into a rectangular cloud, which i estimate from inception to completion was about 30 seconds. i ask willow my wife, to look at it and demand she pull over. she does so. we both get out of the car and look up. it is about 800 feet away, at an elevation of about 500 feet. the cloud is not moving. it simply looks like a rectangular cloud i estimate between 50-80 feet long, by 20-30 feet.\r\n\r\nas we are staring at it, i did notice other drivers pull up and stop, too.\r\n\r\nafter about 10 seconds, a ball appears from the cloud. it is a perfect ball. it looks sort of copper/brown in color. no lights. no sounds. it moved up about 50 feet and then darts west of my view about 600 feet within less than 1 second in a curve s now it is about 800 feet in the air. it stops and remains stationary for about 3 seconds then drops down 400-500 feet (so it is momentarily about 300 feet from the ground and loops back up and heads into the cloud. this manouver was faster than the first and took less than a second, too. \r\n\r\nthe ball was about 30 feet i guess in diameter - though oddly, i seem to recall it slightly of a larger diameter than the cloud.\r\n\r\nit \"hit\" the cloud while accelerating - but nothing came out to other side. no sonic crack - nothing.\r\n\r\nover the next 30 seconds the cloud \"vaporizes\" and simply evaoprates. there is nothing there.\r\n\r\nmy wife and i (divorced now) were religious as we did not want to discuss it after we saw it. i know others saw it, too - as they were parked watching, but we did not speak to them, we drive off.\r\n\r\ni thought i would finally report it as to this day - depsite me being very anti-religious and very oriented in the sciences, the fact remains it was real and happened in broad daylight. there must be others who have since reported this incident.\r\n\r\nthis is the first and only ufo i have ever seen.\r\n\r\nthank you for your time.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with

windy (gusts hit 40 mph according to local npr station). i turned on the radio to listen to npr while i smoked and leaned over to roll down the passenger side window (which was not in the direction of the wind). when i rolled it down i noticed a bright star like object that appeared.  it materialized out of thin air.  it became brighter until it reached its full luminosity. it hovered for about a couple of seconds then began to move. the object was in the direction of the south-west and then moved towards the east or south. it looked far away, and i could not tell if it was moving south or east from that distance. it moved very slowly, like watching a high altitude jumbo jet flying far, far off int he distance. there were no contrails, however. it's speed and velocity could not be verified by me. after traveling in a straight line for about 10 to 15 seconds, it stopped, and then became much brighter, and simply disappeared. i looked in that same direction for a minute or two to see if it would reappear but it did not. the location i witnessed it at is near the sacramento international airport where one can see several or more southwest airlines boeing 737-300s taking off and landing. they fly much closer to the ground than this object seem to be, and high altitude jumbo jets that fly over sacramento i have noticed take the same flight paths, which was not were this object
