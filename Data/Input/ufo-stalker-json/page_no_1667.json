became very bright again and then eventually disappeared completely.  just as it had disappeared for good, all of i sudden i see several miles across to the left of where it had been, a very large

helicopters or planes over the pacific ocean in the area when this was happening.  i don't know if any of them were just passing through or were actually \"following\" this object(s).  i have seen

facing south.  out of the corner of my eye, i saw what first appeared to be a bright star to the west of us.  when we first parked, it was blocked by the top of a tree, but it caught my attention when it seemed to get brighter.\r\n\r\ni focused my attention on the object and it noticeably moved from side to side horizontally.  the object's movements would change, first just sitting stationary, then drifting back and forth horizontally, with the occasional bob vertically.  it didn't move particularly fast, but the movements seemed erratic.\r\n\r\nwe originally considered that it might be a helicopter or a small plane, since the flagstaff airport was close by and in the same general direction, but there were no other lights on the object and the movements seemed too odd for a conventional aircraft.  the object itself was bright white, and glowing like a star.  there were no other colors of light, nor any blinking or pulsing.\r\n\r\ni suggested it might be some sort of kite with a light on it, since the movements of the object seemed restrained, like a kite would in a strong wind.  we also considered a laser or spotlight beam, but there was no tail to the light and the cloud cover was very light.  in addition, the light seemed to come from the object, and was not a reflection.\r\n\r\nany other ideas i had that it might have been something tethered to the ground disappeared when we pulled back onto lake mary road and started to head back to flagstaff, around 10:30pm.  from where we were parked, the light seemed to be over lower lake mary, so we figured we'd get closer to it as we drove down the lake.\r\n\r\nhowever, as we drove further west, the light seemed to first maintain a distance away from us, then seemed to pick up speed and slowly drift away.  it got smaller and smaller, and i eventually lost sight of it as we entered more heavily populated residential areas.  the combination of the distance, as well as the added lights from the streetlamps made keeping an eye on it nearly impossible.  i lost sight of it around 10:40pm.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with

try and get a better look at the lights. at this time i noticed a very faint disk like shape around the light, and a second smaller light that did not flash. the smaller light was only visible for a brief moment and then it disappeared, but the flashing light could still be seen. the flashing light would change from a white, to a dark red, to a red-orange color. the flashes at times seemed occur sequentially, but would occasionally flash randomly. the fact that the lights never moved at all tells me this could not have been a plane because planes are incapable of remaining still. i knew it could not be a star because stars to not flash. i also do not believe it was a helicopter because it would make sense for a helicopter to remain in the exact same place that long. i got frightened

City","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My son i and have taken a trip from iowa to the lake mead recreation area near bullhead city, arizona. we are camping at the katherines landing location which is north of davis dam and about 6 miles north of bullhead city, az. we arrived here on the 27th of january and are still here as of submission of this report.\r\n\r\nbeing amateur star gazers we have taken advantage of the excellant conditions for night sky viewing on several occasions using a telescope. many times at night while moving about the campsite, my son, myself or both of us will take a few minutes to observe the night sky with the naked eye. on one night in particular, during the early morning hours of tuesday, february 21 at approximately 12:30 a.M. mst i had just finished some chores before going to bed. since it was a clear, moonless night i decided to take a few minutes to view the sky before sleeping. while scanning the sky i noticed a light at approximately 10 degrees above the mountain horizon a few degrees east of north. the light was a significant distance from my location, estimating it to be at least 15 to 20 miles away as if you were viewing a distant aircraft beacon. it looked mostly red with a little white-ish component and had a radiant variance. at first i thought it to be nothing more than a common aircraft one would see at night accounting the radiant variance to be the effect of low angle viewing. the light did not strobe on and off as do most aircraft. appearing to be stationary for the short time, maybe 20 to 30 seconds of viewing, i made the determination it was not a star or planet. then to my surprise the light moved upward a few degrees then back down to it's original position in maybe 4 to 5 seconds at the most. thinking this to be odd it now had my full attention since to move that amount from the distance i was viewing meant it had to be traveling at a significant velocity as well stop and start. continuing to watch, approximately 20 seconds later the light moved again in the same upward direction at the same speed as before but this time it came downward in a slight arcing diaganol ending up just east of its original position by the width of about a fifth of its upward movement at the same position above the horizon. a couple of seconds later it moved to the left(west) traveling at the same rate of speed it went upward going approximately 3 times the distance that it had traveled upward, stopped and came back to its original position at a slightly faster speed. as it remained stationary i ran to my vehicle to grab a set of binoculars for a closer look and to tell my son, who was also in the vehicle using his laptop computer at the time, about what i had observed. hurrying back with my son the light was still in the same location. i viewed it through the binoculars. the image was larger than with the naked eye but still quite small. the light now looked to be composed of three colors. blue on top, white-ish in the center and red on the bottom but not well defined as the image was still too small for more detail. i gave my son the binoculars to view it. while he looked for about half a minute the light moved again this time to the right(east). it appeared to move at the same speed and distance as it had done to the west and came back to its original position with the abrupt stops at each end of its travel. this event is now about 10 minutes into it and having witnessed a couple more times of the up-down, side-to-side movements with the exception of one east back to west movement, in which the travel back was a wave-like motion. deciding to get yet a closer look, i left my son with the binoculars to keep an eye on it and went to my tent to get our telescope. i set up the telescope and sighted in the light while it was stationary. the image was larger than the binocular view and now the colors more defined but no detail of a craft. could now see definite blue light radiating from the top third, a white-ish yellow light in the middle that radiated less than a third part and the remaining bottom part which was more than a third as a bright red. the telescope image gave better detail of the light. it was very intense with a variable radiance, spherical with no defined outside edge, just fuzzy or almost intensly sun-like radiant. we're now about 20 minutes into this experience when the light starts an upward ascension at a slower rate of speed than what we previosly observed, slow enough that i could make fast enough adjustments to keep it in the eyepiece. the ascension required equatorial adjustments to the east until reaching approximately a 45 degree angle to the horizon in which it disappeared or i lost track of it in the night sky. total time of sighting lasted approximately 35 to 40 minutes.","distance":"Over One

spot.  i fish here often.  there is one small, unoccupied cabin on the pond.  an undeveloped old logging access road cuts through a very steep mountain side.  there is swamp that turns into a valley, more mountains a mile or two in the distance to the west.  there is on occasion a house light about a mile or more away on a mountain top that is visible on nights without fog and a radio tower about half that distance with multiple red and hot white lights that blink regularly (to the sw).  \r\n\r\nit was a very clear and quiet night, though it is always quiet.  it was between the hours of 10pm-1am.  it was so clear that the moon illuminated the earth around me - i didn't need my headlamp.  the pond is so remote you can not hear or see any car traffic/lights from this spot.  air traffic is not regular, but not uncommon.\r\n\r\ni was paddling across the pond to the side away from the road, traveling nw when i saw in my peripheral vision, from the north a light in the sky.  i stopped paddling to take a look.\r\n\r\nthe light was bright round-orb like, hot blue and white - star like - about four times as bright as polaris.  it almost looked like an electric fire, incredibly hot colored pulsating light-but not in frequency, but in the color.  it had no tail, trail indicating its flight path.  it appeared from the north, over the trees on the horizon .  it seemed high in the sky, similar to that of a high flying military plane. it made a sweeping arc southward.  it appeared to be slowing as it moved across the sky.  it was almost at the peak of the dome that it came to an abrupt stop.  this thing was still moving at considerable speed, then bam! just stopped.  i was looking right up at it, head cocked back wondering \"how the hell did that stop - looks like it hit a wall in the sky\".  it stayed there for a second, maybe two and vanished.  it just wasn't there.  this took about a half minute, maybe less.  no sound, not a thing else and it was just gone.\r\n\r\ni was awe struck, sitting in my little canoe looking up at the sky.  when i went home, about 45 minutes later the gravity of what i could've seen really hit me.  i felt anxious - an i was afraid.  i don't know what i saw.  i just know i saw something and that is what was most frightening to me: no explanation.\r\ni don't drink when i fish and i am very responsible and consider myself a safe and

my phone, when a bright light caught my eye in the sky.  bright enough to bring my attention away from my bright phone.  there were some clouds in the sky, minimal and fast moving, my initial thought was that it was an airplane.  i knew there were no stars that large, and no stars that bright in that part of the sky.\r\n\r\nsince i thought it was an airplane, i was waiting for the small puff of cloud to move out of the way, or expected to see it on the other side of the cloud.  this did not happen.  instead, the bright white light faded as if it were moving away.  after the cloud moved, there was nothing at all in the sky except for stars.  right after it faded, i heard a dog barking uncontrollably.  it was from a dog that i do not usually hear barking.  i heard it's owner outside trying to calm it down.  i was still looking up at the sky, and i saw a \"shooting star\" beam across the sky coming from the point of where the bright light faded.  after this happened, the dog stopped barking.\r\n\r\nthe object was a bright white light that i noticed large, then become smaller as if it was moving away.\r\n\r\ni felt perplexed by this event, as i am familiar with what

meteorological phenomenon that causes the moon to appear orange with an aura, and it was cold and still dark when i woke up),i woke up for work around 5 am. i always go outside first thing to have a cigarette and let the dog out. i looked up because i like to see the stars when the city lights aren't so bright, and there isn't much else to do that early in the morning when you are just outside to have a cigarette. i saw a very large object directly over my next-door neighbor's house and partially over my back yard. it appeared to be very low, maybe 100 feet or so, just high enough to clear the oak trees in my yard. at that distance, it appeared to be between 60 and 150 feet across at it's widest point. our lots are about 60 feet wide and it seemed to cover my next-door neighbor's house, part of my yard, and part of the neighbor on the other side of my next-door neighbor's house. it made no noise. it didn't even bother the dog, she paid no attention to it. it looked like a triangle, based on the three bright white lights that seemed to be on the corners. the lights did not seem to actually illuminate anything. my yard remained dark. i don't know how to describe the surface except to say that it was not a reflection of anything, but at the same time, it didn't appear to be a solid surface. it looked more like a projection of the night-sky above it,including cloud movement, looking up from underneath. it moved very slowly, impossibly slowly. i watched as it moved even more slowly than a person can walk. i almost thought i was seeing things. i went inside to get another cigarette, figuring that if it was gone when i came back out, i had just imagined it, or something. when i came back out only a second or two later (i kept my cigarettes right by the back door)it was still there, still moving at the same pace. so i kept watching it. honestly, i can't remember seeing it actually go away. i watched it for so long that i think i got tired of watching and went inside to take my shower and get ready for work, though in retrospect, i can't imagine why i didn't keep watching until it was gone, or why i didn't try to take a picture, or even why i didn't wake up my husband. i didn't even tell him when he did wake up because i guess i thought it sounded crazy. but i just kept thinking, \"i saw it. i know i saw it.\" i finally did tell my husband a couple of months later, and my closest friend maybe a year ago. we don't really discuss it. i have never told anyone else, but i can't let go of the experience. that it happened, i have no doubt. what exactly it was, i have no idea. i am only sharing because it continues to creep into my thoughts to this day, and i thought that maybe my experience might have some value as a record of similar experiences or maybe be consistent with other reports in the same area, around the same time.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

midnight on february 4th, 2012 when i turned around to take a picture of them with the pier in the background. i noticed a \"reddish-orange flaming ball-shaped\" object in the sky to the south of us. at first we thought it might be a plane or helicopter due to the speed, except that it was not blinking, and it changed course, similar to the shape of a question mark, as it headed from east to west

cloudy that night, but not completely overcast, and the object was clearly visible below the clouds until it sped away, never to be seen again. if it was a plane, it would have followed a course in an

in september or october 1982, i went outside of my parents house to go see my sister who was babysitting up the road. i was  17 at the time. we lived in a rural area and could see all the stars, so, like always, i looked up  and soon realized that a portion of the stars were blocked out. i soon realized that there were \"four stars\",very far apart, rotating in a circle hovering right above me and slightly to my left. there was no sound. i called out to my mother, but she couldn't see it. i felt it was probably as big as a football field, but i'm not sure how close it was to me and the black part was not really something one could see, it was just blocking the stars, so i realized that it was a large rectangular object with a light at each corner, about as bright as the stars.  my mother asked me if i was still going up the road, but i wasn't sure, because now i was scared. she went back in the house. i think it could read my mind or intentions, because the split second before i made the decision to go, it moved over the road and waited for me. as i walked and ran up the road, the object moved ahead of me,or to my right, but stayed very close. it was like it was escorting me to where i was going. when i was about one house from my sister, it moved over the house where she was and hovered spinning over the back door. this was the door everyone used, but how would it
