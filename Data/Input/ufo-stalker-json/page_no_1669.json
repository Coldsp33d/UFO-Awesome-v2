hour i continued to observe them in the low southern sky. the night was clear, but this phenomenon seemed to have a cloud associated with it and repeatedly came from 2 distinct locations. i got out our leitz 10x binoculars in an attempt to see better what was going on. it seemed like gigantic arc welders were illuminating the sky with varying blasts of very intense light. there was no sound associated with the lights. i began observing this @ 2:34 am and it continued for longer than the 70 minutes i stayed awake watching. i was uncertain whether or not some of the light blasts had star-like movement associated with them and decided to look elsewhere in the sky when i detected a brightest star in the sky almost 180 degrees away from the lightning like display. when i first looked at this light with binoculars i thought my hands were shaking because of its movements, so i braced my hands and binoculars against the house and then realized that none of the other stars were moving, but that this one had rapid, tight movements and color changes associated with it. i observed it \"drifting\" in the sky while wildly darting and spinning in a fairly tight circle and there were always color changes going on at the same time. the shakiness and pinpoint intensity of the light reminded me of a hand held laser pointer but all the light appeared to be emanating from the source as opposed to being projected.\r\n\r\ni finally awakened my wife, handed her the binoculars and asked her to tell me what she saw. her description corroborated my observations and we are both convinced that we witnessed a phenomenon outside any normal celestial observation that has no logical explanation. this sighting remained in the sky without interruption until i went back to

while standing outside on a deck. i was taking my dogs out at the time and often watch the night sky. i first noticed it due to its non-ordinary appearance. i really had no explanation of what hte object was, just that i knew it seemed odd.\r\n\r\nthis is the report i sent to [name redacted/cms/tg] at [site redacted/cms/tg]\r\n\r\ni saw it first coming from the north traveling southward. the object was moving slow and had no sound. it seemed to be quite large in the sky and had no other color other than orange. it then got to about almost an eastward viewing still at about 60-70 degrees overhead and began to fade (almost as if it were gaining a lot of altitude). it took about 10-20 seconds then disappeared all together. i know the report you have says it describes 13 objects, but i only witnessed this one.\r\n\r\ni knew it was not an aircraft that is known to me and was not a meteorite or shooting star. the best way i could describe it when i first saw it was a glowing orange sphere and about the size of a soccer ball in the sky. it seemed close, almost like that of a helicopter in regards of distance.It wasnt until it was about 2/3rds of its visibility that it got smaller and faded.\r\n\r\nunfortunately i have no evidence of this, just my eye witness report. my wife was at home but she works third shift. i did run in the door at one point to wake her, but by the time

shower(he didn't know that i smoked, and was apposed to my mother smoking).  we went around to the south-west side of the house and leaned our backs to the wall, standing side by side under the eve, about a foot apart.  i felt my mother tense up next to me and she started to hit my arm frantically, remaining silent, i looked over at her at once to find her staring straight up with her jaw wide open.  i followed her gaze into the sky, then my jaw fell, directly above us(we were actually under an oak tree that had lost it's leaves for the year as well) was a large black sillouette of a triangle with strange blue-silverish round lights on all three corners and one slightly larger in the center.  it was less than 100 feet above us, it hovered what seemed like was just above the 50-60 foot oak tree, very close.  not only was it silient, but the lights on the object never reached the ground, the area was not lit, no shadows out of place.  the lights were a strange blue and almost looked like there was a liquid texture to them that kinda swirrelled behind the lens, but as i said they didn't actually \"shine\".  the center light remained stationary while the three outer lights blinked in succesion, giving the illusion, i think it was an illusion, that it was spinning, i remember trying to decide if it was or not.  i think i remember some straight lines, and right angled lines on the bottom, but mostly it was a black sillouete.  we both stood there staring at it silently for a while, mesmurized.  i would estimate no more than five minutes elapsed.  then i heard a strange noise, it was my mothers voice trying to escape her throat.  it started as a deep gutural sound that strained from her chest, i remember thinking it seemed to come out really slow and forced but she finally managed to scream: donald!(my fathers name).  this snapped me out of my trance and i heard a commotion in the house, wich i realized was my dad rushing out of the shower and sprinting through the house to the front door upon hearing his wife call his name in that manor.  just as i heard him aproach the door the object exploded into a perfect ring of red, blue, and green capsules of light.  my mom and i both yelled whoa! at the same time. it turned into a little red blinking light and sped off as my dad flung the door open, naked as a jay bird with soap in his hair and toso.  by this time i was yelling at my mom \"oh my god what was that\"  completely amazed and excited, we ignored my dad who had just sprinted from the shower to see a red blinking light speeding off.\"thats an airplane,\" he told us noncholantly.  our excitement quickly convinced him otherwise.  luckily in all the excitement he didn't notice the cigarrete in my hand, but neither did i at that moment.  he finished his shower then joined me and my mom briefly in scanning the sky.\r\n  this next part is the strangest part of the story, mostly due to the fact i totally forgot about it for 15 years!  when the memory came back to me(semi recently) it came to me as if i had never forgotten it, i can't remember what trigered it.\r\n  later that same night i woke up with a start(i slept in a small camper trailor about 50 feet from the main house),  i looked out my window and i could see everything in the yard, the light kinda reminded me of when lightning strikes, that silverylight, only it was steady, it didnt even produce shadow it was so bright outside, the yard was truly flooded in light, i didn't actually see the source but i could tell it was from not to far above my trailor.  i closed my eyes and laid back down immediatly, hoping it would be gone when i opened them, but it wasn't.  my only rational thought was to grab my 22 caliber rifle for protection.  isummoned the strength to sit up and swing my legs off the bed and open the cuppoard where i usually kept it.  my heart sank to my toes when i realized it was in the house.  the yard was still saturated with the strange light as i got out of bed and looked out of other windows to make sure.  i paced from one end of the trailor to the other 2-3 times.  i remember thinking to myself with grimm reaization\"i've gotta make it to the house\"  i was certain my dad would know what to do.  i stood at the door of my trailor with my hand on the door lever, but i was so scared i couldn't bring myself to push down.  i cosciencly made an attempt to control my breathing as a stood at the door, the light still bright on the other side of it.  i realized it wasn't going away, so in my mind i decided \"i cant stay out here, i gotta make it to the house!\"  i took several deep breaths and counted to three before i flung the door open and took off in a flat sprint for the house.  i had probably covered 25 feet before i realized it was gone, the light, the fear, the heavy breathing, gone.  the only way i can describe the feeling is like this: you ever go to take a drink of milk but it winds up being kool-ade instead. your sense of taste is almost startled by it, confused.  that probably dosen't make sense to anyone but me.  i stood midway between my trailor and the house in complete darkness and silence totaly confused and disoriented.  \"i'm going in the house anyway's!\" i thought to my self and started off in that direction then stopped, thinking \"what am i gonna tell my dad\" i turned around and headed back towards my trailor a few steps, stopped and thought,\"i should at least go get my gun\" turned back towards the house, stopped again and thought \"why?\" i walked back to my trailor reluctantly and laid in bed for hours, wide awake staring ou the window, but nothing else happened.  then i forgot the entire event until i was 31 years old (i was sixteen when it occured) ","distance":"21-100

when i noticed what look liked a bright star or airplane headlight. i got out my 10x binoculars to view the object up close to see if it was moving. when i noticed that it was moving relative to the stars i thought i would see its strobe light since it was probably an airplane. when i didn't see any strobes i continued to observe the object through the binoculars. \r\n\r\nmy next thought was that it must be the space station as it was too bright to be a satellite. the object moved about the same speed as an airplane. as it moved closer i noticed two bright orange colored lights underneath and to the rear of the object. when it was almost overhead, and when i managed to keep the binoculars very still i noticed a faint blinking red light in the center of the object. it seemed to be a triangular shaped object with two orange colored lights in back, one faint blinking red light in the center, and one bright white light in the front. it was too dark to make out any features. \r\n\r\ni lost sight of the object when it flew overhead. no sound. i looked online to see where the current location of the space station was. when i found out is was still west of me i knew it

was brighter than all the stars in the sky but not bright enough to notice it illuminating the ground around us. the light remained stationary for a couple seconds while my girlfriend and i reaffirmed that we were seeing the same thing. the light looked to be about 500 feet above us at about a 60 degree angle which would place it over the lake. the white light turned off and a light blue light remained, then the craft made a reverse \"j\" manuever that no human craft i know of would be capable of and then it zoomed out into space, faster than any human craft i know of. the strange thing about this is that neither of us felt any fear during or after the experience. it really seemed like they wanted us to know they were there. i am sure they were watching us for a while before we

we observed a ufo. i am 58 years old, and by profession i am a child welfare case manager. she is 60 years old and a retired school board employee.\r\n\r\nwe were on the deck by the (open air)pool, i was watering plants and we had the dog out to take care of her business before we went in to watch a movie. my girl friend saw the object first and said tom look look what is that ????? she was pointing the the north east corner of the back yard sky.\r\n\r\nshe was pointing to a bright orange fire colored object that initially looked v-shaped or winged. i responded to her saying that looks like a plane on fire, because outside of the orange fire it looked to have some kind of winged shape. the object appeared in the east sky, its difficult to guess the distance but it was in the sky at about 120-140 degrees. she said when she initially saw it and started calling for me to look it was standing still. it is hard to describe the size, other than to say it was easily seen by the naked eye, if you held your arm out and made a fist looking out to the horizon this would represent the size of it. \r\n\r\nas we stood there in amazement, we quickly realized it was not a plane on fire, the object moved west ward in a straight line, at a slow rate of speed, i ran inside and got my binaculors, which took 10 seconds, when i came back the object was moving and then the object appeared to be stationary and hovering. this lasted for at least 30 seconds. it hung there so long, my girl went in to get the camera, when she did this, the object began moving again away from us to the north. when she got back with the camera is was moving away and up into the sky northward. it kept going until it disappeared. we did not get a picture of it. when i observed it thru the binoculors while it was stationary i did not see the winged shape which it first appeared to us it had. it appeared to be round or disk shaped with the burning orange fire colors.\r\n\r\nthe object had a unique fire ball orange-red-yellow color, like a setting sun, which is why at first it looked like a plane totally engulfed in flames. it made no noise, it left no trail. it is difficult to guess how far away from us it was in the sky. best guess is less than a mile. it was at aproximately 120 to 140 degrees on the horizon as we observed it.  when it moved away it went on a gradually rising trajectory until it disappeared. it was not a plane on fire, it was not a rocket launch i checked the nasa site there was no launch. it was a ufo.\r\n\r\nthe total encounter lasted aproximately 3 minutes. we are just normal people that pbserved something highly unusua.  we had just finished dinner and basically were in the back yard like we are on many many nights walking the dog and hanging out for 15 -20 minutes.

moving in a repetitious path on some kind of aircraft.  the central light was yellowish, but it had a bright red cone of light around it, not unlike a laser light show.  the red cone did not extend much past the yellowish light and circulated with it.  it travelled east to west for a few minutes and then began to head north at which time the lights faded.  i would chock it up to a helicopter with a searchlight, but is was too high up ( just under the clouds) and it's light was not circulating in a pattern consistent with a localized suspect search (we have police helicopters flying over our house all the time).  i have never seen any aircraft with lights like i witnessed, nor circulating in the way that i saw, and we have many aircraft flying overhead or nearby.","distance":"Over One

in the sky. at first i thought it was a plane since its normal to see them around here, but as it keep moving forward the light got stronger and brighter so i noticed it wasnt a plane considering that planes haver red, white blue lights flashing. when the light was almost in front of my bedroom window it blink twice and then dissapear. after that i went running downstairs to get a camera and got back to my room hoping to see something else, and i was really lucky cause a couple of minutes later the light appear again near from where i saw it the first time and then it kind of follow the same path but this time it was like descending until it look like it went behind some houses.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
