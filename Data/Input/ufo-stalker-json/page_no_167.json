was on my vacation on korkyra island in croatia (europe) and like every morning i take a ride to the town to get a coffee. i saw a beautifull sunrise above the old town so i stop the car and take a photo with my iphone. it has live photo and makes two pics in one second. in my iphone im able to click to each photo and then a have a few frames to see before the final photo is shown (like a mini video, a cool feature).\r\nand that was it.\r\nafter few days i want to post some photos on fb so i started to search the best...And then i notice something strange - i've had two pics, one is normal and on the other it pops up some flying object from nowhere. i was confused because i didnt remember that i saw something like that when i take a shot. i was concentrated to make a nice photo, there where a lot of sun, and i wanted to make it quick because i was at the road with my car. the photos were taken just outside the town of korcula, with a nice view to the monastry of st. nikola. both photos are taken in a fraction of a second and has this \"video efect\" so it is very clear that ufo on second photo appears out of nowhere. when i realize that maybe i have something interesting i was so excited so i went to my husband to show the photos. he is an amateur but passionate photographer and he was astonished. after closer examination he concluded that this is no some anomaly on lens or something and it seems that definitely it is a real flying object. when you use the iphone feature you can see the movement of the bird in the beam of light in the position above the object so you can actually see the quick time that passed from the moment the 2 photos where taken and also clearly the moment of the appearance of the ufo. it seams to us that this is a small spaceship or a small explorer ship used just for expeditions from a mother spacecraft. it is hard to say what is the size of the flaying object but is sems to us that is abut 3 or 4 meter. if you look at other elemnts on the photos and compare it the ufo you will see that the bright and dark regions are just perfectly fitting, refecting the sun correcly since it seam that the ufo is flying at a small angle and little descending, too. precisely because of that angle there is light reflecting from the ufo, the most from behind and some also on the front forwards. the strong light reflecting from the back side must be from some highly reflective material and it seams to us that this could be a part where the propulsion system is located. the small reflection of light on the front it seams that this is from the cabin. we also applied several filters to the photo to see how the ufo object looks comparing to other objects and everything  is looking perfecly normal. \r\n","distance":"101-500

up. but this sighting sticks with me the most. my mum lives roughly a 10 minute walk from hollingbury golf course in brighton, uk. from the window at the top of the stairs, we had a good view of it. my brother noticed a green light moving back and fourth along the path of the golf course. there is a dew pond at the far end. it kept going to that, then back about half way. it was a green light, dancing in a circle. then it would move back to the dew pond. this went on for about 30 to 45 minutes. then it flew over to falmer, near to where brighton and hove albion's football stadium is now. then it came back to the dew pond and carried on doing what it did before. dancing in a circular motion. \r\n\r\nafter, it flew over to the race course. the light turned red. it stopped completely for a few minutes. then shot into the sky in a diagonal line. it came back to the golf course. the whole time, me and my brother were outside on the driveway. my cousin was freaked out and stayed in the house. my mum was a sleep on the sofa because she had a migraine. if this wasn't strange enough, on my life, it hovered above the house completely black. no lights. but it was the shape of a helicopter, no sound. me and my brother looked at it for about 5 minutes. if you put the house, or 2 houses on top, that was how high up it was. i dont have the best eyesight. but it was close enough for me to see the outline of it. then it went back to the dew pond and moving back and fourth again.\r\n\r\ni remember being excited about what i was seeing. i tried to record it on my phone. but the cameras back then weren't the best. i was calm throughout and weren't scared at all. not even when it hovered above the house. but, after writing this, and no matter how many people i tell my story to. i can never remember how it dissapeared. \r\n\r\nthis isn't the only story i have. my brother messaged me a week later to tell me it was back. my mum has stories. my friends who grew up with me on that street have stories. winter months, october to january are the most active. there is a flight path for planes over that way. but this object was above the trees on the golf course. it was not a plane, or helicopter. it was just the shape of a helicopter. the way it was moving wasn't like anything i've ever seen. only on star wars. it was a clear night. i can remember a lot in great detail.
