the sky. as i was approaching the traffic light to get on 75, an object in the sky caught my eye through my windshield, west and slightly south of my position. first thought was a plane. dayton intl airport and wright-patt afb nearby, see planes all the time. quickly realized it wasn't a plane. maybe a helicopter, i thought? definitely not, because it would definitely have been close enough to see the typical features, but this was only a sphere. it seemed a little hard to focus on, not sure if due to distance or some other factor, but it seemed just slightly out of focus. not blurry, per se, but a very slight haze. i could see enough that it looked like a gray/sivler metallic surface that reflected the bright sunlight. saw no features like windows or anything else. having no idea of the actual size of the thing, it's really tough to guess at distance from me. as i looked at it i fully expected it to become apparent that it was something i would recognize as it turned, got closer, or something. but it just seemed to stay stationary, with no apparent motion and never changing from a sphere shape. as as idea of the size of what i saw, when you see the moon during the day, i would say if you put this object in front of it in the sky, the object would have covered nearly a quarter of the diameter of the moon. it wasn't a tiny spec, there was something in the sky that i had never seen before. i looked at it for maybe as long as 8 seconds, then shifted focus to traffic as i came to a stop at the traffic light. my 10-year-old daughter was with me and as i came to a stop i intended to joke with her like \"hey it looks like a ufo up there\" because as i said i expected it to become something ordinary. maybe 2-4 seconds after taking my eyes off of it, we were stopped at the light and i looked up again, ready to make my ufo joke. it was gone and left no sign behind it. again, it wasn't a spec that i just couldn't track down again. it was a definite, visible, sizeable object that would've been easy to relocate if it was anything i'm used to seeing. i looked hard, and continued to look over that entire area of the sky as i got onto 75. nothing. nada. completely gone. didn't see it fly away, vanish, etc., so i don't know what it did, but it was completely gone just a couple seconds after i had watched it hover for a number of seconds. didn't mention it to my daughter because i knew she hadn't seen anything. just kept thinking it over as i continued driving, realizing i had just seen something highly unusual and unexplainable. just fyi, while open to the idea there could be \"others\" i've never seen anything like this before, nor do i spend much time thinking about it or gazing at the sky. but this thing caught my attention and there is no way i can write it off.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":35920,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.0407882,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02182012-0018","longitude":-84.1948267,"occurred":1329516600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1329636160000,"summary":"Hovering

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"A friend and i were fishing at lewisville lake, in denton county, late at night. sometime after midnight, approx., we saw a bright, vertical line of white light forming in the western sky.\r\n\r\nthis line was slowing moving towards us and as it did, it seemed only the front edge was moving and leaving a long rectangular plane behind it. within the rectangle were sharp, equal bands of light, in different shades of white, about 7 bands.\r\n\r\nthere were no windows, or any sound. though it seemed to be moving slow and steady, it must have been travelling fast. it didn't glow, like with diffused light, but we couldn't see through it either. it seemed 2 dimensional, with a height of maybe a mile and a width of approximately 500 miles long. right above us, the leading edge of the rectangle made a sharp 90 degree turn to the south, with the remaining part of the rectangle still moving east until it hit that point, at which it bent and also turned to the south.\r\n\r\nwe watched this display for around 10-20 minutes. we never saw any structure. nothing was ever emitted from it. it didn't seem like any kind of craft. it was just like a huge and long light crossing the sky. it finally vanished into the south.\r\n\r\ni've never seen any ufo report similar to this and i never reported it. i can't imagine what it was. 3 days after this event, i was searching the local newspaper, dallas morning news, to see if there was any report on it. there was a small report mentioned about a russian missle that had re-entered the atmosphere over our west coast, travelling east to oklahoma, then turning south, went over dallas, and houston before going out over the gulf and falling into the water.\r\n\r\nmy date and times are only approximate. i clearly remember the event and have grown more and more curious as to what i really saw. i know that it couldn't be any kind of missle or any satellite. it wasn't re-entering our atmosphere, there were no sparks or flames. it was travelling in a continuous direction east and then turning south. it never moved up or down and it only turned at that one point, the rectangle bending around one point so at the same time, there was the leading part heading south and a trailing part still heading east.\r\n\r\ni also approximate the time it took to pass over us. i know it started south long before we ever saw the end of it and we could have watched it for more than 20 minutes or more, or even less. also, i think the event occurred sometime between the mid 1980's to 1990.\r\n\r\ni've had my share of ridicule about this, but it really did happen. i don't make any claim as to what it was, i just don't know, nor do i have anything to compare it to. my only hope seems to be some entity like yours with much greater access to info than i have and active investigators.\r\n\r\ncan you tell me what i saw or at least know of others who also witnessed it or something similar to it?","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with

horses, but my neighbors have pasters that separate our homes. and they have several heads of cattle. for about one month  my adult son and i while outside have noticed these orange/yellow like orbs hoovering to the left of our property. we noticed them because they were so bright, strange in color, not moving just hoovering, and very close to our cabin. we do live close to a small airport, so we are use to seeing planes, but never seen anything like this. no plane can hoover, and if it was a helicopter, this orb was close enough to hear.  they were close enough that i could get pics on my digital camera. last week i counted 7 of them straight in line hoovering behind my cabin and they all disappear at the same time. everytime we see them, they stay for a couple of hours, when i start taking pics or looking thru ir night vision, it will fade away, but come back slowly. but for the last week, this one orb shows up at the same place at the same time. it will fade away then come back, sometimes it gets even brighter when it comes back, but i assume its because its getting closer. it moves and disappers. i stopped my neighbor tonight and told him what we have been seeing, and pointed it out to him. he said \" he knew, him and his girlfriend have been watching it too the last few nights\". 2 weeks ago my son said\" he felt a vibration that felt like it was going thru his chest, then a loud humming. it was so bad he had to cover his ears\". he said\" he was screaming my name, i was right next to him, but i wouldn't wake up. my ex-husband lives 7 miles from us, two days after this humming he also heard a humming that made his head hurt. we had not discused this at all till a week later and found out they both experinced the same feeling and humming. when we looked thru the ir night vision, (this happened to me and my son) a light got real bright in the lense, and my son and i got headaches and sick on our stomachs. when i walk outside now, i have a very uneasy feeling. i know this sounds weird, but i feel like i'm always being watched, its just a creepy feeling. it show up every night!! it just moves away slowly then fades away. it's been a clear night everynight, tonight its cloudy and the orb left early.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then

in a triangle pattern, with a center green blue light with a milde glow in the middle, in a mild cloud cover. thought it might be stars through the clouds, or a house across the valley. but the angle was to great to be a house on the mountain on the other side of the river. i went out at 7:15 and the clouds had moved, the lights were gone, there were no stars in that pattern, and the angle was to high to be something on the mountain. \r\n     when i was looking at it, it was like they were trying to send images telepathically, mentally like trying to communicate. i felt a bit warm, and there was a feeling of electro-magneteic, or dry static elcectricity feeling, with a metalic taste in my mouth.  i do work in a mahcine shop metal working, but this was like the tast of maybe blood taste. if you cut your finger and try to stop the bleeding. that taste. it was like a residue for over two hours after they left. \r\n    the images were of like star patterns, or star charts, like a flight path map you would see of the us and all the flights, connected from air port to airport. also there were symbals, and geometric shapes that i did not understand, or could reporduce, they were very detailed.  it was to intense and fast, like downloading of the inernet very fast. \r\ni feel that i had had a close encounter. \r\nthe vessel was about a mile away approx. 45 deg angle from  where i was, so i would put it at about 3000 ft agl. but i will always remeber the feeling i got, like a hotflash during what i feel was some kind of communication.  i will never forget this experience.","distance":"Over One
