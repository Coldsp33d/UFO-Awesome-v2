(by this time i'm pretty jaded, i have had 8 or  9 other sightings starting about 10 years ago.)  when i got in bed i looked up through the open blind toward where the object was located but could not see the object. before i gave up looking, the object sailed gracefully by my window, from left to right, probably at an altitude of less than 1,000 feet and i estimate about one quarter mile from me horizontally.  the apparent size during the fly-by was 3/4 inch held at arms length. i wasn't excited per se because this is old hat with me, but i was grateful to have been invited to see it.  there is no way i would get up to go to the bathroom and think on my own \"i think i'll open the blinds...\"  it's interesting that none of the ten craft i have spotted in the past ten years is remotely like the others in size, shape or color or behavior.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

object hovering down and sitting above the house acroos the street from my house.It then started to move to the right and wjen this object got to the middle of the syreet it just hovered and stayed in the same place around 15 to 20 minutes.Where i live theyre hardly no ligjts on the streets and whete this huge object was hovering at had no light what so ever and was very dark making it very easy to srr becausr, it was very bright and large in  size. by the way i live is in florida and the small city on the west coast named north port. after watching this object for i would guess anout 20 minutes we noticed this red light to describe it to you it was like an ord or something of that nature.Anyways we seen this red tiny ball like an ord shoot out of it and it went in the direction torwards the left of it.And it just vanished into the air. it was traveling at a very fast speed and as soon as we seen it this red ord ligjt thing vanished as fast as it appeared! then about a minute or two this object  started to move down the street as if it wasdjyst srolli.G through  the neighborhood. since this object was up in the air it was really hard to see its size but, we estimated that it had to be  bigger than 6 or more large houses! as we watched this object move down the street it turned in such a sharp mannor that not even a car cam turn that sharply. and pretty soon this object was out of our vision. now every nigjt since then ive seen this object in the sky just hovering in the same place every night after seening the object i just eplained to you. i used a telescope to veiw this object thay appears to the  naked eye to look just as if it were a star. but veiwing it with a telescope you can clearly see that it has red and blue ligjts that seem to move in the same direction as if were circulating around the object. it is really stange and scary to me to see this object in the sky every night and it has not moved from the same spot all week. it has me thinking and believing that this object might be there during the day to! i would have never even questioned anything about ufos if my own eyes havent seen this object myself!  a lot of scary thoughts have been in  my head since the first night i seen it and i cant help to wonder why is it that there seems to be more and more sighting than ever before.And theres been talks about alien invasions from people up in high places. is it true is something going to happen are we being warned and if this is true how do we or can we even prepare ourselfs for it at all? wake up everyone and look up at the sky above you because, chances are that their up in your skies t. its times to look up and start reporting everything you see and rember uour not alone a lot of people are.Seeing the same objects in thheir skies

normally due since last summer when we witnessed another sighting and was interviewed by the local new 10 crew.\r\n    we have been noticing blinking star like things showing up sometimes in the sky where there was nothing in that location the night before and sometimes we would see more than one making a triangular type shape, blinking, shooting up into the air, or just all the lights would just turn off at the same time and disappear. we bought a amateur telescope and got interested in the stellarium space software so that if we did see something we could check the location and see if it was something that was supposed to be there or not.\r\n   we saw a circle of light and a faint sound and we looked up and my roommate took out his cheap metro pcs samsung phone so he could try to get a better look at what it was and told me it looked like some kind of helicopter.  we do get the life flight helicopters and the police dept helicopters overhead quite a bit...But this was one i had never seen before and as i said there were lights that made a circle on the helicopter...Which i have never seen before.\r\n   right about that time my roommate panned to the left and called me over to look at his screen, and on the screen i could see 1 light come on and then turn off...Then another one turned on and they 1 by 1 turned on and off, then another one turned on and it made kind of a v shape and they stayed on...At that point another light came on but not as bright...After that other ones showed up darting side to side around the others and then would shoot straight up into the air and disappear.\r\n   he was able to get some good pics and we have those avail to send to you...I am a paranormal investigator myself and am very aware that there are many things that happen in our sky's at night which causes me to pay attention and over the years i have witnessed many different ufo's but this is actually the 2nd time in this location that i have witnessed one. the last one i found out later that other people had also witnessed the other one and had reported it as well. i know the importance of evidence in the paranormal world which is why we tried to get whatever pics we could (even though it is not a high grade cell phone camera) in order to be able to show proof of what we saw.\r\n  please feel free to contact me if you need any additional

 as i continued to look at it from where i was standing it seemed to power down some of it's brightness on the bottom and now appeared to me to take on the color of solid white because i no longer felt as uncomfortable as before looking at it and that's when i realized that it was now moving away and getting smaller.  that's when i yelled at my team leader oscar who was down at the other jacketing building [jacketing #1] to look up and out. i also yelled for our new jacketing personnel mona to look!!!

inside lighting up the surface as like you could see through it. not transparent but a light tan skin-like surface. each octagonal surface was outlined to the center to each point of the octagon. no

and faced me so i could see all three objects. the objects then seperated slowly to about 100ft apart. the objects then departed at an incredible rate of speed. the two end ones went horizontal away

and their 6 year old daughter.  we had just left a musical concert at a local church.  \r\ni was driving home on a hill top facing north toward lake eufaula at night and saw a camouflaged oval disk shape with rotating lights moving east across the lake and again moving west. the rotating lights were toward the bottom of the craft.  it appeared as if the outside of the craft had reflectors to be the same as the darkness but the edges were visible and the rotating lights were more visible.  there may have been more than one craft of similar appearance because it went behind some trees and i stopped on the road and turned my lights off to get a better look as there were no street lights or traffic where i was and a craft came back in the opposite direction.  i thought because light was coming out of the bottom of the craft it was looking for something.\r\nthis has been very alarming because something this big should have made big news.  i was looking over the city of eufaula and the craft seemed to be one third to one fourth the size of the entire town.  i have tried to figure out how far it was but it is impossible to know because it was dark.  this would allow me to figure how big it was.\r\nthe next morning a heavy fog was over eufaula and much of east central oklahoma.  this heavy fog has lasted throughout the week especially at night and early mornings.\r\ni have searched the internet to see if others have had a similar experience in this area to no avail.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional

system a massive star-like object that descended horizontally from a 45 degree angle in the night sky and as it did it divided itself into 8 other smaller oval shaped star-like objects glowing with the same intensity and pulsating as they descended so low on the east due east that were no longer in my security camera system line of sight. \r\n\r\n    i have been in the military and in the civilian law enforcement for over 10 years combined and i have never seen a drop of flares that would perform as these lights did. if it was a night-op from the near by air force base performing a drop on some experimental flares, can anyone inform of such event? thank you. \r\n\r\nretired army infantryman and current law enforcement officer.","distance":"Over One
