 i didn't know what it was, but i grabbed my camera and headed out to the back patio to see if i could take a picture on the next pass, if the helicopter came back.  about 8 minutes later it came past again, but farther away again, near the canal, so i couldn't get a good picture.  i waited outside for another 15 minutes, but the helicopter never returned.  it continued off to the east, roughly in the direction of the summit bridge.  about 10 minutes after i lost sight of it, i saw a dim white light moving in a non-linear path, miles away near the horizon near the bridge, but after 15 seconds of moving to the left, then a little up, then back right, then up, it vanished.  i noted that it was near the horizon, because the nearby shadows of the treeline were useful in noticing that it wasn't simply moving in a straight line like a plane would.  in total, my mother said it passed back and forth 8 times in the hour.  we also could not think of a reason why at this time of night, a helicopter would make so many passes over the house, and some of them very low (less than 500 feet), in such a strange pattern, unless it was expressly following the red light.  we both felt very strange about the sighting.  we see airplanes and helicopters all the time, but this was strange, and we had never seen an aircraft apparently following a red light.  the following day (this morning), my mother talked with one of her coworkers, and her coworker also noticed 3 helicopters, in the vicinity, at roughly the same time of night, while driving her children home from a child's birthday party.

exciting 10 months ago i believe was my 1st sighting & wasn't my last.\r\niam out back looked up northwest saw this formation of stars in sky (seen before) and underneath it is a very huge glowing and flikering bright red blue orange star-like object so i set up camera again to capture it & it started to fly up never did that before.I looked around notice above me there was 2 of them flying across the the sky at a very fast and unusual way trying to capture it on video there were too fast,gone.I attempted to record the run away star-like object as i was doing that i i noticed another flying object maybe 20ft from roof top heading in my direction i looked behind me there was another one & the next thing i saw on the right side coming huge bright red and blue lights & flew by it was between my house and the neighbors house it had humming sound i told my boyfriend it looked like a huge potato with strange looking lights on it very strange it was just 10-20 ft above roof top if not closer.Never seen anything like it.At this point i stopped recording because i felt like they knew was recording them a didn't like it.That was my feeling.So go to my front porch sat there and watch couple more passing by.I go to brothers house across town told him what i saw so he comes outside w/me and they were everywhere   explainable flying very low objects some stop and hoovered around.I'am at my brothers house telling him what i've seen already at my house so i took him outside to let him see for himself,they were everywhere more than i saw at my it was crazy.So i decided to stay a little longer to see what i can catch on video i realized they just kept coming what seems like around me like if they didn't want me recording them so i stop went inside for sec then went back outside i told myself iam tripping so i continued to record i sat on porch i'am on second floor is i noticed this huge bright object coming up right behind this huge tree that sits on neighbors side as i looked thru the camera i realized it wasn't just one it had buddies this thing wasn't far from me just next door behind big tree i freaked out cause as i watching this thing at 1st i had heard humming sound then nothing and one min it was huge bright weird shape object then red then gone then it appeared again at one point i heard that humming sound again like it was about to take off.Well that freaked the hell out of me i ran inside told my brother what had happened we went back outside w/camera in hand and as i looked thru the camera i noticed this strange object and decided to zoom in on it to get a better look and that is what this video is so you tell me what u think it is ..............Remember iam on second floor.

then back to its original position. when it first moved i assumed it was a satelite taking an evasive action to possibly avoid floatsom, but its movements became far too eratic, to even be the highest quality of jet. about 20 minutes later i went inside to tell a friend what i was looking at, then returned outside to watch for a few more minutes. when i realized more northeast there was another object of similar design. i looked to the original and it appeared to have a triangular shape now. coming from south east i thought i saw a fast moving jet begin an ascending arc towards the object, but suddenly its lights blacked out. i assume to hide its presense from both us and the object. i then looked back towards the second object and realized it was now also movnig eratically, and then vanished from sight. i came back inside and my friend was now also watching and said he could hear what sounded like several helicopters in the distance, be described them as being too low pitch to be

particular. after completing the blanketing of 5 horses i started back to the house, i looked up and said to myself wow, i don't think i have ever in my life seen so many stars. i starred at them when i noticed a star move quickly to the left, miles to the left then it dropped downwards, i stopped walking, my one dog stood on the right of me the other to the left of me. we starred up at the sky i noticed an object coming over the roof of the house, extremely slow as taking its time, i noticed it since there were millions of stars all around but not within this extremely large oval. once it stopped i saw other circles underneath moving in all different directions, meanwhile i didn't move nor did my dogs. it slowly moved sideways to the next lot went slowly forward tilted upwards at an angle and was gone in a snap but i could see vapor trails and then all the stars disappeared. later in the night i heard an apache helicopter over my house i went outside and no lights were on i said i hear you were are you, then they lite me up hovered me for awhile then followed the exact pattern this ufo did, they then followed the path and landed in the street with their lights off. i saw people running through the desert with flashlights, they closed the roads, trucks were driving down the street with no lights on for months after i kept seeing a silver government car seemed to be following me for a few months. cows did live in the field were the helicopter landed nd there hasn't been any cows there since. i know what isaw and it was real. my two dogs saw it

daughter from a school function around 8:30 pm. as we pulled into our subdivision i noticed directly in front of me what i thought was a plane. i noticed the light configuration was a little different than normal and it was fairly low but other than that i didn't think much of it. it had two strobe type lights on what i assumed were the wing tips and one red light in the center. the white strobe lights blinked a couple of times per second and the red light blinked at a slow but steady frequency. again, i really didn't think much of it but i did notice that it banked to the right and up. i thought that was a little odd but i didn't suspect anything out of the ordinary. as i drove through the neighborhood, i caught another glance of it off to the right and i could tell it was making a looping type circle around the neighborhood. this raised my curiosity. i was trying to figure out why the pilot was making maneuvers in a residential area at night. \r\n\r\nwhen i arrived at the house, i waited for my daughter to remove some items from the car before i got out. i still had the aircraft in mind so i stood outside the car and waited to see if i could view it again. i didn't see it or hear it. as i was about to go inside, i looked up and saw it was flying right over my house heading in a westerly direction. from the back, the two wing tip lights were a amber type color, where before they were strobes (at least from the front). almost the color of a street lamp but not as bright. i could still see the red light on the bottom. the sky that night was partly cloudy, some parts of the sky were clear, while other parts had a cloudy overcast look. i realized looking at the aircraft that i couldn't discern the shape. i was only able to see the lights. the direction it was flying was going to take it directly underneath a blanket of clouds. i assumed once it was under the clouds, it would contrast and i would see the shape. it flew under the clouds but for whatever reason i still couldn't see what the shape was. i could clearly see the lights but could not see what they were attached to. at that time it immediately made a hard bank to the left. now i could see a red light on top as well as on the bottom. the strange part about it was the red lights on top and bottom seemed to be almost touching giving the appearance that it was very thin. there seemed to be very little structure between the two lights. i didn't hear any sound from the aircraft, however the night was chilly and the heating units in the neighborhood were running, so i can't be sure.  \r\n\r\ni'm not sure what i saw, but it was definitely different.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

altitude of commercial jets that frequently fly above the path of the these two objects). after approximately two minutes i lost sight of the first object as it passed behind trees a few yards from my

february 14, 2012 at approximately 10:50 pm (cst) she was on our balcony, in forest park, having a cigarette and facing east when she saw a cluster of black objects emerge over a building in oak park.  at first she thought the black cluster might be balloons ��� more then 10, maybe 20.  the cluster suddenly disappeared and then she saw one round black object take their place.  it was matte black (not reflective), had no lights and made no sound.  it appeared to be about the same size as a helicopter.\r\n\r\nthe object was solid, had a round /orb-like shape, with something spinning on top ��� almost like a rotor.  she has worked in the airline industry for about 20 years, and she is sure this was not a helicopter ��� the shape isn���t the same and moved faster than a helicopter.  the only thing it had in common with a helicopter is some sort of spinning device on top that ���reminded��� her of a propeller. \r\n\r\nthe black object wobbled slightly for only a few seconds as it ascended diagonally, going north by northeast (starting at 30��� to about 70��� or less).    it corrected the wobble and traveled below the cloud cover at a very high rate of speed, maintaining a consistent,

is and walked away.\r\n(thanks dear) the rotating lights stopped and the white lite stayed observed for 40 min it stayed staitnary, the light dimed, might be because i shined a large spotlight in that area direction. i tryed to call neihbor and no anser (he was pissed, at him self) after this sighting nothing else did we see while we lived there. having worked in covert operations new phones were being monitored, if you picked up and started yelling about what you just saw well. dont like being yelled at. and have a daughter.\r\n1984 worked on aircraft till present.","distance":"101-500

i made myself comfortable in an adirondack  chair and waiting for him to pick up the phone, i noticed a very bright object on the sky and that it was moving.  as soon as my friend answered, i told him so he and his wife could go outside and watch (his wife loves star gazing)but almost immediately as soon as they looked at it, it stopped moving.  the next few minutes were a back and forth of \"is it moving?  yeah, i think it is...Wait no, it's not...No wait, it looks like it's movi--no, i guess not...\" suddenly, two more bright (slightly less brighter than the first object)appeared out of nowhere--they didn't appear to fly to this spot, they just suddenly lit up.  the next few minutes were spent watching the three objects clearly interacting with each other. moving back and forth almost perfectly in sync.  after seven or eight minutes, one of the two that appeared last took off to the ese slowly and turned sharply to the s at a high rate of speed, followed moments later by the other object that it appeared with.  the original object hung around and meandered for about five minutes more, before taking off from a dead stop to unbelievably fast speed.

casually observing venus towards the southwest. next to venus was what i thought to be a star at first. when i noticed it was moving i became interested. i didn't know what it was at first. as it got closer to me, at the closest point almost right over head, i noticed that it didn't move like anything i'd ever seen in the sky before. it was slow, and seemed like it was light as air. it bobbed and weaved (subtly) and at one point came to a brief stand still before resuming course. it was yellowish gold/orange. it made no sound whatsoever. it passed overhead all the way to the ene horizon and then vanished from my view. my girlfriend is the second witness. i was extremely excited during this experience. i've wanted to see a ufo ever since i was a little kid. when i realized what i was seeing wasn't a plane, helicopter, meteor, or a satellite, i became as elated as if i'd won the lottery. after 4 to 5 minutes of watching this thing, it just disappeared from my sight like a plane does. it simply got too far away for me to see it any longer.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

my parents. i was sitting on my porch and happened to see an orange orb in the sky. when i first noticed the object, i thought it was the planet venus, but then quickly disregarded that thought because the light being emitted was far to bright to be from a planet or star. the orange orb started about 25 degrees above the tree line then slowly descended to right above the tree line. this still being probably a mile or more from where i was standing it was hard to say though. the object then began to move from left to right at a pretty fast pace quicker than any aircraft that fly through the area. to my best guess the object began slowing down as it crossed over where the interstate is located and began doing something i have never seen. my best description of what the object was doing was projecting a very thin white line with a small ball of white light attached. the weirdest thing about it though was when the orange orb began projecting this light, it seemed to happen like as if i were watching an old time 1900's movie:very choppy or almost flashing. the next thing that happened was my father opening the garage door so i turned around to go get my father and show him this thing because i couldn't believe what i was seeing. before i told my father, what was going on i looked back to see if the orange orb was still there and i am still dumbfounded as to where the object went. i took my eyes off of the light for 5 seconds max and it was gone. i decided not to tell my parents about the sighting for fear of ridicule, and have tried to dismiss the event myself, but i have yet to come up with and answer for what i observed on feb. 14. might i also note that i live 15 miles from charlotte douglas airport and live in an area when every type of commercial aircraft fly day and night. this object was no aircraft it did not strobe emergency lights, there were no additional lights other than the orb, and the fact that there was no sound is also rather peculiar.
