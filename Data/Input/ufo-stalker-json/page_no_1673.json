changing lights of blue, green, yellow,red and white. all the  way home my instincts said go to coopersville, michigan but we went to grand haven michigan hoping we could get a better view from the

10:30pm we didn't have to be convinced so we went home. i looked on the internet and there were no reports for the area.\r\n\r\nthe feelings were exciting. all of us were tired after we ate but got

were sitting right in the middle of a cross road. i was afraid to look out the window cause i thought i might have been beamed  up, but at that time i heard the sound of their space craft it was the same sound that came out of \"lost in space\". i asked for them to appear to me and they did but chickened out when it happened. \r\n\r\nthe next day there were several hundred phone calls that came into the radio station. i also talked to one of the woman that i worked with the next day and she said her son seen a ufo in wyoming michigan and was wondering if she should believe him or not. i told

back from minnesota at the end of the july 4th weekend in 2003, driving southbound on highway 169 north of adel, iowa.  it was around 2:00 to 2:30 a.M. when a deer came onto the road.  both witnesses saw it, and the driver reacted quickly, and felt relieved when he managed to avoid hitting it.\r\n\r\nhe drove on a couple miles and there was an ambulance sitting in the middle of the highway with its headlights and tail lights on, and also turned on were the lights that are used to illuminate an area when emt personnel are working an emergency situation.  the red flashing light was not on.  the driver���s door was open, and the back doors of the ambulance were wide open, but there was no one inside or outside the ambulance.  no one in the area, at all, no working of an emergency situation, and yet, there it sat with all those lights on in the middle of the highway.  the witnesses thought it was strange, but the driver slowly drove his car around the ambulance, and drove on for a couple more miles.\r\n\r\nthen things got stranger.  there was what appeared to be a man standing by the side of the road perfectly still, with his back to the road.  he seemed to be engaged in no activity whatsoever.  there was no vehicle nearby, and there were no farm buildings nearby that would seem to explain his stance, or his presence.  the male witness wondered out loud if they should stop and ask if he needed help, but his girlfriend was really shook up at this point and said ���no, no, don���t stop.���\r\n\r\nwhen they got home that night, they were suspicious enough about what they���d seen to think they should check the time to see if they���d had any missing time, and found that they did get home at the time they expected to.  but, the male witness has always wondered what was going on that night.  and when he attended a ufo adult education class, and there was a discussion of ���screen memory��� incidents, he told investigator trout, so that���s why the incident is being reported now.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":35802,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.6144325,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02142012-0011","longitude":-94.017453,"occurred":1038652200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Iowa","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1329256253000,"summary":"Apparent

a couple who attended trout���s ufo adult education class in january, 2012���..  on september 6, 2011, at about 9:45 p.M., from their car as they drove along their small hometown street in van meter, a male witness and his wife saw a reddish-orange circular light pass from south to north over the town.  they were curious, so they drove north out of town and parked in the driveway of the iowa veterans cemetery a mile north of town.  looking to their sw and w and nw, they watched as several more (9 in addition to the one they���d seen while still in town) moved through an approximately 3 land miles transit.\r\n\r\ntotal duration is estimated at 10-15 minutes.  they estimate it probably took a couple minutes to drive a bit over one mile to their vantage point north of town, from where they watched an additional 9 lights/objects as they moved into view, going from south to north.  \r\n\r\nthey watched to their left (looking south) as the objects emerged over the trees south of the town and as the objects moved over the town from south to north, and over a gravel pit lake on the south side of i-80 directly opposite from where witnesses were parked, then on over i-80 to the north where they disappeared over the elevated terrain ��� an estimated 3 miles straight-line trajectory transit.\r\n\r\nthe far side bank of the gravel pit lake west of the witnesses is estimated at 200 yards (600 feet) land distance from where they were parked.  apparent size of the objects was a dime (1.8 degrees), and they were seeing the objects at about 70 degrees elevation over the lake.  \r\n\r\nthere was no sound from any of the objects, and witnesses were unable to see any structure.  they could only see the unwavering reddish-orange lights of each object.\r\n\r\none light/object would come into view, move across the sky, then move beyond the witnesses view to the north, at which point, another one would move across the sky and do the same thing, until 8 of the 9 had done so ��� the last one did the same until it got to their right at about 60 degrees & then, instead of continuing to move beyond witnesses line of sight, when it got to their 2 o���clock position, it simply disappeared as they watched it.\r\n\r\nboth witnesses compare the speed of the objects to a light plane���s speed, in other words, not as fast as a commercial jetliner. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

thing made no noise at all. i was travelling south on 29  on 2/13/2012 at approx. 9:30 pm may have been later i wasnt paying attention to the clock when 4 bright lights caught my attention in the sky. the airport is less than 1 1/2 miles from where this occured  so at first i thought it was a helicopter but it didnt make sense to me. the object was hovering over the powerline right of way on the northbound side of 29 about 1/2 mile from proffit rd. i was intrigued so i pulled over into airport motors to watch this thing.I rolled my window down to listen but the only noise i heard was traffic and my engine. at the distance i was from whatever it was there was no sound at all. this thing was just over treetop level i would guess less than 500 ft for sure and less than 1500 ft from me. i did notice it turn and move from its position towards the airport. i lost sight of it after its turn i didnt see the lights anymore and i didnt witness a high speed acceleration i dont think. i looked and just didnt see it. i saw a plane traveling south of the position to the front of my truck, just after i lost sight of the object. i cant tell you what the fuselage was shaped like because the lights were bright and i couldnt make it out.I realized it turned because the lights shifted position and moved off. i donmt know what it was maybe you guys can have better luck than me. if it was a ufo maybe the airport radar caught it, like i said the airport is less than 2 miles from where this happened. if it was a helicopter it was like nothing i have seen because it made no sound at

stopped at the traffic light at 4th ave., her attention was diverted to what she believed was an airplane on fire. she witnessed this object at her 2 o'clock position [roughly north] and at about 50 degrees up. she immediately called me to report the event and i felt an unusual extreme distress on her voice. i totally felt she was actually witnessing an airplane on fire, she is definitely not the kind of person prone to imagine things. as we were on the phone -not ten seconds later- she witnessed what she described as 4 lights chasing the fiery object. she described these as 'arches', similar to a child-drawn bird, slightly larger than the first object and extremely bright [magnesium white]. she now observed that the apparent fire on the first object looked more like sparks trailing it. the traffic light changed and she had to move. she stopped at the next traffic light where she realized she had lost view of the fiery object. however, she managed to see one of the white glowing arches starting to release sparks. in retrospect, she feels this object was turning into another 'fiery' one. she lost view of all objects by the next traffic light. by the time she arrived home, she sounded just like every honest ufo reporting witness, i.E., believing she saw a 'plane on fire', then realizing she's seen something quite different. the image provided is just an illustration i did

if anyone else had seen anything like this during the weekend of 2/10/12. i caught a strange light out of the corner of my eye in the sky while hunting about an hour after dark. i thought it was a descending plane or helicopter but noticed it was moving up and down and left to right very rapidly in and out of view of the tree line that was to my 10 o'clock view from me. it was odd enough for me to pick it out of the little prop planes and airliners that were flying around every once in a while at various altitudes that night. \r\n\r\nwhen i backed up to get a better look to see what it was i noticed that it looked like a bright star that was moving in pigtail patterns. it looked as if it was falling, and rapidly moving in all directions very inconsistently but almost coming back to the same plane of reference every time it recovered from moving around after a bit. i gauged that by the flashing radio towers along the horizon in the distance. it almost looked like how a balloon or kite looks when it's getting whipped around by the wind but this seemed to find various spots in the sky to kind of hover and coast along. i tried to video from my phone at this point but it was too dark and far enough away that i couldn't see anything in my screen.\r\n\r\ni proceeded to call my friend who was on his way and tried to explain to him to hurry due to me being completely freaked out at this point. i had been watching this for about 40-50 minutes by this point. so, not really believing in any of this i went back to camp and wiped my eyes and started looking around at the lights on the horizon for a reference. i spent the next 30 minutes trying to rationalize what it could have been. i watched planes come and go to see if maybe i was just seeing this thing as it was getting closer or further away mimicking the hover effect. but everything just moved on and this one just stayed there. no other lights moved the way this particular light was moving. i even got in my truck and stuck a cigarette pack to my windshield and marked it so i had a reference point for where this light kept moving around.\r\n\r\nwhen i got out of my truck to view this again and try to record it with my phone yet again i noticed the other two orange colored \"star-like\" orbs. between the three combined, it was more of a triangular shape in the sky. one to to my west, one just south of tyler to my east, and the original white/red/orange light toward the palestine or crockett area to the immediate south of where i was facing. the three covered an extremely huge area but all seemed to be moving independently and all in the same style and manner as the first.\r\n\r\nby this point my buddy arrived and he gets out to see what i am looking at and why i was so freaked out. he instantly sees the first star i saw and cocked his head sideways and said \"is that thing moving!\" we then both watched it calling out the directions it was moving at the same time and we both saw it move the exact same. he began to spend time trying to explain in as i tried to do before he arrived. that's when we saw the spotlights from the southeast come on and they started pointing in random directions. could be completely unrelated but weird none the less. \r\n\r\nwe sat and talked for a while trying to scan the sky for anything else that looked abnormal. since it was in the middle of our 1200+ acres in rural country we could see all around us without any type of heavy light pollution. after a total of 2-2 1/2 hours for me, and about an hour or so for him, we noticed the western most light was gone from the mix of stars that was surrounding it. then the second to our east started to fade in and out and that's when we noticed the original light source started moving around and coming in and out of view. finally it was just gone in no sort of spectacular fashion or anything. tried to look for those lights again and saw nothing at all on the second night out there.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional

and looked up to see this extremely bright star like object that appeared to be ascending, then changed course and headed north while maintaining a certain height. it then moved what had to be many miles southward again within seconds, and then stopped above the nearby city of chico, ca or somewhere near its outskirts. i noticed during this time many aircraft suddenly were in the sky in the area around the object. at one point a very dim small glowing sphere shot across the sky and seemed to merge with or disappeared into the star like object. just went outside again and object has completely vanished from the sky.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

yesterday. i was curious if they were affected by the cold and snow. they seemed not to be and looked to be playing in it.\r\n \r\ni then went to my back yard and notice a small blueish craft hovering inches above the snow. so i took a picture of it. i didn't notice that it was accompanied by others until i looked at it on my computer.\r\n\r\ni am starting to see a lot of them and i can't figure
