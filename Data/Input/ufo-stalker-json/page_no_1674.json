object was pure white, and it did not illuminate any of the surrounding area.\r\n��� the objects rate of decent was as though it was in an uncontrolled free fall.\r\n��� the manner in which the light

my eyes to the right but well in front of me.  i thought at first that there was a fire in the distant tree line, or perhaps i was seeing a cell tower or even a low flying plane.  i watched these lights and noticed they were not blinking the way a tower or plane would.  i brought what i was seeing to the attention of my husband. we both began questioning what we were seeing.  i told him to get the video camera (we had just come from a sporting event), and although he had tried to record it, the camera kept saying the lense cap was on (which it was not).  as we approached it more, it was evident how huge these lights were.  the object was far too low to be a plane and none of the lights blinked.  there were 3 white lights in the shape of a triangle, with a smaller red light in the center.  we knew it couldn't be a plane because 1) the lights didn't blink 2) there was no noise coming from the lights, and we were pretty close to it.  the object simply hovered in the sky while we drove by it.  we could not see any \"craft\", simple the lights and blackness.  we could not pull over to try to get a better look, because we were traveling in a long line of traffic, and the roads were a sheet of ice.  i had tried to slow down and was almost rear ended.  we crested the hill, and then we could no longer see the object.  we didn't go back later that night because my husband had to get to work, and the roads were so bad.\r\n\r\nthe next day, i drove back to the area where we saw the lights.  there are no cell towers at all in this area.  (i had thought perhaps there might have been a new tower i wasn't aware of).  the only towers that are in that general area are on bald mountain.  while you can somewhat see those towers from the road, the lights they give off appear very small, they are all red, and they blink.  this object had 3 solid white lights that i could only visually compare to basketball size... which would make them huge in reality, and 1 sold red light that would be comperable to softball size (again, this would be huge, porportionately).   again, solid lights, no blinking, and it made no sound.  my husband was in the passengers side and had a little better look, and he said there appeared to be a light trail of smoke or mist following it.   after doing some research, the picture of the belgian triangle sighting is about as close to what we saw as i can get.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":35772,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.5553547,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02132012-0111","longitude":-68.4320009,"occurred":1329024900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maine","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1329165037000,"summary":"My husband and i witnessed three giant white lights in a triangle formation with 1 red smaller light in the center.","tags":["triangle","lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"04605","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Ellsworth, Maine","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:13367"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"While letting my dog out last night to use the bathroom. i stood at the back door waiting for her. all a sudden i saw a bright reddish orange light whiched looked like it came from the front of the house. it scanned across the patio which lite up the whole patio.It headed to the back of the patio and toward the back of the yard. my dog saw it and ran as fast as she could to the door. i let her in and quickly closed the back door. it was to scared to look outside.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":35771,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.4366734,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02132012-0110","longitude":-78.6522342,"occurred":1329120000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1329164379000,"summary":"While letting my dog outside on patio a bright red light hovered over the patio. it lite the whole patio up.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"23601","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Virginia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:13368"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I don't really know how to explain what is going on around here. i just know that i'm starting to get a bit fearful of what i've been seeing and hearing over the span of several months. it all started with a green laser i purchased some months back. actually, its been over a year now. to make a years worth of stories short, i, along with a select few have seen bizarre lights and unusual craft in the sky do amazing things including laser-to-ufo and ufo-to-laser communication. without fail, these craft show up every night  i beckon them except on heavily overcast nights like last night which was also too cold to go out. i had gotten the kids to bed around 9:30 and started feeling drowsy at around 10:45 so i went to bed. suddenly, i awoke with a jolt. i immediately thought a jumbo jet was taking off and flying directly over my house. i thought to myself \"my god that's loud! taking forever to go away\" as i tried to go back to sleep, but the rumbling was just too loud. frustrated, i staggered over to the front door which faces east and opened to see where all that noise was coming from. the sky was heavily clouded and the roar of what seemed to be a dozen 747's was just slightly 45 degrees from the horizon north north east of my position at about 500+- feet out. i could tell that it was moving extremely slowly away from my position. as i stood in the jam of the door, i began to get a feeling of fear and dread as i knew this sound was not of a typical aircraft that i am familiar with. at that moment tiny drops of hail began to fall. the sound of the craft took a little over an hour to completely fade in the distance (around 3:30am). very slowly, everything started to settle down and the air was calm and quiet again, but i cant forget that sound.

the back side of the v shape. it was also very brick like in shape. it was boxy not very aerodynamic in nature. it had a patern of something like a grid patern on its underside.  i could easily draw the craft if i was ordered to duplicate it. a month later or so i saw something of the same nature flying the same way and the same direction, it also had the same patern grid underside and grey
