it looked quite a long way away but was very bright. i've seen plenty of helicopters and planes flying over crossflatts park over the years and even satellites being moved and this thing was nothing like anything i have ever seen before.\r\n\r\nlooking towards leeds it moved slowly from left to right, i watched it for a few minutes and then ran upstairs for a better view from the attic and grabbed my hd video recording camera. even on 16x optical zoom it was still quite a distance away because on maximum zoom it was still just a bright spherical object.\r\n\r\nit was a very pale orange colour and appeared to slowly shift colour from fleshy pink to pale orange. it made no sound at all, when ive watched police helicopters searching for people from a distance you can at least hear their engines echoing while theyre in the air.\r\n\r\nthe object was moving in the opposite direction that incoming planes use when they're coming in to land at the leeds and bradford airport. the strangest thing was that it would sporadically stop dead in the sky and then carry on moving. and at one point it was to the east in the direction of crossflatts park then dissapeared and reappeared nne in the direction of leeds city center, so there were either two of them that flew identical paths in the sky or the same thing that moved very fast in the blink of an eye. when looking carefully at the recorded video i was able to save individual frames and zoom in on the object. on closer inspection it appeared to be be sphere with small bumps clustered around it. either clustered bumps or a sphere with lights of various intensity on it, making it look like it was clustered with smaller objects. and it also looked like a ball of fire because you can make out what looks to be sparks or flames licking off of it.\r\n\r\nthe most bizzare thing is that i didnt just lose it from focus, on closer inspection of the video on the pc, the object actually skips through the sky a short distance then quickly does a u-turn and dissapears at an alarming rate in the opposite direction. a second or so after it leaves, there is a faint noise almost like the crack of a sonic boom. i have seen iridium flares, chinese lanterns, search helicopters and plenty of planes over the years but none of them looked like what i recorded.\r\n\r\n(i have uploaded the original large mts file that my camera generated. without converting it, the only media player that i can watch it with is vlc media player. hopefully you will be able to take a closer look at the object and perhaps enhance the video. fortunately it was a very clear night with only the moon out.)","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with

anything, but on occasion the cloud cover would break up giving us access to the object. \r\n\r\nshortly the ufo sent what appeared to be sparkles and falling downward, this was witnessed by three of us this was a familiar activity that has been seen by previous sightings by us.\r\nthe witness said she had a video taken by a digital camera of the same objects; it was clearly visible off the same type object. as you watched the video, there were two smaller objects dancing around the larger object and changing colours. \r\nto our surprise, they formed a pattern of a disc shaped object with secondary colours were surrounding it as it was manoeuvring. although the cloud continued our host pointed to the locations where she would normally see them.\r\nduring our time there, we heard a

can be seen in the video i uploaded). the video makes it hard to see, but all three of the objects had a short tail and were slowly drifting or \"dancing\" back and forth. i was freaking out and inadvertently drawing a lot of attention (as can be heard in my video). there were other witnesses in the parking lot, a couple of ladies are seen asking us what they were in the video. before i started filming, another group of people wrote off the objects as being, \"just meteors\". the objects clearly were not meteors. they disappeared one at a time and just seemed to burn out or fade away. roughly 3 minutes after the incident there was a fireworks show about 30 degrees west and much much lower to the ground than the lights had appeared. i do not think the sightings were related to the fireworks, they lasted too long and did not behave like any fireworks i have ever seen, they were also long gone by the time the fireworks started and were in the completely wrong part of the sky. roughly 10-15 minutes after the event, i was driving due north when a row of 3 fighter jets flew straight past me heading in the exact direction that the lights had been seen. we were relatively close to luke air force base, but jets rarely fly directly over the city, and they were low and fast. at the same time as the jets flew past me, a helicopter flew directly overhead going northwest (not toward the event). i do not think the helicopter was related to the event, but i have suspicions that the jets might be.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

turn right onto rt. 47 (delsea dr.)  my wife said \"oh my god, what is that?\"  then i looked up and seen about 10 orbs floating in a formation across the sky. i briefly slowed down to observe them, but then quickly turned into the nearest parking lot and jumped out of the vehicle.  i took a few photos and a couple short videos with my wifes digital camera.  there were numerous cars pulled over along the road observing the event as well, then another car stopped next to us and were asking \"what's going on?\" \r\nthe red glowing orbs appeared to be floating in a formation type pattern, then they began to disappear a few at a time, leaving some behind, then they disappeared as well.  they seemed to either fly away, or just turn invisible...Was hard to tell. many of the orbs turned away and disappeared very quickly, so i only captured a couple objects on video.  the pictures i have on the other hand are quite interesting.  a few other objects appeared after i uploaded the photos and zoomed in closely, these we did not see during the event.  we have not disclosed these photos or videos to anyone but close family and friends, and after numerous people said we should contact someone...Well, here we are.  hope to hear from you soon, i would love to get the photos looked at by a professional, so we can be certain what is on there.  give thanks for your time and
