2012. we live in a rural location and our house is 1/4 mile down a gravel road after turning off of a highway. we live just south of a small lake which has a row of homes about a 1/4 mile long stretching east to west. i pulled into the driveway right along the garage. it was dark and the yard light wasn't on. my daughter got out first as i rummaged thru the car to find whatever i needed to bring into the house with me. seconds later i heard my daughter yelling at me, \"mom, mom, mom get out here!!!\" at first i thought she was just cold and crabby that the door was locked and she wanted me to hurry up but she had raced back to the car and opened the door and yelled at me to get me out there. it's cold winter weather in february. i jumped out of the car and just east, to the right of us above the tree tops about 25 feet away and straight up, was a bright pure red light that produced a red glow down into the entire back yards of our neighbors. it was slightly foggy too which intensified the glow of the red. i hadn't seen this red glow driving down the road or sitting in my car because the garage blocked my view. my daughter's responce was, \"mom...What is that?!?!\" we stared at it sorta mesmorized because i have never seen anything like it before. my first reaction was that it looked like it was something with a bright light underneath hovering just above the tree tops and appeared to be moving away from us approximately 10 mph or so, just floating along. we both just stared at it and i was sorta freaked. i said i have no idea what it is. the brilliant glowing red light then turned to a white light. the white wasn't as intense. it was slightly foggy out so it really looked eerie. i heard voices chattering in a distance so my logical mind said to my daughter, \"oh, its gotta be a firework spark just floating down or something.\" i really did have the spooks and we both dashed into the house. i immediately asked my mom, whom i live with, \"did you hear any fireworks going off?\" her responce was, \"no. i didn't hear any noises. nothing. it's been quiet.\"  i then thought to myself, 'oh my god i think that was a ufo.' i felt a shudder go through me. that was the last we talked about it until three days later.\r\n\r\nit was wednesday and i did my usual morning walk with my friend and our dogs. he said his brother had called him last night and told him that he and his friend saw a ufo. my friend works in the county jail as a sgt. and his brother wanted to know if anything was reported last sunday night. i asked him the details. he said his brother got a flat tire on his way home from ice fishing sunday night. he had pulled off the highway and saw this fire red light illuminating the trees all the way to the ground. it was hovering along the treetops. i freaked out. i interrupted his story and told him what my daughter and i had seen. it was the same night. i kept saying to him, oh my god i saw a ufo. we talked about the subject of ufo's during the whole walk. he said he'd give his brother my phone number so we could talk that night. \r\n\r\nhis brother did call me and i found out that he and his friend had gotten their flat tire right on the highway near my road. they had pulled off onto my road to change their flat tire. i did recalled seeing a car parked as i turned onto my road that sunday night on our way home from the movie theater. my daughter and i had seen this red light moving away from our end of the neighborhood while they had seen it coming towards them at the opposite end of the row of houses near the highway. anyway, he had called me that night so we could talk directly about the details of what we each had seen that night. from their standpoint he could see the trees and the ground all lit up from the bright red light. he said it looked as if this ufo was scanning the ground as it moved east along the back yards. he said it was so bright red that if someone was standing under the glowing red light that they easily could have been seen. just as it got to the end of the homes by the highway the bright red light turned white. that's what my daughter and i had seen too. that's when we ditched into the house. he then said it turned directions and moved north along the highway up around the east side of the lake. they watched it until they no longer could see it which was approximately a mile or two up the highway. \r\n\r\nwe both had concluded that this must have been a craft of some type emitting this red light. you could actually see the light which was a round red light that produced the glowing red which illuminated the entire back yards as it slowly moved horizontally across the tops of the trees. then...It turned white. that's when we had gone into the house and from their end they had seen it turn north and continue on. it never altered its elevation from their standpoint. from ours, because i wasnt quite sure what it was, i had thought it might have been a spark slowly floating down when in actuality after hearing how they saw it floating across towards them, it was actually slowly moving away from us. i can say it was fascinating experience to say the least. it was incredible to hear from someone who had seen it from the other end of the neigborhood. i have not asked any other neighbors if they witnessed the red illumination. but i may because i heard voices that night. i don't think i could have heard the other witnesses talking because they were a quarter mile up the road. it was quite the coincedence that my friends brother was there that night. otherwise i think this sighting would have been forgotten and not documented. \r\n\r\ni feel exhilarated from the experience. i really feel that it was a craft of some type even though the red illuminated light and slight fog and the dark night prevented us from seeing what the red light was fixed upon. it had to be fixed upon something. i really can't stop thinking about it and i've been on the internet trying to see if any such red lighted craft has been witnessed before. we also felt like 'they' must have been scanning the ground and looking for something or someone. \r\n\r\ni told my daughter about the other witnesses and that they believe whole heartedly it was a ufo. all she said to me was \"i told you!! you should listen to me more mom!!\" i guess at first sight i was so freaked i had to logically make it out to be a spark from a firework but we heard no booming or popping. i asked my daughter, who is age 15, how she felt when she first saw the glowing red light. she said she was really scared and that's why she was frantically calling for me to get out of the car. she thinks its was a ufo. i do and also the other two witnesses.

phone that was sitting near the living room window,  it was then when i noticed a group of red lights outside on the eastern side of the town. i informed my wife of the sighting and run outside to the back porch. she soon followed behind me with camera on hand. the group of red bright solid lights were all spread across the horizon not flying anywhere (more like peppering the sky),  no particular formation, but seemingly hovering for a minute or two before start ascending straight up in unison.  no engine or other sound was heard .There was an overcast and soon after the start of the ascend they disappeared behind the clouds.  we noticed that they must have been at different altitudes since they disappeared at different intervals with the closest one to us, last.  the encounter lasted around 2 minutes. however, i don't know how long they were there before i noticed them.  so i cannot tell if they had descended thru the overcast and sat there for a while and went back up. or if they had been flying under the overcast and sat there before a saw them, then ascended thru the overcast. all i know is when i spotted then, they were not ascending or descending, they were hovering spread thru the horizon.  the reason i know they were spread thru the horizon is that the closest one to us was bigger than the other farther away.\r\n  my wife brought the digital camera with her but i was unable to take pictures because the camera kept on trying to focus on the tall tree in front of us and it did not let me take the picture in spite of the fact that i press the shutter button many times.  i had my ipod touch and starting videotaping. i could not see anything thru my ipod's screen so i assumed that for some reason it wasn't recording so i stop (came to find out later, it had recorded some). the expletive you hear is me frustrated with not been able to document the event. i counted from this very short video and from what i recall at least 10 of the red bright lights. \r\n  the event is driving us crazy. i sent an email to the local paper asking if someone else reported them to the local or county authorities but  i have not received any response. \r\n  last, a word on the video. it's better if you viewed on a computer monitor with lights off. where the video stops you can count the other lights, keep in mind some of then are not visible due the tall tree in front of the lights.","distance":"Over One

with no light pollution. i went back inside and tried to use my video camera and regular camera however i could not get a good focus due to distance of object which caused me to try and maximum zoom which i could not steady and locate in lens. using my binoculars i watched object until it vanished from sight in a clear night sky, unobstructed view. it simply blinked out and it was gone. during the entire sighting, the object appeared as a red/white/orange light. since initial visual was gained, the object moved in a reverse closed number 4 pattern, starting at the lowest point, moving to the highest point, then lowering on a diagonal half way back down and to the right, the it moved horizontaly going south, through the path of the upward movement... then it blinked out and it was gone. this entire sighting took approximately 15 minutes in total. i am on some of the highest ground in my area and i did not have to look up to see these lights. i only had to look west. based on my location and my percieved distance from the object, i believe whatever caused these lights was off the west coast of california... exactly due west of richmond, ca. these lights might have been seen from people closer to the coast had they been looking also. they were not over the sf bay... they were much further west than that because i can see the bay clearly.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

ago (2/7/12) and saw a craft right over bob hope drive.  it was at around 6:30 to 6:45 p.M. and the road was full of cars.  i was driving in shock, with my eyes on the flying object.  i kept asking my sister if she agrees that it's a flying saucer type of craft and it's absolutely unbelievable.  she agreed.  i almost got hysterical but tried to hold myself back from screaming in disbelief because my 3 year old was with us and also because i didn't want my sister to make fun of me later.  it was so close to us and to the ground that i could have counted all the white, round lights.  it had one light on top (i saw the red light in the middle as protruding from an dome or peek at the top of the craft).  the bottom of the craft was not visible for most of the sighting except for a few seconds.  it appeared to be in the shape of a cone.  the bright, round lights along the circular edge of the craft turned on and off erratically.  it started moving further away and we kept trying to follow it.  it took me only about a minutes or so to turn right onto a side road so i can stop away from the busy traffic.  by then, the craft was all the way over the mountains towards joshua tree (?).  it was a little strange that it had gotten so far away even though it was seemingly flying quite slow.  i wouldn't call it flying.  it was moving in a circular motion, like a frizbee.  as we were stopped and continued to watch it for a few minutes, it came back over an area in front of us.  i believe it's an empty desert area along hwy 10.  at this point, we were on a secluded road and my sister was a little frightened and joked about abductions.  i wasn't brave enough to try to follow it any longer.  it got further and further away in an easterly direction.  it's absolutely unbelievable and very frustrating that no one else reported a sighting and there was no coverage on the local news.  i guess people are either skeptical or embarrassed to report it.  what we saw resembles the videos from recent sightings on the internet from russia, san rafael, ca, and uk.  someone also forwarded a link to a website to me where i found a report of a sighting over the same area (hwy. 10 in palm desert) two days before our sighting.  someone has commented on it and described a sighting on the night of our sighting (feb 7th) from his house in palm desert, ca.  please be certain that what i saw was a ufo in the shape of a flying saucer at pretty close range and very obvious.  i am absolutely certain that it was not a weather balloon, blimp, cloud formation/aura, airplane, helicopter, etc.  it looked and behaved like every flying saucer i have seen throughout the years in sci-fi movies.  if it was a new, secret military craft in the shape of a flying saucer, i would be very impressed by it because it continuously stopped mid air.  \r\n\r\ni know i'm not allowed to post links to other websites but the two reports over palm desert area on the night of our sighting and two days before our sighting should not be overlooked.  if you decide to contact me, i can forward the link to you.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

february 9th. i was watching television when the dog began to act anxious, which i interpreted as a need to relieve herself. i let her out onto the back porch but she did not run off into the trees or leave my side. i stepped out from under the porch roof because i saw light emanating from the area, above the canyon, behind my parents house.\r\n\r\ni saw two spheres, one blue and one green, that i, at first thought, were vehicles moving around on the hill about a mile away from the house on the far side of the canyon. after a few moments i realized that the angle was wrong and the lights were too high in the sky and too close to be on the ground. the trees behind our house obscured my view and i could not tell what they were in the distance. \r\n\r\nwe live in a very secluded area and when you stand outside you can hear the sound of engines if there are trucks or snow mobiles but there was absolutely no sound, which was very unsettling.\r\n\r\ni brought the dog back in and went up into the tower at the house to use the telescope to try and see what these were. with the telescope i struggled to keep focused on them and i could not pick out any distinguishing features. they still just looked like fuzzy, floating, glowing discs or spheres. they then moved behind the cover of the roof and and went downstairs again to watch them through a window.\r\n\r\n the dog was still quite uneasy and was staying very close to my leg. the lights had crossed from being across from the eastern corner of the house to the western end. the blue light was slightly higher than the green. they appeared

or faster than reasonable. i am at a loss as to what i saw. i have never had an experience like this before and i am a devout skeptic, however i am stumped and a little freaked out. \r\n\r\ni would much prefer a reasonable explanation to having seen an alien craft. i would even prefer an experimental aircraft or something.

december 24, 2011 we were just sitting in the car talking.  and everytime i'm out at night i always look out for ufos because i am a strong beliver in those type of things.  then i see an object from a far that doesnt have the color patterns a normal plane has, so i asked her if it was a ufo and she said i don't know but keep watching it so i did.  as we got closer i kept getting the feeling that it wasnt a plane.  we just basically were riding along with it for maybe 5 mintutes. and my sister was driving and trying to watch the obect at the same time.  so she was swerving in the road and i took my eyes if the craft for 2 seconds to make sure we wernt going to crash and it had changed shape it now had red and white lights along the edge instead of green ones. and as soon as that happend my sister started crying and saying a few curse words, and i felt completely nauseous and scared.  then the craft picks up speed turns left and by this time it was pretty much right above us but a little more to the left like over this empty field along that road and it was hovering and underneath it were three bright rectaguler white lights.  since it was hovering we drove past it then we qucikly turned aroun on the nearest road and within two mintues the craft was gone. and i have no idea how sincce it was hovering when we passed it and the sky was very clear that night. then at midnight the next morning i woke up vomiting. also three nights before witnessing the object i had a dream about witnessing one. and i would love to know if it was a coincidence or not.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:15:41","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then
