osprey preserve) in hopes of scoring a big buck. after midnite we walked from the back side of my grandfather's property to the area near where we had put the blind. the area of the osprey preserve is roughly the size of a football field and it is wide open wetland inside of that area. it is surrounded by trees. as jeff and i came in through the trees we were about 50 feet from the open area, when we saw what we thought were 2 sets of headlights. i shined my spotlight at them, and jeff got angry, because we thought they were the dnr(department of natural resources), which spells trouble for two hunters in the middle of the night. as soon as i spotlighted what we thought were atvs the lights moved faster than anything i have ever seen, through the trees right up to twenty feet in front of us and hovered, at head leval. we were both armed with full magazines, with our guns aimed at the light that was directly in front of each of us. we were paralized standing for approx. 10 minutes. we got a good look at them, but they are difficult to describe. they were the size of a volleyball and seemed to be melting neon light, pink,purple,deep blue,and green. and as i said we couldnt move at all. i remember being stuck like that for what seemed like two minutes, but to jeff seemed more like ten minutes. it let go of us at the same time and we fell down, and clawed dirt trying to get away, until we both had a big tree at our backs. as we were on the ground the lights had moved with us, still maintainig the 20 foot distance from us. then all at once it ascended so fast you almost couldnt see it doing it, like in the blink of the eye. this really happened. jeff was former military with security clearance and he said that it was not man made, and had never seen anything like it.-fred

as there are many contrails around here, i wouldn't have thought much about them- except that they were so large and on a very irregular flight path.  no type of aircraft that would leave a contrail that i am aware of flies in that manner........And it looked very strange. in addition, they appeared to be significantly lower than most contrails one sees on a regular basis.  observing these while driving, i then noticed there were 2 jets at an apparently very high altitude (you couldn't see the jets- just the contrails they were making) following these very large, irregularly shaped contrails from way above .  then i turned to look at the other end of the  very large, irregularly shaped contrails, and there were 4 additional  jets following the same irregularly shaped contrails (a total of 6 additional contrails in addition to the irregularly shaped 3 contrails.) the \"regular\" contrails of the 4 jets (which you could see the planes that were making them- so they were significantly \"lower\" than the other 2 \"regular\" contrails) were very close together- as though \"flying in formation\".  it was very unusual, and 3 people personally witnessed these, as well. in total, there were 9 contrails- only 6 that appeared on a \"normal\" flight path (not in a \"convoluted\" manner). the 3 convoluted contrails were headed south to north.  in addition, this morning at 7:35 a.M., i noticed there was 1 convoluted, very large contrail going from east to west,but there was only 1, and i saw only 1 other \"normal\" contrail following that flight path(in a \"normal\" straight line through the convoluted contrail)- so i didn't think too much of it until i saw the 3 this afternoon. then when i saw a ufo report in lansing, mi (pretty much west of here), i was wondering if there might be some type of connection..........There is no need to contact me, as this is all the info i have, but thought it might be of some use in the event there are other reports of strange sightings in this area.

mother. while staring up at the moon i noticed that below it and to the right was a small row of lights that was staying in one place but tilted to the right. they kind of pulsated and changed colors from blue, to green, to red, to white, and that was how i distinguished it wasn't any kind of star. i immediately pointed it out to everyone around me when i noticed the exact same set of lights tilted in the exact same way a mile or so to the right of that. we had sat there and stared back and forth for quite some time at these lights that were completely still but randomly changing colors of all sorts, we decided to finish our journey home and keep an eye on the sky. we figured that maybe we could distinguish if it happened to be a floating satelite or some kind of plane if we traveled to the other side of the city and checked it out there. we were pulling up on the street to my house which is a very slow quiet street and the moon happened to be right in front of me, so i figured it was safe enough to take a glance and see if i saw the same lights when much to my surprise i saw much more than that, we saw a hovering orange light that seemed much closer in the atmosphere. this bright orange orb glowed, lightly pulsated, and was also stationary. my mother was never able to see the slanted flashing lights because she didn't have her glasses (3 other people including myself saw them), but this orb stood out more than anything else in the sky, it was pretty hard to miss. all of us were in such shock that i immediatly stopped the car in the middle of the road and slammed it in park to get out my camera phone when we watched it fade out as if it was taking off into the atmosphere. those stationary lights also remained in the sky for an hour or 2 before also disappearing. i tried to get any kind of footage but they would not show up on my camera. all of us are completely shocked and have been obsessed about finding out more information. apparently these orange orb ufo's are pretty common and i have found footage of what i have seen by searching \"orange orb ufo\".. i linked a video i believe looks almost exactly like what we saw","distance":"501 Feet

then in my view i caught sight of a sphere in the lower part of the binocular, it was white-ish in color, kind of like the color of a cloud, it had a soft glow to it, almost a translucent, i watched it for a minute or so before i couldn't track it any longer due to the other apt building obscuring the path the ufo was on. i knew it was a ufo when i saw it, i have seen a ufo one other time in my life, i was ten at the time of that sighting. i listen to george noory on coast to coast every night at work and on the way home from work.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

of 20:20 and 20:30, i was out on my back deck with my girlfriend and our daughter. i saw a cigar shaped object with two orange/yellow lights. the lights appeared large and one was in the mid front of the object and one was toward the mid back. the object moved quickly on a very flat trajectory as if on a line. we watched the object as it went across the sky from the southeast to the northwest. the object was low in the sky at about 500 feet or less. it made no sound. the object behind it did make a lot of noise. a jet appeared to be chasing this object. the jet was as low and on the same flight path as the object. the jet was about a half a mile to three-quarters of a mile behind the object. it was so loud and low all the dogs and coyotes in the area started howling. we watched as the jet continued off to the northwest toward the cites of pocola, ok and fort smith, ar. as for the size of the object i can only say it appeared as large as the aircraft behind it. my girlfriend observed the same object with me but she said to her the lights appeared more red and there appeared to be four lights in back that did not blink. i wanted to report her sighting too as we witnessed it together but saw differences in the lights on the object. my daughter is only three as she was just frightened by all of the animals howling.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
