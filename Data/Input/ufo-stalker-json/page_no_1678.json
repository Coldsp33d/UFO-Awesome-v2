was slightly larger in size than this star  and equally as bright. it was moving very slowly and then it quickly faded into a very tiny light, the size of a satellite passing in the sky, and then quickly disappeared.  i observed the object for a few more seconds once the light had become small in size and then it was gone from my sight.  it's general slow direction was from roughly e to w.\r\n\r\ni noticed the object as i was looking up at jupiter, then orion and other stars.  it simply caught my eye as not being part of orion.  i first thought that i was seeing the headlight of a large jet, as i live near a naval air base and often see large passenger jets flying between seattle, wa and vancouver, bc. however, i listened for quite a while for any jet noise and heard nothing. there was also very little (5%) sky cover at the time of my observation.    however, when the light got so small suddenly, like a satellite, i questioned what i was observing.  \r\n\r\ni am a bit of a skeptic when it comes to ufo's and have never seen any object in the sky that i can't explain.  i am not quick to jump on a ufo band wagon without a large amount of proof.   tonight when i googled what i saw and read that others had posted a similar observation, i decided to post this sighting.  this is the first and only time i have ever questioned any sky observation and deemed it potentially unexplainable.  i do believe in the potential and overall likelihood of life outside of our planet and solar system.  after tonight, i am very anxious to find out if what i saw was an airplane or a perhaps as satellite that was reflecting light from the moon?  i would be much more excited to know that i actually saw a

tv on sitting on the couch with our balcony to our left.  i don't to why but, we both looked outside to the sky at the same time, which is strange considering we were sitting on the couch really just watching tv.  we both spotted this white round light which had a long white bright tail, both of us exclaimed \"wow!\", it was so bright it actually lit up the sky (clouds) as it travelled south east over the ocean.  after about 5 seconds it disappeared.\r\nwe were left wondering what it was.  we are very used to air traffic and recognize the blinking lights from airplanes but, this was a light with a long tail, quite large.\r\n\r\nto add to this mystery on the following night, again taking advantage of great weather... my sister, boyfriend & i were sitting outside on our balcony.  we were telling her the story, again around the same time (6:30 pm), actually we were pointing in the same direction of where we saw this thing the night before and just as we are pointing up at the sky, my sister says \"what's that???\" and we all see this smaller round object and it streaks accross the sky again in the same general direction.  this one was a lot smaller.  was this a meteor, it certainly looked like it could have been, but what are at the chances of seeing something 2 nights in a row?\r\n\r\nafter the weekend i return to work and tell a co-worker what happened.  she tells me

in the southwest sky (initially mistaken for a planet or a star in the moring sky-cavu conditions).  on the large glowing opaque sphere, i noticed what looked like a darker (black) band around the center.  seconds later a smaller orb appeared out of thin air directly next to it, then another, then another and possibly several hundred feet ahead, yet another glowing sphere ( 4 total).  the orb closest to the larger craft, started a slow and steady orbit around it for one full and complete orbit to only join the craft (looked like it must have either joined or was absorbed by the larger craft).  seconds later, in unison all three remaining craft started a slow and steady acceleration to the southwest until it was out of my sight.  i made notes, and times of the event and wrote down any and all details.  i also checked all air traffic in the area and there where no flights regestered on that path or altitude (flightware application).  no aircraft where in the area.  these where not stars, planets, helicopters or mylar balloons.  these where controlled craft.  i'm submitting my report in hopes that there where other witnesses.","distance":"Over One

into cloud cover, but then we told each other that it was a clear night; just stars in the sky. i've had one sighting similar to this, this past summer in july. i don't exactly like to talk about it, due to people never believing me. but what i saw last night was very interesting. it was weird how the object went to the left for about 10 seconds and then completely disappeared. we couldn't exactly tell what color it was, but noticed it was more triangular shaped and it had about 3 lights on it that blinked off and on. the lights were a bright, white color. this recent sighting was the most convincing of the 2 total sightings i've had in joplin. i always hope that someone else saw what i saw that night, because it's very annoying when no one seems to believe you.

 now that was strange.  there was no-where, at least that i could determine, that this light could have emanated from.  my conclusion was that the ufo or whatever it was, was anticipated and the light in the sky was giving it a vector, showing it where to go.  it has been months since this happened and i have not observed a horizontal search light since.  i stated above that there was a plane overhead but i cant say i remember one, which is due mostly to the fact that i live under a very busy flight path for the san antonio airport, jets are always going overhead.  let me be clear: i have always whatched the skies, even as a child, thats just something i do; i know the difference between a man-made (not to include classified and secret) air ship and an anamoly, i also know a meteorite when i see one ...This was niether.  it had a smooth flight path, was bright but not too bright, it appeared, swooped around and into the cloud and vanished, all in the blink of an eye.  and just where did the spot light come from???  if i had known about this organization back then, i would have reported it immediately, while it was still fresh in my mind.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":35528,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.660738016942947,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02062012-0015","longitude":-98.4618681908796,"occurred":1316413800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Sphere,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1328578389000,"summary":"A small bright sphere appeared out of nowhere, made a semi loop and disappeared into a cloud that was being hilighted by a horizontal search light.","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"78258","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":140,"locationName":"San Antonio, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:13862"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Bangor","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I went to the va hospital in wilkes barre, pa on 2/6/12 and was x-rayed for pain in my left elbox. technicians asked me if i had any wires or any defibrillators implanted into my left arm and i said, \"no\". they asked me to take more x-rays. i went home and called my cardiologist in syracuse, ny and he said he had never touched my left arm. the implant is about 10cm in length (5 inches or longer on the x-ray, but goes beyond the visible portion of the x-ray towards my left shoulder). i have no idea where it ends and this seems like a serious matter. i am very frightened by this and i have no memory of how it got there. i have obtained a copy of the x-ray which i am sending in this mufon sighting report. please contact me as soon as possible.
