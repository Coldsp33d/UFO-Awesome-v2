but larger radius of surrounding clouds.My ex-wife stayed outside watching it while i ran inside to get my dad. it was gone when i came back outside, and left a larger trail of clouds behind it. also after the circular cloud dispersed i noticed a small ufo light ( probe or individual craft) where the center of the cloud previously was. the light was moving to fast and was too high up to be a

of monterey bay in california. i see trees, the ocean, the mountains across the bay and a lighthouse from my sliding glass doors that lead from the bedroom to the deck. my wife and i have each had a sighting within the last year and a half. both were accompanied by our power browning out.\r\n\r\nmy sighting of mid january this year is very similar to a video that was posted 1/12/12 at the website, \"the truth behind the scenes.\" this was filmed in brazil. yet, the lights looked at times almost exactly like those i witnessed. at first, i thought that someone had left their christmas lights up and perhaps a wind chime on my deck was reflecting them. the main reason i speculated this was that these lights appeared to be about a half dozen in a line, separated much like christmas lights on a string. and these lights were different colors. they also would appear for perhaps a minute, then go away for a similar period of time, only to repeat this many times. the entire sighting probably lasted at least twenty minutes. and this \"string\" of lights always was slanted at about 30 degrees to the right from straight down. if on a clock face and these lights made up the big hand, they would have pointed to the four. i tried to wake my wife, but she seemed as if she could not wake up. \r\n\r\nthese lights would appear and disappear and i imagined that they might be a reflection from a spinning wind chime. however, looking the next day, there are no chimes in that area of our deck. after a considerable amount of time, they disappeared and did not reappear with the regularity they had been. then, very suddenly there appeared very bright yellowish lights just behind the trees that looked like they could be a low flying plane going down the beach to the south. however, there was no sound. if it were a plane, i would definitely have heard it as it was really quite close. i see planes approaching our airport all the time. they always approach from the same direction, which is also the direction these lights came from. and i always hear them when they are much farther away than these lights were. last but not least, as soon as this last object flew by, the lights in the room dimmed to a glow for just a few seconds. however, they looked just as they did when my wife saw her uso. at that time, oct of 2010, the brownout effect lasted almost an hour.\r\n\r\ni hesitate to report this due to our location and the many government facilities located in our area, such as the naval postgraduate school, the defense language institute, the monterey institute for international studies, and the fact that this is the home town of the u.S. secretary of defense, leon panetta. consequently, i suspect there is a better than average chance that if the government wants to clandestinely show off some new equipment, it is not unreasonable to assume it might show up here.\r\n\r\ni would not have made this report if not for that video i observed that looked so much like what i saw.

beach which is a lake side camp ground on lake eire, pa. my wife was driving so i was taking advantage of being a passenger and was looking out the window at the sky. as we got closer to lake eire i noticed that there were a few out of place abnormally looking orange stars and commented on them. i was trying to determine if they were planets or stars or whatever they were when i saw what i thought was a shooting star and as i was about to announce it, it changed direction and stopped which really got my attention. we pulled off the interstate and stopped near the intersections of interstate 79 and 90 so i could take some pictures. i took some photos but it was really out of the reach of my 280mm lens so nothing earth shattering came out of that. it was near midnight at the time when those photos were taken. we got back in the car and proceeded on. we were letting the gps guide is to the campground which was west of eire about ��� ways between erie and conneaut ohio. as we proceeded we ended up on west lake road route 5 traveling west looking for the camp ground when i saw another shooting star thing that just stopped dead in the air off to the southwest. \r\n\r\nwe pulled over again so i could take more photos. this time it was much closer. my wife, step-son and step-niece and i all got out of the car to look at this thing while i grabbed my camera to photograph it. i was facing southwest and its flight path was eastward.  as i focused on this thing with my camera i thought to myself i���m getting way better shots but i wish it was closer. before i could think another thought in a split second this thing was right over top of us almost as if it read my mind. i was caught up in the moment photographing it but it really scared my wife, step-son and step-niece almost to tears because it moved so weird and approached us like that and i freaked out later. i was able to get some really crazy and descent photos of this thing especially for night shots of a moving object. this thing was house sized but the brightness of the lights made it difficult to make out object���s outline. it made no sound per say but what we did hear could be best described as an electrical buzzing sound like the ones you might hear in those old scifi movies in mad scientist laboratory. i know that sounds like a goofy description but that is what it sounded like. it had 3 very bright lights no blinking lights or marking lights at all that would be on conventional air craft. and after it slowly flew by us at about tree top height it changed direction northward sped up and flew off. it went very quickly and disappeared towards the direction of lake eire. \r\n\r\nwe ended up lost in conneaut ohio and stopped at this convenience store to regroup and find the camp ground. we were talking about the event and the clerk over heard us. she said we see that all kind of stuff all the time here. if you are here for week you���ll see it at least once. she said many people see it near the power plant by the lake along with other strange lights. heck most locals don���t even report them or give it a second thought it���s so normal anymore.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

about 700-1000 feet in the air, moving fairly slowly, and was moving southbound just east of the interstate. as it was traveling it was also drifting from east to west. i was actually able to keep up with it at approximately 55mph. at first i thought it was a small plane, but rolled down my window and heard no noise other then the other traffic. also, there were lights (will make an ascii sketch below) at the tips/ends? of the object that changed from red to white in colour, but alternating, (when one end was red, the other was white). in-between the ends of the object was a sequence of lights that chased from left to right, then from the middle to the ends, then from right to left and repeated again, i have no idea what the shape of the object was as it was dark out, but estimating

in a formation that looked like orion's belt head on. we shocked, so we neglected to take picture or film until afterwards. we thought it was and airplane at first. we (my son and i) stopped the car to see if there was any movement. there was absolutly no movement whatsoever. at the distence we were, if the object were an airplane we would have at least seen a little bit of movement, even if it were coming at us head on. the object appeard to be hovering. as we continued up our driveway, the object dipped behind our roof. when we got to our car port, my son asked to be let out of the car. he then went to our back yard to get a better view. he told me that the object was descending and flying toward the northeast. he described the object as looking almost like a boomerang and flying smoothly, although not nearly as fast as a normal airplane. he said the object made absolutly no noise. this is what made me relize that this was probably not an airplane, since as low as this object was there would have definatly been at least a low roar. my son said that he didn't feel scared, but he did have a bit of an eerie feeling. he described it as being in wonder of what the object was. he explained that the object had started moving when he got to where he could see it. he told me that it had started to move off toward the northeast and began to drop in altitude. when he told me this my suspicions began to rise again that this object was an airplane coming in for a landing, but he also told me that this object was changing direction irradically. we lost sight of the object when it disappeard behind the tree line. i feel sure it wasn't a helicopter as it had three lights in a boomerang formation. the object also shared few characteristicts with a plane. my son told me that from the side the three lights were almost lined up, the middle light barely being in front of the other two. we see lots of planes and we know how they behave, and this behaved nothing like one, nor looked like one. our dogs normally bark if an airplane is going overhead, and our dogs didn't even notice this flying object. this object was different than anything we've ever seen, and felt that

weeks before and i was going to spend the night with my mom who was severly depressed but my husband called to say our son was ill so i decided to make the hour and a half drive home. about 10 minutes into my trip home, i noticed an extremily bright, white light in the sky coming from the basic direction of where i was going. the road i was on was desolate and there was no other traffic so i found myself watching this light as i was driving. at first i thought is was a plane with it's front light coming toward me for i knew it was way too bright to be a star or planet. i noticed though that it was staying in the same place for the entire time i was driving on the back roads. it made me feel very uneasy but at the time i didn't know why. coming off the main road i was taking, i started down a 5 lane highway going east. i saw the light was getting closer but that it was also growing dimmer. i knew there was no way that it was a beacon or tower for i had been steadily watching this light for 45 minutes. as i was coming closer to my exit i could see that this object was actually a row of bright pulsating lights of red, orange, yellow, blue, and green. i just remember being completely confused and fearful for as i stared at this object i almost drove into a ditch. braking completely, i stopped on the side of the road just watching this thing trying to comprehend and understand exactly what it was i was seeing. as i watched for aprox. 1 minute the object suddenly started to rotate at a 90 degree turn. whereas it was a horizontal object, it was now becoming vertical. this motion completely terrified me. i just knew immediately that what i was seeing was something unnatural and just the sheer unusualness of what it what doing scared me enough that i looked away, slammed on the accelerater and flew down my exit. i regret this decision for i have spent the last 14 years wondering what else this object did after i sped away, as well as what the object was to begin with. on my way home after seeing this i turned on the radio right away, flipping through stations, sure that i would hear something about what i saw. even though there were no other cars that i remember seeing i was sure that someone, anyone must have been awake to see this object as well. when i got home i ran in the house to tell my husband what i saw and he immediately thought it was a helicopter or an airplane. i wanted him to drive back that night with me to see if it was still there but because of our son being sick we didn't. i read every line, everyday in the newspaper hoping to see that someone else had seen and reported it so that i could also come forward. but of course nothing. i know for a 100% fact that what i saw was not a conventional aircraft. i am not some crackpot looking for attention for i don't want any. i am a married woman with 6 children, no psychiatric problems, was not drinking or doing drugs, and was not tired or hallucinating the night i saw this. the main reason i have come forward after all this time is because of a ufo documentary that i was watching recently where i saw an incident in texas where a man saw an object hovering in the sky. as a matter of fact when i saw the re-enactment of his object rotating at a 90% angle it kind of took my breath away for i am certain that what i saw was the same object. the one he saw split in two after becoming vertical but i don't know what the one i saw did because of my unfortunate decision to flee and not continue to watch. this incident is something that has bothered me for many years and it's frustrating to me that i don't know what it was to this day.
