20. the sighting occurred at approximately at coordinates 30.741037, -86.987174 on steel bridge rd in milton, fl which is right beside whiting field nas-south. 2 of my friends and i had arrived to the area in the afternoon, maybe 2 -3 pm, to set up a campsite for some other friends that were joining us there later that evening. steel bridge rd itself is used mostly by the local canoe rental company as a drop off point into blackwater river, and isn't really a campsite per say. there must have been the off season (fall or spring) because the road was usually very busy with river goers, but no one was on the road that day. seeing as we weren't really sure about the legality of camping at the time, we had parked farther down steel bridge rd and were walking towards the river (east of where we parked) with a tent, a couple chairs, etc.\r\nwe were about by said coordinates when i looked up to the tree line to our right and noticed what could only be described as a stereotypical flying saucer. it was fairly small only slightly larger than a car or truck, maybe roughly 20 - 30 ft in diameter and silver in color. it was a disk shape, but had a slight dome in the center that could maybe have fit 2 - 3 people. it was hovering maybe 10 - 15 feet about the pine trees, and making no sound whatsoever. i pointed it out to my friends and we couldn't help but start laughing and pointing at it out of shock as it looked like nothing we had ever seen before. there was absolutely no way it could have been anything besides a 'flying saucer.' it was well lit outside and we could clearly see the craft as it was only 100 - 200 ft from us. as we were pointing at it, it must have noticed us as well because it went from a totally stationary position to moving towards the river, where we were also heading (eastward). it moved under 5 mph in a seemingly straight line, staying about the treetops, and not venturing over the road. i looked down for maybe a split second (probably to see where my phone was to take a pic) and looked back up and it was already about 300 feet away. and then it was across the river and out of our sight over the tree line in a matter of a couple seconds. it was in the middle of the day so it really didn't feel creepy to us at the time. we were more astounded than anything.\r\nthe next morning we woke up to the sounds of \"reveille\" being played on horns, and it sounded like it was coming from the east side of the river which was the direction the ufo flew (we were camping on the west bank). the naval air station however was about 5 miles southwest of where we were camping. i make this note because at the time i thought the horns were just from the naval air station, but as i've thought about it, this really doesn't make any sense. not only did the horns sound much closer than 5 miles away, they sounded like they came in from the direction where the ufo flew, which was in the opposite direction of the base. maybe they were camping out in the woods experimenting with with the aircraft?","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:40","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

screen door and stood on 2nd floor balcony of my bedroom. no leaves on trees. my residence is across the street from the fox river. my balcony faces the street and the river. enjoying the unusually warm weather, i stood in my underwear on my balcony just before going to bed. i looked southwest down the river toward the downtown area of algonquin. i observed the normal lights with a normal halo of ambient light from the streets, businesses, etc. i noticed some lights higher than the buildings which caught my interest. they were white and numerous. couldn't make out a form or pattern. the downtown area of algonquin is approximately 1 mile south of my residence on n river rd. i stood on my balcony, enjoying the slight warm breezes at that time of night. i noticed after a few minutes that the lights were moving very slowly heading north above the river. i strained my eyes to observe the lights because i was looking thru the tree limbs that made the lights flicker on and off. i thought this is rather odd and kept looking at the lights. after about 15 minutes the lights came closer and were higher than my row of 50 foot high catalpa trees along the road. i could now observe a large black form moving very slowly (1 or 2 miles/hr.)with rows of lights. all lights were white except for a red light at the front on left end on a row of maybe 10 lights. this front row of lights was 90 degrees from the heading of the object. joining this row of front lights was a row of white lights running back along the length of the form to an end row of white lights 90 degrees from the objects path, just the same as the front row of lights. the only difference between the number of lights, white colored lights, was a green light at the left end on the rear row of lights. i believe i could hear a very slight hum, but it was almost undetectable. at that time i realized that i was probably observing a ufo. the object continued in a ne direction and disappeared over the wooded hills east of the river. the height of the hills (the river valley) are about 100 feet. the craft/object just past over the height of the hills. i would guess the object was about 150 to 200 feet above the river. it was big, probably 400 to 500 feet long and 50 to 75 feet wide. the only thing i thought it could be was a blimp, but it would be very dangerous to fly a blimp that low and at that time of night. i drew a diagram of the light pattern the next morning and showed it to friends at a downtown algonquin billiard hall the next night. i do not know the exact number of lights in the pattern nor do i know the size of the lights because i had no reference point to estimate any size comparison. the path of this black form came from the horizon se of the downtown area of algonquin, over the downtown area and ne along the fox river and over the hills about 1.25 miles north of the downtown area of algonquin. i now wish i tried to shine a flashlight at it to see more of it. don't know if that would have helped since it was at least 500 feet from me. i didn't try to take a photo because i didn't know what i was seeing until it went over the trees and at that point i lost vision of it in about 30 to 45 seconds. i knew i was seeing something very strange and i recall trying to memorize the light patterns. i have lived at this location for 25 years and this was the only time i saw this object. however, i just observed some strange lights recently and i will make a separate report. i am used to the light s from commercial jets coming from the west to land at o'hare airport 25 miles east of me. this object was not anything like those light patterns from commercial jets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

Alegre","country":"Brazil","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I have been watching some of the programs on history channel, including \"hangar 1\", and even though i believe a lot of the information you are sharing is highly speculative, and probably incorrect, i decided to write to share my own experience.\r\n\r\nplease notices that the information shared above is not related to one event but a series of connected events that i will describe below. also, please keep in mind that those events happened more than 30 years ago when i was a child, so i do not remember exact dates, and forgot many details but the below are details that stuck with me.\r\n\r\nmost of those events are connected to a known brazilian medium, who is considered a fraud by most, and he might as well be but i know what i saw, smelled and touched, but interestingly he does not seem to be known in the u.S. i will refer to him by his initials tgm. he is a public figure so i do not think there is a concern about his privacy.\r\n\r\nlet's start from the beginning. sometime between 1985 and 1988, one of my uncle's friends, who was an executive for one of the largest privately held banks in brazil, was dying from cancer. at that time tgm was a guru to many brazilian stars (musicians, writers, actors, politicians) and somehow got introduced to my uncle's friend. i only know what i heard and this is why i believe tgm's story was credible. what i heard was that he told my uncle's friend's family that he could not cure the cancer, but he could make his \"transition\" painless and peaceful without drugs. he seemed to have held many sessions where he would energize my uncle's friends, and to my knowledge he never gave drugs or anything that he would ingest. my understanding is that my uncle's friend died peacefully and painlessly a few months later.\r\n\r\nat this point, tgm was introduced to my uncle, also an executive for the same bank, and maybe because my uncle was always unimpressed by celebrities, tgm seemed to like him and seek him out, which was very unusual behavior (since most people sought tgm out). the interesting connection is that tgm lives in a small city called pouso alegre, in the state of minas gerais, where my mom and her siblings were born, and at the time my great grand aunt (now in her late 80's, early 90's) and my great aunt lived.\r\n\r\nso it came to tgm's attention that my great grand aunt had advanced gangrene in one of her legs (all the way to the knees) and that the doctors were going to amputate her leg. he said that he could cure her and that amputation was not needed.\r\n\r\nmy first contact with tgm was when my family was visiting my great grand aunt in pouso alegre. he showed up at her home for her treatment and they went inside the guest room where we were sleeping. it is important for me to stress that he was not carrying anything at all - no bags, nothing - and we were staying in that bedroom, which only had beds and our bags. nothing else.\r\n\r\nthey closed the door and he would yell his \"mantra\" which was pronounced \"rá\" (in english, it would sound like \"ha!\" with a strong \"r\"), and as he would yell it, we could see different colors of light coming through the cracks of the door. and i mean really strong lights (and there was no machinery in the room that could be emitting them). everything tgm touched would stay with this strong perfume smell for days, including our hands, after we shook hands - and it would stay on for days, even as we showered etc.\r\n\r\nlong story short on my great grand mother, the gangrene that was at her knee was completely reversed, and eventually receded all the way to her toe. somehow brazilian doctors convinced her to amputate the toe, even though the gangrene had basically completely been reversed on her leg. i remember hearing that tgm was very upset that the toe was amputated because he said he could have cured her completely in a few more weeks.\r\n\r\nmy second experience with tgm was at my uncle's office. the office was on the 11th floor of the building. there were 5 offices with closed doors and no exit, one single entry door right in front of my uncle's administrative assistant, and there were three elevators, also immediately in front of my uncle's admin. what i am trying to say is that no one could enter the floor without us seeing the door opening, or hearing the elevator and seeing the elevator doors opening.\r\n\r\ni was 13 at the time and i was working for my uncle as a courier (back than 13 was the minimum age for working in brazil; it is 16 now a days). i was talking to his admin and i had my back to the elevators, and she was facing the elevators when we hear a yell \"rá\". i jump and tgm was right behind me. the elevators didn't make the usual noise when it arrives at the floor, and neither the elevators or the side door were open. it was like he just \"materialized\" behind me. my uncle's admin and i were clearly startled but also kind of excited because we knew tgm at that point and the whole thing was just crazy. he wanted to see my uncle. he went inside my uncle's office, and after a while he came back out. an elevator door opened but it was going up (there were two floors above us). there was someone waiting for the elevator to go down but tgm walked in the elevator going up. we were observing as the door closed, and then a few seconds later opened again with the arrow indicating it was now going down (like elevators sometimes do) and tgm was no longer inside. is it possible that he could have exited in one of the floors above? yes, but he did not know anyone in the floors above and those floors were highly controlled because higher level executives had offices there. we believe he just disappeared, just like he had just appeared behind me.\r\n\r\nmy third experience with tgm was more interesting. i was visiting by great grand aunt again in pouso alegre but this time my uncle was also visiting, and he decided to go visit tgm at his house. i joined the party.\r\n\r\nwhen we arrived at tgm's house he was excited to see my uncle, and started bending coins and spoons with his mind. that is something he often did, and whenever he did that, those objects would stay impregnated with his strong perfume for months (and i mean literally months since i got a couple, which unfortunately i eventually got rid off).\r\n\r\nthen he asked someone to get a bird they claimed to have found dead, which he had put in the freezer. the bird was clearly frozen (like a rock), and tgm grabbed it in his hand and yelled \"rá\" and the bird went off flying. it may have been some sort of trick but i cannot explain it and i know what i saw.\r\n\r\nby them, some of the folks were expressing skepticism. a gentleman who was the brother of a very famous brazilian novelist was there, and tgm asked him if he had a coin. the guest pulled a coin from his pocket. thomas asked him for his full name and initials, and then asked everyone what day it was. he then passed the coin around and asked us to read the date on the coin etc. so that everyone knew that he was not replacing the coin. he then asked the guest to hold the coin in his hand with the fist closed, and yelled \"rá\". he asked the guest to open his hand and look at the coin. the guest was speechless. as the coin was passed around, and i had it in my own hands and saw it with my own eyes, the coin was bent in a w shape (relative to its profile), had the same value and year from the coin that was passed around earlier (it was supposedly the same coin), had the characteristic strong perfume smell, and had the guest's initials and the day (day, month and year!) engraved along the borders of the coin. i have a hard time dismissing this one as a trick unless the guest was placed there, and everyone were in it, except for my uncle, his family and i.\r\n\r\nwhen we decided to go back to my great grand aunt's house, tgm said he had to go somewhere and jumped in his truck. he was driving on the highway in front of us, and as i recollect, at some point he moved from the passenger side to the passenger side. we could see like lightning inside his cabin, and the truck kept driving for a while on its own. then eventually he moved back to the drivers side, and eventually we took a different road. we could not explain that occurrence. i have to say, if it was a trick, it was very elaborate, and i should remind you that this was in 1988, so there was no self-driving car back then. heck... pretty much all cars in brazil then, including tgm's, had stick shifts. automatic cars were extremely rare in brazil then, and pretty much no one even had basic cruise control.\r\n\r\nthat was the last time i saw tgm. but a few days later, still in pouso alegre, i remember seeing this thing that looked like a ufo on the sky. i got very excited and called my family to see it but it disappeared in thin air (and pretty much no one believed me).\r\n\r\nthe connection to ufo's here is that tgm claims that when he was a teenager,  he was struck by \"lightning\" and gained his powers then. i am not sure why he changed his name (which was not tgm if i recall correctly). tgm says that then he was abducted by aliens, and that his powers came from the aliens. people close to tgm claimed that sometimes he would disappear for days at a time, and return looking 10-20 years younger. beyond curing people from various diseases, bending coins and spoons, and returning small animals to life, he explained that the reason why he would bend items was to energize them and that his energy could help people be healthy and protect them.\r\n\r\nnow... tgm was a very controversial figure. he was often drunk, cursed a lot, and smoked. most people believed he was a fraud, but i personally cannot explain how he cured my great grand aunt or the other things i've seen when he was around. i have no idea if he is still around, and if mufon has ever heard of him, but you should absolutely investigate, if you haven't yet.\r\n\r\nin full disclosure, when i was a teenager, i was very much into the new age movement, and my mother was all over the place regarding religious practices. i remember her holding \"sessions\" with several people in my house, i remember speaking with several different mediums, some of whom would talk to me about events that i hadn't shared with anyone - big and small - and they could not possibly know, and in detail. i am not talking about the garden variety frauds that you can find everywhere that talk broadly and lead people to connect the dots, i am talking about detailed descriptions of events, what i saw, how i felt, and exactly what i did. for a while we also would go to this \"macumba\" sessions where people \"receive spirits\" and while some of them were unremarkable, in others i was told about detailed events that only i knew about. again, i cannot explain those things, and i was very young. i believe everything is connected though. i've had a few other paranormal experiences when i was a teenager but i will not describe them for the sake of space here.\r\n\r\nbecause i was experiencing all those things, i also devoured books about those topics - from shirley mclaine's books, to madam blavatski's books, to the bhagavad gita, to where the gods astronauts, to the bible, you name it. i read a lot about everything and my conclusion is that no one really knows anything - and those who may know are not telling. i also haven't experienced anything paranormal since i became an adult, and concluded that the more i read, the more questions i had, so i stopped seeking answers, became very skeptical, including of my own experiences, but those highly speculative shows about ufo's on history channel made me want to at least share my experience.\r\n\r\ni hope this helps and leads to something. if you do any research, i would love to know about your findings - even if it is to debunk tgm. maybe we will all eventually find the truth. i think death itself is a much bigger mystery than ufo's. and although i had my own experiences, and i admit to believing that it is likely that there is life in other planets based on pure mathematics, i also think that if aliens were visiting us, we would know it for sure by now. in the 1980's we didn't have the technology and the surveillance we have today. today we have billions of people with cameras (smart phones) in their pockets. i believe that if there was something out there, someone would have recorded and shared it by now.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":85856,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-22.2480373,"location":null,"logNumber":"BR-08122017-0005","longitude":-45.9420118,"occurred":583718400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"State

house because my friend had texted me that the moon looked cool. i can't remember what particularly about it made it look cool, but that's irrelevant. i was sitting on the sidewalk, watching the sky when i began to see flashing red streaks, almost like a missle, arching through the sky. maybe 1 would be visible every minute or so. my initial thought was that it was coming from one of the near by army bases, because we have them all over southern nevada and one really close to the mountain range by my house. it didn't make sense though, military testing that close to the city had been outlawed years ago, and the object just didn't seem like a human aircraft or weapon. at that point more had flown over, arching, then cruising, then dissipating. they seemed like a missle, yet it could have been a bullet shaped craft i was mistaking for a missle. as they flew they had a trail behind them emminating a goldish-yellowish-orangish trail. the shape and behavior of the trail resembled that of a comet. the noise they made were somewhat aircraft like, kinda like a jet taking off but also with a sort of roar/rumble that was loud to the point it got uncomfortable. the only way i can describe it is as if the sounds of a taking off jet, a taking off rocket, and a revving sports car were combined then put through an amplifier. i was extremely scared, having 15 minutes into witnessing this seen maybe 20 or more ufos either arch off tword mt. charleston (south) or towards my neighborhood (east). they came from the dresert (west). at that point i got so frightened i went back inside, and attempted to lay down and sleep. i was so anxious about it though, i didn't sleep very well, extremely worried as to what the things were and if they could hurt me/ my house. i haven't seen them again, but i have since moved farther away (more inland las vegas) from that mountain range and from that military base.","distance":"Over One

this is. i tried to convince myself this is the \"clouds\" effect where you see something like snoopy in the clouds... but i just keep looking at it, and looking at it... and i thought i would let others see it. it's impressive to me. \r\n\r\ni have uploaded the 2 pics that were snapped by the trail cam back to back.\r\n\r\nin the dark photo is where the creature is. it appears to be peaking around the side of the light pole. the reflection on the pole is from the trail cam.
