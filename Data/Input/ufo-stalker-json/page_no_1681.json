i took 3 pictures on the evening of 2/3/12.  the sphere was glowing white and the base (upright oval portion) was dark blue in color.  my camera is a nikon d60 10mp with 200mm zoom in manual mode.  5-second and 8-second exposures were done on a tripod\r\nwith a timer so no possible bumping of the camera or jitter could be induced into the image.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":35462,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.63007755428503,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02042012-0004","longitude":-120.17567566030317,"occurred":1328169600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1328391567000,"summary":"Glowing sphere offset on top of upright oval shape, also glowing","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/35462_submitter_file1__Odd-lights-in-icon-format-northsky-020212.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/35462_submitter_file2__DSC_4361.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/35462_submitter_file3__CSC_4370.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"93427","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2,"locationName":"Buellton, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:14017"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Enola","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Heading w. on either jack williams,bull creek,or whatever it is between hwy 36 and 107 heading into enola,ark.Looked in rear view mirror,saw lights i hadn't noticed before,thought they were probablly farm lights in the distance,1 white light,one amber about 45 degrees above and to the side,didnt think much of it til i rounded a turn and changed directions that i saw the same thing again in mirror.I go the same route every tuesday evening ,never seen that,but i know they fly a lot of c-130s up in that area,kind of think thats probably what it was,who knows?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":35460,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.195362,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02042012-0001","longitude":-92.2032058,"occurred":1327458420000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arkansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1328348715000,"summary":"Saw lights in rear view,thought farm,,turned corner,saw same lights in rear view mirror","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":10,"locationName":"Enola, Arkansas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:14018"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Natomas","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My boyfriend and i were driving home on highway 80. right before we exited the freeway, i saw a blue light hovering and a white light falling. i thought it was a falling star. they were little lights that would change color between white, blue, and purple. i then saw the white one change direction right at the horizon. it moved up on the other side of the blue light. the blue light started moving at this point. we pulled over on the road to watch. they flew around for about 5 minutes. they would go every direction and when they changed direction it was very abrupt. we wanted to get a closer look so we started to head towards them again. we lost sight for a few seconds and they disappeared. the sky was clear that night. they were far away and moved really fast.

2. the odd variety and geometric shape of lights on the object.\r\n\r\nthe object had three distinct types/shapes of lights that stayed fixed in relationship to each other on the flying object:\r\n1. a single very bright continuous light (or perhaps two lights close together) near the \"top\" or uppermost portion of the object.  this light was a very bright white to yellow-white color, and did not blink nor flash.\r\n2. a large continuous string of lights, approximately but not exactly, triangular in shape.  these lights were also quite bright, but not as bright as the light listed in 1. above.  this triangular shape of lights appeared to be very large, easily 200 to 300 ft in each direction of the triangle.  this triangle shape was always pointing toward the ground, and always appeared lower to the ground than the light described in 1. above. these lights were a blue-white color, and did not blink nor flash.\r\n3. two continuous strings of lights in straight lines that appeared to be approx 100 to 200 ft in length, that seemed to angle out of the center of the object.  these lights were by far the dimmest, and were only visible when we were at our closest point to the object - approx one-half to one mile away from it.  these lights were a bright green color, and did not blink nor flash.\r\n\r\nwe lost sight of the object, at approx 8:25pm est, because it accelerated rapidly away toward the nw and climbed in elevation.  i estimate the object flew over i79 at about 8:20pm est, somewhere around or just north of exit 99, heading nw at a rapid speed and climbing.\r\n\r\nneither i nor my wife has ever seen anything like this flying object, nor have we ever seen an object before that we would definitely classify as a ufo.  i have two engineering degrees and manage a technical consulting firm.  my wife has an accounting degree and works in banking.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":35454,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.9841323,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02032012-0023","longitude":-80.1839742,"occurred":1328328000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"West Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1328335890000,"summary":"Large object, multiple lights, triangular shape, changed direction and descended/ascended multiple times;

miles away from my home (very peaceful place). i was at rose mofford park located at 9833 n. 25th ave. phoenix, az (on 25th avenue just north of dunlap). \r\n\r\nthis park generally has many people playing sports in the afternoon and some people having lunch or relaxing during the day. at that time of the day i had walked buy two full soccer games involving preteens and kids. i decided since i wanted peace and sunlight that i would avoid the soccer fields and go on the way to the running track area, which i did. i proceeded to lay down on the grass on the outside of the track on its west side. it was completely cloudless that day which is very typical of phoenix. i was affixed at looking into the sky as i did when i was a child... like looking at the clouds and guessing what they might resemble. that was my state of mind at the time. \r\n\r\ni soon noticed a small dot in the sky that could have not bee a plane by any stretch of the imagination. i looked a little deeper and thought it couldnt be a bird... no bird would ever fly so high alone that it was nothing more than a tiny black dot (size of a pin head or smaller). i chose to ignore that dot and decided to gaze at the whole sky rather just out of relaxation. i widened my gaze and the whole viewable sky  and immediately came across something out of place... a formation of 6 semi transparent or muted color orbs forming a slightly unorganized cross system. one orb was a darker gray color and was bigger than the others, this orb was off center (top left of the cross intersection). this system of orbs moved slowly across the sky (as if quietly cruising) as one unchanging group. none of the orbs moved independently of the others. they moved as one system. in between the orbs it appeared just as the rest of the sky or completely transparent. \r\n\r\ni was baffled, but not surprised or skeptical to see this. this is the second time ive seen a truly unmistakable alien craft or ufo in the sky and dont regularly go looking for them at all. even my choice to go to the park to clear my mind in the middle of the day like that was absolutely out of character (been at leased a whole year since i did that type of thing). \r\n\r\nto debunk any skeptics, yes i was here when phoenix lights occurred but was not an eye witness in any way. for the record, that event doesnt & didnt cross my mind during this sighting. that event was never fresh in my mind since i had no personal attachment to / experience with it. with that said, the phoenix lights event has no bearing on my current experience. i was not looking for this sort of thing,... it just happened! \r\n\r\nmy belief system as for phoenix lights is this: i believed it was true and happened physically as well as that it was a real space craft driven by either our govt or other intelligent species from within our galaxy. as said before, i actually was not an eye witness of the phoenix lights, but from all videos and said descriptions of the sighting from eye witnesses, this ufo that i saw had / was using what appeared to be the same type of cloaking technology where i could see the normal sky in between  the orbs. also, this ufo appeared much higher in the sky and didnt form a chevron like the phoenix lights one did.\r\n\r\nin a nutshell, i 100% without a doubt know i saw an alien or possibly top secret government craft that was cloaked and peacefully traveling over west phoenix that day on junuary 31st, 2012 at 3:30pm in the afternoon. hopefully others might have seen it as well and can confirm it with me.  \r\n\r\ni now

mexico and utah, i'm submitting this witness statment on behalf of two (2) individuals who wish to remain anonymous.\r\n\r\n(the mother-48 years old):\r\non saturday evening, january 21, 2012 at 7:15 pm (it had already got dark), i was coming back with my daughter from gallup, new mexico, as we turned onto navajo route#4, from highway#191, at the pinon junction. i saw a chain or row of bright lights approximately (1) mile west of an area known as \"the pond\". the lights were huge, bright and the row was approximately (100+) hundred yards in length. i shouted to my daughter \"what is that?\" thats when this single row of white lights shut off and approximately (1) second later a large array of orange lights came on. this formation lights was at least (300+) feet long, by approximately (3) stories high, it's appearance looked like that of a power plant or a city. these lights were arranged in rows and columns with the appearance of windows with white flashes of light that appeared to be on the inside, there were at least (50) or more of these windows. suddenly the lights shut off. we did not know if the object took off after we passed it. there was a loud boom like a \"sonic boom\" and a flash of light from behind a hill that was behind where the object had been. it is unknown if the object had been hovering or was actually touching the ground. this area where the object was is flat and wide open range, there are no other man made structures in this area. there were other motorist traveling on route# 4 and highway# 191 at the same time that would have also witnessed the event.\r\n\r\n(the daughter-22 years old):\r\non saturday, january 21, 2012, about 7:15 pm on our way back from town, my mom directed my attention towards a huge pattern of orange lights about a mile from our moving vehicle. the lights were at eye level and appeared to be in rectangular windows-the pattern had smaller lights flashing at random within. the length of the object was at least (100+) yards across. my first thoughts in comparing what i saw would be that of a power plant or city, but the rectangles were distinct and in rows and columns. the orange lights lasted for about (5) seconds and turned off (like a light switch being turned off). about (2-3) seconds later, in the same direction, but further away there was a loud \"boom\" and white light was radiating behind a nearby hill. the light was coming from the ground. i also noticed in the foreground a black dome that did not move. this lasted (1-2) seconds. as we drove pased the site i kept looking in that direction to see if i could see any other lights, but i did not see anything. about that time we did notice that there was a power outage in all the nearby communities. the weather also drastically changed. there was blizzard-like conditions on the rest of the drive home. i did not notice any changes with myself physically-just that i got a strage eerie calm/paranoid feeling. another thing, before the orange lights disappeared, i reached for my phone to get a picture of the lights, but as i was putting in my password my phone completely shut off. i don't know if that is directly related to what we saw, but i had enough battery life for this not to happen.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

commented on the fair \r\nweather.  it was a warm, breezy, hazy evening.  i pointed back to the southwest and commented on the pretty moon.  it had a beautiful pinkish aura and was perfectly cresent shaped.\r\n  \r\ni then referred to the constellation orion the hunter, more to my south.  it was bright and i could see all stars that i know of in the constellation, even the glow of his scabard, sweeping down from his belt could be seen, the tip of it was very bright.  sometimes it is hard to see every star in orion and i thought that when we got past the tree that was blocking my view, i would be able to see both stars that mark his feet.  a tree blocked his left foot from my right-sided view.  \r\n\r\n\r\nmy kid was chatting away about \"ya mom, orion is the easiest constellation to see from the midwestern us......\".  right at that point in time is when i saw 3 giant pink orbs of light come into my view, directly into and below the star of orions left foot.\r\n\r\ni stop and point.  \"look at that!\" then is see about 5 or 6 more orbs of light.  dumbstruck, i freeze taking in what looked to me like 7 or 8 orbs of light that were in a v shaped flying pattern.  the front orb of the v was pointing right at orion's left star foot and began to move across the sky from my right to left.  \r\n\r\nanother orb of brighter light joins them to form almost a perfect v of 9 lights and maybe a smaller dimmer one coming in.  they were not flashing lights, more like a pulsating light.  most looked pinkish to me but, a few looked brighter and more yellow, though smaller.  the ones flying in were smaller and very bright white until they got closer to the formation, joined it and then got more yellow.\r\n\r\nas it began to move, i was just astounded at what i saw as it stretched out across the width of orions starred feet and it looked enormous!  i was shouting \"look, look, look at that!!\"\r\n\r\nthe ufo had stopped almost dead on top of the feet stars of orion and i realized that i was seeing the most enormous object i have ever seen in my lifetime. so, from my orientation, it spanned tip to tip between orion's feet and after picking up the other couple of white then yellow orbs, started to move again!\r\n\r\ni am shouting \"look at the lights, they are over his feet!  look, look they're moving!  see, see?!\" i wanted for my kid to see this too! \r\n\r\nthe ufo accellerated and kind of streaked off into the night sky and disappeared from my view.  it had a pinkish glow and it went fast, leaving a beautiful pinkish trail of sparkly light that just kind of faded. it was beautiful.  \r\n\r\nthe whole sighting was probably about 30 or 40 seconds max. \r\n\r\nafter it was gone, i kind of looked around, you know, to see if there were any car lights or lights or anything that could have been reflecting in my view.  i wasn't wearing glasses.  all is quiet, no cars,no people. we kept walking east, toward our block.\r\n\r\ni dismissed my kids suggestions that maybe i had seen a plane, or helicopter or jet fighter.  i didn't hear anything.  what i saw was none of those things.  what i saw was so enormous, it is almost scary and that is why i keep referring to orion's feet.  that really gave me something to scale this object on and wow!\r\n\r\nthe thing that strikes me the most about this sighting is that the ufo was 3 dimensional to me.  it was not just a flat set of big, bright dots in the sky. it was not as if i was looking thru holes punched in paper or at stationary stars. it was 3 dimensional.  i have tried to draw it and i am no artist so it just ends up looking like a v with circles drawn inside of it. too bad!\r\n\r\ni did some internet research and saw videos that are very similar to what i saw, some very recent. it is my hope that this post helps someone else that may have ever had a similar experience. \r\n\r\nthank you!<:\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n","distance":"Over One
