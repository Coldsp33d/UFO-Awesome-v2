attention because it was flying in an unusual pattern. it would hoover than it would go slow and then it would move quickly. as i stared at it i could see a blinking white to yellowish light. it went behind some trees so i moved to get a better look. then another one appeared of the same type and description flying in the same direction. seconds later a third one appeared and they were then all traveling at a high rate of speed. suddenly from west there appeared a whole swam of objects with flashing light. they were all white and flying at a high rate of speed. they had rapidly flashing lights and almost looked like a swarm of birds because of the chaotic pattern or grouping of objects. they went from directly overhead to over the horizon in about 6 seconds or less. they were not planes or birds. i was amazed because i have never seen anything like this except for the films of ufo sightings in mexico where you have a large swarm of objects. i tried to shoot a picture with my iphone but was too nervous to get a shot off in time. it was absolutely amazing. i go to the local airshow all of the time in smyrna and i have never seen anything close to what i saw. the swarm of

(note: it was not reflective.) also, it seemed to be...\"gliding\". there was almost a grace to its flight as it seemed to periodically bank left and right. it was during these subtle maneuvers that the object revealed its only discernible feature: it appeared to have a sharp point in the \"front\". this is to say that the object seemed to converge into a point at its front, much like a hang glider. (note: while its true that (due most likely to distance) i couldnt make out any real shape or features, its no less true that i could tell what the object was not. it was not for example an orb or a triangle or a disc, etc. at best, as far as i could see, it was a \"line\" that, as it appeared to bank left and right a few times (perhaps 2-3 times), seemed to have a pointy front like a hang glider.)\r\n\r\nhaving come up with the image of a hang glider, i still struggled with the idea of the object actually being a hang glider. the reasons for this are as follows: \r\n\r\n1. the sighting took place in elk grove, california, smack dab in the middle of the central valley. this means that the nearest mountain where it could have been launched from was what, 20 miles or more away? so unless it was launched from a plane (and ive never heard of such a thing), i have no idea how it would be gliding over elk grove unless it had traveled for what seems like an exorbitant distance.\r\n\r\n2. while it evoked an image of a hang glider, it didnt really look (or act) like one. there was no obvious sign of a person suspended underneath, it didnt spiral or swoop or appear to change altitude. it simply flew, at what seemed to be a fairly high speed, on a relatively straight heading towards the northeast.\r\n\r\n3. as mentioned above, the object appeared to be moving pretty fast. it also appeared to be at a significantly higher altitude than the plane. and even at this perceived altitude it appeared to be moving at a higher velocity. this means that it either really was moving faster than the plane, or that it was much lower (and closer) than i thought, and simply appeared faster. the latter seems less likely however, because if it were true then i should have been able to make out more about the object in terms of shape, color, features, etc. \r\n\r\ni thought then that perhaps it was a helium balloon. but again, it didnt look or act like the potential explanation it evoked. balloons tend to wobble and float this way and that, and they certainly dont move faster than propeller planes, even on windy days. and today, the day in question, there was very little wind. and of course the object most certainly did not wobble or otherwise act like a balloon in any way. and there is also the not exactly small matter of it moving swiftly and consistently in one direction.\r\n\r\nso i observed the object for about 2 minutes, after which time i lost sight of it over my house. i then proceeded to tend to my dog, all the while running various possibilities and such through my head. once done with the dog, i went through my house and out onto the street to try and catch another glimpse. alas, it was no longer visible. i can only assume that my estimation of its speed was correct and that in the couple of minutes that i was busy with my dog it had traveled far enough away so as to be obscured from view by the houses across the street.\r\n\r\nin conclusion:\r\n\r\n-observed a flying white object for approx 2 mins that looked like an indistinct \"line\". object appeared to bank softly to the left & right 2-3 times, which seemed to reveal a pointed front, similar to a hang glider. (note: object did not otherwise look like a hang glider.)\r\n\r\n-object appeared to be at least 500 ft in the air. appeared significantly higher in altitude than propeller plane which was concurrently in the sky.\r\n\r\n-object appeared to be moving faster than the aforementioned plane.\r\n\r\n-aside from the soft banking, object appeared to maintain altitude and most certainly maintained a general direction of ne.\r\n\r\n-object showed no characteristics consistent with what i would expect a balloon to exhibit.\r\n\r\n-object made no discernible noise, released no discernible emissions, had no discernible lights/features/coloration (other than its white appearance), and reflected no light.\r\n\r\n-object appeared to under intelligent control.

these lights turned on and off. they did this 3 times. i watched them from 5:15 am to 5:30 am. they were bright enough that they should have illuminate the house but didn���t. they were floating not moving at all. these objects were the size of a car. all three were the same size. about 6 to 7 feet in diameter. they were about half an acre or 100 feet away.\r\n\r\nthe next thing i know is it is about 6:40 am. i can���t account for the missing time. i���m not sure what happened during the previous hour and 10 minutes.  at a quarter to 7 i heard jet engines. the sun was just coming up. i saw 2 air force jets flying close enough i could see the pilots head and shoulders. i was shocked that they didn���t hit the trees because they were so low. they were going slow enough that both pilots looked at me. the jets were blue and silver or some dark color. i���m not sure of the color because i was looking at the pilots. my husband was sleeping when this happened. i should have been afraid but wasn���t. i was confused that i was not afraid. i waited to see if the jets would come back till 7:00 am. she saw movement over by the leland cypress tree. i saw what looked like a mirage in the shape of an oval.  the oval then moved very slowly over head.  as the object moved away the morning sunlight hit the bottom of the object and i could see a second oval under the bigger one. it made the metal of the object look like copper. i told my husband that night about what had happened.\r\n","distance":"21-100

triangular. they were moving much slower than any aircraft i have ever seen and i had 31 years of service between the us navy and department of defense and have seen many aircraft in my day. the only aircraft i have ever seen moving that slow have been helicopters and these were not helicopters! the light pulsated in an unusual fashion. i watched them as they moved almost directly over my house and proceded to the northeast. then a second pair exactly like the first popped up over the horizon in the exact same location as the first pair and passed in the exact same direction. i asked my wife to come out and see and she was somewhat amazed. i continued to follow the 2nd set of craft as they moved to the northeast and by the time they were beyond my house the 1st set vanished and a few minutes later the 2nd set vanished, abruptly. the entire event took approximately 10-12 minutes. as i stated, there was absolutely no sound and i find that highly unusual for craft of this size and at

skyward into a clear cloudless sky.  most immediately i saw a \"star\" shift, and watched close.  it stayed still for a short time, and then streaked spacebound or i think.  what i saw was a brief flash of light in shape of a line, then nothing.  from my view, the line was approx 500 ft. i continued my walk home.  stopping as routine at the veterans memorial on the town green.  i circled the memorial leaving 4 signs i burned into wood at the base of the memorial.  \"poverty's end\"  \"building world\"  and \"community\".  leaving a childs size leather coat in red white and blue on the

hour but i wasnt thinking in digital time so i may be inaccurate.  i continue on and watched them as i walked the last mile home.  they seemed to follow me i cant be sure, but it felt like it.  i then had a brief jolt of fear shoot through me.  then thought this is ok, you will sleep tonight and wake tomorrow.  i gave a last glance skyward as i opened the door.  bumping my chest in a sign of respect, i went to my room and thrived.  i have to add this:  i do not remember many dreams after being involved in a head on collision.  this night i remember vividly what i saw in my sleep.  i will

pick-up truck home from work at 7:55 pm on wednesday, feb. 1, 2012, traveling north on hwy 281, passing between the exits for brook hollow and thousand oaks, facing due north, when suddenly a very large and extremely bright white \"fireball\" with a long yellow tail streaked into view passing directly in front of me from west to east and descending at a very shallow angle. the object was close enough that i could make out some detail in the long yellow tail behind it which looked like flames. from my viewpoint, the object appeared to be just beyond loop 1604 and paralleling the loop from west to east. loop 1604 was about a mile north of my position when the object came into view. the object was about the size of a penny when my hand is held at arms length with the thumb and index finger extended. the object appeared to be very low, maybe 800 feet of altitude and was descending at a very shallow angle of about one unit down for every ten units forward. it was traveling at a very high rate of speed, much faster than the commercial air traffic that is common in this area as these jets set up for landing at san antonio international about three miles to the south of my position when i first saw it. i estimate that it was within my field of vision for about 7 seconds before it passed out of view behind buildings to my right. my first impression was that it was a very bright meteor and i kept expecting it to burn out, but it did not lose any intensity while within my view. my next impression was that it was so bright that it looked like burning magnesium, but did not have any other colors associated with it other than the flaming yellow tail. my last impression was that i fully expected to come around the buildings and see that it had hit the ground somewhere between hwy 281 and universal city about 7 - 8 miles to the east. i drove up to the interchange at 1604 and 281 and watched to the east for a few minutes but did not see any sign of the object or a possible impact. i called 911 to report this incident because i expect that this object had to have hit the ground somewhere to the east of 281 unless it burned up immediately after passing out of my view.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:07","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line
