streaking across the open blue sky. birds, insects, planes, even men, fly, and none are capable of cutting through the sky like the object i observed. at aire shows the speeds at which jets move can be appreciated due to how short a distance the  observer is allowed to ejoy the show from. yet, even at the air show - when the jets fly some distance away - they appear to be moving at a slower rate. this past september, the object i observed was a good distance away - maybe a mile or more - and still its speed was impossible. you may ask: \"if it was going so fast, how did you get such a good look at it?\" all i can say is this: when the the human mind observes something entirely new to its senses, it locks onto it, and the entire world seems to slow down as all of the brilliant details stand out like flames and brand themselves into your memory. in the state of maine we are not supposed to have mountain lions. the game wardens service says they do not exist up hear. well the people up this way see them. i saw one run across the street in front of my cruiser, and although it crossed the street a few graceful bounds, my mind locked onto what i was seeing for the very first time and allowed me to record details that might be missed amid a more common event. so, anyway, that is my report. ive seen things before, but always had doubts about what i really saw. i have no doubts about last september.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":35391,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.9536111,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02012012-0009","longitude":-67.1619444,"occurred":1314921600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maine","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1328133152000,"summary":"While on patrol i observed a disc shaped object the color of silver light streak across the open, blue, sky.","tags":["disc","light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":152,"locationName":"Pembroke, Maine","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:14144"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover), Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Chino","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was at the children's museum in chino california at a birthday party. the party was just ending it was around 4 pm i was talking to my wife's cousin when this bright lite kinda flickered it wasn't high up in the sky cause i barely look up just over the two story building it seem to be a way's away cause it looked small but my wife's cousin was also taking picture's, i don't know what kind of camera he had but it had a five to six inch lens on it so i told him to take some pictures he took a total of six pictures all with in maybe thirty seconds you can see the object moving away and up from us till we finally lost it. he then shows me the pictures on the cameras screen they looked very small till he zoomed in close and wow is all i could say i was very excited about the whole event, i was the only one so i had him send my wife the pictures through facebook my wife emailed them to me the next day, my wife's cousin said he left the option of zooming in on the pictures i sent you zoomed in pictures on file cimg215.Jpg and the originals on file dsc_3579.Jpg... the only reason i seen it is because i'm always looking up and was in the marines for a while till i got hurt in the early nineties so know that wasn't a plane helicopter even though the ontario airport is only five or so miles away that actually made me think about the airspace there's no way it was a civilian aircraft the big airlines fly by just a little higher than object..Send me an email or call me to know i\"m not just wasting my time..Cause i have lots more..Thank you ","distance":"501 Feet -

had church.  as i was traveling south from tyler, tx towards frankston, tx, i noticed a weird light in the sky.  it was a different color than the planets and stars that we are used to seeing and that is what caught my attention about this light.  the stars and planets are all bright white colored and this was a distinct orange-yellow color.  however, at first i thought that maybe it was the north star because of the location of it, it seemed to be closer to the ground and very, very bright.  we made a right turn to go home and saw the object again from a different angle and it seemed to not be as bright as before and more yellow-orange than it was before too.  the object was so intriguing and fascinating to me that i felt compelled to check it out more so i dropped my mom off at home and then took my camera to the marina to get a better look at it.  when i got to the marina the object had moved over accross the lake and was hovering over the other side of the shore.  there were alot of people out shooting fireworks so occasionally i would hear and see fireworks accross the lake underneath where the object was hovering.  it looked like a orange yellow ball that was pulsating or blinking colors kinda like disco lights flash.  i would see red and blue colors flash inside of this orange yellow ball.  i got out my camera right when i got there and took some still pictures and then decided to do a video.  it was very cold and my hands were shaking so i am afraid the video may not have come out that well, but it does show the object when i used the zoom on my camera to show more detail of the object and then i would zoom out to show where the object was in relation of the lake and the lights on the lake.  the part of the video where you dont see anything but black is when i was trying to get a plane to show up on the video but all the planes i saw were so small compared to this orb that i couldnt get them to show up.  the purpose of that was to show the difference between this orb and a plane.  i stayed for a while and the object just slowly moved away from where i was until it was just a little spec of light hoving over the horizon.  my battery kept going dead so i didnt get to film it all.  i felt excited that i got the object on video.  i really think it was not a plane because planes are not round, and it moved too funny to be a planet or a star. weird.\r\np.S. i have tried repeatedly to send my videos but i guess the video files are too big and they wont allow me to submit my report.  i will send stills instead. \r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

children and i were returning to our home.  while we were in front of the cited address, i was pointing out the stars in the belt of orion to my children when we noticed a \"flock\" of glowing birds in a perfect \"v\" moving across the sky at a very fast speed - at least twice as fast as i've ever seen birds move across the sky.  at no time did any of the \"birds\" flap or change position relative to the other.  though i didn't count them at the time, i recall 5-6 \"birds\" down each \"wing\" of the \"v\" with one in the lead (giving a total of 11-13). the \"birds\" appeared to be of uniform size and exhibited a uniform dull white-yellow glow.\r\n\r\nthe \"v\" came almost directly overhead (approximately 80-85 deg. above the horizon) with a heading of approximately 350 deg in a straight line (as estimated using google earth).  no sound was detected.\r\n\r\ninitially, i believed the object was a flock of birds due to the distinct \"v\" shape; however, i noted it was moving too fast to be birds so i began to think it might be a plane based on our proximity to dulles airport.  about this time, i was able to see the \"bird\" shapes more clearly and again thought it must be a flock.  as the birds/object came over, i waited to hear a sound, however, no sound was heard by any of us.  i lost sight of the object in nearby trees.  i hoped i would be able to make out a shape behind the \"birds\" from the half moon, but i was not able to do so.  i am not sure if it was a \"trick of the trees\" but the object may have begun to bank to the right just after it passed us.\r\n\r\na pure guess as to the altitude of the object would be approximately 1000 feet agl.\r\n \r\na number of commercial aircraft were in the area; however, they appear much higher in altitude and exhibit standard navigational and anti-collision lights.  dulles airport is approximately 8nm wnw of our location.\r\n \r\nin an attempt to rule out a flock of birds flying very fast due to a tail

as i was having electrical \"flashing\" on my dashboard electronics & pulled over(this is a brand new truck). the view was such a unique site. several sonic booms were heard during this flight process in a very tight circle.\r\n\r\n        i started to take pictures of the circular patterns as they criss-crossed in a spiral upward motion from about 12k ft to almost 30k feet in approximation. the jet paused mid-air, and dropped to the lower altitude similar to a harrier jet & began the spiral once again. this time, their were glowing circular objects going straight up in the middle of the plumes. they werent weather balloons, in the traditional sense, as they  would stop mid-air, descend and then accelerate at a high rate of speed upward & then stop as the jet came closer.\r\n\r\n        this happened over the china lake \"echo\" range which is a communications and radar jamming system. the coordinates seemed to be somewhere above the area of 35 degrees 33 08.32\" x 117 degrees, 26 38.77\" in approximation.\r\n\r\n        i was able to capture photos of the circling jet, plumes of smoke and upon initial review, couldnt pick up the circular objects, which seemed to fade-in and out with an almost reflective mirror quality. i thought initially it could be weather balloons made of a highly reflective mylar, as most balloons are produced this way. balloons do have the capability to travel by radio control, so i am not so naive to think and understand that side-to-side and up-n-down movement would not be possible with our current technology. the speeds however & dead stopping in mid-air at a rate that the jet could not match left me thinking it might be something else.\r\n\r\n        upon careful review and clicking on the depth of field clarification on my htc cell phone picture i was able to see very clearly the 7 each circular objects. these objects were witnessed by other vehicles that had stopped, they too were taking pictures with their cell phones. the day was clear, the temp about 83f, mid-day at about 11:20am. i have a mountain view in the background of the pictures as a contrast.\r\n\r\n        the circular objects went up and down a few more times, stopped at a certain elevation (approximately 12k ft) and ascended straight-up & excellerated to a point of vanishing. the miliatry jet, seemed to attempt to follow, then travelled in a excellerated speed at almost a verticle climb. the aircraft dissapeared from view into the stratosphere.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"11:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":35372,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.6316161,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01312012-0007","longitude":-117.6677666,"occurred":1327000800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Cylinder,   Disc,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1328061263000,"summary":"Ufos ascended to a hieght of approximately 35k ft., decended beyond the mountains which are only at about 3k ft circled by jet @ high rate of speed -

have watched satellites over the years and never seen them change in intensity. this got really bright for a split second or two, becoming the brightest star in the sky. i thought that maybe a satellite had burned up in the atmosphere, but in a split second it went back to the original duller tone of what looked like a satellite. it kinda freaked me out because the light gave me the feeling

pm\r\n\r\ndescription of incident:\r\n \r\n on january 27, 2012 at 6:44 pm i was taking pictures at random of a 'waxing crescent moon' as i was trying to decide what type of photo compostion i might use. the following pictures were taken as basic preliminary snap shots before focusing on closeup photos of the moon on a very clear evening.\r\n the two pictures submitted were taken within 2 seconds of each other.  it wasn't until later that evening, when i was looking at the pictures, did i notice that i may have captured two 'rods' in picture dsc_8019e.  i was convinced when i discovered that in the previous picture dsc_8018e had no evidence of any 'rods' what so ever.  it was as if they were there one second and gone in the next.\r\n \r\n identifying the two 'rods': in picture dsc_8019e: 'rod' 1 is located almost in the center of the picture; three branches up from the fork of the tree. 'rod' 2 is much more prominent because it is in the open sky to the right of 'rod' 1. both 'rods' appear to be on the same projectory from the left to the right of the picture. \r\n \r\nequipment
