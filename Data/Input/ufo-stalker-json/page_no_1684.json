ufo.  i was driving at night on interstate 74/280 in between coal valley and the 74/80 interchange in the illinois side.  it was a heavily wooded area on both sides of the interstate and there were no cars on the stretch of road besides me.  the first thing i noticed was what appeared to be stadium lights off behind the trees to one side and wondering how i didn't know there was a stadium over there, since i'd grown up in that area.  out of the corner of my eye i noticed that the 'stadium lights' disappeared behind taller trees for a little bit and then suddenly reappeared much closer than they had been initially, which caught my attention.  when i looked back, the lights were now coming over the interstate and i could make out the gigantic triangle shape (i'm talking football field size, at least).  it was moving very slowly (think blimp) and i couldn't hear any sound coming from it. engine and road noise may have covered a hum but there was no significant noise (i hear planes and helicopters over engine and road noise all the time).  it seems like there was 1 white light on each corner and 1 white light centered on each side and there seemed to be a 'mist' around it, or possibly it was entering clouds, but seemed to be much too low for that to be possible.  i cannot remember for sure it if was a partly cloudy night or not but i do remember determining its shape at one point by seeing the stars that it blocked as it passed in front of them.  i'm not sure of color but it had to be very dark.  it floated slowly over my truck until it disappeared behind the trees on the other side of the interstate.  something else to note, prior to this incident, if someone had told me this same story that i am now telling, i would have been sure they were nuts and never believed it.  i also cannot believe that i did not pull over and stop.  all i remember is leaning forward looking up at it (because by the time it was crossing the interstate it was basically directly above my truck) and feeling complete awe mixed with almost fear and general unease.  i just kept driving, asking myself over and over again in my head 'what was that?' and trying to rationalize it.  there is nothing to this day that i can think of that it could have been.  it was the most amazing crazy thing that has ever happened to me.","distance":"21-100

(this is about 5 minutes after the first two objects disappeared). the two jets were flying perpendicular to one another, yet they weren't meeting one another at any point. i focused my attention on one of the jets, and watched the trail it left. this was a normal trail, one that dissipated into the air. strangely enough, a white orb appeared next to the trail. it looked as if it remained stationary, and the plane continued in it's normal path. did the plane drop a white sphere? i didn't see the sphere come out of the plane, and i didn't see the sphere come out of the trail. it just appeared next to the trail, and looked as if it were stationary. it disappeared with the trail. do airplanes drop white spheres that remain stationary? i would like some kind of explanation as to what it could be. the first two objects were probably trash, but spotting this orb appearing at a different location shortly after the first two disappeared has made me question whether or not the first two objects were really trash.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":35351,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.61216226015271,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01302012-0008","longitude":-82.15912036589128,"occurred":1327963020000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Tennessee","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1327964394000,"summary":"Clear skies. saw 2 orb-like objects close to the horizon, right above the tree line. they moved around each other then disappeared. saw two jets going in opposite directions afterwards. as if dropped by one of the jets, an orb appeared near the trail.

it was already dark out, and i was outside performing a chore that i had to wait on.  i was listening to a recording on my phone/mp3 player and was just observing the sky in front of me.  just a few degrees above my virtual horizon (a tree line 1.43 miles away at an altitude of 863\").  i observed a light appear then disappear.  it did not move in any direction.  it was just there for about a second and then it was not.  i am very familiar with this horizon, and knew that this was out of place.  i had already observed aircraft flying in and out of this area and this was nothing like that.  it did not come into this area of the sky, it just appeared.  for over an hour i observed, in an approximate heading of 75.64 degrees and at a very good distance, this object appear for no longer than two seconds then disappear.  i witnessed this over a dozen times.  each time it appeared at varying heights and locations with varying intensity.  it was red on top and white on the bottom. all occurring within a small window of the sky.  the closest known thing i could equate it to was fireworks in the distance.  it would have had to have been the exact same firework fired off each time.  my wife observed this object twice independently and once with me. after doing a bit of research i learned that at my altitude the full horizon spans nearly 70 miles.  depending upon the objects altitude it could have been even further away.  at no time were either of us disturbed, or uncomfortable about what we were seeing.","distance":"Over One

with the staes. that when this bright light tock off like a bat out of hell this thing was moving so fast that it looked like a tracer across the sky then just disappear.Then it shows up just off to my left like someone had turned a bright light on. it stayed stationary for about 5 min then just like the first time it started all again first tracer then disappared.Then poped back up in the same place i had seen it the first time. i watched this light do this for about 20min back and forth right to left.I to my girl friend to come and check this out.I told her to look between these two pine trees at that bright light up there.Just i said that it took off i said look over there as i pointed it will show up over. she gave me this look i told her ive been watching this for 20 min it just

stat-icy. as i leaned forward to adjust the channel, commenting to my wife that it was strange, an object caught my eye over the treeline. i said to my wife \"look!!\" and she said \"what the f**k!!\"\"\r\n i slowed the jeep to a crawl, fascinated.\r\nwhat we saw was a pie shaped \"object\" traveling from west to east, right above the treeline. it was very close, about 500ft from us, maybe 75-100ft above the trees....And it was big. as it crossed in front of us, the \"front tip of it would be on one side of the road over the tree line while the \"back\" was still over the treeline on the other side of the road.\r\n\r\n it was a dull grey in color with lights shining on the underside. i could see the underside front, side and back as it passed. there were no lights on the side or back. there were some sort of... \"protrusions\"...On the sides and back(kind of like you'd see on a ship), and had what appeared to be barnicals the size of 5 gallon buckets and kelp hanging off the back.\r\n\r\nit was moving so friggin slow, i thought how the hell is that thing in the air?? there was no sound from it, no exhaust,there was no disturbance of the vegetation as it passed over it...No trees swaying, anything like that.\r\n\r\nall i could think was that thing had been under water for a long time.\r\n\r\nas it passed over the eastern treeline i sped up the jeep hoping to regain another sight advantage point, but it was just...Gone. the radio came back in clear and that was it.\r\n\r\ni can't tell anyone what it was but i certainly tell them what it wasn't.\r\nit wasn't a plane, helicopter,kite,balloon,rocket,cloud,sunspot,boat none of that.\r\n\r\ni am a practical man and that incident changed the way i think of ufo.\r\ni would love to go under hypnosis and
