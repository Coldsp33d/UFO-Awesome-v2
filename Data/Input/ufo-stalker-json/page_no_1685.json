i ended up deep in the woods at a deck that overlooks the reservoir! orions belt was so bright that i thought it would come out on camera... \r\n\r\nwhile looking at it, i was thinking about my poor little brother whos fighting cancer. then i saw what i thought was an airplane coming towards me, but it was getting brighter and brighter... it disappeared then reappeared, but it was moving side to side also! thats when i got down on my knees and mounted my elbows onto the railing to support my helmet and get the camera very steady. the footage shows something amazing!\r\n\r\nit is so much more interesting to watch on my computer frame-by-frame. for youtube, i edited it to make sense of the sighting for a general audience. ufologists believe it without a doubt, but to show that its not fake in any way, i did a lot of work to give more perspective...\r\n\r\ni composited a still image from that exact point during day time and left it 10% transparent in the background so you can understand movement better without taking away from the view i saw. i also added 20% contrast to make the objects a tiny bit more clear/bright in the all black background (to show it how i saw it). at the time, i didnt realize that doing this also hides the hundreds of surrounding orbs that are also blinking. its not bad, though, because what i saw clearest was that one airplane-looking amber light that came towards me. also, i didnt visually see them appear in front of me when i yelled to them; i only saw blinks in the distance and could feel their presence!\r\n\r\nive watched many ufo videos on youtube. many are real. the debunkers like to use effects to add perspective to whats going on. i experimented with a different effect called \"echo,\" which makes a trail of the same object. if youre interested in my video analysis, please watch-  [link moved to fi section/cms/tg]  \r\n\r\nthe first thing i did to report this sighting was writing the editor of mufon: clifford clift, who told me my sighting \"could not be analyzed\" because it is not \"original.\" for this report, i went back to the video and deleted all slowmos and perspective attempts. i also removed the 10% contrast adjustment, which reveals hundreds of surrounding orbs. they are tough to see, but if you look at your screen from an angle, they will be easily distinguished. now this video should absolutely able to be analyzed by the ufo professionals. nothing done to it other than cuts to save time and sound decibel lowering to save your ears!\r\n\r\nmy last email to clifford explained why i think this video is so important and how i want people to see it on a huge scale, but he ignored me. i think its important for people to see the difference between ufos as objects and ufos as entities/spiritual beings. \r\n\r\ni think this video proves their extra-dimensional existence and that they are trying to communicate with us. this event changed my life and the way i think about life as a whole. its made me realize that life exists beyond life and perhaps how we live our lives is reflected by our souls and not our minds. it has taught me how powerful the mind is and that awareness plays a major role in how you perceive the world around you. \r\n\r\ni am not religious, but i must state what i was doing at the time. i was thinking about my little brother, whos fighting cancer. about 3 weeks prior to this event i was also staring at an open sky, thinking of him when a big bright green and red light fell from the sky at mach speed...But i didnt get that on camera and that was very far away.\r\n\r\nthis experience opened my mind further than its already been. during the experience, i felt the understanding that life is about how you deal with it; not how you live it. negative thoughts only create negative emotions. stay positive with a clear mind and you can overcome anything. that is the mindset i have now. i no longer hope, but i believe in positivity for every circumstance. i will no longer live in fear. i know my brother will be fine. i will try not to think, \"what if?\" about something beyond my control.\r\n\r\nagain, please watch the youtube analysis and leave a comment/opinion. i am eager to see what others think as this is my first time actually filming something i saw in the sky!

strange lights that he and his son were watching in the sky. i live about 8 miles from him in medina, tennessee. after about 6 or 8 minutes i was able to find the lights he was describing. they were oval shaped lights (about 6) that were moving in a general counter-clockwise circular pattern and were in the southwest sky close to the moons position. there were some clouds in the area of the moon that obscured it. the lights were reflecting off of these clouds. i soon identified these as lights from a spotlight since i had seen similar lights rotating in this pattern several years ago (i even drove and found the spotlight in the parking lot of a local club in jackson).\r\n\r\ni had called my son, daughter, and wife out to the back porch to check out the lights. since i could identify them, i didnt grab a camera. as we were watching these lights a bright light appeared out of nowhere at approximately 8:30 pm. the light was due south of our location at about 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon. it was very bright, mostly steady, solid white but with a redish/orange pulsating glow around it. it was traveling directly towards our position. at first i thought it might be a helicopter with its search light on coming straight at us. however, as it got closer, the light never changed even after it got directly above us. also, it became apparent that it was actually very high (several miles) and was moving at an extremely high rate of speed. there was also no sound. it moved in a steady straight path eventualy getting to 90 degrees directly above us. at first i thought that this object was the international space station since i have seen it pass over many times over the years. the white part of the light was solid and steady, not blinking, but the outer edges were glowing red and orange with a pulsating action. the size of the object was also very similar to the size of the station and had a very similar brightness. however, i have never seen edges like this on the station. after i came in, i checked the position of the station and it was over australia.\r\n\r\nthe object continued over our heads and as it got to about 100 or 115 degrees it became redish/orange only, began to get smaller and smaller until it just blinked out. my son got my wifes iphone and did manage to take video of the object after it passed 90 degrees and until it blinked out. we viewed the object for about 60 seconds from the time we first saw it until it vanished.\r\n\r\ni am confused about this because of the color and characteristics of the object. my instinct was that it was a satellite, however, i know of nothing that bright other than the space station and as i said, it was not in our area. also, the color was very strange with the pulsating red and orange edges compared to what i have seen of satellites in the past. i have attached the video also.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

clouds and the temperature was about 10���c. i was with my family in my apartment, located in the colony \"letran valle\" in mexico city. we were just to breakfast, when looking out the window, i saw far away a series of some objects that at first seemed like metallic balloons.\r\nafter looking at them for some time, we note that they were not actually balloons like.\r\nthey were at a distance of about 5 to 6 kilometers south-west direction, at the height of the horizon (approximate) . the group of objects climbed slowly, one followed by another one (we count around 75 of them) to reach a high altitude (about 50 degrees from my place, maybe around 40 to 60 km to the ground), and slowly they began to move northward.\r\nhard to tell if they emitted some kind of light or just reflected sunlight (which was very intense) because they looked very small from our perspective, and it was, sometimes, easy to lose them in the blue sky.\r\nwe took some pictures with cell phones, but it not work at all (they were too high), so i took my old canon rebel xt semi-pro digital camera (8 mega-pixels) and i took around 10 pictures without knowing if it really will work (because i can't see anything from the camera vision), it was very difficult to focus, given its small size and high altitude.\r\nit took about 10 to 15 minutes to the group of objects to cross the sky, until they passed over our building (four floors), and we were not able to see them anymore.\r\nby capturing the photographs in the computer,i happily discover the objects on the pictures with some help of the digital zoom, but sadly i did not take any clear object to work like reference to the objects...\r\n\r\npd: also, my lens was very dirty :p\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nen espa���ol:\r\nera una ma���ana soleada, al rededor de las 9:00 a.M., no hab���a nubes y la temperatura era de unos 10���c. estaba con mi familia en mi departamento, ubicado en la colonia letran valle, en la ciudad de m���xico. estabamos por desayunar, cuando al mirar por la ventana (frente a la mesa), observ���, bast���nte lejos, una serie de objetos que en un primer momento parec���an globos metalicos.\r\nluego de mirarlos con mayor atenci���n, nosotros notamos que no aprec���an ser globos.\r\nse encontraban a una distancia de unos 5 a 6 km, en direcci���n al suroeste, a la altura del horizonte. ascendieron lentamente, unos seguidos de otros (contamos al rededor de 75 objetos) hasta alcanzar una gran altitud (a unos 50��� desde mi perpectiva), y lentamente comenzaron a avanzar hacia el norte.\r\nes dificil saber si emit���an una luz propia o reflejaban la luz del sol (que era muy intensa) y se ve���an basnate peque���os desde nuestra perscetiva; tanto que en ocasiones era f���cil perderlos de vista.\r\ntomamos algunas fotograf���as con celulares, pero no se lograban distinguir, as��� que tom��� una c���mara digital canon rebel xt (8 megapixeles) y tom��� varias fotograf���as sin saber si en realidad aparecer���asn los objetos en ellas, pues era muy dificil enfocarlos, dado su peque���o tama���o y su gran altitud.\r\ntardaron unos 10 a 15 minutos en cruzar el cielo, hasta que pasaron sobre nuestro edificio (de cuatro pisos), y no los pudimos ver m���s.\r\nal capturar las fotograf���as a la computadora, felizmente observ��� que s��� se lograban ver los objetos al hacer zoom digital; pero que tristemente no integr��� muchos objetos como referencia...\r\n\r\npd: mi lente estaba bastante sucio :p","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
