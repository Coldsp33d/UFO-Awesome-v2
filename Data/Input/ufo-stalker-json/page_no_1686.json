States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On monday january 23, 2012 while heading home to fayetteville from farmington, arkansas, i noticed a bright star like light in the sw sky. the time was about 8:15 p.M. more or less. initially the light was about 30-40 degrees above the horizon. i first noticed it when i turned on hamestring rd. where i stopped my car completely, rolled down my window and watched it. it looked stationary and appeared to be about the height most aircraft. i kept driving and stopped not far down the road and rolled down my window again to view the light. it looked as if it might have been traveling horizontally very slowly. however, it was hard to tell if it was because there was an airplane flying in its vicinity and that may have given me the impression that it was moving. the light was very bright and resembled a planes landing light, but was more star like. in fact when i first saw it i thought that it was a plane but i was wondering why it wasnt moving. i have seen airplanes and helicopters with their landing lights on so i know how they can appear starlike, especially if they facing you and are heading in your direction. i continued driving on to john garrison rd. all the while keeping the light in my sight. when i pulled into our driveway, the light was still in my sight in the sw. i took a couple of bags inside and grabbed my binoculars (i didnt get my camera because at this point i thought it was probably something ordinary) to better view the object. i went back outside immediately and stood by the field next to my house to study this light. between when i first noticed the light while i was driving and when i arrived in my yard with my binoculars about five minutes had passed. for what seemed like 10 minutes i watched this light, which appeared to hover or remain in the same spot in the sky, and considered the possibility of it being venus or some other planet. for at that time i ruled out the possibility of it being aircraft because an aircraft could not stay in the sky in one spot for that long and i could hear no noise coming from this light. the next explanation that made the most sense would be a planet. this light looked similar to venus at its brightest but with obvious differences. it was similar in that it was in the same spot where venus usually is,it appeared to twinkle (it would dim and brighten slightly) and it seemed to be still. it was different in that it was more intensely bright seemed to be larger, and was a yellow-orange color, while venus is more white. after about 10 minutes of observing this light, i ruled out the possibility of it being a planet. it started to move slowly and strangely. it would randomly move in a contained space around itself in various directions. it barely moved from where it had originally been hovering. at first i thought that i might have been mistaken about its movements but i saw it repeat these strange movements over a period of about 5-10 min. this is when i thought \"what planet or craft does that?\" sometimes the light would move in said manner and sometimes it would remain stationary. throughout the time i was watching the light, it was gradually moving toward the west. it was only apparent that it was moving because the longer i watched it the farther away it got. you could not tell it was moving away unless you studied it for a few minutes. i watched it until it was almost over the horizon. i then headed inside because you could hardly see it anymore. the farther away it got the dimmer it became and it began to take on a reddish tint. throughout the sighting i would look at the light through my binoculars and it just looked like a yellow-orange dot, not quite round like a circle in shape. while this light was in the sky , i could hear dogs barking in the direction of the object. as it got lower in the sky and farther west, the dogs barking quietened but i could still hear the dogs farther to the west barking. the whole time i was watching the light i kept thinking \"what is that?\" and when it began to move unusually, i thought, \" thats incredible!\". i kept running through explanations in my head for this light but i couldnt come up with any that didnt have flaws. i have never seen any light move, behave or look like this one. does venus move across the sky in that short amount of time. what else could move the way this light moved? there was a lot of air traffic in the vicinity of the light (including airplanes and jets) for the duration of the sighting. the light didnt really seem to react to these. i was very curious and excited during the sighting. the entire sighting from the time i first saw the light to when it was barely visible on the horizon lasted approximately half an hour, from around 8:15 p.M to 8:45 p.M. i did not attempt to record the light on video or take photographs mainly because i didnt want to go inside and miss this light doing something out of the ordinary. furthermore, it wouldnt have shown up very good in photographs and had i taken a video it probably would have been shaky as there was nothing to rest the camera on. this sighting leaves me with a lot of questions. i cannot come up with an explanation. i am surprised that there arent more reports from the area on this light. im sure that other people saw it as well.

the trip.\r\n\r\nat approximately 7:24am, about 50 miles east of el paso, i observe a bright white light to the north of i10. the sun had been up for about an hour and at first i assume the light i am seeing is a star or the sun's reflection on an aircraft.\r\n\r\nafter maybe 7-10 seconds of me looking at the light, it blinks out, leaving an empty blue sky. i look away from the northern horizon for about 3 seconds (long enough to see that my girlfriend is sound asleep in the passenger seat) before looking back to see another bright white light, this one much further east but at roughly the same altitude and intensity as the first light.\r\n\r\ni stare again for maybe 8 seconds before the light begins to fade in a circular motion, from the bottom upward - as if the light were rotating around the object - from a bright white to a dullish silver, to a dark grey, to a faint egg-on-its-side silhouette before completely vanishing again. this entire process lasted 3-4 seconds at most.\r\n\r\nfor the next several minutes, i search the skies in vain as the lights do not make a reappearance.\r\n\r\ni also noted two nearby jet streams, one almost directly under the first light (from my perspective), and a second much further to the east of both sightings.\r\n\r\naside from the jet streams, the sky was as clear as could be. i will not even attempt to estimate the distance we were from the lights, but they appeared to be at the approximate height you would expect to see a commercial aircraft, and about the size and intensity of a bright star.\r\n\r\nafter about 5 minutes of trying to process what i'd just witnessed, i text my father an entire blow-by-blow of the experience. my girlfriend wakes up about 10 minutes after the sighting and immediately comments that i appear shaken up; after telling her the story, she is upset that i did not wake her up during the sighting. i tell her that the entire event lasted 20-30 seconds at most and that i did not know (and still don't) what i was witnessing until after it had happened.\r\n\r\nwe watched the skies carefully for the rest of the morning. this region of texas along i10 is fairly desolate and we did not see any other aircraft for several hours after the event.\r\n\r\nwhile i am a little disappointed that my first ufo sighting can only best be described as a \"bright white light,\" i am truly dumbfounded

flight, aprox 11am to 12 noon, i looked out the window and observed a cigar shaped object that was aprox 5 to 8 miles away & seemed to be aprox 3 to 4 football fields long, silver outer shaped along with darker features inside of the shape. i rubbed my eyes, kept seeing it for 5 seconds, then i turned to the man sitting next to me and said \"look, do you see that\"? he looked out and said no! as i looked back out, it was gone!I was jut relaxing at the time, just looking out the window from time to time,it was so large, that's why i noticed it. i know when i saw it it was not of this world as i was in the u.S. navy & worked on aircraft & worked for the dod and government contractors! it was stationary didn't seem to move. i was excited! and nervous!Lost sight when i turned to the man in the seat next to me. i really hope someone else reported the same type of object on the same day, time, and location. please direct me where to go to find out that info, thank you!","distance":"Over

ran to the other side of the house. i called her and she didn't come so i toll approx 8-10 steps toward the rear of the house and my attention was drawn to a light just above the trees in my backyard. i looked up at this light thinking it was a police light but as i kept looking there was no other light except this blue. very strange light almost bright and dull if that makes sense. i watched this ball of light which was only above the trees and in clear view for what i would say was five\r\nminutes. not one movement or sound from the object the blue light was steady and there were yellow lights in it shining through the blue. the only thing the light did was sort of flash which scared me terribly and i ran back inside the house. i crept over to my window to look from my bedroom and the ball of light was gone. i have been overcome with fear since and i haven't slept during darkness since. i have also woken up suddenly in the days since with no explanation of how i got there. i cannot understand any of this and i am terribly frightened of what i stumbled upon. i must stress i was never threatened by the light and it never interacted with me however i believe that i interrupted whatever it was doing. i have contacted multiple people to try and figure out what happened with no luck as of yet.","distance":"21-100

but whirring instead of that linear scream. then the object came into view from behind, in-between my home & the two story home to the right(there was never any question of what it was); it looked like a black disk with a silver seven pointed pentagram on the domed/bubbled bottom with several randomly appearing rectangle red lights & one bar shaped light at the end of each point outlining  the circle. i was instantly very happy, kind hearted, sexually aroused to a flash erection, loving & appreciative of life(not my usual but has not left yet) the object continued across the street, over the high school drive-way then did a 1/4 circle curve out of my sight behind a very small hill. i felt like my dog died for a split second, saw a white strobe for about four flashes from the other side of the hill & have felt a bit high on life with a touch of horney anxiety. for a few days now & a reaccuring thought that a 'reunion' is approaching. it only seemed to take..Maybe 30 seconds but my cig. had burned away & out completely. unfortunately i was much too passive and \"love drunk\" to think of looking at the time again but it seemed a good deal quieter & i felt amazing like that
