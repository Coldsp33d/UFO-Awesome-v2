directions including around each other.  the night sky was so clear it was only the second time i was able to see milky way with bare eyes.  2 minutes after going outside my wife joined me outside and to our south she pointed out a large triangle shaped object with 3 lights on each tip.  the object was only a quarter mile above the ground and it was traveling very slowly and noiseless.  we watched this triangle continue its path due west and after 5 minutes or more, just as it was almost out of sight it began returning in our direction and passed by my house again now to my north watching it for a total of 15 minutes.  i live on a dead end street and had people on my road trying to chase it down.  just as i lost sight of it for the first time it was about to go ver the ocean. at my house here we are lucky to have a very good unobstructed view for miles in all directions without trees even interfering.  we live on a dead end road with only 3 homes past mine and the road is not finished yet because it has not been developed.  the only cars to pass my house daily are the people living on my road, but while this was going on,at one point had 11 vehicles turning around.  we did not hear

an amber glow masking its actual shape and size. i have found these and other craft are attracted to green lasers and actually carry one with me and once i confirmed the object was not an aircraft

couple more seconds as my laser would reflect off its surface then it disappeared in an unknown direction. the orbs are always silent and seem to be trying to camouflage them selves as conventional

the sky was clear with large cumulus clouds.  i spotted a contrail coming from a craft or ufo.  the ufo was heading straight up at an angle to my left at about 11 oclock.  at the time i spotted it, it was probably under 20,000 ft altitude.  it was a conical shaped craft that was a little bigger than what you would see on the top of a saturn 5 rocket. the shape was probably a little more skinny than the saturn 5 module.  the best way i can describe it is to say it was similar to the mcdonnell douglass delta clipper. it had a polished metallic appearance exterior and the sunlight would flash off of its reflective skin as it moved.  its speed was not too fast or too slow but about what you see commercial jets flying at.  the contrail was a white continuous stream with clear and crisp white rings at a constant frequency (donuts on a rope).  i saw these rings popping out of the exhaust of the ufo and it was maybe 1 every 1-3 seconds id say -not too fast or too slow.  the rings appear like actual rings unlike some of the photos i've seen on the internet about this subject.  i kept watching this craft as it increased in altitude to probably above 60k feet where i couldnt see it any more.  also, to the right i saw 2 other ufos that were of the same shape and design which were ascending at a similar speed to the first.  they appeared to the upper right or at the 1 oclock position of me and these were at a lower altitude at first (staged lower from the first ufo).  however, these two which looked like they were side by side had no exhaust whatsoever that i could see.  again i kept watch of these 2 ufos until i could not see them as they disappeared into the upper atmosphere traveling at a steep angle opposite of the first ufo.\r\n","distance":"Over One

want to share with you with some of my experiences for which i have been desperately looking answers. i had many unusual experiences throughout my life which i think are unexplainable. i have been thinking since long time to talk to someone professional regarding this but never had the courage to do so. \r\n\r\ni am 28 years old punjabi girl, basically from mumbai, living in australia since 3 years for study.\r\n \r\nthe first unusual experience i had during my childhood, i don���t remember the exact year, but i think i was 10-11 years old at that time.  that night, i went to sleep as usual, when i got up i had very strange memories about being carried away by someone in space. they took me with them while i was sleeping; i was walking with them. i can���t remember the faces of the beings, but they were similar to humans as i have very blurred vision about that. i was laid down, and they inserted something on my collar bone. they pushed it inside my skin using long, thin needle-like equipment. it was painful. when i got up in the morning, for 10-20 minutes i was stunned and thinking about what happened last night.  i couldn���t believe that anything like that can happen; as i never heard anything like that i thought it was just a bad dream. i remember, i was looking through the window, and i thought it is not possible for someone to come from the sky as there was so less gap between the two buildings.  then i went to look up in the mirror, i saw there is a scar on my collar bone. i was very scared, and couldn���t believe it was true. i tried to convince myself what i think about the scar is not true, and the memories i remember was just a bad dream.\r\n\r\nafter that, i started getting depressed about things and lost interest in studying. i was thinking suicidal at that time, lost interest in living in this world. i had bad nightmares and was too scared to go to school. i hurt myself by cutting my hand with blades, pen. my parents took me took to psychiatrist and after some time my health was improved. \r\n\r\nafter 2- 3 years of depression, i was good , i got very fat due to my over-eating in depression, i became like 90 kgs, i made up my mind and i lost 40 kgs in one year. i worked in film industry as a junior artist for some time, and then i started studying again and still studying.\r\n\r\ni had some unusual experiences like feeling of knowing something before, out of body experiences but i never paid much attention to these things as i didn���t really want to think about those things. \r\n\r\nin the year 2008, i was travelling to go to 2 institutes to enquire about a course. while i was travelling, i suddenly started feeling happy and my mind said me that today you are going to get a job offer from an institute. when i went to the first institute, the counselor really offered me a job offer. i was truly amazed at that time, and felt how can a feeling become true. i was also puzzled that it was a feeling or a message by someone.\r\n\r\nthen in the end of the year 2009, my brother was engaged with a girl and they were together since 7-8 months and were soon going to get married. everything was going good and preparations for the marriage were started at my house.  a week before the marriage, i got a vision; i can't really explain that vision. it was more like a feeling or message, and what i interpreted from that message was that my brother will not get married and i uttered those words from the mouth. during that message, i also saw a monkey like being.  my husband was also sitting with me when this thing happened and he heard what i said. then i just got confused of what i said and i told my husband why i am feeling bad about my brother, i shouldn���t be thinking like that. i felt it was just a thought of mind and nothing else. but the next day, i got a call from my father that my brother���s engagement is broken and he is not going to get married. it was shocking as it shows there is some kind of connection between mind and reality.\r\nin the year 2010, one day i was just sitting and feeling sad about mother and don���t know why i was feeling like it. after few hours a call from my mom on my phone, and i was just too scared to attend that call. i started crying in front of my husband and told him it is a bad news, i don���t want to hear the bad news. i am normal and have never done anything like this crazy before without any valid reason. i don���t know why i behaved like that. i talked to my mom for an hour or so and was so happy that my mom is good and nothing really has happened to her. but then after 2 days i got a call from home, again that feeling started. i thought to ignore the feeling and attended the call. this time my brother was calling to give bad news about my mom. she had a stroke, she was serious and hospitalized. i was very sad to hear this news, and was pretty confused about the connection between the mind and reality.\r\n\r\nthe above stated are the most prominent ones, other than that i had out of body experiences a couple of times that i remember.\r\n\r\nthe situation at present is that i am puzzled about life and reality. health wise presently, sometimes i can feel some kind of pressure in the middle of the eyebrows flowing towards the nose. i got swelling in my legs; especially my left knee is swollen and painful since 2 years, also i feel very tired even after doing light work. i am not sure whether these symptoms are related to the abduction or not but i am more concerned about the scar i have. i would like to further investigate into this matter but have no idea where to start and who will be the best person to contact regarding this matter. \r\n\r\ni have attached the pictures of the implant scar; it is right over my collar bone. please ignore the stretch marks near the scar, as i got that after losing my weight. any help regarding this will be appreciated.

illinois, out in the open country farm area's. there were four of us there. it was a very warm summer night. i had my guitar outside and plugged into an amp and was jamming some tunes for my friends. we were having some beers and just enjoying the night since it was the weekend. the sky was very clear and the stars were all around. my my were there going on about six hours and it was getting to be around 2:00 a.M. in the morning. my mother and step father were out of town and i was staying home alone. we had dairy cows at the time and a corn field on our farm. the sky was still very clear but wind started blowing as if a storm was approaching but no signs of clouds anywhere. the cows in the barn started acting funny pacing and making mooing noise's, as if something was spooking them. one of my friends decided to leave because it was late and he didn't want to get caught in the storm that he thought was coming. so he looked up at the sky puzzled and said, \" that's strange how there are no clouds around and looks and feels stormy \". he then said, \" later dude's!\", and drove off. just after he left my other two friends said they were gonna take off also and started pulling out my drive way witch is kinda long before you get to the main road. as they were pulling out i noticed something dark and big just kinda hovering over one of our three corn bin's. i quickly ran to the porch light switch and started flickering the lights so my friends would see what i was seeing but they didn't notice the thing and just honked the car horn and yelled, \" later man \". so i then put down my guitar and still had a beer in my right hand, and no! i wasn't drunk. i was really seeing this thing, and started walking up to the corn bin thinking, what the heck. i saw it was very large and black in color and was like a triangle shape and it had some lights going around it on the three tips of the shape and one on the bottom that seemed to be getting brighter as i watched it. then just like in a second, a bright white light came out from the bottom and was blinding me from seeing. then the next thing i knew the light was going back up to the object and then it took off in a flash like a match blowing out. the next thing is even stranger. it was like 2:00 a.M. and dark outside when this was occurring but when i was able to focus my eye's from after that brightness, the sun was coming up and it was dawn and going on around 6:00 a.M.? and the beer i was holding in my right hand was now in my left hand.? i swear, i never switched them. i don't know why there was four hours missing and don't remember anything from the time i saw the object to the time it just took off. i had bad dreams after that some nights about being on a table in a strange place and seeing these beings with big black eye's just looking at me on this table. i wake up sweating and scared. i thought i would share this now because it has always been on my mind and this site gave me this chance to tell it. thank you so much for reading my report. chuck m. from belvidere, illinois..:)","distance":"21-100

country farm area. there were four of us there. it was a very nice warm summer night. i had my guitar out side and plugged into an amp and was playing some tunes for my friends. we were having some beer's and just enjoying the night since it was the weekend. the sky was very clear and the stars were all around. my friends had been there going on about six hours and it was getting to be about 2:00 a.M. in the morning. my mother and step father were out of town and i was staying home alone. we had dairy cows at that time and grew corn. the sky was still clear and all of a sudden the wind started blowing as if a storm was approaching but there wasnt any clouds as we could see. the cows in the barn started acting funny and making noise, like some thing was bothering them. one of my friends then said he was ready to leave because he didnt want to get hit with that storm he thought was comming and needed to get home. so he looked up at the sky and said. that's so strange because he did'nt see any clouds or anything but the the way the wind was acting it should have looked stormy. but he got in his car then pulled out of my long drive way we have and drove off. well right after he left my other two friends decided they were gonna leave also. as they were pulling out of the drive i noticed something big and dark above one of the three corn bins we have and was just hovering above it. i quickly started flashing the house lights on and off to get them to come back and to look at what i was seeing but they never even noticed the thing and just drove off honking the horn good bye. i then turned my attention back to the object and started to walk towards the corn bin were it was hovering. i noticed it was very large and was triangle shaped. it looked bigger than the corn bin. it had some lights kinda pulsating around it. i thought what the heck. i had a beer in my hand as i walked up to it,( no i wasnt drunk ), i was seeing this thing. the beer was in my right hand because im right handed and always use that hand. just as i was staring at this thing, bam! this light hit's me like a spot light, very bright. i can't see anything now. just that light. after i was hit with that light all i remember was the light going back up into the ufo and it just took off like very fast and was gone. now this is the strange part. this all happened at around 2:00 a.M. and was dark outside of course. but now as im standing there the sun is comming up and it's just becomming dawn. and the beer i was holding was now in my left hand and i swear that i never switch it. seem's four hours had passed and i dont remember what happened in between. i feel i was taken aboard or something, and then put back down. i have had bad dreams since then and always about being on some strange table being looked at by aliens. i just wanted to share this story since i feel maybe this may have happened to some one else perhaps and to let them know they are not alone. thank you
