a satellite in the sky\", and so all of us stopped playing and looked up at the sky and for the next 15 or 20 minutes had the most singular experience. we all thought it was a satellite in the begining. but then we noticed it was not moving in a straight line. it just appeared to be randomly moving in the sky. it appeared to us that it went near certain stars. meaning it would go near a star and stop, then it would go near another star and stop for a few seconds. this went on for some time as we watched. it was a clear cloudless night and we could see all the stars clearly. so the constellations were also clearly visible. there was this line of three stars, and it went near the first star and one of us said out loud, what if it went to the next star in line, and lo and behold, this moving star slowly moves to the second star in the line, next we said, what if it went to the third star, and it went again, this went on for may be the next 15 minutes or so, this moving star would go near every star we wanted it to go to. by then the movie show had begun and we had to go into the auditorium. we were too young to realize the seriousness of what we had experienced. we never spoke of this to anyone else. ever since once in a while i always looked up at the night sky, hoping to see this object again. never saw it again. as i grew older i later learnt that the distances between the stars are so enormous and as per the laws of physics, it would be impossible for anything to travel so quickly between these distances and in reality the stars are not really in line etc..But what still bothers me is that, how this thing was able to do what we wanted it to do and how did it make us feel that it was doing what we wanted it to do? how did it communicate with us?? i met one of my friends who was with us that night about 25 years after i left school, and he asked me..Do you remember that star??

parking lot, nose of vehicle facing benny's store front. i exited vehicle facing benny's, stretched a little and adjusted my pant legs (they were wet) and got ready to go inside...\r\n\r\n2. what made you first notice the object? \r\n\r\ni heard a bird and turned to the direction (off to my left, slightly up) to see it, noticed several black-ish birds flying in a small flock, the birds were heading toward my left & i watched them switch direction... as they switched direction and headed off behind me in a diagonal projectory..I noticed another black thing flying along. in my thoughts, i was wondering why this bird was flying slower than the rest..Observed it..Realized it wasnt a bird at all. \r\n\r\n\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\r\n\r\na bird slightly above the flock of birds, just flying slower than the rest.\r\n\r\nwhen my eye singled it out and noticed its shape wasnt a bird, i also noticed object was bigger than the birds i had seen. \r\n\r\nthe object stood out, just before & as the birds switched direction. the object stayed on a straight path. the birds flew off in a diagonal path.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions in detail. \r\n\r\nthe object turned out not being a bird at all, but a diamond shape, dimensional, flat black in color. its projectory did not follow the birds diagonally after the birds switched direction. it continued on flying (smoothly) toward my left, over my head, then on to my right side and kept going towards and over the adjacent parking lots. when it flew as far as (what seemed) price right & soveign bank (taunton ave) parking lot, it stopped and hovered. at this point, the ufo was tiny to my eye & i decided to go in to benny's. when exiting benny's (it was short, because benny's didnt have what i was looking for) i looked back to the last place i seen the ufo hover & it was still there, but appeared to now be moving...I watched it until i could not see it anymore due to distance. during the sighting, the object did not make any sound what so ever. it was distinctively diamond shaped. i saw a slight almost transparent potrusion off the diamond's point (pointing the direction it was going)it was stiff & not floppy, like a balloon string or anything like it. i could barely see this part of the ufo. i did not see this part of the ufo when it was overhead. there was no glare on this object, but you could see a dimension to the shape. it was not a flat bottom to this object. it moved smoothly across the sky and did not flutter, waver, bob, or nothing like that. just straight and smooth. there were other people pulling into a parking space, but i dont think they seen it or knew what i was looking up at.  \r\n\r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object.\r\n\r\ncalm, amazed, fascinated, surprised, excited, calm again.\r\n\r\n6. how did you lose sight of the object?\r\n\r\nlost sight of it

couldn't make out the plane's body, but assumed it was a large plane due to the large contrail) heading west from birmingham, alabama, and was thinking of the contrail it was leaving. the reason for this is because on december 3, 2011, i took a photo of an odd contrail with evenly spaced ripples, and i had never seen anything like it before (i will provide the picture of the contrail from dec. 3rd). back to today, i was looking at the plane, and that's when i noticed a larger object behind, and just slightly lower in the horizon trailing the plane. i wouldn't have thought to much about it if the sun hadn't reflected off of the object as i was looking at it. this object was definitely larger, and did not have any form of contrail behind it and it was keeping up with the airplane. i watched this for about 3-4 minutes until they both went behind the trees in my front yard, so i went to the end of my driveway (about 45ft), and i was able to see the airplane, but not the object anymore. it never crossed my mind to get a camera, but i got my phone and called my brother in kansas city, mo at 11:36am to tell him. as i was on the phone with him, i noticed an airplane heading east towards birmingham, al. (also pretty high up), and i noticed the object again. this time i was only able to see the object for about 15-20 seconds, and then it just disappeared, but the airplane was still in view. this is the second time i've seen something strange, and the first time both myself and my mother saw something in kansas city, mo back in 2008 that was unexplainable to us. i wish i could see this again to prove i'm not crazy, but this was the most exciting thing for me since seeing the other object in 2008. again, i am posting a picture of a strange contrail that i saw back on december 3, 2011. it's different from any other contrail i've seen, and i used to live close to whiteman afb in missouri.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":35110,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.86524949984732,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01242012-0025","longitude":-87.21105032504765,"occurred":1327433160000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alabama","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,   Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1327457820000,"summary":"It appeared to be tracking the airplane i was looking at.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/35110_submitter_file1__StrangeContrailByAnAircraft-12-3-2011.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"35504","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Jasper, Alabama","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:14721"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Anchorage","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was about 730pm we were waiting in the parking lot. i looked over at these red lights coming over the mountains in line formation.I thought maybe military parachuting, but once the red lights got over the mountains it looked like they all spread out then lifted up higher into the sky all together all at the same time and pace then disappeared.
