noticed something. not sure at this point of what he was looking at me called my attention to it. his words: \"hey honey, look what is that?\" so i looked up and at first i could not really focus on what he was looking at. i asked what am i looking at? he said look, pointing to the sky, there are two things flying. when i finally was able to focus at the direction he was point too, i notice something moving quiet fast. my husband said, there are two of them. at this point i am trying to keep my eyes on this \"thing\" which was moving so fast i could keep up. i told him, i only see one. my husband said, he saw two at first. we are now both trying to keep up with the speed of this object. january 1st, was a clear day. the sun was bright and there were no clouds. one thing that was very clear was the speed, at times it would just disappear by accesding into the clouds. then it reapear and continue moving very fast. we noticed that at all times it was reflecting the sun light. it seem to have metalic shine to it. again it would disappear and then become visible. at one point we noticed that it was just stationary. we made this accessment because we had a point of reference. a black window building on the otherside, maybe a couple of blocks futher down. it just seem to howver and then it just vanished. we kept looking for it, as you would do when you are following the path of an airplane as it passes by. my husband said that when he first noticed it, what caught his attention was the helicopter that was flying by and then noticing two objects that were higher than the helicopter. my husband explained to me that when he first notice the object/s, it seem like out of one it became two, and then they went their separe ways. i only saw one. this object paths was heading towards the glendale mountains, as if were flying towards \"cast away restaurant.\" finally we just lost all sight of it. we are not sure what it was, but by the defenition of and ufo to us

sky because the clouds were particularly beautiful that day.  they were moving across the sky rather fast since it was a windy day, and they had dark bottoms and white billowy tops.  i noticed these 2 large clouds, larger than any of the others in the sky going by, and out of the front of the one closest to me i saw a sort of cigar shaped object come completely out of it as if it accidently sped up.  it then slowed down to a complete stop and went back into the cloud in reverse as if who ever was piloting it realized it over shot the cloud and was out in the wide open.\r\n \r\nthe object appeared to be at least 3 times larger than a huge airplane like a boeing 747.  it had around 50 to 100 large windows in 2 rows, one above the other, running along the center axis going down the side of it.  the skin of the object had a metallic color, and i could actually see the sun light glittering on it as well as seeing the reflection of the sun in its windows.  i had a little less than about 3 seconds to see the object, but in that time i was able to see it in enough detail to know that the front of it looked exactly like the back of it, and it didn���t have any wings on it or a carriage underneath of it like a blimp would.  also, it made no noise.\r\n \r\nthe one thing that i can say for sure is that it was not anything i���ve ever seen.  i don���t think it was of this world.  let me also say that this was a life changing experience for me because prior to seeing it, i thought that there was life in the universe, but most likely it didn���t make it to earth yet.  now, i believe the earth is being visited.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with

own experiences. but we are discussing the fricot city event and our reaction during the event and afterwards, the next morning, (we as a family, all have had visits but have never been comfortable talking about those event even to each other.. its an overwhelming feeling we arent suppose to speak about the visits!\r\nso we finally do, began asking each other why us, why the cover ups, what really going on, what the aliens want with us, what does our family have that they need.\r\nwhen i was a child we lived in a car, traveling from one end of the west coast to the other including oregon. we camped out a lot. but they still found us.! so we were contemplating how they knew our where abouts and seem to know every thing about us.  other the years i have done research lots of reading and i learned about the implants from other abductees and it���s the only way the aliens could have found us!! \r\nso the same night after our family discussion at my brothers house, (we had never told our children about the ufo until this night)  the kids and i are  going home, traveling  down hwy 12/88 as we approach the intersection of hwy 12/88 we see lights in the hay  field next to the road,, red, green, blue, pulsating  light  appear in the field next to the road, one of the children ask if it���s a ufo, im teasing the kids, we are all laughing and i tell then maybe, mean while the ufo is moving extremly fast back and forth and i suddenly decided to turn off hwy 88 and made a turn onto tuttle rd, the ufo passed over the car, the lights and engine died while the car is now moving in the dark night, when i became aware again the car is passing over the train tracks the lights and engine come back on.  \r\nour usual route to paloma  from stockton was hwy88 to hwy12 to paloma rd.\r\nonce again we forgot the event happened, until years later, looking back i realized we have missing time.\r\nwhen i ask my children, they don���t remember either the craft or the event.\r\nmy nieces report little grey figure have entered  their rooms at night. their and i father shared  the 1976 fricot city event. \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

end of my driveway i looked north, up the highway and saw a large narrow object hovering but as i watched, it was really moving very, very slowly just above the tree tops. i looked and my dog was not noticing it at all, no reaction as there was no noise.  i am hear of hearing for high pitch but the dog was not interested so i say no noise at all.  i kept thinking i should hear a hum, with it up in the air with no wings or propellers.  \r\n\r\nit was a narrow rectangle shape. gray, with a small redish lighted done on top and a amber small light. across the area i was looking at were 3 or 4, i am not sure of number now as i was more impressed with the big round cicle white lights, that i thought of as engines or something, there were no flames, or waves of air, that i could tell but they were the whitest white i have ever seen...I am an artisan and now no lights or color white look white to me but rather have a dull yellow or amber tint.  the large white circles were also next to an area that seemed to be black vertical bars or vents on about a third of the entire rectangular area to the left. the lights on top had low ilregular flashes within them, nothing like the lights on planes. no light projected in any fashion on to road or trees.\r\n\r\ni did not feel fear, just wander and curious, i could see the sky around it, sides and below.  i tired to judge the size and posistion by the tree tops, width of the two lane highway and it's dirrection of movement.  it seemed to be as wide as the highway it not a bit more, even as high as the pine tree it was close to.  there was no wind movement of the tree as it crossed over them. i just stood there and watched it, as i figured to run in and get the camera, it would be gone; also to get my car keys to follow i figured the same.  \r\n\r\nafter it reached the forrest edge on my left side, i just walked slowly toward my house, trying to figure if the afbase to the southeast of me might have any hoover craft, trying to think of what it could have been, when i hear a deep rumble rather like the trains sometime have but it was a short sound then total quiet again. \r\n\r\ni went in and just went to bed, i guess i was in wonder or shock, and then the next day or two, there was an unusal amount of jet flights and even for two nights helochopers with bright green and red lights on their runners that didn't blink flying around my area. two days after i looked online for a place to report it and could not get any of the links with mufon of ga to work so told my son, who lives above atlanta, about it.  he is the only one i have talked to about it, i am a mature adult and have only seen one other thing when i lived in north ga which was a white ball like a star take a 45 degree turn in the night sky, my younger son was with me then.\r\n\r\ni'm still haveing trouble finding the right box in my mind to put this, as i can not relate any thing i know to it.  that is other than science fiction and this thing was real !!!!  i still feel no fear to walk my dog and watch the sky but man, what was it ???","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

amazing unbelievable things! about 8p just getting dusk, as we were all standing outside on the patio we watched ufo event which was reported to sheriff, (who ridiculed her, gave her number for national ufo center and once again she called and was ridiculed ).\r\nfirst we spotted an huge orange/yellow burning ball, looked exactly like picture we see of our burning sun, this ufo was stationary and hung  in the dark sky over  a ravine when we first saw it. next it changed slowly become a dark red glowing ember colored orb with dark lines, then it began to close up on its self  and went from a burning sun/orb to a small bright bright luminescent  light which zipped all over the night sky, instantly changing from a bright bright light to burning sun/orb then back to bright white light. this went on for a couple of hours, we were so fascinated we didn���t notice the time then it landed on the hill side across the ravine from our position in fricote city (which lays on a hill top). we were so excited we watched for hours.\r\nafter the ufo landed across the way from us, it continued to change from orange/yellow burning sun to bright bright light and  we started to worry it would start a fire in the dry grass it had landed on, although \r\neach time it became a bright light or orange sun you could see the outline  or shadows of the oak trees in that were in between us and  of the ufo.\r\nwe continued to watch the ufo until about 11p then i became very very sleepy, then my brother turns to me and tells me he can hardly keep his eyes open either so we go to bed���awaken at day break to the sound of jet engines to find the air force and army choppers, there were military jeeps and men and others in same place we watched the ufo land the night before. but i couldn���t seem to care or get excited about all the actions caused by the ufo landing quite the opposite of who i really am!! completely unnatural reaction for me!\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet,

drawer on a pillow out side with mother while she worked , while my 6 year sister played nearby while mom was hanging  clothes  on the line a flash of light in the sky caught moms attention and she watched a  silver disk  with sunlight  glinting on the surface of the craft. the ufo  dropped down through the air moving back and  forth in a stair pattern, then it moved closer and closer until craft hovered over mom and she saw a being in the  round  window, the being had a sharp shaped face with pointed ears.  the middle of the craft stayed still while underneath the bottom of the ufo spun around.\r\nthe ufo was silent except for the sound of the wind it created which pulled moms dress and the clothes on the clothes line toward the craft.\r\nafter a few minutes, the ufo began to rise back up to the sky about 300 ft where it began to wobble in flight then the ufo began to wobble and descend again, the ufo dropped out of site behind the nearby mountain ridge, then there was an explosion and a fire and shortly after that, the forestry dept. made us evacuate. \r\nthis was the beginning of a life long visits from ufo`s on our family. my mother brothers report sighting ufo too.
