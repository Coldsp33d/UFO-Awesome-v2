was lower than any other plane that i've seen in my life. i stopped in the middle of the road to try and take a picture, at this point i realize the craft is moving and is moving pretty quickly southeast. i quickly take one picture that didn't turn out well and drove quickly to my home about 200 yards away, i race inside to gather the attention of my family and by the time i got my family and i out on the deck the craft had just passed over the tree line.\r\n\r\nthe night sky was clear there were very little clouds in the sky so the visibility was clear the moon was in a waxing

angeles, i went up i-5 and saw the lemore nas sign. i remembered art bellâs show had discussed the place, so i grabbed a room at the super 8 in kettleman city, ca.\r\n\r\niâm a writer as well as a licensed clinical social worker (lcsw) in my âpast life,â so i got up early to write on the morning of, as best as i can recall, august 8, 2008, or cutely 08-08-08. as my motel coffee brewed sometime between 4 and 5 a.M. i was admiring the clear predawn sky when what i thought was a shooting star descended. my first âmicro thoughtâ was âkind of slow.â i did my exhale of appreciation as it dropped behind the motel sign.\r\n\r\nnext?\r\n\r\nthe object shot up into the sky where it had started in the time of a finger snap. i exclaimed, âmy shooting star just did a u-turn!â then came the âair showâ of what the ufo community calls powered or âintelligent maneuvers.â it seemed i could talk to the object, it heard me, and responded. i said, âaw, iâve seen that beforeâ during an acrobatic routine i had long ago concluded was a 1986 u.S. military âdrone showâ to have me ranting about âflying saucers.â\r\n\r\nthis craft did some of the same tricks, but also stood still. thus, i could perceive a hull. definitely not âswamp gas,â and not a cloud or anything but a spacecraft. as i mentioned on the phone, i think a private company built this craft and they fly it out there. it may be stored at lemore, where the navy base has no water or airplanes, but they sure have plush base housing. i was questioned by a navy police officer for taking a photo of the bus stop off the base which he directed me to delete from my later seized by lawmen, stolen, and ultimately stored by crazed criminal kinfolk fuji digital camera. not fiction; all truth.\r\n\r\ni later saw a âconference charlatanâ who sells a lot of books hanging around the motel. if you want a name, get me to my long overdue movie deal meeting. iâm tired of being trapped in substandard motels over this sighting and much more. i suspect the craft is like a âscout shipâ that can exceed the speed of light. it made no sound whatsoever and imitated a 737 as it glided over a mountain range to end the show. i will never forget that night. hope you share this and have a comment or two. i do still have a photo of what i jokingly called an âalien landing stripâ out there. we might wonder together why a female in a military uniform drove by in a small pickup truck before i took the photo. this is called âpsy opâ and âdisinformation.â there are no e.T.âs folks, and i fear the astro-fools headed to mars on orion wonât make it back alive.\r\n\r\nhave a great california dayâ¦i hate it out there!","distance":"501 Feet - 1

her what color they where and she said \"grey\". so i had a thought and google gray alien pics. i scrolled down and asked her if these where the monsters and if so which one do they look like. she

cigarette before bed.It was a clear cloudless night and as i looked at the sky i noticed what i initially thought was a plane.I realised that it was moving but hovering in the same place.It was then that i also realized there was no sound whatsoever coming from it.This made me look at it more closely as i wasn't sure what this was.This is when i could see that it actually consisted of four lights forming the shape of a diamond.The top light and one diagonally beneath it were white and the other light diagonally beneath and the bottom light were both red.I knew this wasn't a plane or a helicopter because of the unusual formation of the lights and lack of sound.I watched as the cluster of lights,which were slowly flashing,slowly and silently began to move in a straight line in a northerly direction.As my balcony faces south,it slowly moved out of my line of vision.As i looked back to where i had originally spotted it hovering in the sky i was amazed to see yet another set of four lights hovering in the exact spot i had just seen the previous lights hovering.Again it was four lights forming the shape of a diamond but this time all four lights were red but weren't flashing.I was stunned to then see another set of four lights appear from what looked like roughly 50feet away from the red hovering lights.This third set of lights were exactly the same as the first set of lights which had now left my line of vision-diamond formation with two white and two red and flashing slowly.This formation seemed to appear out of thin air as i never seen it when i had noticed the four red hovering lights.This new set of lights i had noticed were moving in the same slow manner as the lights i saw at the start and began moving in the same northerly direction.As it moved the red lights which were hovering began to slowly move as if they were folloing the lights close by.As it began to follow,two of the red lights changed to white so that it now had the same appearance ss the other two objects or crafts or whatever these things were.At this point my heart rate was increasing as i knew i was witnessing something highly unusual.I ran into my bedroom to get my girlfriend ,who had just gone to bed,to come to the balcony and see what i was witnessing.I half expected them to have gone when we came back out but they were both there and still moving very slowly.We both watched as the set of lights which seemed to be getting followed changed direction from north to south almost as though it was circling behind the other set of lights behind it.We watched as it slowly circled round and i'm unsure whether it was because it was now facing us at a different angle but it's four lights were now white and suddenly two of the lights became very bright almost like the searchlight of a helicopter.It wasn't a helicopter though as these two bright lights didn't give off any sort of beam the way a helicopter searchlight would.This was all done in complete silence.They then seemed to be carrying on with the northerly direction of the first set of lights i had saw and as they did so they seemed to fade in front of our eyes until they simply looked lime a single point of white light.As we watched this,i saw what i can only describe as a white flash or flare come flying down towards the trees just along from our house.It came in at a 45degree angle and had a white trail of light behind it.As it got close enough to the tree where it looked like it might hit the tree it completely vanished.It also made no sound whatsoever.At this point my excitement turned slighty to anxiety as i was witnessing not only what appeared to be three ufo's but now it seemed that they were firing something from their craft.I don't know if it was some sorg of flare,laser or something else but i'm certain it came from the original set of lights i saw that had disappeared from view.This was one of the most exciting and scary things i have seen and leaves me in no doubt that we are definitely not alone.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:07:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering

roof terrace in the late evening to enjoy the coolness and look at the night sky.\r\n \r\non monday we were looking out at the bright full moon which was in the southern aspect of the sky. the lower horizon was fairly misty in the valleys coming up from the coast, so the moon was beautiful. because it was so bright, i was curious as to how many stars we would see.\r\nlooking up towards the ne, my eye caught a bright flash of what could have been a star just uncovered by a cloud, then covered again - however, there was not a cloud in the sky.\r\n\r\ncuriosity made me keep looking in the area of the sky to try to figure out if it was a plane and its trajectory.\r\ni know it was not a sattelite as we had observed one a few days previously as a single light travelling in a straight line across the sky from sse to nnw with no trail.\r\nnor was it a shooting star, which we see regularly.\r\ni pointed it out to my husband who confirmed that he too saw it and its eratic placement in the sky.\r\n\r\nthe second flash was about 8 seconds later heading towards the east.\r\nthe next one was back towards the north.\r\ni sat down in order to 'frame' the area i was watching, using the posts and poles of the of the terrace, to have a reference in case i was wobbling.\r\nthe next few flashes i noted the direction changes were random, as if it were spiraling or looping the loop.\r\nthe time interval between flashes varied between 3 and 12 seconds appart.\r\nas i was watching, and anticipating where the next one would be, i noted that associated with the flash was a pinpoint of light that i could follow with the naked eye. the bright flash seemed to eminate from this point every time.\r\nafter a final swirl of movement that i was able to clearly see, it flashed really bright and then the brighter dot streaked off leaving a faint trail, in a nw direction and was gone.\r\n\r\ni felt intrigued and convinced that it was a ufo.\r\n\r\none thought i had was that if it was a craft with one surface that was more reflective than the others, then as it turned in flight, it may have flashed with the reflection of the bright moon that was in the nearly opposite quadrant of the sky. that would explain why i felt it was spiraling - almost 'playing'.\r\n\r\nthere are large eagles that soar during the day in the jimena area as the village is situated at the base of a castle that had value as a strategic point at the time of the moors and the romans. the apparent spiraling movements of the lights reminded me of their soaring flight with the air currents, and how they can disappear from view when end-on.\r\n\r\ni have spoken about this to colleagues at work and was told that there are others who have witnessed exactly the same phenomenon in the same region, but viewing from further west - looking east and north over the national park.\r\n\r\nplease note, there is a supposed 'top secret' us base at 36.479370, -5.599288 - see file

2016. i use a power wheelchair to access the community. i was waiting for the bus that would take me home. it was a very clear and unusually bright day. the fact that it was so bright made me notice the only cloud in the sky. the cloud was unlike any cloud i had ever seen in my life. it was a perfect circle that appeared to surround the sun which hurt my eyes to look in the direction of the sky. there was no center in the cloud it appeared to be a transparent circle framing the sun. even more unusual was there appeared to be a rainbow or prism effect around the cloud. the cloud formed a cirle around the sun and the rainbow circled the cloud. i grabbed my phone and snapped a couple of pictures because i thought that maybe it was a weather phenomenon causing this effect and i wanted to show it to my wife and family and investigate the cause of this apparition. i tuned my camera northward to snap a picture to show just how clear a day it was and to compare the contradicting phenomenon. i took 3 pictures of the cloud and 1 of the clear sky. just as i finished the photographs the bus pulled up. the driver asked my name got out of the bus and lowered the lift and allowed me to board. i put away my phone and talked to the driver who was not very interested in the strange cloud. later that afternoon my wife asked me if anything interesting happened at the doctor's office. i related the story to her about the cloud. i pulled my phone out of my pocket and showed her the photos i took. on the first picture there appeared to be a small dot in the picture near the sun. it was quite reflective and i thought maybe it was just a reflection or something electronic. i slid the picture to the left to view the next photo. this time the dot had moved from inside the cirlce to just below it in the 7 o'clock position. i enlarged the picture and boy did i get the shock of my life. the dot was actually an orb and there appeared to be something metallic on the surface and there were several of these small metallic strictures on the surface. again i slid the photo to the left with a swipe of my finger to reveal the next photo. somehow the next photo was a burst and with one click i had taken 3 pictures and in each one of the pictures the orb was in a different place in the cloud. i was impressed with the speed of the object. one more swipe and the picture of the clear sky to the north came into view. this was actually the first picture i took but because of the way the telephone stores the pictures it was the last picture to come into view. the picture revealed a tree along with the sky and a blue/green almost turquoise orb just under the lower branches of the tree. in this picture the orb was on its way to the cloud at the time that i snapped the picture. these pictures remain in my phone to this day and i  have only shown them to a select few associates. i have since come to realize that i  don't have the right to keep these things to myself, i should share them with the world.
