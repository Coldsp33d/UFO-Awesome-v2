passenger saw a bright (intensity of lighting)bluish / white ball of light develop off in front of us at an unknown distance.  to do my best guess, it was maybe 1/4 mile... but it could have been 50 miles.  it was hard to determine.\r\n   the ball shaped object immediately caught both of our attention, and stayed sort of a pulsating ball for maybe 4 seconds.  then, the ball remained, but a perfectly shaped \"v\" ray of light shot to the sky, and then it went out.\r\n   both i an my passenger both said holy @#$% what was that... at exactly the same time.  there were numerous cars on i-90, and i know they saw it too in that many of us hit the brakes on our cars at the same time.\r\n    my first thought was the the nuclear power plant (perry electric plant) had exploded.  my second thought was some sort of nuclear explosion happened way off in the distance, and there was some sort of terror attact.  my 3rd, 4th, & 5th thoughts were it was some weird lighting (no storm and clear night) or gasoline truck accident (none found), or electrical transformer explosion (have seen those before, and not the same).  so, i dont know what it was, and i can not venture a guess.\r\n   i felt scared, because i know there is a nuclear reactor near there, and the possibility of terrorism.\r\n   the object just disappated like a light turning off.  \r\n\r\n    as for the next question ... # of witnesses... i know about 8 cars in front of me all hit their brakes at the same time.  i stopped 2 exits ahead for gas, and ran into a husband and wife who saw the same thing.  they couldnt explain it either.  so i dont know how to answer that question.  there were 2 or 3 (my son was sleeping in the back) who saw it in my car, plus many others on the highway.\r\n

stopped at about 1630hrs to eat when i noticed a red light appear on hillside about 3/4 of a mile away but it went out and i did not think about. once we finished eating i cleaned up the site put everything back into vehicle and prepared to leave, my friend wanted to stay awhile to see the stars, at about 20:15 the red light again appeared on the hillside but moving across the hill, when it went vertical over the crest of the hill top (5400) moved toward the center of a saddle and came to a hover.I new this was going to be interesting,a second object appeared from the direction of connecting hill and joined the first object in a hover. while my attention was on the two objects in front of me my friend told me to look at what was happening to my right, this is weird i am looking at 4 columns of 4 evenly spaced red lights that are blinking from top to bottom and from bottom to top and sequentially from my right to left with 2-6 bright white lights at the base moving in step with the columns. now all this is going on there is no noise, and after 25min of this show everything close's down leaving just the first object which remained in a hover pulsed 3 times and disappeared!This not the end, this area is now part of the state park system and all trails are now marked like a freeway, my own experience in this area is 20years, but for some reason i could not find my way back to the highway which could be see from this location each time we tried we ended up back at the spot we had left, 5 times over 5 hours finally had to stop fuel was low and were not going anywhere! next day we checked the area for any signs of foul play no sign of human playing games just the desert! how about that, this show was preformed for us at close range, like within a

show, moving around strangly & quickly. amazingly, all 3 lights even combined together into one & back apart! they couldnt have been any normal aircraft because of how quickly they moved, & how quickly they changed direction. i lights dissapeared after a few minutes.\r\n\r\nsometime after the event, i was at school & told my story. a guy in my class said his dad works in the airforce, he said his dad told that they got calls reporting lights in the sky. they said it was f22 raptor testing.\r\nbut i doubt it because the lights where very quick & agile, & even combined.\r\n\r\nwe

5:15 p.M. and was looking at some very strange egg-carton like clouds when something shiny caught my eye.  i saw a cluster of approximately 25 perfectly round silver metallic speheres flying to the east of my position at 45-degrees off the horizon and at least 1,000 feet altititude.  the sun was setting and shone off of these spheres.  the objects were in a large circular shotgun pattern, but as they moved away from me they got closer together and into a tight formation. they then moved into the strange clouds and dissapeared from view. it would take a garbage can lid held at arms length to cover these objects all at once at the point where i first saw them. these objects moved silently in a type of wave, undulating through the sky. the objects were definatley not birds. i have spent a lot of time in the wilderness and am a hunter, and these were not like snow geese, canada geese, or any type of bird ive ever seen.  ive also never seen conventional aircraft like this. i was alone and did not have a camera with me, but from now on plan to have a camera on my person at all times.  i am college educationed, own and operate two businesses and am not prone to halucinations. ive never seen anything like this and would like to know what they were.\"    ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with

then blinked out. it really scared me! i slammed the door shut and went running for my husband, i have no idea what it was, but it was to close for comfort. needless to say, he had to let the dog back
