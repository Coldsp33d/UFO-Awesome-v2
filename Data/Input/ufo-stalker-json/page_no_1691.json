\r\n\r\ni went outside to bring a book to my fathers house.  i was in a hurry, and so didnt have my cell phone with me.  \r\n \r\nas i was getting into my car, i saw two reddish lights across the street in the sky.  i figured it was just the usual air traffic, and so decided to ignore it- unless something else happened.  the odd reddish color was intruiging.\r\n \r\nas i turned the car around to leave the driveway, i saw two more lights (for a total of four.)  all the same reddish color.  they looked like embers from a fire: you blow on a dying fire, and you get this same color.\r\n \r\nat this time i decided it was not the usual air-traffic, and stopped the car halfway on the sidewalk, turned off the engine, and opened the door to look.\r\n \r\ni then noticed that one of the lights in the first pair of lights suddenly vanished.  that was it.  i knew it was something unusual.  they were flying in strange patterns, drifting right, but not in a straight line, the way that airplanes do.  for fun, i started to wave my hand in a friendly manner, and yelled, \"hello, welcome to earth!\"  why the heck not?  give em a friendly greeting, i say.\r\n \r\nas if on cue, the left side of the sky was filled with them.  well over ten.  in a semi-narraow band appearing to be above the treeline (from my angle), but they must have been much higher.  it was like when you see an ant in the kitchen: and then all of a sudden, you see ten ants where there was just one.  they were all flying in typical ufo patterns as seen in the 1950s utah footage, and also the nasa ufo-footage shown by david sereda.  they flew to the right, blinking off and on, into and out of existence, almost, and all with the same reddish color.  by the time i recovered my bearings, i counted only nine, but im sure there had been more before i realized i should count them.\r\n \r\nthe whole thing lasted about two minutes.  slowly, one by one, they disappeared, until only the original pair was left, then just one, then nothing.\r\n \r\nwhile all this happened, i noticed some flashes coming from across the street to the right: i figured it was camera flashes, and was glad someone else was seeing the damn things.  turns out i was correct.\r\n \r\ni finally got into my car, and drove to my parents house.  i decided to keep an eye out for anyone else who might have seen them.  along x street, the street where i had first seen the camera flashes coming from, i saw a woman in the darkness, standing on her lawn.  i stopped my car, rolled down the window, and asked, \"did you see the lights?\"\r\n \r\nshe said yes.  turns out she knows me: it was a woman named x, who is the friend of my former neighbor, x.  x said, \"they looked like meteors\", but i said, \"no, meteors streak across the sky and fizzle out -these were drifting to the right, and were moving upwards, and popping in and out.\"  at that, x got a creeped out expression on her face.  x then said, \"i got a call from my daughter- she was driving and says she saw fifteen of them.\"  i asked where her daughter lived, and she said on x (my address, also), and that she was driving on x when she saw them.  x confirmed she attempted to take some pictures, and i told her i had seen the camera flash.\r\n\r\nat my parents house, i was telling my father about what had happend, when i saw single light of the same reddish color.  we were standing on the front lawn.  whereas from my previous angle at my house, they had appeared to be above the horizon, here this one drifted across the center of the sky.  if drifted by us, truning slightly to the left, then vanished.\r\n\r\nlater on, back at home, i saw three more:\r\n \r\n1) the first, a solitary light, appeared to the left of my house, where i had first seen the flotilla.  i called my neighbor over, and he noted the red color.  it vanished after about 1 minute.\r\n\r\n2) another appeared directly across from my house, and then vanished after 20 seconds.  \r\n\r\nby now it was 9:40 pm or so.  although i saw many planes, etc., i saw no other objects with the strange red color.  i came inside about 10:15pm or so, so it all lasted less than an hour.  all had the same distinctive, reddish, ember-like color.  \r\n\r\n3) much later, after 2am, while driving back from walmart, i saw another light, not reddish this time: it was whitish, flying in the opposite direction.  it was starting and stopping, hovering, and then moving at high speeds.  when i made a u-turn to follow it, it took off to the left.  i watched it until i couldnt see it anymore.\r\n \r\naddendum: that night on fox 13 news at 10pm or 11pm, they said that nasa and the military had launched a defense satellite from cape canaveral earlier that night.  it was carried on a rocket,  and contained a scanning and imaging system.  no idea if this was the cause or somehow related to this ufo appearance.\r\nsincerely,\r\nx\r\n

object was entering the atmosphere and generating extreme heat. i thought i was observing space trash re-entering the atmosphere and incinerating.  but it seemed to be moving too slow.  the object appeared to be at a very high altitide and there was no engine noise observed.  the trail behind the object grew longer as it continued heading north to south to the east of my position (over the ocean) and seemed to be descending and slowing down.  the heat trail diminished and the object appeared as a glowing yellowish light again.   the object appeared to slow down and then the shocker:  it appeared to turn to the east and also appeared to be ascending again. no heat trail.  and no more southerly movement.  and after several more seconds, the light seemed to turn redish for a moment and then just disappeared. it didn't disapate.  it just wasnt there any more.  i knew i had seen something remarkable, but i just don't know what it was.  i'll save my speculation for discussions with friends, but thought it might be worthwhile to report this sighting here.

looking ahead and noticed a rather large orange orb moving slowly, less than 400 feet from the ground. it was traveling eastward and suddenly stopped moving. apparently the orange light was at the front of the craft. this orange large light suddenly tuned off, but we could both still see the outline of something with a long fiery looking trial.  it aimed upwards at that time and rose to a very high altitude, then hovered at the higher altitude and continued to transform into something we could not see the shape of. it also was observed at that moment to have a red flashing light which was very small as compared to the large orange orb. we got off the exit and pulled over to watch it. as the form of the ship shifted to something indiscernible in shape, we focused on the firey emanation that seemed to power it, which suddenly dimmed down. at that moment of the dimming, we then saw three short spurts of what appeared to be some orangey luminous energy emanating out of the back of the craft. they looked light pyramids of light to me. one, then two then three. then all dimmed and all we could see what a light chem, vapor or energy trail. we drove and followed it but it suddenly transformed into what appeared to be a star then traveled rapidly upward in a curvy s-type manner straight up then turned toward the south at a rate of speed beyond comprehension, and vanished.\r\n\r\nduring this entire event, my boyfriend who was driving, attempted to take video with his i-phone, but the phone, which was on before the sighting, would not initiate and continually shut down over several attempts.\r\n\r\nimmediately thereafter if you looked westward toward the everglades last night, where the object we saw was initially traveling from, you could clearly see another very large white light which looked like venus, but was very very low to the ground. \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

me,my brother mike,and his two friends chris and jeff, mysister too it blinked rocking back & forth then it flew to joh deere middle school, then it turned around and chased us we ran fast as we could back home but did not make it home it caught up with us and hovered abouve a tree pushing the branches down hard the branches blew around hard,all the sudden i and my brother were frozen in running action 3 ft off the ground and my sister was watching us from a distance,i could not move my body at all, all i could move was my kneck,i thought i would never ever see home ever again and it traumatized me i was 16 yrs old then i am age 54 now.Then i got away and ran home, i never felt the same, scared to go out on walks at nite after that.\r\n\r\nthen yrs later i have reason to believe that same ufo landed in my fathers field and i had a conversation with the alien, he looked like a man, he kept coming back over and over and my dog nearly got killed by him, he looked exactly like a man but green with extreamly pointed ears,we had a long conversation, later we all moved.I know who they are now and why they come here and i plan on going back there i also plan on writing a book and contacting steven spielburg and i am not sharing anymore info.\r\n\r\nwould someone pleeeease send steven spielburg my way so i can heal,for some reason i am thinking about the terrible time i had trying hard to get away, and yes its bothering me.Last sighting i had which was the 2nd time it was when i was 19 yrs old, i plan on having a movie made with the help of steven spielburg i hope he contacts me so people will have some answers, people that are wondering whats going on why the ufo's keep coming back i have the answer now.I went there yrs later with my kids when they were ages 13 & 14 and a kid that lives in my parents old home said it still comes there,that thats why his dad plaqnted those tall skinny trees that look like hedges by their drive way and that thats why his dad built a huge red barn like shed, so that no one could see out into the field !!! i wish they would move anyway i'm going back their this summer. but i refuse to say,because i want badly to write a movie with spielburg so don't ask me,that was in the yr 1998, keep in mind this 2nd encounter was only me, but that yrs later a family moved in that home, and their son with blond hair and blue eyes told me that ufo still comes there he told me that in 1998 !!! so its 4 witness's for the 1st story told and not sure how many witness's for the 2nd story.So i put the number 5 this means 4 my brother 1 his friends 2 more my sister 1 for the first story and at my parents old home in the country me as 1 witness and a hand full that took pictures of the green grass that turned all hay color brown 5 places out in that field and now in 1998 a tall tall kid comes out of that home and tells me that that ufo lands out in that field.\r\n\r\ntheres also another ufo i believe its the same one that goes out on that long road up and down from alpha illinois back to coal valley and the moline, illinois >> air port road not over the airport though its that long road going from moline threw coal vally

particular night i had gone to bed and after 5 minutes realized i needed to pee . i went outside to relieve myself and was almost immediately drawn to a \"star\" that was behaving in an unusual way . it was directly overhead and was flashing in multiple colors , and i just thought this is just a star that's light is being distorted by high altitude get stream winds , nothing unusual . i was drawn to this object and continued to watch it as it was behaving very weird then suddenly it divided into 2 objects , with one moving away to the north and slowly fading out after about 4 seconds , the main \"star\" remained exactly where it was for the remainder of the night but was gone the next evening , .\r\nbut it didn't end there , a few days later , late arvo , while watching a spectacular sunset , while my sister was visiting we were standing outside the shed when a strange cloud came from behind us from the other side of the ridge and just settled right in front of us , it was the size of small cabin and was pulsing with light and color of all descriptions , this \"cloud\" hovered right in front of us both for several minutes , my sister turned to me and ask \"are you seeing this?\" i said absolutely , this cloud hovered 20 feet away ,it was pulsing and seemed alive with power , i could have almost reached out and touched it  , my sister became scared and went inside and i laughed at her saying it just a highly charged cloud , the cloud began to move away , and it got about 50 meters away when i said to my sister , \"see its just a cloud don't be a woos come back out\" as soon as i said this the cloud did a reverse and came marching back at me and was flashing even more intensely and stopped right in front of me , not 15 feet away, and i swear it was rumbling at me . i said ok , i`m convinced and promptly retreated back inside the cabin and peered at it through a window , then the strange cloud moved off again . we were both freaked out by this strange cloud .\r\nit was a couple of weeks later that i developed a swelling in the roof of my mouth and after a xray they found a large cyst in my sinus caverty that was growing around an \"impacted eye tooth\" . i saw the xray and it looked nothing like a tooth , but was about 1/2 inch long and 2 millimeters wide , like a slither . the doctor immediately booked me for surgery at the royal brisbane hospital , and within 4 days i had a team of surgeons , up to 15 of them , who then removed the \"tooth\" and cyst , before the surgery i had asked that i would like to keep the \"tooth\" but when i woke i asked for it and they told me it had gone for testing and i couldn't have it , and when i asked what the hell was it , the nurse told me that i got the most unusual cyst of the year award .\r\nto this day i still have a huge scar in the roof of my mouth and the outside of the tooth line where they had too attack the object to get at it  , wtf \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
