the country and i like to look at the stars at night. on that night the sky was really clear cause it was cold outside and there really wasnt very many clouds that night if there was any. while i was look out the window a \"star\" caught my eye, i was watching it closely, and thinking to myself \" is that a star? that looks to big to be a star! and it looks pretty low for a star\" but i didnt say anything to my husband. i just kept watching it. after a moment it started to dim out, and now im kinda  like wtf. then i started to freak cause it got bright again and this time it was bright then before...Did i mention that it was just hanging there in the same spot this hole time..So im yelling at my husband, who is driving ,\"pull over! pull over! you have to see this there is something going on!\" just when i thought it couldnt get any weirder bam theres two now! the second one lights up out of nowhere straight to the right of the first one. im freaking out more and continuing to scream at my husband, just as we were pulling off the interstate...Bam again! a third one pops out and its above the first two now they look like a perfect triangle! we stopped right off the ramp and got out of the car it just sat there and since we lived pretty close  we ran to the house and grabbed a witness..My mom.I had ran in side and said anyone want to come see some ufos? she kinda smiled and said sure!So went right back up the road and there they where after a few minutes they stared to fly but it was like they were hooked together cause they stayed in the same triangle formation as the flew over top. after they went pass more came and went and after about a half an hour there were at least 10 bright orbs just hanging out by the horizon once they were all over that way they would get bright and dim and bight and dim...It was late and i was tired so we went home...I did not have a video camera and my phone camera is crappy so the only evidence i have is my word and i would never lie about something like that.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path then

enough to feel led to report in my 35 years.  this is my first time to this website.  \r\n     i got off work at 7:15pm tonight.  i went to the gas station across the street to fuel up.  as i began to refuel i heard a jet flying by headed, what sounded like, in a southeast direction.  it was fairly low by the sound of it, but i was unable to see due to the station canopy.  i thought nothing of it because its not the first time ive witnessed/heard night flights from the local military bases.\r\n     while driving home on i95 from jacksonville to saint augustine i saw a stationary, bright light that i initially thought was a comet, due to what seemed like a small tail.  i found it very off and out of place.  i moved my head around to judge whether or not it was just a reflection from the windshield.  it wasnt.  i also adjusted my glasses to see if it was a smudge or reflection from them.  as i was doing that, the \"tail\" brightened and i was able to tell that it was neither and it was definitely a beam of light, not very long, coming from the starlike light.  it began moving slowly from west of i95 to east.  as i got closer i could also see, in the beam, what appeared to be smoke or mist as it moves through a beam of light.  i watched it move approximately 1 mile across the sky in an eastward direction over a two minute period.  about 3/4 of the way through it started to slowly gain altitude as well and i could no longer distinguish the short beam.  after the two minutes it hovered, with no beam for another minute.  just a bright, starlike light.  then it just disappeared.  i thought omg.  wth was that.  maybe it went behind clouds, but there were none.  it was a cloudless night.  \r\n     i considered that it could have been a helicopter with a searchlight, and it could be, but the altitude was way to high for the light to have done any good.  it appeared to be at least 600 feet off the ground when i first spotted it and the beam was only visible for maybe 70 feet of that distance and i dont know that searchlights get three times brighter or have adjustable intensity settings.  maybe they do.  the object wasnt using it for navigation purposes, because it was pointed in the opposite direction as it was heading.\r\n     i wasnt the only one to have seen it either because the traffic slowed down as it passed over the interstate and i noticed a few vehicles parked on the shoulder of i95 most likely watching the same thing.\r\n     i later realized the jet i heard earlier was headed in that direction and not towards the closest base.  it would have been heading southwest if that were the case, not southeast.\r\n     as i got home i searched the sky for a bit and noticed venus.  using that as a reference i would say the object was at least twice as big and bright as it is.\r\n     i mentioned at the beginning that i was an \"occasional\" sky watcher.  i like looking for unexplained things but remain on the skeptical side.  this is the first time ive seen something that didnt seem it could have an easy explanation so i submitted this in hopes of getting a reasonable explanation.  let me know if you have one.

(i say back because it exited the object from the opposite end of the direction it was heading) the light shot from the object and traveled down the length of the red tail. it did not stem from the object like light from a flashlight stems from the flashlight itself but rather after it was shot from the object it traveled detached. the white light was shot a number of times from the red orb. the sight was very perplexing and almost fearful due to the unknowns surrounding what it could be. the white light then stopped and it was just the red orb and the red tail again. shortly after the white light stopped, the red tail disappeared. the object traveled for a few seconds more then disappeared as if it went behind a cloud. i thought that it was clear skies but it was dark out so i can't say for sure. however, the stars could be seen near where the object disappeared so i watched and waited for it to reappear hoping to see the trail and the white light again. however, it never reappeared. it was like it disappeared or the light went out. i immediately went inside to check online for any events such as meteor showers happening but couldn't find anything so i went back outside to look at the sky for anything strange. within a few minutes a police officer came down my street shining its spotlight. the officer talked to some kids walking down the street but i was too far away to catch what the conversation was about. the cop then continued on shining the spotlight from the car as if looking for someone. about 10 minutes later a helicopter flew by extremely low and it too had its spotlight on but it is unclear if the police and the red orb were related in any way. it all happened around 7:40 pm eastern standard time. i checked periodically throughout the night for anything in the sky but it is now 12:00 am and no cops or strange objects have been seen

motionless for 1 min, pulsated about 3 times, then the light went back solid then it dissappeared. initially i thought it was a missile or rocket. i then thought it was an airplane on fire until the light dimmed down a just sat there. also when i first noticed the light there was an airplane in the area and this object looked to be three times the size of the airplane. after about 20 seconds of watching the object we reached a stop light and the people in the car next to us were recording the object on their phone. i asked them what it was and they said they didn't know. we also drove by a

at it. very quickly, we knew this was something strange we had never seen before. the light started to move slowly across the interstate and began to change shape. it started to resemble something like a missile or a comet that had a pronounced fire-like body and tail. as it made its way across the interstate, for a few moments i thought we had lost it, but immediately we could see the same

get smaller, resembling a star. it looked like it stopped moving, so i put my phone down and stopped recording it. the weirdest thing is that the moment i put my phone down and looked up again, it was gone. when i tried to play back the video on my phone to see what it looked like, my phone said \"oops! your camera will not open. please try again later.\" and the video i recorded on my cell phone

& it's dark right now so can't say anything much about that. it may have become too faint after that point. the only reason why i decided to post here is because there are no active military bases any where near where i live. it did not make any sense. i wish there was a way to debunk this. could a jet engine appear like this in the sky were it possibly had an engine explode & it still be able to maintain itself in flight? it was a very strong emission, enough to grab my attention while driving. i'm not typically 'looking' for things in the sky so just don't know what to make of it. oh, there was a helicopter in the sky just afterwards, but this is also common for south florida so wasn't sure if it was a coincidence or not..... as i type there's a helicopter with a search light shining down. a common happening. my feelings on this are more like i just want to know the answer since seeing something like this is not normal. i might see if i can reach the nearest airport (it's a small private one in boca rating) to the incident & see if there's any logical explanation.","distance":"Over One

it was the national magazine story of the hill couple, who claimed to have been abducted and placed onboard an alien aircraft. the story and the pictures in the article pretty much hooked me for life. i searched for more on the subject, but my being a child limited my access to resources.  very rarely, something would pop up in the local newspaper.  a couple of years later, however, a friend of mine brought a book to school called ���flying saucers: serious business���  by frank edwards. this had tons of stories and lots of photographs.  i bought a copy of that book, along with many others on the subject, through the school���s reading program. several friends and i devoured everything that we could find on flying saucers.\r\ni have never been one of those who ranted and raved about distant moving lights in the night sky. that does nothing for me. i had seen clear pictures in my books and in a true magazine ufo edition, of supposed saucers, and that was all that i was interested in. clear daylight photographs!  maybe, it warped my perspective, but boys and girls a distant light or lights can be anything.  your eyes can play tricks on you. the earth���s atmosphere can play tricks on you. \r\nmy wife and i experienced this recently, while traveling on a country back road at night. as we crested a hill, a valley lay out in front of us. there in the sky above the road ahead was a huge oval of lights, all seeming to be of equal brightness. they appeared to be motionless and both of us in the car were quite startled. i almost came to a complete stop, as we tried to figure out what kind of an object would be so huge in the sky and ringed with such bright lights. suddenly, one of the lights dimmed and we could see a flashing red light near it. to our surprise, our huge oval of lights turned out to be a group of c130s, circling and preparing to land on a military base. their apparent still position in the sky was due to the fact that they were all heading straight towards us, when we first spotted them. if our car had gone down a slope or behind some trees, during this event, we would have never known what we had seen, assuming the planes had landed before we had another clear view. there, boys and girls, would be one of the typical classic night time ufo stories! a giant object in the sky that suddenly disappeared!\r\nthat all being said, i am going to tell you of something that my family and i experienced on february 4th, 1999. i have kept a record of the date, for all these years, in case somewhere, sometime, somebody will tell me that they saw the same thing on that night.\r\nat the time, the three of us were living in a heavily populated area, which is part of a twin city capitol. on many late afternoons, we would walk our street and the one on the hilltop above our house for exercise.  it is a typical city neighborhood, with lots of houses and lots of traffic. we got a later start than normal, on that evening, and twilight was upon us, before we got to the hilltop street. the air was quite clear and the stars were shining bright. i remember looking up, several times, seeing a few low clouds passing between us and a lot of high flying air traffic. i don���t know that it was more air traffic than normal or that the air was so clean that we could see more.\r\nwe had just rounded a curve on the hilltop street, when my daughter said ���daddy, what is that?���\r\nwhen i first looked to where she was indicating, i thought that i was seeing the bellies of some low flying geese that frequent the area that time of year. but, suddenly, i realized that i was seeing three pale lights, one each in the corner of a black triangular shaped object, a little higher in the air than i had thought before.  i am positive that the only reason we spotted the object was because it was between us and one of the passing clouds. the lights may have not actually been lit, but appeared to be so because they were reflecting the lights of the city. the object was moving at a slow pace, to our southwest, with the bottom slightly turned to us. we could see nothing of the top of the object and heard no sound with its passing.  within a few seconds, it was out of sight, because of the trees and houses along the street. \r\ni was the first to speak. i knew exactly what we had just seen.\r\n���that was the flying triangle!���\r\ni had seen lots of stories about that particular object. one standout had been an unsolved mysteries report from years earlier. they have appeared many times in europe, usually near military installations. as a matter of fact, the course of this triangle was from the direction of a very nearby usaf base. \r\nmy reaction to having seen the triangle changed over the next several hours. i started out by being pretty giddy, very happy that my wife and daughter saw it too, but by a couple of hours later my state of mind had completely changed. i was overcome with thoughts of why a loving god had allowed us to see this.  i still don���t have an answer for that. why were we allowed to see something that millions and millions of people have never seen? what was the damn point to it!! what has been gained from our knowledge that this craft actual exists? why were we on that street at that exact moment and why did our daughter spot the movement in the sky? god, why did you let this happen to us?\r\nin a movie, i would have been contacted by government agents or space aliens and the story would have been wrapped up neatly, with all parties satisfied, in less than two hours. in real life, i was spooked for a very long time. i didn���t tell many about it, for a while, because i have seen enough shows on television to know what their possible response would be.  i eventually told. the response was as predicted. pure disbelief! the fact that my wife and daughter backed up my story, carried absolutely no weight what-so-ever. even my own father, who thought highly of my wife and daughter, could not hide the doubt in his voice.\r\n i now knew what it felt like to be a witness to such a thing. one of those people you see on television that try to convince reporters of what they saw, only to be laughed at when the show switches back to the new anchors in the studio. no one will ever fully believe you. even though you have nothing to gain, no one will believe you.  no one!  no matter how much respect they have for the others that saw it, they will not believe it happened. \r\nsometimes, it really pisses me off!\r\nmy wife, who is a skeptic to all things supernatural and space craft wise, does not like the fact that she saw the triangle. even now, if i am watching a show about ufos, and she comes into the room, she will gripe about me viewing that kind of crud. but when i tell her that the show is about the triangle, she shuts up and leaves the room. yep, she really wishes that she hadn���t seen it. i know in my heart, that she would have never believed me, if she hadn���t been there. so ��� why did god have her there? to give me some peace of mind, i guess.\r\nmy daughter will talk about that night, if asked, but it takes up no more space in her mind than a baseball game she kind of watched on tv. it doesn���t bother her, as to why we got to see the triangle. she knows that no one will believe her and that seems to sit ���ok��� with her.\r\nwhat i hope that we saw that night was a stealth blimp. there is a lot of information on the web about that particular secret aircraft.  what puzzles me, though, is why has it been kept secret for so many decades? it has been 30 plus years since the first reports started coming in about ���flying triangles���. check on it! every other whispered about military craft has seen the light of day in much less time. what is the point? it is not being used by the military in combat or there would be reports of it by now. what other frickin��� use would they have for it? to accomplish what?  just to be sneaky? it makes no sense for all the more current reports of triangles to still be a stealth blimp!\r\n i do hope that it is, though. it being anything else is not very comforting to me.\r\ni wish that i hadn���t seen it! i start off this tale, every time, in a positive frame of mind, but by this point in the story, i just get mad! i didn���t want to see it. i never looked for anything like that in the sky! i wish that this had never happened to me. \r\nwell, i���ve got myself all spooked again! at least it will be a good reason for a terrible night of sleep!  unlike what a famous scientist said, years ago, about seeing strange things in the sky, i suggest that you don���t ���look up���. what bliss to not be a part of this mystery!\r\none of my friends told me how he wished that he had seen the flying triangle. he really doesn���t understand.  i wouldn���t wish my experience on my worst enemy! not unless they could handle the mental part of it all better than me.\r\n but then, who couldn���t? i���m crazy! i see flying saucers!\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

thing i saw was a blue ball streak across my house then take a upward turn into the clouds and vanish. it left a sparkle trail behind it. i thought at first it was a firework, but it was silent and flew horizontally for a few hundred feet before turning skyward and moving off through the clouds.  the next sighting was a gold coloured ball moving toward the pentland hills.  it appeared to land then take off and return the way it had come, moving toward the south.  i took a photo of this, which i will post here. the next incident was a  cream glow like a pearl light bulb which floated in a random pattern across the roof of my house. my friend witnessed this with me, but was not interested.  as i was very excited about this third sighting in such a short time, i felt a bit silly that she was so nonplussed. i waved at it and shouted come back.  obviously it never. another friend turned up and i told her about my encounter, when suddenly i heard a voice in my head, say come outside, were back.  i jumped out of my chair telling my friend i heard them say come outside, and sure enough, there it was moving in the exact same manner and same place.  i was awestruck.  the next one is strange as it is a star that i have been watching for a while.  it moves far quicker across the horizon than the rest of the stars, moving about 20 degrees in half an hour.  i got the telescope out for a look at saw what appeared to be a red,blue and green plasma ball.  i thought maybe mercury looked like this, but when looking at it without the telescope it appeared to drop molten silver looking tears that then flew off. i was with several other people at the time and we all witnessed this.  a few weeks went by with no sightings, then two in the same day.  i was collecting my child from youth club at about 7.30 on a tuesday evening, when a bright light appeared in the sky. as this is a flight path, my mind registered it as a normal plane, as i glanced up i caught it move with excessive speed across the sky,stop blink once, then vanish.  other parent watched it too.  later that night i was outside in the garden thinking about what i had been witnessing lately, wondering if it was experimental craft from the military.  so i asked out loud, if you are alien show me something, right at that moment, a light appeared, again i just assumed it was a plane coming into view, but then it got really bright, as big as a street lamp in the sky, then started to fade, as it faded i saw a grey rectangular shaped object. then it vanished  as if it had never been there at all. this whole episode has made me feel like i have been going crazy, but other people in the area assured me they have been experiencing the same phenomena.  since then nothing.

generally the smog covers most of the stars where we live but the recent s.A. winds, and rain made for a very clear night, no clouds present and many stars were glowing which is a rare occassion in southern california.  he noticed a star moving, ask if it is a falling star, so i looked up, it was not a falling star, clearly not that.  it was located to the left in the night sky or west, moving east-wards and extremely fast, its speed covered the entire sky in about 1 minute or less. it looked to be the same size as a bright star, but its speed was unusual compared to any airraft i have  personally ever seen.  we live in the landing path of john wayne airport so i see alot of planes, granted it could have been a jet, however it was so high it looked equal to the stars as to the distance away. my instinct felt that it was not a jet as it seemed to me faster that any jet ive ever seen. it

~4:30am when i (the passenger) noticed 2 disc shaped objects hovering stationary in the sky at a 30degree pitch off the horizon. one was within a mile of us and the other was behind it about a mile and a half. they were exaclty alike in size and shape and seemed to be coordinating a 2 vessel observation. they just stayed still in the same relation to each other and emitted the same color patterns. the top half glowed a greenish/blue pastel color and the bottom half a yellow/orange pastel. it was still dark so we could see them very well. they were very large crafts and i would guestimate ~300 feet diameter. we pulled to the side of the road and got out of the car to observe. we thought maybe they were tower lights or something but as the sun rose we could still see them and there was nothing even close to the crafts. after 2 hours they were still there and we could still faintly see them as the morning went on. the 2 crafts maintained their positions until they went out of eyesight range due to earth rotation. we never saw them move in 2 hours and when we arrived at our destination even the company security guards were watching them trying to figure out what they were.\r\n\r\nmy personal feelings were that of amazement, being an engineer i couldn't figure out an explanation for an aircraft that didn't need lift to fly. you have to move to create lift. also, why didn't they care if we saw them? obviously it was not a experimental military excersise. they didn't seem to care that thousands of people on the ground were looking at them, there was no fear or concern of military (human) intervention.\r\n\r\ni to this day am totally puzzled as to why they were elevated over the malaysian jungle in the middle of nowhere. it also made me feel a bit scared, small and helpless due to their boldness. i had the feeling they could have done whatever they wanted.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
