images of my location and ufo passage that are added below.\r\n\r\nottawa, canada ufo ��� summer 1986\r\n\r\nduring the summer of 1986 when i was 24 years old, i was very fortunate to witness a high speed ufo travelling just above the ottawa river at what i estimate to be 3,000 to 5,000 feet.  this observation is based on aircraft normally flying at 20,000 to 30,000 feet.\r\n\r\nthe craft was a cigar shape.  tapered at both ends and thickening in the middle.\r\n\r\nthe width and thickness of the object observed from my distance was that of a canadian dime.  true length of object viewed from 1.7 miles is 30 meters to 40 meters.\r\n\r\nplease note that the human eye has a natural zoom capability for distant objects of about 1,800x.  this observation is based on my use of a modern 2011 sony video camera with a 50x optical zoom and 1,800x digital zoom.  model dcr - sr20\r\n\r\ndistance to object has been estimated at 1.7 to 2 miles using google earth, measuring from the top of the hill at the intersection at duford street and jamison avenue.\r\n\r\nmy viewing location for this event was at the top of the queenswood height's hill in orleans located approximately 10 miles from ottawa.  intersection at duford street and jamison avenue. \r\n\r\nin 1986 there were no houses built on this hill giving a clear view of the ottawa river and the gatineau valley 1.7 miles away.\r\n\r\nmonth of sighting is june 1986.  estimate\r\n\r\nviewing time was between 15:00hrs to 17:00hrs, broad daylight.\r\n\r\ni had the ufo in sight for only 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nlater on i would determine with google earth that the distance covered by the ufo during my observation time was 4 miles.  this was possible because of my elevated position on queenswood heights hill giving me a clear view of the ottawa river and gatineau valley in the distance.\r\n\r\nthe ufo travelled rapidly over the ottawa river moving in an east to west direction towards the city of ottawa.\r\n\r\nthe ufo would be spotted by several students at carleton university, reported to the ottawa citizen newspaper, and written up the next day in a small story.\r\n\r\nthe event happened on a friday.  exact date unknown.\r\n\r\ntechnical details of the event.\r\n\r\ntime in view 2 seconds.\r\n\r\ndistance covered 4 miles.\r\n\r\nspeed 4 miles per 2 seconds.\r\n\r\n4 miles = 6437.376 metres\r\n\r\n6437.376 m

absolute complete silence.\r\n\r\nthere was no sonic boom associated with this high speed travelling object and i was completely surprised.  i was listening for it intently.\r\n\r\nthis ufo therefore had the capability to move through a medium like air without displacing it.\r\n\r\ntravelling at 9.45x the speed of sound the only way not to create a sonic boom is not to displace the medium of air in the first place.\r\n\r\ntherefore ufo craft have an ability to move through a medium like air and water without displacing it.  this means that there is no friction with the medium allowing such fast velocities and changes in direction when required.\r\n\r\nhow this is accomplished is not known at this time.\r\n\r\ncould a magnetic field enable an object to move through a medium without displacing it?\r\n\r\na engineering challenge for future aircraft designers.\r\n\r\nthe technology to move an object through a medium without displacing it exists.\r\n\r\ni have seen it in 1986 and

their tricks.  i have been thinking about this subject for the past 25 years since my own observation of a ufo travelling towards ottawa, canada at 9x the speed of sound without breaking the sound barrier.  this ufo was spotted by four other independent observers in june 1986 and written up in the ottawa citizen newspaper.\r\n\r\nbest ufo's documentary ��� i know what i saw ��� full 1:30:31 hrs

about ufo's and their ability to defy conventional wisdom by travelling above the speed of sound without breaking the sound barrier.\r\n\r\nufo's are observed to travel at high velocity and change direction as if beyond capability.\r\n\r\nwhen i was 24 years old, i was very fortunate to witness a ufo in june 1986 travelling above the ottawa river at about 5,000 feet towards the city of ottawa at a very high rate of speed.  later on in 2010 i would determine the speed of the ufo to be 9x the speed of sound based on the fact that it covered a 4 mile distance in 2 seconds.  event happened on a thursday or friday in the late afternoon in june 1986.\r\n\r\nthe presence of jet fighters are very rare in ottawa, but at least once every two years one would fly over queenswood heights, orleans where i lived from 10 years to 26 years of age.  from experience i knew that jet fighters generated a lot of noise when they passed overhead.\r\n\r\nstanding at the top of the queenswood heights hill, overlooking the scenic ottawa river and gatineau, quebec (intersection of duford and jamison avenue) i was intrigued by a very high velocity object that suddenly came into view travelling east to west over the ottawa river (5,000 feet estimate) headed up river towards the city of ottawa 10 miles (15.6km) away.\r\n\r\nupon seeing the high speed object cover 4 miles in 2 seconds, i immediately began listening intently for a sonic boom and any kind of engine noise.  there was nothing, the object was completely silent and there was no sonic boom.  ���impossible,��� i thought at the time. \r\n\r\n���how could an object travel so rapidly through the air and not make a sonic boom���, i wondered?\r\n\r\nthe ufo was observed by four other students seconds later, who then contacted the ottawa citizen who wrote up a story the next day and printed it in the newspaper.  i was thrilled to have seen the news story to learn that other people had witnessed what i had seen.\r\n\r\ni instantly became a ufo believer having witnessed my own event.  then my life moved on and i forgot about the incident.\r\n\r\nthroughout the next few years i would read about more ufo sightings and see video footage in 2006 shot from the us space shuttle showing a high velocity object travelling over canada and the united states at a phenomenal rate of speed.  the speed of the ufo was very similar to the one i had observed in 1986, twenty years earlier.\r\n\r\nout of curiosity, in 2010 i would determine from google earth and google maps that the ufo i had observed in 1986 was travelling at 9x the speed of sound.  i had the ufo in sight for a distance of 4 miles due to my elevated viewing angle on queenswood heights hill.  the time for the ufo to travel this 4 miles was two seconds.  \r\n\r\nthe ufo is estimated to have been  1.76 to 2 miles away from where i stood on the queenswood heights hill to the middle of the ottawa river.  estimate determined using google earth.\r\n\r\nthe ufo was an aerodynamic cigar shape approximately 30m to 40m (1,000ft) in length.\r\n\r\nfrom my perspective the ufo was the width and thickness of the edge of a dime. \r\n\r\nif one were to stretch out their right arm, index finger pointed out and slowly draw your arm in arc from right to left this was the velocity of the ufo over the ottawa river 1.76 to 2 miles away.  time in sight was 2 seconds.  distance covered 4 miles.  velocity 9x the speed of sound.\r\n\r\nsonic boom ��� none.\r\n\r\nengine noise ��� none.\r\n\r\ndisturbance of air around the object ��� none.\r\n\r\nif you have ever seen a fighter jet travelling at or above the speed of sound near the ground you can see the shock wave around the aircraft.  the water vapour in the air condenses into droplets around the aircraft.  it is very cool to see.\r\n\r\nso a ufo can move through a medium like air without displacing it.  \r\n\r\nthis then allows the ufo to move through air at above the speed of sound without making a sonic boom.\r\n\r\nin my case and others ufo's are observed to travel at 9x the speed of sound and faster without creating a sonic boom.  meaning the medium of air is not displaced when the ufo travels through it.\r\n\r\nthe same effect has also been seen with ufo's travelling through the water.\r\n\r\nufo's can travel at a high rate of speed through a medium without displacing the medium they are in.\r\n\r\nufo's it then stands to reason, do not experience friction from air molecules like other aircraft.\r\n\r\nufo's have also been observed making impossible manoeuvres in the air like abrupt jumps to the left and right of aircraft and fore and aft of aircraft. \r\n\r\nufo's have also been observed making abrupt 90 degree turns above the speed of sound.\r\n\r\nimpossible?\r\n\r\nif ufo's do not displace the medium they travel through then why are they so streamlined?\r\n\r\nwhy are ufo's cigar shape?  why not a cube?  why be so aerodynamic?\r\n\r\nanother clue.  fighter jets engaging ufo's report a loss of their control surfaces and electronic instrumentation when they get too close. \r\n\r\nall of the above observations make sense if one considers that we live in space-time and the ufo is warping time around it.\r\n\r\nthe ufo is streamlined because it is travelling through the medium of air.\r\n\r\nhowever\r\n it is travelling through the air very slowly from its perspective.\r\n\r\nthe  ufo is travelling in a bubble of accelerated time.\r\n\r\nthe world outside of this time bubble is moving in slow motion.\r\n\r\nthis explains the observation of ufo's travelling at high velocities through the medium of air and water without apparently displacing it.  the time frame of the ufo relative to its surroundings is adjustable based on the time acceleration in the bubble surrounding the ufo.\r\n\r\nthis explains how a ufo can suddenly accelerate away at an unbelievable speed.\r\n\r\nthe ufo is not accelerating away.  the observers time reference is being slowed down relative to that of the ufo.\r\n\r\nufo's making abrupt 90 degree turns in flight can now be explained if one understands that the ufo is moving very slowly in its bubble of accelerated time.  to the outside observer from their frame of slowed time the manoeuvres seem impossible.  however from the perspective of the ufo inside the accelerated time bubble they are moving very slowly.\r\n\r\ntherefore a ufo can never create a sonic boom, because it is never close to breaking the speed of sound in its time reference.\r\n\r\nthis can best be illustrated by running a movie through a projector at a much faster speed.  the action in the film seems to be impossible based on known physical laws.  the observer is experiencing a slower time reference to that of the film. \r\n\r\nthe ufo appears to do amazing feats of aerodynamics and acceleration because it is accelerating time in its bubble.\r\n\r\nwhen jet fighters get to close to a ufo in flight they risk penetrating the accelerated time bubble surrounding the ufo.  \r\n\r\nthis is what causes a jet aircraft to loose flight control.  the jet is moving from a normal time frame of 600mph to one of 60mph or slower.  the fighter jet cannot stay in the air at the much slower speed.\r\n\r\nmoving through the  accelerated time bubble no doubt causes avionics to behave in very strange ways, which has what has been observed in numerous military cases.  specifically that of the iranian pilot in 1984.\r\n\r\nit is impossible for modern jet fighters to catch an aerodynamic ufo, because the ufo has the ability to accelerate time in the bubble that surrounds it.  the greater the risk posed by the fighter jet, the more that time is accelerated in the ufo bubble to escape the threat.\r\n\r\nthe ufo never changes its velocity.  only the time acceleration changes, relative to the outside world.\r\n\r\nthe creation of a time accelerated bubble around the ufo may be tied to the gravitational drive that keeps it aloft in the air.\r\n\r\nit is important to remember now that the ufo is now moving slowly in accelerated time.\r\n\r\nthis acceleration of time may also affect gravity allowing the craft to appear to be weightless.\r\n\r\nthe concept of  accelerating time in the bubble that surrounds the spacecraft can be extrapolated even further to allow these spacecraft to travel between star systems and galaxies.  the speed of light is never broken inside the space-time bubble.  however outside the ufo bubble in normal space-time the spacecraft would appear to defy physics breaking the speed of light.\r\n\r\nthe speed of light however has never been broken, only time has been accelerated in the confined bubble containing the spacecraft / ufo.  to my knowledge there is no limit to the acceleration of time.\r\n\r\ntherefore faster than light travel is theoretically possible from an outside viewers perspective.\r\n\r\nthe same phenomenon is observed when ufo's are observed to be travelling faster than the speed in normal space-time, yet there is no sonic boom (in my observation 9x the speed of sound).  this is because in the accelerated space-time bubble surrounding the ufo, the ufo is not exceeding the speed of sound, nor is it even close to it.  therefore no sonic boom is ever heard.\r\n\r\nthe same concept applies to faster than light travel from a normal space-time perspective.\r\nufo's can exceed the speed of light by simply accelerating time in their space-time bubble.\r\nspeeding up time is much easier and convenient to enable interstellar travel.","distance":"Over One

streamlined because it is travelling through the medium of air.\r\n\r\nhowever it is travelling through the air very slowly from its perspective.\r\n\r\nthe  ufo is travelling in a bubble of accelerated time.\r\n\r\nthe world outside of this time bubble is moving in slow motion.\r\n\r\nthis explains the observation of ufo's travelling at high velocities through the medium of air and water without apparently displacing it.  the time frame of the ufo relative to its surroundings is adjustable based on the time acceleration in the bubble surrounding the ufo.\r\n\r\nthis explains how a ufo can suddenly accelerate away at an unbelievable speed.\r\n\r\nthe ufo is not accelerating away.  the observers time reference is being slowed down relative to that of the ufo.\r\n\r\nufo's making abrupt 90 degree turns in flight can now be explained if one understands that the ufo is moving very slowly in its bubble of accelerated time.  to the outside observer from their frame of slowed time the manoeuvres seem impossible.  however from the perspective of the ufo inside the accelerated time bubble they are moving very slowly.\r\n\r\ntherefore a ufo can never create a sonic boom, because it is never close to breaking the speed of sound in its time reference.\r\n\r\nthis can best be illustrated by running a movie through a projector at a much faster speed.  the action in the film seems to be impossible based on known physical laws.  the observer is experiencing a slower time reference to that of the film. \r\n\r\nthe ufo appears to do amazing feats of aerodynamics and acceleration because it is accelerating time in its bubble.\r\n\r\nwhen jet fighters get to close to a ufo in flight they risk penetrating the accelerated time bubble surrounding the ufo.  \r\n\r\nthis is what causes a jet aircraft to loose flight control.  the jet is moving from a normal time frame of 600mph to one of 60mph or slower.  the fighter jet cannot stay in the air at the much slower speed.\r\n\r\nmoving through the  accelerated time bubble no doubt causes avionics to behave in very strange ways, which has what has been observed in numerous military cases.  specifically that of the iranian pilot in 1984.\r\n\r\nit is impossible for modern jet fighters to catch an aerodynamic ufo, because the ufo has the ability to accelerate time in the bubble that surrounds it.  the greater the risk posed by the fighter jet, the more that time is accelerated in the ufo bubble to escape the threat.\r\n\r\nthe ufo never changes its velocity.  only the time acceleration changes, relative to the outside world.\r\n\r\nthe creation of a time accelerated bubble around the ufo may be tied to the gravitational drive that keeps it aloft in the air.\r\n\r\nit is important to remember now that the ufo is now moving slowly in accelerated time.\r\n\r\nthis acceleration of time may also affect gravity allowing the craft to appear to be weightless.\r\n\r\nthe concept of  accelerating time in the bubble that surrounds the spacecraft can be extrapolated even further to allow these spacecraft to travel between star systems and galaxies.  the speed of light is never broken inside the space-time bubble.  however outside the ufo bubble in normal space-time the spacecraft would appear to defy physics breaking the speed of light.\r\n\r\nthe speed of light however has never been broken, only time has been accelerated in the confined bubble containing the spacecraft / ufo.  to my knowledge there is no limit to the acceleration of time.\r\n\r\ntherefore faster than light travel is theoretically possible from an outside viewers perspective.\r\n\r\nthe same phenomenon is observed when ufo's are observed to be travelling faster than the speed in normal space-time, yet there is no sonic boom (in my observation 9x the speed of sound).  this is because in the accelerated space-time bubble surrounding the ufo, the ufo is not exceeding the speed of sound, nor is it even close to it.  therefore no sonic boom is ever heard.\r\n\r\nthe same concept applies to faster than light travel from a normal space-time perspective.\r\nufo's can exceed the speed of light by simply accelerating time in their space-time bubble.\r\nspeeding up time is much easier and convenient to enable interstellar travel.\r\n\r\narnold vinette\r\nottawa, canada\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

that has video and recorded the event.I zoomed on the bright light which appears to be like a bright star or the north star.Once i zoomed in on full, i could see the actual shape which was a perfect circle.It was greyish in color with many blurry black dots at the bottom.As i was recorded the bottom of the aircraft it zoomed much higher in the sky fast.Real fast.It zoomed up and down and i guess it realized that i was taping it and moved very high in the sky, so the only thing that would appear on my screen was a bright light.It kept going up and down but would move at light speed much faster than i could possibly zoom.Now i was completely shocked at this event.She then showed me another one that was pretty much right above the house so i zoomed in out it as well.It was the same shape,with the same black blurry dots on the bottom and it zoomed closer and then further away just like the other one and this one was just as fast....Every night these 2 ufo's are outside of my dads house and

down from me.  i didn't think anything at first, then after while i noticed it moving staight up and the definitely got my attention.  i started watching it every night including tonight.  it usually appears betweem 6:00 - 6:30pm every night only it is really high up.  after it first appears, then i started seeing smaller, not so bright, i think cigar sharped crafts filling the sky.  i believe that the larger crafts are dropping them off and then later picking them up.  about 2 weekthey  ago i went out to the front yard and looked straight up and there was a second large, bright light like the first one i saw.  if i could stay up later than 11:00pm or so i would see more.  \r\n\r\n1.  i was sitting on my front porch\r\n2.  the brightness of the craft made me notice it\r\n3.  maybe a tower with a light.  i really didn't pay attention until it started moving up an down.\r\n4.  when the larger objects appears, they are coming down from really high up.  they eventually come to a complete stop for about 30 seconds then move again and come to a complete stop.  they repeat this for about an hour or 1 1/2 hours.  then they ascend an more or less hover.  sometimes jets fly very close above it or below it and it will back off for about 5 minutes and then come right back forward.  they are always in sight.\r\n5.  at first i was totally shocked and excited.  the first thing i did was run into the house and tell my family.  they all said i was crazy and won't even talk to me about it.  i tried to find a group that would interested (on the internet).  i emailed \"realufos\", but never got a response back so i finally gave up.  then a fried told me to go to \"mufon\".  now i am kinda of used to it, but i am still bewildered.  i go out and sit on the front porch every night and watch what they are doing.\r\n5.  i haven't lost sight of them. when i get through with this i am going outside to see what is going on.  i have been asking myself, am i the only one seeing all of this.  you are welcome to call me if you have questions.  i don't have a good camera because if i did believe me i would have taken pictures.
