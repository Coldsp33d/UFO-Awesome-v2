an area familiar to me. kananaskis is now a well-known wilderness recreation area, but in the late '60's there was none of the development for which it is known today. \r\n\r\nthe two lakes are separated by approximately 150 yards horizontally and 100 feet or more vertically. both have been dammed for power generation, so water levels fluctuate considerable from season to season and, even in mid-to-late spring, levels are usually still well down because meltwater has not yet replaced the water that has been used over the winter to drive generater turbines. i'm given to understand that present-day kananaskis lakes recreation area boasts many modern, well-serviced campsites, but for us, at that time,conditions were happily primitive.\r\n\r\nwhen my traveling companion and i arrived in the early afternoon, two of our party had already set up their tent on the exposed beach next to the lower lake. we camped above them, nearer to the upper lake and next to the connecting sluiceway, about 50 feet east of the upper dam and somewhat lower than the dam in altitude, a position that would give us early-morning warming sun coming in over the lower lake. as we set up our tent that afternoon and also later as we hiked the north shore of the upper lake, we noticed a forestry helicopter flying up and down the kananaskis valley, passing within two miles of us, the sound of its motor and rotors echoing off of the surrounding mountains. \r\n\r\naround 6 to 7 o'clock we lit a fire, cooked an evening meal and, following that, got out our guitars to play and sing for a while. the scene, at this point, is vivid in my memory: \r\n\r\ni am sitting on a stump, looking beyond roger at an exquisitely picturesque mountain valley, the lower elevations of which are in shade, as am i. the other two members of my group are, like us, sitting beside their fire, 150 yards away from us, next to the absolutely still lower kananaskis lake. the west side of the valley, still in brilliant sunshine, is reflected perfectly in the lakewater. the silence is so profound that it seems almost wrong to mar it with our music but we do so anyway.\r\n\r\nmy friend has a guitar that is much more expensive that mine, so it shocks me when he drops it. it bounces off of something, probably his feet, and into the fire. i grab it quickly before it begins to burn, then look at him for an explanation. i see terror on his face,looking over my shoulder at something behind me. i step towards him, across the fire and turn, a guitar dangling from each hand (held by the neck), expecting to see a bear. i see nothing. i ask him \"what did you see?\" and \"where is it?\" but get no answer. to my left, i see him going into the tent.\r\n\r\ni'm not frightened but i still don't see anything, so i stand still and look carefully into the shadows of the trees nearest us in the direction that my campanion had been looking, which is to the west, uphill, in the direction of the north shore of the upper kananaskis lake (which is over the dam and out of sight).\r\n\r\nmovement is what i'm looking for and that is exactly what gets my attention, but it isn't in the shadows, it is above the trees and visible against the clear sky, on the other side of the tree-tops. coming towards me but coming slowly. at this point, i'm beginning to comprehend that something is wrong but i can't get my mind to formulate a thought. my senses are acute and record details but my thought processes are very slow. it is as if there are two of me: one observing and another thinking. \r\n\r\nthe me that is observing sees a silver-grey shape approaching and descending from beyond the trees at a speed that, in retrospect, appeared to be 15 to 20 miles/hour. it just clears the nearest tree-tops, which would put it at well under 50 vertical feet above the ground at that point but still 80 or more feet above me and 200 yards away (the trees are upslope from me). it continues to descent as it approaches me, but not at the same rate as the slope of the ground, so the object is 50 feet or so above me as it passes over me - not directly over me, but about 20 degrees or so off the vertical, so i'm viewing this object from below, at about a 70 degree angle and at a distance of from 50 to 60 feet (20 yards). it is still moving slowly.  there are what appears to be windows around the circumference of the object both on the main body and on the upper turret. there are also colored lights pulsing around the perimeter of the main body. movement is steady, silent and has a quality of lightness or fragility. the object continues on its path, passing over my companions on the beach and coming to rest less than 6 feet above the surface of the lake where it remains for 5 to 10 seconds in full view of at least one of them but neither of them seems aware of it. under the object, the glassy surface of the water is undisturbed.\r\n\r\nsimultaneously, two things happen: my thoughts return to normal with: \"it's a ufo!\" and the object shoots off at roughly a 45 degree angle into the clear blue sky and disappears into the distance in roughly one second, with no apparent acceleration. \r\n\r\nwhile all of that was going on, the other me (remember?)was struggling to think with a mind that was functioning like a swimmer in molasses:\r\n\r\n\"trying to identify this thing. helicopter? something's wrong. where's the noise? is it landing? what's wrong with it? not a helicopter? why don't the guys look up at it? what's wrong with them? what's wrong with the water? ............Its a ufo!\" \r\n\r\nonly the last three words were word-thoughts. all the rest were conceptual, non-verbal thoughts which i've put into words after the event. there was no emotion felt during the experience and no confusion, just what can best be described as a temporal duality: my thoughts and my physical experience just didn't match up.\r\n\r\n i remembering staring at the point of blue sky into which the ufo had disappeared and calling to my friend in the tent who'd left me with his guitar. when he didn't answer, i went into the tent feeling excited and wanting to talk about what had just happened. he was in his sleeping bag in mild shock and refused to talk. he just wanted to go home, which we did next morning, still without any discussion. i dropped him off at his home, and we haven't seen each other since that time.\r\n\r\nthe other two guys down on the beach neither saw nor heard the ufo though it passed only about 30 feet above them. their dog kept them up all night growling at something though.\r\n\r\n\r\n ","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Window(s),  Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":34927,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.05293,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-01182012-0005","longitude":-114.0487922,"occurred":-50963400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alberta","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1326886295000,"summary":"Approached us treetop height passed close overhead descended to surface of lake. shot abruptly upward into bright sky and disappeared.

oaks and traveling northbound on the 101 freeway in california.  i was driving along the stretch of freeway that is no more than 50 feet from the pacific ocean.  the view of the ocean and channel islands is completely un-ubstructed from houses or trees, but there was a terrific sunset with a marine layer creeping in on the horizon, so the channel islands were not as imedietly apparent like they would be on a clear day.\r\nwhat drew my attention away from what i would ussually be looking at during this point of my freeway drive home(the great waves at rincon point) was a spiraling con-trail on the edge of the horizon that was in clear contrast compared to the milky sunset transpiring. cant remember if the sun was still up, but the time was right around 5:00pm pst and i wundered from where they were doing this launch, and did it fail or something? the trail cut off right where the marine layer stopped and there was nothing but clear skies above....So thats why i thought something must have gone wrong because i would have expected it to contiue and be connected to it's maker.  then all of a sudden at about a 45degree angle from my car window vantage point, i noticed a jet.  then i really noticed the jet, and how high in elevation, but how large at the same time it was.  nothing about this jet screamed ufo but it was hauling butt along the skyline and looked to be performing some slight s turns that looked very controlled. the contrails from the jet disipated very fast...Maybe 10-20 times the jets body length, but at the jet's tail i could tell these trails were extremely thick and seemed like a double or tripple width contrail and where a dark reddish color.  i thought this could be because of the orangy sunset going on.\r\n\r\nas soon as the jet left my vantage point from my car driver side window which took 1or 2  minute tops, i started wundering if this was ejected from a sub,san nicholas island,or simply a plane coming over  the horizon from overseas.  thats when i noticed i noticed two very bright glowing balls that where about midway from the marine layer and the coastline, and maybe 1000 feet of the ocean level, or just about where i first noticed the jet(at 45degrees) the reason i was looking out there again and not trying to stretch my head out the window and keep watching the jet overhead was because i wanted to see the relationship of the trail to the islands to see if it could have come from our outer island san nicholas which is never visable from our shores,but i never made that calculation due to seing the bright glowing green balls which took all my attention.\r\n\r\ni had to keep my eyes on the road, but my second look at the glowing balls gave me enough time to notice they were very slowly falling in the direction of the sea. not nearly as fast as a freefall would be, no matter what it's distance out to sea, or elevation could have been, so i'd say it was more of a slow deliberately decent.\r\n\r\nthe freeway took a sharp turn inland about this same time, and no longer offered the view i needed to keep viewing.\r\n\r\ni did'nt react or feel like i thought i would given such an occurance...It almost felt like a normal everyday thing, especially when i started asking myself all the questions like \"why did'nt you pull over?\" \"why did'nt you look longer?\" \"why did'nt i try to flag some other drivers down and point to the horizon and see if they saw it too?\" \"why did i not at least look at my car clock to find out the exact time?\"(i always do that immedietly whenever something wierd happens) my only explanation for my lack of excitedness and panic is that maybe i thought the message i was seeing would mean something to me, or become more explosive visually, but it did'nt, or i was'nt able to watch it close or long enough due to the crazy trafic at the time.\r\n\r\ni measured the distance of the freeway where i was seeing this on a mapping sevice and it was about 3 miles , and i was traveling around 75 to 80 mph and with the flow of traffic which was very congested, so potentially there are hundreds of people who if looking out at the ocean could not have missed the jet or the orbs\r\ni hope this helps anyone who might have also seen this out there, and am very excited to see if there were some details or later happenings that i missed.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

and acting erratically. the hawk was very verbal and raising her body to a point where she was stalling midair then she would recover and circle us once again. while watching this i commented to my friend that i had never seen a hawk act that way. he also said the same. looking at the hawk i saw two white dots racing along a a modest speed, roughly the speed of a say  f-4 phantom at twenty or thirty thousand feet, i say this because i have observed the latter and this experience i had a hard time judging the size of the obejects so i am at a best guess trying to guess size and altitude. both white round shapes flew in formation with each other for at least forty seconds. the object on the right took a ninety degree turn, excelerated and vanished. the object on the left continued straight for at least two to four seconds and vaninshed in a straight line both objects were on a northwest heading. i asked my friend what the hell is that, do you see those, he replied yes, he said i don't know. we had some more what the hell are they comments and then we both said where did it go? we turned and looked back almost straight up and looked for the hawk, my friend said where the hawk go, i said it was right there, but it was gone. both of us looked at the sky around us and i said to my friend look theres five more of those. i asked him are the gulls from the river and he said he thought that they were to high. i said to him why would birds glint sun light like a mirror, he said he didn,t think they were birds. as this conversation was happening we were observing the five white objects, identical to the first two in shape, size and altitude. they were flying in a five star formation, same speed and unequal distance from each other, not a tight or precise formation. they flew twoard us on a northwest heading. we observed them for twenty to forty seconds, when they started to circle each other some turning left some right. they did advance forward in their flight path at the same speed for maybe ten seconds, prompting me to ask my friend if he thought they were birds. his response was no and that birds don't shine like a mirror. all five objects then resumed their original formation and continued northwest on the same path as the first two, excelerated and vanished from right to left. we both looked at each other and laughed, i asked my friend was that strange or what. he said we probably ought not to tell anybody as they would think we had started drinking. i am a retired army aviator and have many experiences in aviation, flying and aerodynamics. i don't know what i saw but i can tell you after careful consideration they were not gulls or any other type of birds. the hardest thing i find myself struggling with is at what altitude and what size

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This was a terrifying event for me. i contacted a relative when i got home in the middle of the night and she got me the name of someone here in spokane who supposedly \"handled ufo incidents\". when i called him he asked me what happened and when i started to tell him he said, \"yeah right, so you were chased by lights\". and then he hung up on me. so, i have been very reluctant to speak to anyone of authority regarding this event. here i am, 10 years later, ready to tell anyone who wants to listen. i didn't realize this forum existed or i would have reported this event sooner.\r\n\r\non approximately august 31, 2002, i was traveling back from portland, or to my home in spokane wa. i had gone back to pick up some items i had not brought with me during my move from portland to spokane. \r\n\r\nthe main hwy leading into spokane from portland is 90 and i believe it changes into 2 at some point. i was approximately 30 miles (i would have to go back there to be absolute on this) outside of spokane when this incident occurred, driving in my car, alone, and wide awake. there are huge \"boulders\" on the immediate right side of the hwy. the boulders are really what the hwy is carved through. it's more like a \"wall\" of rock to the right side of the left lane going straight up approximately 20 ft. i would have to go back there to be more accurate on that. \r\n\r\nas i came around a little bend in the hwy my attention was drawn to the top of the boulders on the left side. there was a huge object just laying on the top of the boulders, almost sideways.The predominant lights i remember were white, red and blue. there were many circles of round lights flashing sequentially with smaller circles of light traveling in the opposite direction within those circles. i was traveling at a speed of approximately 60mph so i couldn't stop but my first thought was, \"what kind of roadwork is being done here in the middle of the night?..And on a boulder?\" as i look back it seems my mind was trying to place the object into a framework or context i could understand. \r\n\r\nwith in a couple seconds after passing that place in the hwy where i had looked up to see the object, i saw 3 white lights in my rear view mirror. one of them traveled quickly to the back of my car, about 4 ft off the ground and i thought at first it was a motorcycle traveling at a high rate of speed that was going to crash into the back of my car. as soon as it reached the very back of the car it just \"blinked\" off as though someone had turned the light off. at the same time there were 2 other lights the same size traveling just as quickly to the left and right hand sides of the car but when they reached the back door level, the one on the left side, or the boulder side, just seemed to go straight up the boulder. the one on the right side did the same thing but as there are no boulders on the right side it just flashed off to the right and blinked off.\r\n\r\nthey were basketball size and shape, maybe a little larger. there was absolutely no sound at all. i didn't have the radio on and my window was partially open as i like fresh air when i drive. the one light that came up behind my car did so several times. i was watching it and them in my mirror, my side mirror and over my shoulder. every time they would start someways behind me and then travel so quickly towards the back of the car i was sure they would crash into me but they never did. i realized they were not motorcycle lights. motorcycles cannot travel up a boulder or off the left side of the highway or almost hit the back end of my car repeatedly and then just disappear.\r\n\r\ni was utterly panicked. i felt like a rabbit being chased by wolves that were toying with me. there were no other cars traveling on that hwy during this time which lasted approximately 7-8 minutes. i didn't know what to do other than speed up and try not to crash my car as i couldn't take my eyes off them because i really believed something bad was going to happen to me.\r\n\r\nthen further down the hwy i saw a semi pulled into a gravel \"pit-stop\" nestled into the boulders on the right side of the road. i passed the truck and pulled in front of it skidding to a stop to ask for help. when i opened my car door and tried to get out i literally fell down to my knees and screamed \"motorcycles are chasing me\" to the driver of the semi who was standing in front of the truck. i simply didn't know what else to say because how could i explain what i saw. i must have looked so terrified that i actually scared him because he wouldn't approach me. he looked back down the hwy as i did and there was absolutely nothing coming. no lights, no cars, nothing. i told him, when i could get up, that i was trying to get home to spokane and he said to follow him and he would honk his horn at the the maple st. bridge exit. i knew how to get there, it was just a few minutes on the same road but i didn't want to be on that road alone. so i followed him and kept watching for those lights in the mirrors and over my shoulder but they simply never appeared again.\r\n\r\na couple days after the incident my mother located a retired air force colonel in the spokane area who had been involved somehow in the ufo community. i do not recall his name. (he was not the same person i reached  to report this incident to, who hung up on me.) i called him and we had a couple conversations. he told me he was well aware of ufo sightings by the air force when he was active and also, that people routinely called the police in the area that this incident occurred with reports of strange lights. when i called the police to report seeing lights, just to hear their response, i was told no one had called in a report about anything like that on that evening or any other evening so i don't know if what he said was the truth or if the police were telling the truth. \r\n\r\nso i have sat with this incident over 10 years now and have told just my mother, 2 friends, the colonel and the other person who hung up on me. \r\n\r\ni know what i saw and what i experienced. no one can take that away from me. this was not something i can find any explanation for other than i actually saw a ufo sitting on the boulders and then 3 lights came out of it and chased me for some reason. i have joked to my friends and mother that i was not interesting enough for them to take me. thank god for that!!!!\r\n\r\ni have recounted this incident as clearly as i can. the images of the large object on the boulders and the 3 lights are burned into my memory like it happened last night. thank you for this forum.

her descriptions of the objects are very similar indeed - in fact it helped me recall something i hadnt thought anything of at the time of my incident and so i have also pasted below my subsequent comment:\r\n\r\n\r\nit has been a while since my sighting ��� looking back on the experience i had, i didnt think anything of it at the time ��� the colour of the underside of the crafts ��� i just assumed it was orangey in colour due to the reflection of the streetlights ��� i have since seen an interview with bridget grant (interviewed by nick pope) and she describes exactly the same ships (in la ��� usa)���it was when she said it had the same colouring that i had seen ��� could this be the same craft? she didnt have a picture of it, but like me she had since been through a lot of pictures of ufos ��� she chose ones that looked like what she had seen ��� these can be seen in the interview ��� these look just like what i saw ��� only there was more than one and it didnt hover around ��� the ones i saw flew almost overhead at speed (fortunately).\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nnow present day (17-01-12) i am infatuated with looking up at the sky - my normal routines have gone, i now spend my evenings researching this subject, trying to find a rational explanation - many years ago the triangular shaped craft that was doing the rounds in the 1990's (i reported on here some years later) flew right over my head at low level - like just above my friends house on a clear sunny day- this craft, although very odd looking - perfect triangle, matt black colour, one white/yellowish round light in each corner and two small red lights in the center, craft made audible rumbling as it passed overhead slowly - this i could rationalise - as i could see clear as day, panels, bolts, etc (no actual markings/writing) - using basic logic, i determined it to be terrestrial as i reasoned that if an extraterrestrial craft came, they would be advanced enough not to be using nuts and bolts - aka my reasoning it to be terrestrial - the event in november last year however, i cannot explain.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":34908,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":53.4217564,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-01172012-0007","longitude":-2.5370118,"occurred":1321672200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":null,"reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1326841573000,"summary":"6-7 aerial vehicles flew very quickly over head","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/34908_submitter_file1__mine1.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/34908_submitter_file2__mine2.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"wa37pd","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":59,"locationName":"Warrington","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:16169"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed","city":"Laguna Beach","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I will be so exited when i see an aliene","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"01:01:01","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":34907,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.595765,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01172012-0006","longitude":-117.7504031,"occurred":1325448720000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1326840691000,"summary":"Ilike to have informationufo","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"92650","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":16,"locationName":"Laguna Beach, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:16170"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Littlerock","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Im a freelance photographer and have been for 30 years now and i was going outside to take some pics of the sky about 3 months ago because it was a beautiful day but when i got to my back yard i saw something i didnt know what it was. so i started taking pics of it. i have had allot of sightings since i was very young. when i was 8 and my brother was 9 we where both walking down a country road when the whole sky turned white over us. the next thing we remember is running home as fast as we could. 2hours had passed and we where only 100 feet from our house. we never knew what happened to us that day. i also have a photo of a ufo over palmdale california as well. for some strange reason i have been drawing and writhing things down for a year now about humans and life here on earth. im going to write a book about the human code and our origins. can someone please help me understand whats going on?

lite hovering over our field. she proceeded down our driveway to about half way to our house and stopped her car and cut the engine and lights and got out to see if this light was making any noise which it wasn't and watched as it hovered towards our house. she drove to the house and came in to tell me that i needed to check out this weird light that she had seen. i went out without shoes or a coat and by that time the light had moved behind our house and looked to be about a half a mile behind the house and it was hovering behind the trees in our back yard. this evening was extremely clear with the moon being full or almost full with no clouds visable. i watched the light for a while and went in to get a coat and shoes and came back out to watch the light again which hadn't moved in about 10 to 15 minutes. i asked my wife to get my spotlight which she did and i blinked it three times at this light and the light dimmed down to where it almost disappeared and then lit back up to the original size. my wife told me not to blink the spotlight at it since it may come back and i told her i wanted it to come back so i could get a better look at it and she said she was going in the house which she did.At that time i moved farther into out back yard to try to get a better view of the light and i blinked the spotlight at the hovering light again and it dimmed down again and lit up again just as before. about this time a large dark shadow went over head which caused me to jump and sart to move towards the house and at that time my wife opened our back door and told me again not to blink my light at the light object. i told her to get her car keys so we could follow this thing to get a better look at it and to try to dertermine the distance. she didn't want to but she reluctantly got her keys and we started to follow this light and as we left our driveway her dash in her car started to make rattling noises and i jokingly told her if we were ufo freaks we would think the light was messing with her car and she stated that it hadn't made that noise before. we watched and followed this object for 4 mile and made a right turn to head in the direction of the light and we came to a red car heading in our direction, but parked on the other side of the road with a man standing behind it looking up in the sky in the direction we were coming from and i told her to stop but she wouldn't. i looked at this guy as we passed and he seemed to be zoned out with a blank look on his face and he never looked at us as we past him just kept looking up. we stopped at a stop sign about 100 yards past this guy and i got out to look back to see what he was looking at but saw only the moon and stars and the light object was still ahead of us. we watched the light for a few minutes and then the car came up behind us and we made another right turn to try to get closer to this light and this car followed us a little way and then turned off. we went around a right turn and a cayote ran across the road which she thought was a dog but i told her it was a cayote.We travel another 2.4 miles and came to another bend in the road to the right and this light object was above a two story white house with a black roof facing us.This house was in a field that looked to be at least 150 yards from us.Now this house was well lit from the bright moonlight and this light object was behind the house and to the left of it hovering just above the tree line.She stopped the car in the turn and i told her to move up just in case anyone came up behind us but she said that she could see if anyone came in the mirror.We watched the light and i got my spotlight and blinked it at the light three times and again it dimmed down but this time we must have been closer because as it dimmed down it changed into a blue white ring and i looked into the center of the ring and with the moon light shining down i saw a oval disk in the center of the ring and i asked her if she was seeing this and she said she was.At that time the ring blinked out and we couldn't see it. i said that that mother f'er blinked out and was gone and just as i finished the statment it lit up again to the far right side of the house and was at a farther distance. we followed this light for about another mile and a half to a hill top and watched the light object move over the trees towards the route 208 bridge over lake anna. my wife said she was tired and wanted to go home so we turned around and proceeded home after travel a few miles i looked out the back window of the car and the object was in the center of the rear window and joking agian i told her that this thing was following us and we went a little farther and i looked again and could still see it and i remembered thinking that i was glad we were getting close to the main road.We turned on the main road and went home without seeing the object again.As we entered our house i looked at the clock and thought it's 10 minutes to eight.My wife went upstairs and i went back to watching tv. she came down a little later and we spoke breifly about the strange sighting we had had. over the next couple of days i felt strange but didn't think alot about it.I asked a few associate that live in the area if they had seen the light objject and none had but another associate had seen this light object about a month before and four of them watched it for an hours as it slowly hovered out of sight. i checked for reports of the sighting but found none.We got busy that week and weekend but the next week i kept thinking about this object and on the night of the sighting i had asked my wife how far she thought we had followed this thing and she said about 4 miles,so on my way home january 11th i decided to run the route and check the mileage.I followed the route and and it was about 4 miles to where we saw the guy looking up in the sky behind his car and i turned right at the stop sign and past where the cayote had crossed the road and travel to the right hand bend in the road and looked to my left for the field and house but there wasn't a 150 yard field or house so i figured that it must be a little farther down the road but from there on there is no more fields on the left or any houses that looked like the one i saw that night. i travel the road twice thinking i had missed it but it's not there. i asked my wife what the house looked like and she stated that it was a large house light in color with a dark roof and i told her it wasn't there and that i wanted her to drive there with me. on sat. the 14th in the late afternoon we drove to the site and i watched as she remembered where the guy was and where the cayote was and as we approched the right hand bend she stated that this was the spot and as we came around the bend she was as shocked as i that there isn't a two story white house there, there is a small clearing with a horseshoe driveway with the main diveway in the center going back to a tree farm. there is no 150 yard field or house but she stated that the hardwood tree line was the same. where we saw the field is full on 20 to 25 ft pine trees that cover about 150 yards to the hardwood tree line.I asked her what she thought and she stated that that was very strange.We headed home and i asked her about the sighting which we hadn't discussed in detail before which now seems strange since it was so unusal.I asked her if she remembered me asking her if she was see this and she said yes and i asked what she saw and she said she saw a blue light as the bright light dimmed down. i asked her if she had seen the oval metalic craft in the center of the ring and she said no, but she stated that she had told me to get back in the car and i told her i hadn't gotten out of the car and she said that when she told me to get back in the car i told her that i was trying to get out of the light. as she said this i remembered standing in front of her car facing her headlights and trying to block the lite with my arm. i had no memory of this until she made the statement.We both saw the house and field that night as well as the light object but we have no explaination as to why it's not there now. if this isn't our military equipment then it's from somewhere else. i did finally find another report of the light object that the reporter said turned into a donut shape on january 6th which was three nights after our sighting.On two trips to this sight while trying to remember everything about the sighting i have gotten a dull headache which takes about 15 minutes to go away. maybe the other reporter of this sighting is having the same issue.I'm like everyone else i've read reports like this and though they were interesting i wasn't 100% believing in them. but after having this experience i can understand how it sounds so unreal and why the facts don't relate totally to their experience. whatever this thing was had the ability to alter our perception of reality and to cloud our memory of the event. i focused that night to remember all the details as possible as we were viewing this sighting but it still had the power to fool us into see a field and house that aren't there.This is the truth as we saw it and we can't explain it!
