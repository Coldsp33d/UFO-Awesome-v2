power plant. one night while watching tv, i got up to get something to drink and noticed a really bright light outside in the backyard. we had a sliding glass door that lead out back. i opened the door and went out to find out where the light was coming from. outside to my left i saw a bright yellow/orange beam of light shining to the ground. i looked up to see where it was coming from and could not see to the top and i did not hear any sound from it. at this point i felt a sense of fear and went back inside. my girlfriend at that time worked at the power plant as a security guard. the next morning she came home and asked me to guess what she and others had seen at the power plant. she was shocked when i replied, a ufo. then i told her what i had seen. the next day when her son and daughter came home after staying in battle creek for the weekend. i told them what i seen and they did,nt believe me, so i took them to the bottom of the hill and to the left where the bottom of the light was shining. when we got there, we noticed that the weeds that were around 4ft high were laid flat in about a 12ft.Round area. not burned, just laid flat. on the way back to the house i noticed there were two small steams between the house and the highway. the one closest to the house had what looked like gas on top of the water, and the one closest to the highway was clear. the strangest thing living there were our neighbors. they had two small children ages from three to five. the walls between our duplexes were thin, and in the year we lived there we never heard the children, laugh or cry or anything. i never spoke to the man, but i did speak to the woman on one occasion. she seemed very pleasant and nice, but at the same time had air about her that seemed very distant and cold. kind of what it would feel like talking to an android, and no i don't think she was an android, but the feeling was so strange and i have never forgot it.                                                               if you are wondering why i am writing about this now, i was talking with a friend the other day and the subject came up and my friend said i should contact mufon so i did. this sighting was also reported in the local news papers and other witnesses that worked at the cook nuclear power plant. \r\n","distance":"101-500

on a clear dark night. we were a few miles from the small town of waller, which is about 20 miles from houston.\r\n\r\ni was driving and there were almost no other cars on the road. my mother said, \"what is that?\" and i looked out her window to see a boomerang formation of large white glowing lights. it looked unlike anything i'd ever seen. i turned the rearview mirror up so there would be no possible reflections on it and asked her to lower her window for an unobstructed view. she did that and they were still there.\r\n\r\ni slowed down and, as we watched, the long arm of the boomerang (5 spherical lights) would lose one light as the short arm gained one light--simultaneously. i found this very odd and this action was repeated at least three times with a period of stability (about 30 sec. to several minutes )in between these changes. all the lights glowed steadily, were pure white, had somewhat fuzzy edges, and made no sound whatsoever.\r\n\r\nthe boomerang configuration continued at a steady unwavering path across the sky, with periodic formation changes as described above, until suddenly all lights took off high into the sky in a nw direction. the boomerang shape was constant as they shot off silently and super fast.\r\n\r\nas far as i know, i removed all variables or complicating factors regarding clear vision of the lights without any reflections on glass, mirrors, metal in the car or even eyeglasses. i did suggest that we stop along the road to watch more intently but my mother was terrified and begged me not to do it, so i didn't. i was in my early twenties and my mother was in her early 50's at the time of the sighting.\r\n\r\nat the time, we regarded the lights as separate objects but, in retrospect, they could have been part of a very large craft. if so, as it banked then that might explain the loss of a light on the long arm of the v shape while the short arm gained a light at the same time. the lights were never in the form of an equilateral triangle. at no point could we see any outline of a large craft either. the space between the lights were dead black as was the sky in general. the size of the configuration was extremely large.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

and my witness who also seen everything that i saw were in a park where it was already turning night time still a lil bit of light far out i was looking towards the nearest hospital from the view we were at and suddenly i saw a object jus jump up from some where near the hospital and then stay up in tha sky so i thought it was a helicopter but then i notice a light that was spinning around the belly of the object and then drop back down and within 1-2 mins appear flying out not too far from where i seen it towards the sky as if it was goin out into space. and the next one appeared near some woods near the hospital and was heading towards the other object but this one didnt  have a light it looked like an outline of a car(best description)without the wheels jus like the 1st one. now seeing the first one i told my witness do u see that at first he didnt see but once it was flying away he saw it . so now about 10 after witnessing the 2 objects i noticed to my far left side that more lighting were apearring now these lightings appearred in a form like a triangle there were 6 of them. once they came into a closer view than tha other 2 i told my witness\" do you see that?! are you seening what im seening?! are we really seeing this with our eyes?! now remember we are in a park and its outside in an suburban area where its really quite at night. so once they came into closer view i shouted out f-you ufos and was giving it the middle fingers and suddenly the first odject turned its lights down to me now i know its gonna sound a bit werid but thats what happened. ask your self when has something in the sky at night ever put its lights at you. and immediately i was in shock because that lights appear right as i was yelling. me and while this was happening they didnt make a sound the distance between me and then object i would saw would be like looking at a building with about 10-20 or floors my best guess now what hit me the most was that they didnt make a sound now anything thats close would make a sound but this didnt the other 5 objects just followed it. i pulled out my phone n tired to take a shot for evidence but not appeared just a black screen not even a light or anything so i put it away it was a crap camera on it now all of these things apearred like they were going in the same direction out into space and the 6 objets were no travelling fast or anything but really slow. we watched them fly away now. as soon as they went off into the sky we headed away and were talking to each other about what we saw not 1 or 2 but 8 objects. to this day i still remember what i saw that night the experience what incredible seeing this ","distance":"21-100 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

before, but i only recently felt compelled to write about them. every time i think about it, it sends chills up and down my spine. i feel strange connection to this object; i feel as if it is always watching me.\r\n\r\nim not sure when my initial encounter with this specific object occurred, but it had to be at least two years ago.  i do recall talking to my girlfriend on the phone at night, gazing into the night sky as we converse about this and that. a flashing red, blue and white object (in that order) that seemed to me to be a peculiar star. i paid some attention to this star as i conversed with my girlfriend, when suddenly the light split in two. i watched in awe as the light that branched off from the initial light had been observing, like an act of mitosis, and it began to slowly circle the light it spawned from.  i then began to explain to my girlfriend what i had experienced, and i told her to hold on while i switched my phone to the camera mode.  during this time, the second light had vanished, but the initial light was still there! every picture i took came out very fuzzy. i then proceeded to record a video of this peculiar light, but i could not even tell that the light was flashing in the video.\r\ni went in to get my fathers video camera; it was better quality than my phone camera.  in the time it took me to get my dads recorder, the light had vanished.\r\n\r\nthe light would reappear frequently, but i have yet been able to figure out a pattern in which it appears.\r\n\r\nthe light has only split like a cell undergoing mitosis a few times after that; most of the time it just appears, hovers, then vanishes mysteriously.  the most recent time it split was january 7, 2012. once again, i was unprepared with the encounter with the familiar, peculiar flashing object in the sky.  it seemed to me that it knew when i was not looking, as that was when it would always disappear. i always feel an incredible rush of fear when this object appears; its almost as if this object the fear within me, as i did not choose to be scared, but the scared feeling consumed and overwhelmed me.  i have had some near death experiences that did not horrify me as much as this object has. \r\n\r\ni would not write this report if i did not believe every word of it was true. i consider myself to be a rational person, but this object has really confused and awed me. i hope this report is of some value to you. i will write a new report if anything else happens.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

my kitchen window to observe some strange thing's going on in a neighbour house. while watching i recognized something like an orb or a sphere appearing behind that building i was looking at. it was ascending behind that building. from my distance it was the size of a small pill, like aspirin or so. i do not now the actual distance, but i think it was more then 2 miles away. i think so, because on the opposite side of my position (in my back so to speak) we have the biggest german airport (frankfurt), and this airport is about 3 miles away, linear distance. i use to watch aircrafts landing and starting all the time and i know what they look like in the dark and in the twilight and i know their flightpaths. i also used to work over at the airport for several years, therefore i do know that my sighting was no common aircraft, nor a helicopter! \r\nso i know that there are no civilian flightpaths and i never watched an aircraft in that direction i was looking at (i am living in this appartment for about 4 years now).\r\nthe actual size of the craft was maybe the size of a smaller passenger jet, when i compare it to the aircrafts that can be watched every minute coming in over at the airport.\r\nit was at first just hovering over(behind) that appertment building, stood still for about a minute, then it slowly started moving to the west. it was glowing and sparkling in all kinds of colours. i took my binoculars to get a closer look on it. i could't see any fixed shape, it looked round to me, like a ball or a sphere. the outlines were dizzy because the lights were glowing and pulsating so bright. the pulsating and blinking had no special pattern, it blinked in the 'back', then in 'front', the top and so on in no specific order or pattern. unlike an aircraft. there were no specific position light's like on an airplane or helicopter. it was just covered in changing, flickering, blinking, pulsating lights. no trails, no sound to it. couldn't take photo of it, it was too far away.\r\nafter a couple of minutes watching, i yelled for my girlfrind who was in the bathroom. by the time she showed up, the craft was behind a tree that's right in front of our house, so we couldn't see it anymore. i was a bit dissapointed and went to the bathroom myself after a minute waiting. shortly after that my girl told me to come back because she saw it, too. it showed up again, passed the tree and dissapeared again behind a chimney of another house. unfortunatelyl i didn't have the chance to see it appearing behind the trees, i wasn't fast enough going back into the kitchen. \r\nwe went outside the house into the yard immediately to see if it is still somewhere in the skies, but it was gone. \r\nmy girl is also pretty sure that this was no common aircraft (just for your information, my girl is a non-beliver, she's very very sceptic). she was very confused and excited about it. \r\nso i will start observing this direction in the sky a little bit more now. maybe i will be lucky to see more unknown flying objects. \r\n\r\ngreetings from germany!","distance":"Over One

diamond shape hovering over the shoreline. it had dense clouds around it, as if they produced them themselves. we could see red,yellow and white lights flash in around the center, corners of the diamond shoe. them they flashed around the whole perimeter. we saw one beam of white light. then so quickly it shot out right in front of our car then right back to the shoreline. others saw this as traffic came to almost a full stop. we all drove slowly watching the object follow us. it stayed over the shoreline as we drove. as we entered sea bright it stopped, then in a blink of an eye it shot straight out over the ocean. my husband and i went to the cove restaurant. thats where we were going for dinner when we saw the ufo, i have no doubt that was what it was. neither does my husband. when we got to the restaurant, our friend was the manager. that night her bartender didnt show up and she was stuck filling in. so we ended up having dinner at the bar. as we told her what we has just seen. people started coming in, it was fairly quite that night. a family of 5 and a single woman overheard our recount of the story and both of them ( the family and the single woman) both said they saw it also. they defiantly did because the little girl said she saw it shoot over the road and the shoot back over the shoreline. she said she saw it stop for a second in front of a silver car. we where driving a silver bmw. she didnt hear me tell michelle, the manager that part. she came in after i had told michelle that part.This is my third experience with ufos. after my first experience when i was 22. im 44 now. i would wake in the middle of the night at the same time for months. thats a whole other story. but that one is hard to repeat as most think im nuts. all i can say is, there is no way you can pull out of the holland tunnel and end up at exit 145 on the garden state parkway. you should exit into hoboken and then get onto the nj turnpike. two hour had gone by when we realized we where on the parkway. i would \r\nike to add that since my first encounter, i have had some odd health issues and visions. like i said, its hard to talk about. people think i am nuts. oh,

having a fire outside. i kept having a feeling like i was being watched or something strange was going on. i walked out from the backyard out to the road to get away from the fire light and to look around. i went back to the fire to get my girlfriend and took her out to the road to see what she thought and she felt like someone was watching her as well.  we noticed a star/planet that was extra bright.  i jokingly pointed up at it and said,\" look there they are!\"  that second there was a flash or something behind me that immediately made me turn around. when i did i saw a very large triangle craft that was \"see through.\" you could see stars behind it as it moved. seeing the stars through it as it moved was kind of like looking at a fish in a stream, when the craft passed the stars they kind of jumped positions like refraction was taking place. the three points of the triangle were leaving a bluegreen trail behind them. this light illuminated the edges of the craft. the front two edges of the craft were also making the air glow but not like the 3 points which were leaving a long trail. the craft was silent and moving very slow. then all of a sudden the craft moved very fast in the direction it was heading.  the apparent size of the bluegreen trails that is was leaving behind was only a few inches, however when the craft \"took off\" the bluegreen trails stretched across the sky almost to the horizon. the two lines coming off of the the \"wing tips\" were converging as it got farther away and looked smaller and smaller, but they never met/came together. all of a sudden it stopped or disappeared. it could have just stopped and i would not be able to see it as it was \"see through.\" when it \"took off\" it looked just like it does on the movies when a ship goes \"warp speed\" or whatever. the trails it was leaving instantly stretched across the sky. next my attention was drawn to what my girlfriend was looking at which was what looked like a star moving very fast across the sky.  then while it was traveling in a straight direction(about 90 degrees from the path of the triangle)it moved in like a semi circle and continued in the same direction it was heading, as if it was going around something in its path. very strange to see something move like that.  it looked like it had no inertia, traveling the same speed as it made the turn as it did when it was going straight. it was a very fluid motion. then it traveled about the same distance i saw it travel up to when it made the turn and it \"went out.\" it was no longer glowing at least. i then asked my girlfriend if she saw the triangle n she said she was watching the second object i saw the whole time. i then exclaimed \"no ones going to believe us! that was crazy!\" i told her about the triangle craft in detail and asked what she saw. i was in disbelief and was excited to have seen such a huge craft. the triangle was probably wider than a dozen 747s!  we kept watching the sky the whole night but only saw airplanes with strobe lights. fourteen of them to be exact. they kept flying all over the sky the rest of the night. fourteen planes traversing the sky.  when it became light out the sun revealed chemtrails all over the sky! i dont know if you believe in chem trails but when i was young planes did not leave lines across the sky behind them like they do now. if they did then there wouldnt be any point to sky writing because all planes would leave trails behind them. well anyhow i had never ever seen so many \"chemtrails\" in the sky before or since. they were dozens and dozens and dozens of them. it looked like a hundreds of rockets were launched in all different directions. i can find out an exact date for this as well as the address it

 i have liver disease.  six years ago i had a dozen orbs bring me back from the brink of death.  they performed an operation on my liver that involved the use of magnetism.  they magnetically drew toxins, or maybe even scar tissue from my liver.  i saw them with my naked eye.  my liver was shutting down, and i have my medical file that reflects a 180 degree turn in my health.  my liver enzymes were going off the chart, and returned into the normal zone, after my encounter.  again, i have my medical file that reflects a miracle which any doctor in the world will tell you would be impossible without treatment.  it ultimately reveals an instance of divine intervention.  it is documented.  i cannot fake blood-work.\r\n  three years ago, while working on a manuscript recounting my orb experience, my daughters bought brand new digital cameras.  having seen orb videos on youtube, with some claiming to see faces in the orbs themselves, i sent my daughters on an \"orb hunt\".  they simply shot photos of empty rooms in our home, as well as their school, and even a local street church called \"the gathering place\", in regina.  \r\n  i have several photos that are definitely communication from these entities.  one in particular is the holy grail.  and, i do not mean \"the holy grail of ufo photos\".  i mean much, much more than that.  it is a message that i have taken over three years to decipher, as it is so encoded with communication!  it is a photographic representation of the nature of reality.  it is not just \"a\" message from god.  it is \"the\" message from god.\r\n  i have determined that these entities act as our guardians. they work for god.  some call them guardian angels.  regardless, the communication that i have discovered encoded into this photo pass three truths that prove that they are of divine origin:  \r\ntruth #1:  the communication is made in symbolism, therefore they are in a universal language.  \r\ntruth #2:  the symbolic images found within the orbs themselves are too detailed for a human being to make.  they are multidimensional.  they communicate their message when upside-down or spun onto their sides.  as an artist myself, i do realize that no one could ever design an image to the degree of complexity displayed in these orbs.\r\ntruth #3:  because the encoded images in the orbs are multidimensional, they cannot be altered. if you alter one hair in one image, you ruin another image when the picture is inverted, or tipped on its side.  this is a very, very important aspect to this communication.  it is a message that simply defies corruption.  it will never change over the course of history.  it is perfect.\r\n  heres what happened.  my eldest daughter was taking some random shots in our home, and she was about take one in my living room, but i wanted to get out of the shot.  i was drinking a tea, and i put my cup down and stood next to her while she took the photo.  there were so many orbs in this particular shot, that i simply chalked it up to dust.  i studied other photos in depth, before studying this shot, as i felt it was defective.  \r\n  i thought the other photos blew my mind.  but, when i finally got around to deciphering the \"holy grail\", it was then that i truly \"lost it\"!  the very first photo i studied was basic.  it seemed to depict an angel.  it was blurry, but it was definitely visible.  in hindsight, i realize that i was being \"guided\" through the process by an unknown force.  the images seemed to get more complex as i studied them.  it was like i went from reading a \"dick and jane\" picture book to a stephen hawking scientific journal. \r\n  here is a simple example of symbolism encoded into the setting of the photo itself: the living room cna be spliced perfectly down the center.  the left side symbolizes the \"physical realm\".  the right side represents the \"spiritual realm\".  the left side is predominantly blue and green.  \"blue and green should never be seen.\" it is a symbolic reference to being incarnated into the physical world.  nearly all the orbs in the photo (except one, for another symbolic reason) are located on the right side of the image.  this reflects the message that the orbs are \"positive entities\".  they only do positive actions.  they do not do anything negative.  they work for the \"good\".  the symbolic imagery gets deeper and deeper.  there is a stereo speaker in the shot on the right side of the photo.  this speaker is \"speaking\".  it is where the two brightest orbs appear, and these two orbs are overflowing with symbolic imagery.  however, the speaker has imagery in the form of vapor (ectoplasm perhaps?), that actually depicts an image of christ carrying a baby.  this same image is reflected in a hubble telescope photo of the \"cone nebula\".  it is unnerving, until you understand my interpretation.  it is divine communication that we must take seriously.\r\n  i have determined that my daughter and i must have been guided to create this image, as even the living room itself is rife with encoded meaning.  we did not stage this shot.  it was a random occurrence.  it reinforces the concept that there is no such thing as coincidence.  you will see that the image reflects an intelligent design that could not have been staged.  even if i had staged the setting, i certainly did not digitally alter the image by adding the orbs.  they chose to appear at that precise moment to capture that precise image for their very precise message!\r\n  if a picture is worth a thousand words, and a symbol is worth a thousand pictures, then this one digital image has greater communication than the bible.  i use that comparison, because if im correct (and i am), this image will replace the bible.  i will send the original holy grail (copyrighted), along with some other copyrighted orb photos that add weight to my theory. i simply cannot give you enough information at this time that speaks any better than the images themselves.\r\n  i would love to be interviewed at length.  my evidence defies criticism.\r\nno one could fake this photo.  no one!","distance":"20 Feet or
