(i later confirmed the altitude, by measuring the focus of my binoculars to a duck blind down my river, approximately 550 to 600 feet. the duck blind was in focus and i had not adjusted my scope since the incident.  \r\nas mentioned before we could hear liners far south barely visible.  this object in the 4 minutes of transit was absolutely quiet. almost eerily so, that we did not discern even the road traffic ourselves or in recording.  as it approached i saw a triangular black craft kinda like a stealth bomber, wings from nose but straight across tail from wing tip to wingtip (triangular).  its lights were ridiculously bright but did not seem to emit light (hard to describe)  as it was directly above us we could see its belly.  my wife plain sight and myself still with binocs. the craft was moving no more than 30 km's per hour. and suddenly we both could see (as i had to drop the binocs because of brightness) the entire craft except its very tips with the lights. transformed into the whitest and most perfectly spherical ball of white light, it was perfectly round and whitish blue, and only the tips of the craft were protruding. despite the blinding whiteness of this orb, strangely, the colored lights were also very noticeable.  the bright sphere went out.  and the craft flashed three pink lights nose to tail (down the center) and then instantly two lights inside the colored lights of the wings but out from center of the rear light that flashed in the 3 sequence.  and then it carried on, to the east. and stopping about a half mile from me, as it went over the rise to see the town of cornwall.  it seemed to consciously skirt the town and just do the circumfrence and come back.  we watched this cycle 3 times and then it went north and we never saw it again.  total time within 1000 feet was about 5 minutes.  beyond 1000 feet about an hour.  we have video from a crappy iphone.  but wouldnt you know, it only recorded when the thing was beyond a quarter mile, but did record sound and grey screen the entire time it was over us.  you can hear us discuss its soundlessness, the fact we can hear further objects, but for video only grey screen.  id be interested

something significant and needs to be shared. it was about 12:15am at my mom's house in may of 2010. me being the night owl that i am was up reading and then went out in the backyard to have a cigarette. my mom's backyard had a kid's playset/treehouse from the previous owners that was made of a wood base with plastic climbing \"rocks\" to get up into the treehouse. it overlooked a nice sized pond which the rock steps were facing where i loved to sit on at night and gaze out at the sky. it was a beautiful clear night with bright stars, no breeze, no clouds and just the right temperature to enjoy myself in. so there i was in deep thought enjoying by now my second cigarette. i was about halfway through with it and had been sitting there for about 10 minutes now when for no reason known to me, i took my eyes off of the sky and looked over at my neighbor's tall, bushy tree. about 2 seconds after focusing my attention on the tree, a floating, cloaked being emerged. it was completely black with a hood and it covered everything from it's arms to it's feet. it's body was just like a human from what i could see (imagine a person in a grim reaper costume floating in the air). i was watching it from a side angle so i never saw a face, and also couldn't see a hand, or foot; it was fully cloaked. i would guess it to be 5.5 ft., but it's hard to say since i was watching it from the ground and it was in the air. it moved from the tree at a steady rate of maybe 2mph and kept the same height as the mid-length of the tree which it came from until it neared the edge of the pond; there, it descended while maintaining the same speed until it was about 15 feet above the pond and about 50 feet from the edge. there it stopped movement, pixelated away and was gone. i say pixelated because it didn't just disappear. it was like the pixels on a tv set one by one going away so that i could still see it gradually disappearing. and that was it. i sat there for a few seconds kind of in awe but i didn't have a lot of emotion. i had the same blank feeling as i watched it too. i wasn't scared, i wasn't excited either. i just watched it without any thought. i got up, threw down my cigarette, went inside and called my boyfriend. he got pretty excited as i told him and asked all sorts of questions. it wasn't until then i got a little frightened being the only one awake in the house. i stayed on the phone for a while and wouldn't go back outside that night and for a couple of weeks afterwards (unless someone was with me). i haven't seen it since.\r\n the strange thing i have to add here is that when i was in 9th grade living in nc, i went through a nerve-wrecking experience that continued for about 30 days where there was something in my room at night (maybe 12 out of the 30 days) when i'd go to bed. my room was upstairs and like it's own suite with a full bed, bath, living area, workout room, etc. that i had all to myself. it had 4 skylights, 2 in each main room. soon after turning out the lights, there would be a hooded being exactly like the one i'm mentioning now that would settle around the corner of my bedroom. so, i couldn't see it directly, but i knew it's precise location, movement, and figure (a black, cloaked being) as if i could see through the wall but i wasn't \"looking\" through the wall...It's hard to explain. it knew i knew it was there too. it seemed to communicate telepathically but it wouldn't let me know what it was thinking and it knew that i knew that, if that makes any sense. it seemed to just be observing me. i would get so frightened after a few minutes that i would \"fly\" out of bed and down the stairs. i'd wake my parents often but they could only try to comfort me and say it's my imagination and i spent many nights sleeping on the living room couch. that month or so effected my sleep to a point that i missed some school from being too tired resulting in my parents' concern for my well-being. they took me in to talk to a therapist. the therapist diagnosed me with depression and said my experiences were hallucinations due to lack of sleep...That was bologna...The sightings came before the lack of sleep! but being a doctor straight from the books there was no convincing her otherwise and she put me on an antidepressant only to find that it induced depression (never before had i ever experienced depression) so i stopped taking the meds and regained my former healthy mind. ten years later one can only wonder, due to the similarities, that these two incidences are in some way connected.

years eve, around 8pm, i was in the back yard operating the grill. the location overlooks the front side of the resort, it was overcast and visibility was poor (less than 2 miles) and it was precipitating (mixed conditions) lightly. \r\n\r\nthe mountain was within view and i had just observed the test-fire for the fireworks display.  approximately 10 minutes later i had noticed a dimly lit orb slowly moving west to east, it was partly abstracted by trees.  i knew it was not an airplane due to the terrain and weather conditions... despite the direction it came from, i had assumed it was a lantern at this point and tended to the grill.   \r\n\r\nabout 30 seconds later i had turned around to see if it was still there... it was.  at this point it was hovering approximately 5-800ft above spring fling road and inferno road (or what seemed to be that area from my perspective). it seemed to gain altitude briefly, then descend perhaps 10-20 ft and again hover.  at this point it had my full attention.   \r\n\r\nit was not very exciting to be honest.   it moved west slowly, then stopped again, hovered briefly and started moving east.   at this point it appeared to move away from me and slowly faded into the weather.  the entire time the object was glowing orange (at timed it was fairly bright) and very slowly pulsated from the red wavelength through the yellow wavelength. no nav lights or anything indicative of conventional aircraft. \r\n\r\ni would estimate the size of the object to be no more then 10ft in diameter. \r\n\r\nduring the event, the object was partly obstructed by trees, as it became obscured i had to move my position slightly to regain visual.  i did this little dance till it faded into the weather. \r\n\r\nto give you an idea of the visibility that night... if you look at google maps, the address was between 163 and 331 sugarbush village rd (not sure, but i can point out the house).  from my location i could just barely see the highest point of inferno road that was possible from where i was standing... anything further was clouds/fog, cloud density was varying so visibility was not equal in all directions (typical weather in mountainous terrain)if i was flying, i would be flying ifr. \r\n\r\nno witnesses.  i didn't even tell my friends.\r\n\r\ni have seen a ufo before (when i was a kid) but this was absolutely nothing like that event. \r\n\r\nbest regards,\r\n\r\nigor fokeev\r\n\r\nps: you guys are doing a great service and i would like to thank you for all of your hard work.

and \"sparks of light\" or fire were emanating from underneath the object as it moved toward his position.\r\n\r\nthe witness' first thought was that it was an airplane in distress, and that it was going to crash into him. he slowed his vehicle down to around 50 mph. he noticed 3 or 4 other vehicles zoom past him as if in haste to leave the area. in moments, the object was rapidly approaching his truck. frightened, the witness came to a full stop and turned his engine off, at which point the object also stopped and hovered about 10 feet directly above the hood of the truck, where it remained for approximately 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nduring this time, the witness said he saw a slightly-curved row of approximately ten large lights, evenly spaced, each perhaps 24 inches in diameter. the lights were very bright and were blinking on and off in a regular pattern. the predominant colors were orange, blue, and white. the bright lights made it difficult to see the shape of the rest of the object, which was indistinct. there were no other surface characteristics and there was absolutely no sound.\r\n\r\nthe witness was extremely scared and nervous, but after the object hovered above his hood for about 30 seconds, it suddenly zoomed straight up into the sky and was gone in a second. the speed at which it moved was extremely fast.\r\n\r\nthe witness found no physical traces on his vehicle or person, and suffered no ill effects other than momentary fear. he observed no electromagnetic anomalies. there were no other witnesses.\r\n\r\nthe witness traveled this same route every work day until 1997 and never had any other sightings. he told nobody about it, except for his wife, because he was afraid of being ridiculed.
