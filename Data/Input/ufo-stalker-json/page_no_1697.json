rectangular. as i was walking along the highway, i was hit by a very strong reflection in the sky off to the south west. i had completed about 80% of the distance of the route. i could see it was about 700-800 hundred feet above the river. it was silver with a dome that had brassy portholes on it. it was about 40-50 feet in diameter. it began to slide slowly to the south. i watched it for

no, cars slow down and speed up i realized. this noise was turning street corners holding steady without slowing down nor speeding up at a very rapid speed. then it was in my neighborhood. i recognized the streets it was turning and it was coming fast towards my location. rattle rattle tap tap beep beep beep rattle whirl beep whirl beep...It turned then onto my street. this thing wasnt slowing down what so ever turning street corners. im still laying down quite frightened and my blinds are closed. my sons mom comes in from the living room and she knew the whole experience for what i had told her and she said what the heck is that? i replied, i dont know what it is but im not looking at it! she answered dont look at it! whatever you do, dont look at it! im going back in the living room! screw this! she said. i laid there, it came right outside our bedroom window. it stayed for a few minutes. i felt paralyzed. i wanted to say something to her. i felt like i needed help. i could not move my mouth. i could not move my entire body. rattle rattle tap tap whirl whirl beep beep beep...It had a hold of all my energy. as soon as i thought about the ufo i saw 5 months prior, i mean when that thought entered my mind...The thing took off...It went up every street it came down in a matter of seconds...And was gone. all that was left were dogs barking in the entire neighborhood...And i must have finally dozed off, and awoke to my alarm to go to work. i later thought maybe it was a probe or am i just crazy? but she heard it too, and so did the dogs!!

looking out the windshield first. after it moved, i had to turn my head where my chin was over my left clavicle. the object hovered for a split second. it then moved toward me covering what would seem a great distance in a matter of seconds. it banked toward the hwy crossing the river. approaching me, i hunched over the steering wheel and slowed down because it was moving fast. i saw a black triangular shaped craft. it was this shape that the red and blue lights made. it was non-reflective to any external lighting from the highway lights. the lights did not shine but were of a softy glow.  i got such a adrenalin rush to what i was seeing that tears came to my eyes. i had to tell someone. i looked around and there were no other cars or trucks around me or coming from the other direction.  i almost was as if this thing knew it. and was not afraid to show itself to me.  i lost track of it because it flew directly over my vehicle.

it was definitely not an aircraft. the vehicle was surrounded in a luminous white light, and the material of the vehicle was not easily identifiable - just looked dark silvery (could be the low light and height). it had blue and red lights showing two blue and one red. it faded into sight (the air was very clear - not a cloud or vapour in sight), and moved at a speed i'd judge as about 1,500 km/hour for a distance of approximately 75 kilometers, then faded out to nothing. my wife could not believe her eyes. i have seen other craft before over the years. this observation was too quick for me to get a camera to photograph it, so the report is only verbal. i commented earlier to my wife that the air had a peculiar vibration, but cannot say if the two were connected in any way - it was just strange that there was this vibration in the air that was quite distinct for about an hour before our sighting.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":34811,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-29.80073277928646,"location":null,"logNumber":"ZA-01122012-0012","longitude":30.904929722081768,"occurred":1326425400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"KwaZulu-Natal","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1326407927000,"summary":"Huge boomerang shape spotted just off angle of saturn - witnessed by 2","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"3629","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Westville, KwaZulu-Natal","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:16765"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Bellingham","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I live on a lake under a set of mountains just west of mt. baker south/southeast of bellingham washington reed lake/cain lake. i walked out to my porch which i frequent often, and it faces west looking over the lake up to the mountains. on the top of the mountain just at tree line were three balls of light, clearly larger then any star. being a helicopter pilot, and knowing the specific routes flying over my house i new these lights were not a plane. also i no for a fact there is no tower or structure that would be on top of the mountain there... the lights were in a triangle formation for about a minute or two. then they slowly formed a straight line with a little space in between the three. blinked three times, or pulsated three times and dissapeared...  i was left with a amazing feeling of joy and wonder. during the event i was stuck stareing at the lights, not able to break away and grab my camera which would of been the first thing i normally would of done?  after i came inside and told my girlfriend hesitantly. she could tell i felt wierd.

20 seconds. i kept watching for a while after that. but it never re-appeared. it was the most exciting expirence i've ever had except for when i was in the navy in the south china sea gulf of tonkin in 1973. that's when i saw my first ufo. i had been trained to spot all kinds of planes and i was on watch between 00:00 and 04:00. i spotted a bright white light doing a zig zag pattern then it shot across the sky zig zaged again and shot back where it had started and then shot off into space and disappeared. that's why i know what i saw was not a plane on jan. 11, 2012 ","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":34799,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.44524799939203,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01112012-0019","longitude":-82.96183008741059,"occurred":1326293520000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Sphere,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1326350744000,"summary":"I saw a star like object at first then it became a large glowing orb","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"48225","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Harper Woods, Michigan","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:16776"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Pioneer","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I had arrived home from work in the evening, i was in my driveway at approx. 6:15 p.M.,when i observed two very bright lights at very high altitude. i often see satellites in the sky because i live in a rural area with no city lights. this looked almost like that, but two large, very prominant lights. they did not blink, just traveling along, then reducing to only one light of the same size. the single light traveled for a few more seconds and vanished.I waited to hear sounds from a jet, but heard nothing. it was only seconds after it vanished that i saw what i would usually see, a satellite cruising the sky. usually i see only one satellite every few nights. this night i observed two satellites, cruising at different angles, just after seeing the odd lights. i know this couldnt have been a satellite, but it was also too high to be landing beacons on a plane.  the odd lights were near where the satellites would have crossed paths.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":34798,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.4408651,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01112012-0018","longitude":-120.5648519,"occurred":1326334260000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1326348339000,"summary":"Saw 2 white lights reduce to 1 at very high altitude,then obseved 2 sats","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"95666","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Pioneer, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:16777"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82758,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1697}
