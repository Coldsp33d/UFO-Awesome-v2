gasoline for my car. as i was walking out of the building i glanced left towards the sky and saw something insane. in the sky there were 2 huge cigar shaped objects. they were like huge skinny rectangle objects. both had what looked like 5 flashing orange lights coming from square windows or something or the sorts. the one cigar shaped ufo was slowly turned round and round counter clockwise. the cigar shaped ufo to the right of the first one seemed to move towards the rotating ufo and then it crossed a path in front of it. now what appeared to be a black helicopter was hurrying around both of the ufos. i have no idea what it was doing? inspecting? the whole event of my witnessing this took place under 30 seconds because i ran back to the apartment to have my mother and son come out and look at the phenomenon. i was scared to death! as soon as we all came outside to look everything was gone. last week i witnessed a star light object hovering in the sky in peoria, il. is there something going on in the illinois? anyone else from illinois witness anything bizarre in the sky?","distance":"501 Feet - 1

three lights in the shape of a triangle flying in a straight path from east to west. i live right in the path of sea-tac airport, so i am well familiar with planes of all types flying overhead, at all altitudes. this was definitely not a plane. \r\n\r\ni was unable to determine whether it was one triangular shaped object with lights on all 3 points, or 3 smaller objects flying in that formation. i will say, however, that right as it was leaving my field of vision it appeared one of them was separating from the other two. there was no noise whatsoever.\r\n\r\nthe object(s) was moving far faster than any balloon or chinese lantern could, but nowhere near as fast as a meteor or shooting star. it took about 1-2 minutes to travel from directly overhead to the horizon (i lost sight of it when it went past beacon hill).\r\n\r\nlate in 2011 (i dont remember the exact date) i witnessed a smilar event, except it was moving from north to south. i am hoping others witnessed this event and let me know, first of all so i know im not crazy, and secondly because it definitely seems to me like something is going on here in seattle. i was quite jittery after seeing this, and truly wish i had been able to take a video of the event.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

a flashlight..\r\n\r\nwell one morning around 2 am i went for a walk and heard a strange hum that was not coming from any farm machine i knew off so i followed the noise..\r\nin a baseball field above where i live there was a cigar shaped ship with 2 id say 7 foot tall men with blonde hair that was braided down there backs in suites that looked like a jumpsuite after ud glue silver glitter all over it...\r\nthey where what seems like working on a small square part of the ship that was opened up like u open a car door kinda...\r\n\r\nfor about a hour i watched them many lights where bliniking all diffrent colors it seemed from what ever they where doing.But only the part of the craft they where working on so id say it was coming from inside the craft inner workings and the device they where useing looked kinda like a gluegun id say with a strange steady light coming from it.(id say working on there craft)..\r\n\r\nabout a hour later they close this spot in there ship and a walk way opened in what id say was the back of the craft and they got in it they seems to move in a more calm flow then me or you it wasent sloppy they moved in a flow with eachother step per step...\r\n\r\nshortly after the hum got louder and rocks and garbage just about anything that was around me on the ground since i was trying to hide in the bush outta fear picked up off the ground like it was vibrating or something and the hum built up into a bbboooom and it zipped off into the clouds and knocked me on my butt i mean it lifted me off my feet like some kinda sonic bbooomm and i smacked my back first off a tree and they where gone..\r\nfor the next id say week after there where helicopters going over the area at lower then id think was normal i was only a child but looking back on it doesnt seem normal.\r\n\r\nim sorry about the report before this:i was very excited to make a report about it and got ahead of my self and made a very bad account of what had happend i

moment zipped back to prior position in front of me hovered for a moment, then slowly moved south east somewhat in the direction of greater cincinnati airport (cvg) it was very odd that something could zip that fast stop and zip again without change of speed being noticed no jerkiness no swaying swerving almost as if but not a light turn on in one spot then turn on in another it was that fast, but didnt go out. in sept 2011 while my wife and i were visiting our son who is usaf aircraft mechanic, our other sons one also usaf aircraft mechanic and other son witnessed several red lights in approximately same place, but hovering over woods by our home, but started out with 2 or 3 lights then other lights joined and lined up hovered over the woods for a while then left area, i told them to call 911 non emergency so that it could be documented, she said there have been many sighting in the area, but she saidwell just call it a shooting star my usaf son told her he was in usaf and knows its not a an airplane or shooting star, she said maybe it was the satellite that was to fall, but didnt fall at that time. so she said again well just call it a shooting star. my parents seen the triangle also above their property a couple years earlier. but it had a whitish blue light in middle. and dad said he could see surface of it and it looked like riveted panels?????????It seems odd that the thing would frequent the area. any help would be greatly appreciated. and will definitely help any way i can.

'that's just a chinese lantern\" i responded.\r\n\r\nas i continued watching the light something caught the corner of my eye. i looked at whatever had captured my attention and quite clearly saw a large black disk moving on exactly the same trajectory as the orb except in front of the orb. i exclaimed to mum that the orb was not what she needed to be looking at but the large black disk preceding it. she looked but could not see what i could.\r\n\r\nthe disk and orb were moving at a steady speed and in the same direction. there was no noise emitted from either craft. the black disk was difficult to make out against the darkness of the night but was unmistakable (in case you are wondering mum had cataracts at the time so could not make out poorly defined objects e.G. black on black. she has since had the cataracts removed). mum saw the orb without problem, obviously. they both followed a straight line trajectory.\r\n\r\nas mum didn't see the disk she just seemed amazed that she had seen an orange orb. personally if i had not seen the disk i would have put it down to a chinese lantern. when i realised that a big black disk was flying across the sky i was blown away. i have always been sceptical about ufo sightings but this nailed it home as convincing evidence in my mind. as to whether it was et or a home grown version of fantastic technology i don't know. i just know that i saw what i saw and feel obligated to report it.\r\n\r\ni don't like talking about this other than with close, trusted family or friends. there is a large amount if ridicule that accompanies this subject and i do not enjoy being ridiculed.\r\n\r\nunfortunately i did not have a camera capable of filming this event. the experience probably lasted about 45 seconds to 1 minute.","distance":"501 Feet -
