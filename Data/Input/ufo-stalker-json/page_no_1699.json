(about 15 minutes)  i then went in the rv and got my binoculars.  it was then that i saw the true shape of the craft.  it was very similar to a top or diamond.  the lights seemed to be pulsating from the center of the craft.  i stood and stared at this object for about another 5 minutes or so, then i saw it drop lower on the horizon, then move to the right for about 30 seconds, then move back to the left.  after about another 20-30 seconds, it moved back to a center point between the left and right positions, and rose back up.  approximately 60 seconds after it had moved back into it's original position, i saw a quick flash in my peripheral vision.  i looked over to the north east and witnessed another craft of some type, only smaller than the first (or farther away...I don't know)  this second object was also pulsating the same colors as the first.  at this point i tried to wake my wife.  she would not get up.  i watched the two objects hover for about another 5 minutes, then i went back into the rv.  i sat in awe, trying to figure out what i had just witnessed.  i went back out side about 30 minutes later, and both craft were gone.  \r\n\r\nthe purpose of this letter to to inform you that there have been multiple sightings down here, and they are still happening, almost on a nightly basis.  some people have gotten pictures.  we have witnessed this in different directions over the past year.  sometimes to the east, sometimes to the south...This particular event was the closest i have seen...\r\n\r\nrespectfully submitted,\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":34764,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":31.9783988,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01102012-0009","longitude":-99.8999031,"occurred":1325074500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond,   Triangle,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1326235822000,"summary":"Hovered for approx 30-40 minutes then dropped and moved left to right","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":13,"locationName":"Texas","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:17153"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Bogota","country":"Colombia","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was at home when my father told me to go out beause he had seen such a beatiful huge full moon. i took my cell phone with me because i like taking photos or videos. besides my cell phone was kind of new. \r\n\r\ni wanted to take a picture of the huge moon when i saw an object moving around then i put down my cell phone to make sure that it was an object hanging on the air. so instead of taking the picture i decided to make a video which lasted about 30 seconds. \r\n\r\nps: you will see a big white light- the moon- and a smaller object - what seems to be a ufo. i'm attaching two videos  but the shortest one it's the one i'm interested the most due to the object moves rapidly.

food and then go to his home on the near south side of indianapolis. it was around 7:00 pm 1-9-12. the sky was very clear and the moon very bright. we were talking about how beautiful the full moon looked and the fact that it was hard to see the stars when in the city. we were driving north then turned west. after turning west, still talking about the way the stars look like out in the country, we noticed a bright spot a little south of direct west. it seemed to be way to high to be a light on a tower or building. we drove 12 to 14 blocks west discussing what it might be, even stopping at a red light and watching it, commenting on how it never moved. while at the stop light, a jet flying very low passed in the distance to the west of us moving from the south to the north. it was way lower than the light. the jet was close enough to make out the details of the shape. the \"light\" seemed to both of us to not cast any beam of light but to just be in the shape of a lighted upside down v. dad commented on the fact that the indianapolis airport was to our south west and it might be a helicopter but i thought it was farther west than the airport and it just stayed too still. it was so far away it just looked like a very bright star. we turned left (south) and had gone another 2 blocks when another light appeared rising straight up to almost level with the first light. it looked like the same size and brightness. we pulled into a fast food place, bought sandwiches and sat there a minute or two watching both lights just hang there. we drove home (maybe 5 minutes) with the lights to our back. when we pulled up at dad's house my car was parked facing west and we sat there for maybe 2 minutes, watching, noting that the second light had not moved. the second light then began to move and we got out of the car and stood on the street watching. the second light moved east and in a wide arc. it was still somewhat south of us but as it reached a point a little south east of us the arc got a bit tighter and it was then headed north east. it passed to the east of us and when it did we got a clearer look at it. it was still so high that we could not make out real details but it had a longish shaped body and was blunt on both ends. there were 4 yellowish, round, lighted areas on the back end stacked 2 on top of 2. there were 2 white lights on the front, about the same size as on the back, sitting side by side and the wings were boomarang shaped with a smaller light-blue light near the tip of each wing. none of the lights blinked. the wings seemed to not come out the side of the body but be on top of it. it moved very fast and there was no sound. it dissappeared into the north east within seconds. the origional light was still in the same place when i went to bed at 10:00 pm but was gone at 5:00 am when i got up for work. i don't think me or my dad were frightened in any way. we just felt puzzeled.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional

college the year before, so was 23 years old, and my husband was about 27. i was an office worker at the state capitol and he was a certified auto mechanic. \r\n\r\nwe drove from tampa fl to houston tx, taking the interstates, driving west passing thru new orleans. as we were passing thru new orleans i woke up and a few minutes later saw very bright light approaching in the western sky. husband was driving and saw it too. we speculated about what it could be, even laughing about a ufo.  we at first thought maybe there was an airport nearby. at this point we were still on the outskirts of the city and i believe there was a little air traffic, but nothing else in the sky nearly as bright as this light.  as we continued to drive west we eventually left behind any town area and continued over bayou/swamp on elevated divided hwy/bridge road. we continued to watch the bright light, as it was interesting and the drive was a long one.\r\n\r\nalthough initially we were tracking it toward our right front of our car heading west and it appeared far away as just a very bright light, as we watched it seemed to travel thru sky toward the left side of our vision, so when we finally passed it, it was on the far left (drivers side of car). (sort of like a lazy 's' curve.)\r\n\r\nwe saw that the light we had been watching appear to stall over a cypress swamp. no civilization/man-made structures/towns were nearby, nothing but swamp and water and bridge/road. the object appeared to stall or hover over the swamp above a stand of very high cypress trees. there were no power poles or other structures anywhere nearby that would confuse where it was or could be attached to. it appeared to be just floating silently, alone. we had watched the light for at least 20-30 minutes by this time, and now were considerably closer.\r\n\r\nit was a good way above the trees, probably at least 50 ft. from the roadway the ufo was perhaps 500 ft to our left, and 150 ft up. it was massive. we were struck by how large it appeared to be, like the size of a football field or 10 large houses stuck together.\r\n\r\naltho this was at night time around 2 am, the stars were very bright. the ufo appeared to be shaped like a capital \"h\" and had appendages like antennae and/or machines all over its surface, not smooth at all. we could determine its shape through the stars, as it was a very clear, still, cold, starry night with enough light to make out the shape easily. \r\n\r\nit didn't move and we drove slower and slower, finally passing it altogether. as we were now driving on an elevated roadway bridge over a swamp, there was no place to stop or pull over or even call for help. during this entire time we passed only a couple other cars heading east into new orleans but i could not tell if they saw the ufo or not. \r\n\r\nthis might sound stupid, but as it wasn't moving, nor making noise or doing anything at all but hovering, we just kept driving west, not quite knowing what else to do. it didn't seem like a good idea to just stop and get out. we were driving over the bayou, in the dark. plus, we were still on a divided road with the object hovering on the farthest side of the separate eastbound bridge to our left.  \r\n\r\nwe just kept asking each other, 'what is it?'  eventually we reached the end of the swamp area and pulled over, the ufo miles behind us.  my husband and i decided to sketch independently of each other what we each thought we saw. we both drew an 'h' shape.\r\n\r\nwhen we got to houston we spent time with family and went to see the new movie, \"close encounters of the third kind\". i recall being a little freaked when we saw something in the film that was close in shape to what we saw that night.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

looked out the window in our dining room that faced the gila mountains in the gila wilderness area, and noticed a large, very bright, strob-like light moving northward directly over the turkey creek camp ground area.  this light was different from an aircraft type strobe in that it flashed twice, then about a 1 second of no flash, then another 2 flashes, and so on for about 2 minutes, then it ceased flashing and disappeared.  at the same time i noticed other lights in the same area, i seem to remember about 6 to 8 strobing lights, 2 were bright solid lights, moving at different directions and speeds with various altitude changes.  i wondered if they might have been military aircraft, but, even with looking through binoculars, no wings, red or green nav lights, or anything else that would identify aircraft was seen.  no sound at all.  i estimate they were more than 10 miles away, and were about the size of an average star as seen with the unaided eye, with the exception of the very bright double strobing light which was approx. the size of venus, but much brighter! \r\n\r\nmost of the single strobing lights were moving in fast circles with major altitude changes.\r\n\r\ni have questioned individuals i am familiar with, but noone so far witnessed this sighting other than me.  needless to say, i was transfixed at this sight and watched for about 5 minutes when they all went out and disappeared!\r\n\r\ni have no idea as to what i saw, but they were real, and they were moving as described.  once again the turkey creek camp ground was busy, however, the time since this

and time of day as our november 10, 2011 sighting. we noticed them both days at 3:25pm in the western sky. the sun was getting lower in the sky and there were scattered clouds, though the sky was mostly sunny. the conditions were very similar to our sighting in november. two lights were at the lower cloud level and seemed to be attempting (poorly) to blend in with the clouds. one light appeared to the lower right (west) of the sun and the other was farther to the right (slightly northwest). we only saw them for a minute and then lost them and had to keep driving.\r\n   when i got to our home, about a mile away, i got out our sony handycam and caught at least one light on it at about 4:00 pm. the stationary light was in the clouds directly to the west, to the right of the setting sun. the lights were lower and bigger than the airplanes that were present before and after. i focused in on one light and it appeared almost a triangular shape with fuzzy edges and it was a glowing reddish-pink on the top point, white in the center and green on the bottom two points. the video is shaky but if you pause on it you can really see the colors.\r\n   to the naked eye, the lights were bigger than the size that stars look, closer to the size that jupiter looks right now from our area.\r\n   these lights were stationary, not airplanes, as i was also watching and comparing them to airplanes higher in the atmosphere with their contrails. there were no large planes at that level in the sky, all were much higher. there were no helicopters or small planes in the area when the lights appeared. the lights are not venus or conventional aircraft or the space station or weather balloons, as some have suggested to me. they are stationary and fairly close to the ground.\r\n   also, a dark helicopter flew by about 20 minutes after the light was filmed.\r\n   right after the events our wii froze and wouldn't turn off, has never happened before, and our cell phone wasn't responding when we wanted to play songs, which also hasn't happened before.    \r\n   at the time i was just so satisfied that i had caught one of these lights on camera. but as the week has gone on i am finding myself unnerved about what these are and what they're doing. i cannot think about anything else. i'm also extremely frustrated with the complete denial/dismissal of the general population. \r\n   my 12 year old, who spotted the lights the first time, and saw the lights both times, wants to forget that it happened and is slipping into denial. i don't blame my 12 yr old, at that age it must be hard to accept.\r\n   if you live in the area and want to check it out, watching from orchard road in oswego would give you the best view. i'm guessing they'll show up again on mostly sunny days, when there are some low, thin clouds in the western and slightly northwestern sky. so far they have all been to the right of the sun. make sure to begin watching at about 3:15 pm at about 40 degrees above the horizon, or at about the level of the sun.\r\n","distance":"Over One

heading west. the bottom of the ship was pitch black with neon white light outlining the ship.  i've seen blimps and know what they sound like this was no blimp and it was moving way to quickly to be one and made no sound.   the whole sighting lasted less than 30 seconds and it was gone.  it cleared the treetops in my backyard flew right over me and my house heading west lost sight of it when it flew over the house.  i felt kind of awestruck seeing the object, but the next day i had trouble with my equalibrium and fell in the kitchen.  not one of our dogs left the porch while the object was flying over, but when it passed they all went out in the yard.

10 larger green and white lights underneath and 3 smaller half-oval white lights in the middle of each side. the body of the craft was dark. a split second after he saw it, it descended straight down - only the full bottom of the craft visible - then swooped at the end and leveled off in less than 4 seconds. again, it fell tens of thousands of feet and leveled off at a low altitude in less than 4 seconds - easily less than 400 feet. i estimate it at 150 feet altitude or even less. unreal. \r\n\r\nat the end of the descent, as it began to swoop and level off, my friend suddenly grabbed my left arm tightly as gasped \"look!\" while pointing to the east. i expected a falling star or something. as soon as i looked up over the tree line, the first thing i saw was a fuzzy, white, cloudy...Thing... surrounded by a strange watery substance - it was like a mirage - moving closer to us. as it cleared the tree line, it became clear what it was: it was a cloaked triangle and it was creeping towards our direction at 10mph. it looked to be about 50' long along each side, but it could have been a bit bigger or smaller - it's very hard to be sure as there's no frame of reference for what we saw. this thing didn't waiver, tilt, or wobble at all - it was dead still moving only forward. although the cloaking had a somewhat wavy nature about it, it wasn't vibrating or moving either. everything about this craft was dead still except for the slow forward movement.\r\n\r\nwe had a prefect, unobstructed view of this craft for a full 5 to 7 seconds before it disappeared over the trees in the middle of my block behind my house. it was a cloaked triangle craft. there was a fuzzy, whitish, haze in the front middle and along the leading edges. i also saw some rounding in the back of the fuzzy white where it met the cloaking. it wasn't light - it was a faint white. we could completely see through the craft, but not the white fuzzy stuff. when the craft passed in front of the stars, the stars jiggled. when the craft fully passed, the stars were dead still again. i'll never forget the feeling of just how still the stars are after seeing them jiggle. wow. \r\n\r\nthe cloaked triangle had no visible lights of any kind while cloaked - at least none that we could see. we had a clear view of the bottom, the right side, and the front tip of the craft, but never had a view of the back side, the left side, or the top. although i heard no sound, my friend described it as, and these are his words, \"it sounded like it was pushing the air out of the way\". it was hovering absolutely straight and forward west-southwest at approximately 10mph. the entire event lasted around 11 seconds.\r\n\r\nafter it passed, we were left in disbelief. it was the most incredible thing we had ever witnessed - absolutely as gorgeous as it was mysterious - and it was right in front of us. not high up in the sky or off in the distance, but right there! unreal. the greatest thing i have ever seen in my life.\r\n\r\nin the year after the sighting, my friend and i spoke about it from time to time, gathering the details of the experience, and separating what we were certain of from what we merely thought we saw. everything i've included here is what we are certain of. both of our phones were inside the house when we saw this, so we were unable to get video or pics since it happened so suddenly.\r\n\r\ni also spent time during that year trying to find other reports of the same craft. i googled \"cloaked triangle\" and \"camouflaged triangle\", checked reports at mufon, and never found anything except a video of a cloaked triangle emitting a vapor trail which was suspect and definitely not what we saw.\r\n\r\nthen, the morning after the anniversary of the sighting this past week, i decided to add \"gainesville, fl\" to my search and, to my utter shock, found a report at the nuforc site from someone who saw the exact same craft in the exact same city on the exact same night as we did - jan 3, 2011 in gainesville, fl. this changed everything for me and is why i now feel it's my duty to report what we saw. the only difference was they saw it a half hour before we did. since we saw it descend, this means one of three things: either there were two crafts, or the craft they saw went back up and descended back down over my neighborhood, or they were mistaken about the time by 30 minutes or so. but the description was identical right down to it \"pushing air out of the way\". although we saw a somewhat blueish hue, we presumed it was simply colors from the night sky being refracted and left it out of this report since we weren't certain about it.\r\n\r\nwe would love to talk to that other witness and will ask nuforc to pass on our contact info if they'd like to share stories. should anyone report the same craft to mufon, they can share my email address as well. i want to know more about all of this, believe me.\r\n\r\nwe have made video and audio interviews about this and my friend made a drawing of the triangle in it's un-cloaked form 2 days after we saw it, which i now have. we'd be happy to share all of this with mufon if they are interested.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, Over 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:11","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":34734,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.6915309,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01092012-0001","longitude":-82.3264668,"occurred":1294110540000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1326105226000,"summary":"A triangle (equal with slightly rounded edges) appeared out of thin air, made an impossibly fast decent, stopped on a dime, then hovered slowly forward over the middle of my block.","tags":["triangle","light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"32601","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":370,"locationName":"Gainesville, Florida","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:17179"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Between newberg and the c","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Wife and myself off road by farm to take pictures with digital cameras. i got about ten uneventful/ordinary photos. however, 4 of them showed additional images not visible to the eyes of either myself or my wife. the images appeared to change nature, shape, color, and location -
