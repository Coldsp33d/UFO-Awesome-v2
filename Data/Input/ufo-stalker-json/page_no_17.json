and i were walking and talking in the yard. while outside i started looking straight up at the bright night sky. i made a comment that walking while looking straight up was very difficult, he laughed and i kept doing it while the conversation continued. eventually he said let's try to run while looking straight up. so we were both running in the field looking straight up at the sky telling of how our balance was failing us. at that time two objects came from different directions, 1 east and 1 west. they were almost triangular-shaped from what i could tell, at what distance i can't say. they left a white looking streak that disappeared pretty quick it look like they were going to collide. before collision they both made a 90-degree turn and, in unison, both went south.\r\n\r\nthe flight paths seemed to be straight lines and 90° turns. whatever they were both looked to be pointed and were slightly wider than their trail was. the turns were made at the exact same time. the paths went from horizon to horizon. i cannot calculate elevation or distance covered.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:03","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path

narrow country road that has some houses and a metropark along the way. a few tight turns as well, then running alongside railroad tracks and the cuyahoga river.\r\nafter the last tight turn i saw a brightly lit object in the distance off to the left slightly, right near where the metropark area would be. at first thought perhaps a helicopter.\r\nthen as i got closer, the object has slowly moved over the road and as i went to drive under it, i noticed no sound. stopped, turned down my radio and tried looking up through the windshield to see it.\r\nmy driver's window is broken, so i opened the door, stuck my head out and looked up. a brightly lit object was overhead at maybe 400-500 ft. three brilliant blue-white lights in a traingle. one corner also has a strobing reddish light. i then stepped out of the car (still running, in park) and stood there for maybe another 10-15 seconds. it was so brightly lit i could see some details of what looked like a smoothish bottom, greyish colored with some type of geometric pattern covering the surface. \r\nthe object then started to rotate in pace and slowly starter to move off the road over the woods to the right, towards the railroad tracks and then the river.\r\ni thought then i would try to get a picture. i bent down, reached into the car and grabbed my cell phone from the passenger seat. i was in the car  no more than 5 seconds, and was swiping the screen as i stood back up to get the camera on.\r\ni looked up, and the object was no where to be seen.\r\nstood there another 5 minutes or more dumbstruck. perfectly clear night sky. i just a few minutes i had seen numerous high-altitude planes flying the area as well.\r\nam pissed off that i took my eye off of it and did not see it go away. it had to either have blinked off or shot away, as it was moving very slowly when i last saw it, and should have been no more than another few hundred feet away by the time i got the camera app ready.\r\nanyways...That's what i saw last

event in the sky above lake havasu city, az;\r\n\r\ni saw an airplane approaching from the west when it was about 30% above the horizon and still some miles west of town. it was pretty high up, maybe 20k feet. it was a clear day and i noticed right away that the wing tips appeared quite bright. as it approached the city it slowly became apparent that the brightness was not because of lights on the wings or reflection of the sun off the wingtips. they were too far away from the fuselage and were brighter than any lights i've ever seen on wings. once the plane got right over town the objects were plain to see. both were plain white orbs. no more, no less. they were flying maybe the length of a wingspan away off each wingtip. i don't know what caused their brightness when looking at them from the front. it was also easy to see that the airplane was a large 4-engine military jet. as the jet passed on out of town to the east the orbs pealed off one at a time an headed south. the jet made a large left bank and headed back to the west. while the jet was parallel to town i got a better look at it and am certain it was a large 4-engine military. don't know if it was a transport or a refueler or what. definitely not a b-52. it was high enough that i couldn't hear it.\r\n\r\ni have video of the event, but my camera only captures at 720p and the jet was pretty high up.\r\n\r\nabout

was out smoking a cigarette again. lol  i just happened to be counting all the air planes that i could see in the sky, there was six to seven and then i saw this light to the west. flying north from the south and then it just blinked out. so when i saw it in the morning i was not going to miss getting these pics so i could zoom in and see what i was. it was also not making any noise. i see planes and helicopters all the time as i live in a big city. my feelings towards this object are that this was flying vary smooth and did not make one noise and to me that is not a conventional aircraft. so

[removed slang and undesirable talk to investigators section] i was on the walkway that led to the driveway. i looked up and saw two yellow goldfish orange white lights. 100feet away. as it approached 75ft, i then saw three gold lights. it kept coming toward me straight line. it was tree top low. it was lower than this massive tree right beside the trailer, the tree top didn't exist to this craft. so two lights at first, that's the flat side of equilateral. at 75ft the 3rd light came on. at this time i made out the black structure that had these lights on the bottom of it. flat black, blacker than the night sky. 40ft sides estimated. 6ft thick. straight crisp edges. it kept coming straight at me. standing on the pathway, about 20ft away from the straight side (forward side) a middle 4th light turned on. the three main lights had observable light emitting around edges. not a beam. magnificent bright light yet soft on the eyes as in if you were turned sideways it wouldn't be the same as flashlight shining as u could see on the bridge of ur nose. the fourth light was the same color and also was circular, yet smaller circumference almost by half. the three main lights were probably 4ft in diameter.  the 4th light was focused on me and i didn't break eye contact with that magnificent light. it went off after the center light went passed me about 15feet. the 3 other lights stayed the same. it was about 27-33 feet above the ground. that altitude was maintained throughout. the speed i would say was no more than 15mph, that also stayed the same throughout. at about 35 feet after it hovered over over me it turned slightly right 30degrees then continued straight. hovering at 30 feet throughout right over people's homes i wanted to scream so people would come outside to see, but i didn't. my friend then comes out and asks what was that. i pointed and he saw the craft 100 feet away and was going out of sight. i was thinking about chasing it, it's low speed would've easily follow in a car, but we just stood there in shock. there was no heat from the craft or air movement, everything was still, not the slightest gust of wind. there was a slight humm, and and even slighter buzz to it. my friend said he heard/felt that hum and felt weird. no flashes of abduction memory. i feel i was analyzed by the center light. i had the final papers for the army i was about to sign, to be an infantrymen even though scoring high on asvab. after the event i wanted no part in the military. i felt lied to. so there was a good outcome to this, it was a real eye opener. this happened to me 5 years ago. there hasn't been a single day since i haven't thought of my experience. it stays with me. i'll always remember the greys black almond eyes staring into my soul. he was 6ft, spindly, arms at side. there was a street light emitting on him, metal halide type. it was overwhelming, thus i ran. evil didn't pop up in my head. if a friend was beside me while locking eyes, i would not have ran. sometimes i regret running. but nonetheless, i didn't join the military industrial complex. please reply to any light you can shine on this encounter, i beg you. even the slightest bit of info in return will direly be appreciated. thank you for reading the pinnacle pivot point of my life, i will forever remember. thank you for your time. the world is dark, and i'm scared.

have decided to share with mufon an experience i had many years ago.  i have not been ashamed or afraid to share this story, and have in fact spoken of it with many family members and friends over the years.  now that i frequently watch hangar 1, i wish to share it with you.  i realize that there is likely no where to go as far as an investigative effort into this incident due to the lapse of time and with no proof other than my story.\r\n\r\none summer night in the early 1980s, i was returning to my home in the small central alberta town where i then lived.  it was near midnight.  before i entered my house, i paused on the doorstep and looked straight up into the clear moonless sky.\r\n\r\nin awe of the brilliant stars i could see, within a few seconds i noticed three lights moving in triangular formation coming from the north at what i felt was a rate of speed comparable to satellites.  interestingly enough, there is a segment in the opening credits of each hangar 1 episode where three lights cross the sky that remind me of what i saw.  \"my lights\", however, were hardly more than pinpricks in the inky black sky.  they appeared to be flying at an extremely high altitude also not unlike satellites.  believing it was a satellite or a trio of satellites, i was not particularly affected by what i saw.  i refer to a \"trio of satellites\" as there was no obvious evidence of the lights being separate crafts or all part of one vehicle.\r\n\r\nwhen the lights were almost directly above me, the display upped its ante.  without altering formation, all three lights came to an abrupt halt.  there was no period of slowing down; the forward progress of the -- whatever they were -- stopped on the proverbial dime.  the lights remained stationary for a short time, probably less than five seconds.  then at a much higher rate of speed than they were travelling previously, perhaps as much as ten times faster, the lights moved and disappeared from view.  again there was no period of acceleration:  0 to 100, as it were, in less than a second.  however, they did not travel together in a triangle as they had done when i first saw them.  two of the lights raced off side by side in the same southerly direction.  the third went alone in an easterly direction.  all three were gone from my sight in an unbelievably brief time frame.\r\n\r\nit was only when the lights hovered and then raced away so quickly that i started thinking i was seeing ufos.  at no time, then or since, have i felt threatened or targeted.  this lack of fear was probably because of what i perceived to be such a great distance between them and me.  i did not suffer any trauma, illness, or disadvantageous long-term effects.\r\n\r\nto the best of my memory, i have always believed that we are not alone in this enormous universe.  following that incident about four decades ago, i am more convinced of this.  after this sighting, i entered my home and prepared for bed, devoid of any unease.  to be sure, i reflected on what i had just witnessed.  then and since.  i do not feel as though my life has been affected adversely by the events of that night so long ago.  nor do i feel that my life would be disturbed if i were to see the same thing tonight.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line

was at a small house where i lived in ashfield township, ontario, canada.  it was around 8 or so at night and i was letting my brothers dog out for a pee.  i opened the sliding door that was off my bedroom and that lead to the backyard and the farm fields.  as i was waiting for bubba at the door i noticed how bright the moon was and how odd it was that there was 3 planes in the sky.  in that area air traffic is rare... so 3 planes at one time  was odd to me.  i remember watching the planes going in either direction and that's when i noticed lights flashing out the corner of my eyes.  i looked to my right to see this thing in the sky above the two apple trees in our back yard.  the flashing lights were in fact the band on lights that ran through the center of what appeared to be some sort of craft.  there was red and white lights moving round and round the center.  the craft appeared to be dark or black and like a disk with a bumped up middle. i was shocked and calling out for the dog, soon after what was there vanished right in front of my eyes.  it was there then gone in a flash.  i remember watching the trees and saw it how they moved with the wind and how in contrast this craft moved not at all.  it was silent and still.  i ended up getting the dog inside and shortly after a black helicopter and two silver planes flew above.  i went inside. it's taken me about to report this for a few reasons.  2017 was a very dark and sad year if loss for me.  since i have decided to do this the director of training, ryan stacey had been a great help and i am grateful.\r\ntwo weeks after this event i saw orange orbs in the farm fields behind the house. maybe about ten of them.  they dashed around the fields and in the trees but i didn't hang around long enough to see for how long.  i closed up the curtains and stayed inside.\r\non december 9th i had an experience with what i call the reptilian man, it was a 4 day fiasco of which i am sure. i woke paralyzed from the head down in my bedroom and yet could tell i was being moved on my bed.  i reluctantly turn my head from left to up and my eyes looked directly into the eyes of a snake man.  he was populating with me.  i couldn't speak and didn't want to even deal with it or it being a possible dream.  it was not hurting me but i am certain he or it wanted me to see the act.  there was no emotions and no expressions the act was militabt. it was an intrusive act and rape quite frankly that was not violent or unpleasant, i felt nothing. i told myself i would deal with it in the morning and what back to sleep.  when i woke in the morning i was freaking out.\r\nnow i want to know, why would it even have done that?  i am rh o neg and have two wombs... having children for me is nearly impossible not short of a miracle.  i thought reptiles didn't procreate for any other reason than breeding? since this all happened between nov and dec. my life changed.  i moved to niagara to care for my dying mother and since have left to western canada.  i worry now about many things.  i still am having issues with the idea that these beings can invade your home and head space and there is nothing we can do about it. now i wonder if the beings and ghosts and experiences i have had my entire life are related and worrying that the idea of abductions are now reality! maybe they were always a reality

me?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":90764,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.9288388,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-03142018-0008","longitude":-81.6994392,"occurred":1478649600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1521051799000,"summary":"I
