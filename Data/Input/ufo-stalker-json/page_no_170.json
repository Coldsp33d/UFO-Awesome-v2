initially did not agree, but by definition it was something no one could identify (ufo). i kept looking at the photos and yesterday finally went to local tv station to rule out a meteorological event. the weatherman busy, so sent email with photos. i had to first bluetooth photos from phone to ipad, then sent them. i then looked at the photos again and saw 4 black objects above (3 close togegher and the other a little to left) the crescent shaped moon on the bigger screen of ipad. the weatherman responded with description of whole cloud formation, rather than commenting on specific details asked about. i did not see red/green lights like a net and the object seemed to have a shape/form around what could be called the crescent shaped light. it had black dots, less visible transluscent dots and maybe even some whit dots on other side. idk what it is, but look at pictures. again, the first picture taken with normal lens and contains: crescent shaped thing that is lit up with 4 kther objects above it; the other 2 taken with zoom lens and shows from withi, the light. i only took 3 pictures, all at 832pm, as we had to escort clients back to unit, but am very intrigued by what i did

and i always look up in the sky to observe the stars, when, in the corner of my eye, i saw a big flashing light.\r\n3.) my first thought was, it was an airplane, after a closer look i thought it was an satellite.\r\n4.) like stated before, i came to the conclusion it must have been an satellite, but then it did things, no airplane and no satellite are doing. now, i am familiar with airplanes and i also witnessed countless satellites, but this object did weird things.\r\n\r\n5.) first i began to notice that it can't be an satellite, it was way to slow, i mean, really slow. then there was one pulsating light that came up randomly, not like on airplanes. after the pulsating light turned dark it took 10-15 seconds and one bright flash appeared and this also not regularly.. i was observing this object for around 30 minutes, when i first saw it, it came from the north , heading north east but a plane or an satellite would have taken 1-2 minutes to be out of sight, not this thing. it was far up in the sky and the sky was/is clear.. no clouds.. the object was hardly to see and i could only spot it when the pulsating light came on or after a flash, it also moved in circles, meaning no straight path. it is so hard to explain what it did.\r\n\r\n6.) my actions during the sighting ? i sat down on the ground, my dog next to me and i just looked up to the sky to see what this is all about, i have never witnessed anything like this before, my heart was pounding. trying to explain it and you simply can't. conventional aircraft? i don't think so, satellite? definitely not. we have airplanes / helicopters over this area every day, i know the flight path and like i said before, in nighttime i often look up to the sky and follow satellites.. i am 100% convinced that it was none of those and i hope somebody else in north california witnessed the same thing.   \r\n \r\n7.) it stopped... that's how i lost sight.. there was no pulsating / flashing anymore.. after observing it for around 30 minutes it suddenly stopped. i changed my position to get a larger view of the night sky and i knew where the object must have been, but nothing happened anymore.. i waited another 5 minutes and decided to go home and fill out this report.","distance":"N/A","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path

1975. i was a passenger in a vehicle  with 3 other people. approximately 35 miles from home on interstate 90 from the top of 4th of july pass i spotted a bright light high on the eastern horizon and joking with the others i said \"i think we have a ufo\" when we had proceeded another some distance i noted the light lower and brighter. we reached the cataldo flats and all hell broke loose. we pulled the car off the road, the driver and myself got out and stood on the road shoulder in disbelief. we watched the craft fly down our valley, descend and hover over the old mission state park. when it stopped to hover there was no sound and the disc glowed gold and eminated a surrounding glow. it showed opaque window gallery and i could see shadowy forms behind the windows, i definitely felt like they knew we were there watching. the disc then eminated a blueish beam over the river, this led me to believe the craft was taking on water. while watching i judged the vehicle to be over 100' in circumference and 30 to 50' in height, all gold with the bottom showing brighter and the top a duller gold. it was appropriately 30 to 50' above the ground. when the disc was done , it silently started moving in a westerly direction following the coeur d' alene river. it then started gaining altitude  then took off at an extremely high rate of speed. the other two occupants of the car were female and remained in said vehicle but were able to observe the whole scene. i am one of the few people who has been lucky enough to have witnessed two sightings in my life so far. as a boy in great falls montana i observed ufo's over the air force base there. but this was so close i could almost taste it. i have always wanted to be hypnotized  or take a polygraph. i know ufo's are

yet, no military aircraft seemed aware of its presence over an armored division's assembly area preparing to invade iraq.\r\ni did not report it, then, because i knew i would be discounted and possibly removed from duty.  plus, i felt the ufo did not pose a threat to us.  also, i held an important job in a 5,000 man armored brigade that held half of the armored division's m1a1 tanks (150+).  so, i give you this information to assure you that i know ufos exist and that i am not a nut case.  i have creditability in identifying us forces aircraft. btw, on a lighter note, the a-10, my favorite close air support aircraft, sounds just like a star wars x-wing fighter.\r\n*\r\nfuture uso/ufo event:  i have been told, by an information source that while very reliable, cannot be revealed to you, at this time. yeah, i know, it sounds cryptic; but, i fully believe what i have been told.  the august 21st total solar eclipse is the signal for alien forces, using unidentified submerged objects (usos) assembled in the deep trenches of the atlantic & pacific oceans, to launch a seaborne assault across the west coast beaches and the gulf of mexico beaches of the usa.  i have surmised that their purpose is to conduct a country-wide (if not a world-wide) raid to instill fear of aliens in humans; and, to prove, once and for all, that aliens exist.  this attack will create a worldwide financial collapse and force all nations to work together to fight the alien threat.  a \"raid\" is not meant to occupy ground for a long time.  it has a very limited objective that can be accomplished with limited forces.  this allows you to spread your forces over broader areas of your enemy and therein confuse them, to test their communications and reactions.  a raid could be considered a probing action.  especially since the attacking aliens will not be able to gain overall air supremacy, just localized.  once social-media has spread videos of their attacks, the whole world will know that aliens exist and they pose a serious threat to mankind.  after that, everything else falls into place, as a normal human response to an unknown fear.   this ain't gonna be like \"when the earth stood still\" nor \"independence day\".  these simultaneous attacks (raids) are solely meant to terrorize us, therein, forcing humans to seek a unified approach to dealing with an alien threat.\r\ni've also been told that the alien raiders will penetrate california as far as i-5, thus cutting off any lateral movement of us armed forces.  plus, they will pick specific locations that will preclude the employment of any mass aerial bombing for fear of killing people hold-up in their high-rise apartments and condos.  plus, they come by sea because they can easily travel undetected, by our submarines and sonar; as opposed by air - where we have early warning.\r\nthe alien raiders operate with independent squads of 8 with a squad leader and assistant squad leader.  while they possess projectile/directed energy weapons, they prefer using edged weapons for the fear effect and to boost their own bravado.  this allows them a blitz krieg style of attack that disorients our reaction forces and makes them appear to be everywhere.\r\nwhile i do not know for sure if their forces will remain in place for a set amount of time, or if their forces will die in place, causing us to root them out.  i suspect this will be a hit and run, to test our forces reaction and communications; which, allows them to pinpoint our command and control structure for future attacks.\r\ntheir using the eclipse because it's the best way to coordinate an attack without exposing their internal communications abilities.\r\ni also believe their attack will be staggered; based upon the eclipse's shadow.  this means they'll attack the west coast first to suck in our forces in the west then they'll hit the gulf coast.  oh and btw, high tide in the gulf of mexico coincides with the eclipse.  high tide allows a seaborne attack the ability to get as close as possible with deeper water to minimize discovery and allow forces to more quickly close with its enemy.\r\n*\r\nconclusion:  so, i'm taking a big gamble here that i can trust mufon to seriously consider what i'm saying.  i'm hoping for confirmation or elaboration of what i have, so to better prepare my family & friends for a potential event more terrifying than 9/11.  i've only received this information within the past 45 days and have been confirming suspicions with other sources across the us.  i know there are friendly aliens with a huge variety of life forms.  i also believe our government is fully aware of this (i.E. dhs has held secret meetings & rehearsals, with some of their staff taking convenient 3 week vacations that extend beyond august 21st).  as to whether the government is playing along to achieve a global unification goal or if they only have a damn good hunch, like i have, i do not know.  only time will tell; but, there are too many coincidental developments.  i'm really reaching out here because i know of no other source with which to confer with experts.  but, i do know this is coming; although, i wish it was not; because, people will die from either being murdered by alien raiders or from their own panic.\r\n*\r\nbtw, your hq location is less than 5 miles from the beaches; which, places you in the combat zone; and, alien raiders will drive fast and deep to setup ambushes for reaction forces.  i suggest you close the office on august 21st; or, discount my info and see what happens - nothing, i hope.\r\n**\r\nthank you.
