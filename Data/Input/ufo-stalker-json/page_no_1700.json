country in a rural area. that night i was watching t.V. and heard a slight rumble, so i went outside on my back porch. i noticed a light to the northwest just above the tree line, behind our neighbors house. i thought it might be a helicopter with a spot light. the light began to rise and hover, coming toward me.  the object was about 100' directly over me, when i realized it wasnt anything man-made. it was about the size of a b 52 bomber. it was a boomerang shape with a huge white glowing light in the front, on the bottom was 2 triangle shaped lights, one was red and one was green. both were blinking in alternating pattern. the triangle shaped lights that were red and green were unlike any lights ive ever seen. the sound it made was a quiet rumble, unlike any engine sound ive ever heard. when it was directly over me, it hovered for about 15 seconds, which scared me to death.  i jumped under the porch in fear.  then realized i had to see more. i came back out to see it start to move over our house toward the east, i ran inside the house to wake up my wife, who was asleep and didnt get up.  i went back outside and watched it go over my inlaws house and hover over a gas well across the street.  still heading east, it disappeared over the trees.  i saw something shoot across the sky to the north and never seen it again.  when this occurred my feelings were excited and horrified. while the ufo was over me, i felt frozen, like i couldnt move a muscle. since the incident, i am still having unbelievable fears and excitement, which are undescribable. i would love to talk with anyone who has had a similar experience or has knowledge in this area.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

there was 6 of us total riding in a minivan we had rented. it was around 7pm, and we had made it across the border, and were now traveling through some small, small cities such as brenda and hope where there is very little life and activity, although i don't know exactly where we were at the time.\r\n\r\nthe sun had completely set. my sister was watching out the window while the rest of us were doing other activities in the van. my sister suddenly says she thinks she just saw a ufo. she described that she had seen a ball of orange-reddish light appear in the north-west sky, and then suddenly fade out, much like how a fire is put out. she was quite certain of what she saw and was trying to describe it as well as she could. in the middle of describing it, my brother-in-law, who is driving, suddenly says, \"you mean like that??\" and points to the sky right in front of him. my other sister, sitting in the passenger seat, then gasps, obviously seeing it as well. they described seeing two red lights side by side, seemingly attached to the same object. a second later, one red light went out, and the other one followed. they were not seen again.\r\n\r\nafter two different sightings, all of us had our eyes glued to the sky. about 5 minutes later, my brother-in-law yells that he is seeing something moving above us. all of us see a yellow-orange ball moving in a strange, but controlled fashion. it was a bright ball, that would fade out while moving sideways, and then a second later would reappear and continue this pattern about 5 or 6 times, all the while moving in the same direction. you could see the shapes of where the ball had faded out. then it was just gone. no trace of anything falling. all of us were stunned, it did not look or move like anything any of us had seen before.\r\n\r\nso this whole time we are still driving at around 60-65 mph. no cars in front or behind us. we are all looking out our windows to see if anyone else spots something. i'm behind my sister who spotted the first ufo, so we're both looking out the same side window. after a while, my sister and i spotted something at the exact same time. there was a dim, orange ball just above the horizon that had just appeared, and then disappeared again. a few seconds after it disappeared a bright, bigger one appeared slightly above the dim one, and hovered for a second, then went out like a flame. it was the exact thing my sister had described about an hour earlier when she saw the first ufo. for the next twenty minutes, we lost count on how many objects we saw. a bright yellow/orange/reddish ball would appear in different areas of the sky, and seconds later would dim out, like a flame. there was a big, bright star we had kept our eye on for reference, so that we could see if the ball was appearing in the same place or if it was definitely moving. sometimes the ball would appear close to the horizon to the left hand side of the star, and a while later it would appear farther away from the horizon on the right hand side of the star. so this whole while, we're traveling at 60 mph and we're still seeing the object appear. it was definitely moving, it was not stationary. \r\n\r\nafter 20 minutes of seeing many, many objects, the activity had stopped. 40-45 minutes went by and we stopped looking, also we had passed through mountains and had simply thought that we could not see them anymore. i happen to look back out the window at the edge of a mountain that was the same distance as the horizon we were looking at. another ball had appeared but this time, it did not disappear. we immediately pulled over to watch it. the ball was stationary for a few seconds, and 3 of us saw it move slightly up and down, and back and forth. it was very slight, but it was definitely a moving light. the other 3 thought that it was a stationary light that had just come from behind the mountain while we were driving. after a few minutes of it not moving, we're all convinced it was just a light that had appeared from behind the mountain. as we were about to drive away, the light suddenly disappeared. it was not a light that was behind the mountain, it was the same orange light we had been seeing. it reappeared a second later, and disappeared again. \r\n\r\nnone of us had any explanations for any of the things we had seen. we saw 3 different kinds of objects and lights in a time frame of about 2 hours traveling at 65 mph. all 6 of us had seen these lights. they were not fireworks, they were not flares. nothing ever fell from the light, they just disappeared as quickly as they appeared. we googled on my sisters phone the things we had seen, and we found a story almost exactly like ours in almost the exact location, the story was in congress, which is very close to where we were. it inspired us to share our story, because they were almost identical. we believe we saw the same things as they did. i wish i had an answer as to what we saw, but i think for now, it shall remain a mystery.\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

harford county, maryland from pa. there is a full moon almost directly to the left of me, and a setting sun in the opposite direction to the right of me. there are some high-thin clouds, but it is a relatively clear night ��� and the setting sun is still providing quite a bit of daylight, while the full moon outside of my car window is big and bright. i am glancing at it every 15-30 seconds ��� traffic is very light and this allows me to take a 1 to 2 second peek at the beautiful, rising full moon. \r\nif directly above me is 50 degrees, then i would put the moon to my left at 10-15 degrees above the horizon and the sun to my right at about 5 degrees above the horizon ��� the bottom of the sun was just touching the horizon basically. the positions of each are important to understand the amount of light and what i was able to see. \r\nthen, i look at it - and notice something obstructing my view. it is somewhat thin and black and at a tilt ��� the thing is i only see the left side of the object where the moon���s left surface ends. i roll down my window, the object is still there ��� but it appears to be moving slowly across my view of the moon.  it looks like there���s a big dark scratch on the moon, but it���s moving from left to right. \r\n2 seconds later, this thing, still on a slant, is taking up the full length of the moon from my position ��� which has not changed because the road is fairly straight on the part where i am driving. then, i only see the object, apparently still moving from left to right, from towards the middle of the moon to its right edge. another words i don���t see the entire object anymore ��� almost like it is circling the moon.   the right side of it i now cannot see ��� but given the amount of light, and how large it appears to be, i should see something. \r\nnow, if this were an airplane, due to its size (at one point it took up my entire view of the moon) then it���s length would suggest to me that it was close enough to me to be able to distinguish other features (and see pulsating lights = much as you do when you see a plane cross the sky). if it were a plane that was too far away for me to distinguish, it would have had to have been much smaller ��� not large enough to be the entire length of the moon. the other disturbing thing is, it���s definitely an object that took up the entire length of the moon from my perspective. however, i apparently did not see the left side of it as it moved into view, nor did i see the right side of it as it passed from left to right. it was absolutely light enough for me to be able to see if it were an airplane. and, if it were too dark, i should have seen some sort of airplane lights ��� there were none. it basically disappeared as quickly as it appeared, even though it appeared to be moving somewhat slowly. \r\ni continued to look in the direction of the moon for several minutes, and to the right of the moon, to see if i would finally see some airplane lights so

getting ready for a birthday dinner party of my niece's. the wife took a lot longer than expected, and the moon was full and rising over the neighborhood roof tops toward the east to slightly ne at this time of year. i decided to take a still photo of it with my i-phone 3g, with my younger 8 year old daughter and my 5 year old son near by. soon as the camera function booted up and view finder engaged, i pointed it at the moon, but imediatly noticed a bright blue glowing small orb below and toward the left about a 7:00 o clock position below the moon. it was about 15-20 degrees out from the the moon disc. it was only visible through the electronic view finder of the i-phone, but not to the naked eye. it was stationary in relation to the moon. i moved the camera around to see if it could be a lens refraction from the neighborhood lights, but it stayed put in relation to the moon. i looked around to see if anybody had blue lights around, like christmas lights, but non observed. i kept looking at the part of the sky where it appeared in the view finder, but no orb, no bright stars, or planets were any where nearby. i then being aware that electronic cameras, can see wave lengths of light not seen by the naked eye, i proceeded to photo graph it. upon engaging the zoom function on the still camera function, to draw the orb close in the view finder for a closer photo, i saw what appeared to be electrical, charge, or static like texture to the orb, like static on a off channel on older analog tvs, and rapid dancing gold, silver, yellow and pinkish or rose electrical sparking or arcing around the edges of the orb disc. like those tesla balls you would purchase at sharper image novelty electronic stores with the frankenstein style electrical plasma charges dancing all around a glass globe. i then proceeded to take stills and engage my video function as well, but the video function lacks the zoom capability of the still function. now the one neighbor, i have near by, the father of a girl my daughter plays with, and my children and wife also came over to look at it through the view finder. i attempted to use my wife's i-phone to also view it, but her's, also the same make model and style, bought at the same time and place as mine didn't show the object. even both held side by side pointing at the spot of the orb. we had to go to our party on miami beach. so a stopped photos and film. as we were on our way to 79th st causeway on miami bch. i hit a red light at 826 and bird rd. i rolled the window down engaged the camera, and used it to relocate the object still in it's position. guess the time was about 8:00 or 8:20 pm. we arrived at the trio's on the bay at 1601 79th st. causeway, north bay village, miami, fl. 33141. at 8:50-9:00 pm. i stepped out of the car and turned on the camera again, sure enough it was still in it's original position. seemed not as bright from this location. now i thought if i just traveled 35-40 miles and it is still in its relative original position, this thing has to be very high or outside of the planet's atmosphere. i continued to take photos, using references and other sources, like passing aircraft, buildings, palm trees, etc. for references, and film clips of the object both in front of and on the dockside deck of the restaraunt till my battery got low about 10-10:30 pm. had to shut my phone down to save. i also attempted to use other family member's i-phones and other camera type phones to view the object. only one other i_phone in the group of 4 camera phones seemed to see the object. older black berry and flip phones did not see it when engaged for camera mode. periodically through out the night till we left at 11:45-11:50 pm, i engaged the phone briefly to observe the object. it was there till till we were leaving, then upon one last view attempt with almost dead battery, i noticed it was gone!!!!! by now the moon was directly overhead to slightly toward the west. mary margaret zimmer of mufon has my complete collection of still shots and 4 video clips of the object downloaded in her computer today january, sunday 8th at 1:45 pm, she will be following up with the video evidence!!!!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":34718,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":25.70840817361049,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01082012-0018","longitude":-80.3600679974392,"occurred":1325992800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1326075246000,"summary":"Blue

just above the crest of a hill south of the house. it was about 11:00 to 11:30 on a moonlit night with some wispy clouds in the sky. as the lights came closer i could see that they were on an aircraft and i thought it might be on fire and might crash. i then realized it was on a straight course towards the house and didn't appear to be in distress. as the object and the lights came closer i could see that they were attached to an aircraft of some kind and as it came above the valley just south of the house i could hear a droning sound like that of a plane far off in the distance. but it was nothing if compared to the deafening noise a commercial aircraft of such size and so close by would make. \r\n\r\ni saw the object from below as it passed over the house in a northwesterly direction. it appeared to be a very large black matte or dark grey flat object with a shape between a square and a diamond. it was much bigger than the house. i couldn't see any distinguishing marks on the lower part, but the lights were very bright--the brightest i've ever seen and the colors were very vivid. they seemed to be both orange and yellow at the same time, but in no discernible pattern. there was a light on each point of the object, but there may have been 2 more. i remember thinking that the shape was odd in some way--it's wasn't easy to find a frame of reference to describe it. it also happened very quickly and i was a little frightened by what i was seeing. i couldn't hear any sounds until the craft was very close by and they faded quickly as it moved northward and out of sight.\r\n\r\ni'll try and draw a picture of what i saw, but it will be very difficult. the angle of viewing wasn't straight forward and i'm not an artist.

to the  west for just a second and i saw a bright light that blinked at me. then i told him look at that light he replied :that is an airplane,. when i first saw it i thought it was a flying saucer. i told him lets just wait a few minutes and see. we waited for 5 minutes and the light was still there very slowly moving west. he went to get his coffee and i stayed in the spot and observing the light. 15 minutes later he returned and the light was still there. we even went downtown walking and  on the way there we continued to see the light (25 minutes walk) . by now farther west. this thing was (extremely bright) and it was (extremely far away). i estimate at least 9 miles away. at least 5000 feet above ground. because it was very bright it appeared to be closer and consequently lower. the duration of the sighting was of at least 45 minutes. i did not have any out of the ordinary feelings what so ever. we lost sight of it when we where downtown. by the time we started to walk back,  it was gone. but this things was around for a long ,long guys i would say 45 minutes. it was oval,the color of the light:pure white, changing to light orange, light copper and light red for short periods of time. blinking once in a while. i could also see  commercial airplanes  far away in the distance near it . but their light was very yellow and much much duller,  and smaller than the light from this object.In fact  i saw one airplane very close to us,, i think it was approaching  harrisburg.. and the light was still duller and yellower compared. now you may have an idea of what i mean
