the night of the sighting.\r\n\r\nwhere: bedford, indiana.\r\ntime: approximately 7 pm.\r\nwitness: reporter, alone, 66 yr old male; retired secondary school teacher\r\ntestimony:\r\ni had returned home after having dinner with friends at a local restaurant. despite it being january, the night was not particularly cold, and the sky was spectacularly clear. after parking the car, i stood in my driveway looking at the stars. it occurred to me that if there was any night that one might have the chance to see a ufo, this was that kind of night, and i actually thought, i wish i could see one now. not two minutes passed after that thought when i clearly saw a row of star-colored and star-sized lights passing almost directly overhead, traveling due west. the right hand half of the row was dimmer, and some of the individual lights were not visible, but those on the left hand were all distinctly visible. though i did not have the presence of mind to count them, i know the left half was surely showing more than 4 lights, and probably six, but the right half showed only two; only the one furthest from the midpoint was particularly distinct. as i kept my attention focused on the row of moving lights, i tried to detect any sound the phenomenon might be making, but there was nothing out of the ordinary; it seemed to be completely silent. at the same time, i saw that the row of lights was not a straight line but that they were arranged in a wide l or flying wing configuration. the phenomenon moved steadily at an unchanging high rate of speed and altitude to the west, and as the distance between us increased, suddenly the full complement of lights became visible, an equal number on the left and right. at no time did any of the visible lights change position in relation to one another, nor did they blink or strobe or change colors. the phenomenon was in my field of vision for approximately three seconds and was then instantly not visible, possibly because it passed below the tree line or below the roof line of my car shelter. after a few minutes, i went into the house feeling elated and after a few more minutes decided to call one of the people i had been having dinner with and tell him about the sighting. this i did, but since i have brought up the subject of ufos and my belief in their existence before, i am not sure how seriously any of my friends take my report of this event.\r\n\r\nnote: bedford, indiana is apparently almost directly beneath major east-west and north-south commercial flyways. the reporter has had very frequent opportunity to see both high altitude and medium altitude airline overflights, and also nighttime overflights of small to medium-sized commercial aircraft making descent approaches almost directly over his home on the way to louisville, kentucky. this event was nothing like those overflights in either sounds (or lack of sound) and sights. additionally, all the low-altitude flyovers come in from the west and make a banking right turn over bedford to approach louisville. they do not approach from the east and then simply pass over bedford at low to medium altitude.\r\n\r\nimpressions:\r\nalthough the lights were clearly in a flying wing arrangement, the actual craft in front of them was almost invisible. i actually got the impression that a piece of the night sky was moving across my field of vision. if i had not had the row of lights to focus on, i doubt i would have even noticed its passage.\r\n\r\nbecause of the phenomenons silence and speed, i simply could not get a good impression of its altitude and physical size, though it seemed to me that it was quite large; certainly as a wingspan, it would be remarkable, and the greater the altitude, the more remarkable the size. the next day, i took a ruler to the spot where i was standing, and holding it out at arms length, estimated the object measured 3 to 4 across at arms length. several high-flying commercial aircraft were overhead at the same time as this sighting, but in comparison, they were mere points of strobing lights, and they were visible for minutes rather than seconds.\r\n\r\nthe gradual revelation of the individual right hand lights, and the nearly instant disappearance of the entire row as the phenomenon sped westward suggests to me that one must be very fortunately at the exact proper angle of observation in order to detect this type of ufo at all.\r\n\r\ncomments:\r\nalthough i have been interested in ufo reports for many years, i do not spend much time actually watching the skies to spot them in transit. usually, i only do so a few minutes at a time, such as this one when i was simply pausing on the way from the car shelter to the back door of my house. therefore, considering the very narrow window of opportunity here, either this was an extremely unlikely coincidence (im watching just as it is passing by), or these things are really quite commonly in the skies above us though we simply dont notice them.\r\n\r\nmy overall interpretation of this experience is that although it was an extraordinary encounter with a remarkable piece of technology that has highly secret military capabilities, this is very likely a man-made craft. i am still waiting for the unequivocable alien encounter.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

bottom of the orb was either a beam of light or a gas emission moving like a pendulum from left to right.  i thought maybe this was an lost kite (reflecting the sun) with a tail, but it never changed its glow and the beam coming from the bottom would have been the thickest kite tail i've ever seen.  it was came from the west and went almost directly east (slightly southeast) in a striaght path.  it did not dip or change altitude.  frankly, i think it was moving slightly against the wind.  no sound.\r\n\r\nthe orb was higher than a jet leaving o'hare.  i am familiar with jets and helicopters, and live along the flight path of air traffic.  it does cross my mind that this could have been a reflective balloon or kite, but those don't move in a deliberate path and do change altitude.  also the glow or reflection never flickered, like a reflection does.  kite tails and balloon strings don't move like a pendulum usually, do they?  i suppose if they're weighted it's possible.  but this orb was so high up, and the lightbeam or gas emission from the bottom was thick and visible, not thin or narrow and twisty like string or a tail.  it was a stiff, pendulum-like motion.\r\n\r\nhere is the weirdest coincidence:  two minutes before the sighting i had a strong urge to go outside.  prior to that something popped into my mind telling me i was going to see a ufo today.  i went outside to smoke, and was thinking about sharing this feeling with my s.O., but i was like, \"naah.  what if i am wrong?  don't be weird.\"  at that moment a jet was going west to east and a moment later i saw the orb.  just like that!  i honestly can't explain why i felt like this sighting was going to happen right before it happened, and i feel like - this is crazy - that the ufo was letting me know it was there.  i had the entire feeling while watching the object, and the whole thing lasted about a minute or less.  it was out of sight more quickly than a departing jet.  i was really paying attention to it moving by, and towards the end of the sighting i wanted to grab my binoculars inside and i went for them.  i swear to you, it communicated to me that it would be out of sight by the time i returned.  and it was.  i looked for a good long time but it was gone.

plane with an engine on fire traveling roughly north to south. there was a stream of sparks which looked to be over 60 long trailing behind a plane (its hard to estimate distance at night). the sparks could clearly be seen and it was below five thousand feet. the only reason im guessing it was a plane was there appeared to be blinking lights which correspond to civilian airplane tail/wing marker lights. one piece came off still trailing sparks and began to fall slowly towards the earth. then a second piece fell off and had the same rate off decent. after both of these fell and tail of sparks ceased we were expecting this plane to start to fall from the sky assuming it was a dual engine passenger plane breaking up. our focus then shifted to the two falling objects second of which reversed direction and travels towards the first. as they overlap the first goes out and the second continues in a near horizontal trajectory. while watching this we had lost focus of the plane which is catching back up with the second sparking object. just before the plane reaches the object it goes out.At this point both of us have no idea what we just witnessed. by no means do we think it was extra terrestrial in origin but we are unable to find anything on the web. my friend who witnessed this posted a topix thread in the nashville forum and received one quality response so far. i am aware there is an international airport and air force base at the donelson exit, but this was in no way near an approach for either being several miles west of both. i have also seen military flares first hand (magnesium and phosphorous) and they are single points of light with faint reflection of smoke at night. these were however tails of sparks and not a traditional flare.","distance":"501

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was coming home at 9:45 pm, and parked my car on the street.\r\ni realized that a bright red light was viewable from my front yard to the east of my house, and that it was similiar, or the same red light ufo that i viewed in the east in september in the same neighborhood.\r\ni immediately called a friend that lives a few blocks away, that viewed a  red light ufo with me in september at his house in the same neighborhood.\r\nhe in turn called his father, who lives up on the bench in boise idaho, around 4-5 miles from where we live, which is several hundred feet lower in elevation than his father lives, in a shallow river valley. his father confirmed that the ufo was fairly high in the sky. this gives me reason to think that the ufo was probably over 500 feet high in the sky, any lower, and my friends father would have only barely been able to see it, and it would probably have around the same height as the mountains behind boise. \r\n\r\nafter calling my friend, i ran inside after trying to catch a photo using my blackberry phone.\r\ni scrambled for my digital coolpix camera, and ran outside to shoot a shaky, quick photo....\r\nrealizing i needed a tripod to get any decent photos of the light blown up, i again ran inside and was able to set up my digital camera, and shoot around 12 photos over a 15 minute period.\r\nshortly after taking just a few photos, the ufo, moved a good 50 degrees northwest, and was basically overhead just north of us.\r\nthe movement was straight, with no noise, and the light just pulsated slowly, or was completely unwavering in its strength for a minute or so. then it would start pulsating again.\r\nthe ufo then moved back to its almost original position, taking a slightly different path.\r\nthe entire movement period was no longer than a few minutes if that.\r\nit moved at an even pace, and i wondered how anything could move that fast in the sky, if it was a balloon or such being towed from the ground.\r\neven a balloon/blimp with an engine would have to be moving pretty good to cover that distance.\r\nonce it was stationary again, i commenced taking more photos\r\ni drained the battery, but was able to get around 9 photos that had little movement, and actually showed either artifacts of the light/camera, or actual structure of what i believe is plasma formations.\r\n\r\naround the mid point of the event, a plane high in the sky flew above us, and could probably see the ufo as well, this was not a jet. we could hear the engine, and see the flashing lights of the plane....Each little flashing red light on the plane, was something like 1/20th the intensity/size of this red pulsating ufo.\r\nit was strong enough light, i doubted it was a chinese lantern, and when the ufo moved it didnt flicker, as if a candle were illuminating it.\r\n\r\nthe entire viewing lasted around 35-40 minutes.\r\n\r\ni watched the ufo until it \"left\" which was interesting, and gave me the idea that it was either a digital light controlled hoax, but not a flare or candle/torch in a balloon.\r\nthe ufo moved slightly back east, very slightly, or, it actually shrunk in size, and then it started pulsating faster, and then started strobing for the first time, it strobed completely on and off around 4-6 times at a relative even pace, and then quickly increased completely strobing on and off, and then just completely dissapeared.\r\n\r\ni have only seen a ufo twice before this, in september a few months before, and what we saw on dec 24 looked very similiar, or basically the same as the september sighting.\r\nexcept in september, it was lower on the horizon, and we watched it drift out of view after 20 minutes, instead of watching it strobe and dissapear.\r\n\r\nthe first ufo i saw, was an orb/light ufo, that was red, like this ufo i saw in december, this was in 1978, in mccall idaho, that ufo sped quickly from far away, or grew in size, and quickly stopped over a tree directly to the north of me and some adults inside and above a tree in our yard that was no more than 30 feet tall. (i was 8 years old at the time)\r\nthat ufo wasnt more than 60-80 feet from us, and was a 4-5 foot wide ball of spinning glowing energy that spun red/orange/purple colors very quickly. that ufo suddenly shot up into the sky, turned white, and split in two and quickly dissapeared into the night sky.\r\n\r\nafter i saw blow ups of the dec 4th 2011 photos i took, i was blown away, but how similiar the ball of glowing colors was to the ball i saw so many years ago up in mccall....\r\nfrom a distance, the lights look like a very bright glowing red ball shining with intensity...\r\nbut up close, there is soft edges, different colors, spinning intensity in the one i saw up close.\r\n\r\nlooking at the photos, blowing them up, using different controls on editing the photos, and even using a redeye removing software to look past some of the red glare, i am convinced this is some sort of plasma formation. there are some very interesting phenomenon/or camera artifacts viewable in these photos, which were all taken by myself on dec. 24th 2011 at 9.45pm until around 10:20 pm.\r\nplease ask for permission to publish these photos anywhere.\r\n\r\nthere were some similiar reports the next night in boise idaho, and i noticed also reports in oregon, washington, and california that sounded similiar.\r\n\r\ni am not very knowledgeable about how plasma balls form.\r\nbut i have been doing research for the last week ever since taking these photos.\r\na physicist i lived with at one time, told me plasma balls can be controlled by military technology, and even project sounds.\r\nthis light i saw in december, seemed either motionless/hovering, or moved in a very regular, seemingly controlled fashion.\r\nmy impression in the beginning, before seeing the photos, is that this was an oject that was lit up, and not a glowing plasma ball like i had seen as a child in mccall, and that it was some sort of glowing blimp, hoax, or a ufo aircraft.\r\ni had the impression that this was under control of some intelligence of some sort.\r\nbut understand that plasma formations can be a natural occurence.\r\nseeing the photos i am convinced its a plasma energy ball, if the photos are viewed under the right conditions/filtered correctly, you can see flame  like whisps shooting out and around the ball of light, as if the plasma ball was actually bigger than it looked.\r\nalso notice in some of the photos, under the ufo around 1/2-3/4 of the photo, there can be seen a strange glowing purple area, either a ball shape, or like two small balls on the sides of a larger ball.\r\ni am under the impression, that this is some sort of plasma formation, but very subtle, and that this purple light has something to do with the phenomenon that i witnessed.\r\nit occurred to me, that the energy \"feeding\" this plasma ball, might be a field extending far beyond what looks like to be a solid object from a distance. the strange purple light is present in more than 2 of these photos, but is not viewable on all of them.\r\n\r\nin comparing all the photos, i see what looks like a cloudy mass, with irregularities, but fairly circular, but in others, it looks like a squarish, irregular spinning object, with dimpled areas that sometimes line up quite straight and regularly spaced, almost a sort of stiple effect. and in one photo, the interior looks as if it has bilateral symmetry going on, much like what a walnut shell looks like\r\n\r\nsome sources claim that stationary/hovering ufo's are in a low energy use period, and glow red, but as they speed up, they turn blue/white.\r\nthat might fit somewhat with what i saw in mccall, as the ufo did turn white upon flying directly up into the sky...\r\nbut the ufo viewed on december 24th, did not \"power\" up, or change color when it did its short maneuver. of course, it was not moving extremely fast comparable to the viewing of the red/white light in 1978\r\n\r\nabsolutely one of the most exciting nights of my life, in that i was finally able to get photos of a ufo. everything fell together, right place, right time, camera in the house, and a ufo that sticks around for long enough.

with a lady-friend at her house(she is from argentina). both of us divorced and with minor aged children, visited each other regularly. 10 mins before the event we (only) went outside as it was very hot that evening in the house. exactly at the time mentioned, both of us lying on the hood of my car, i observed a dark dull disc-shaped object appear directly overhead flying east to west. i stared at it for a few seconds and it flew slowly westward, i spoke out to her and lifted my arm to point to it but she had already seen it too and exclaimed, in spanish: \"look at that....Space vehicles\". i was overjoyed because i have had more observations but this one was finally with a witness. the object was clearly disc-like, no lighting but it could have had an inner glow in the center which was deep bronze like. the rest of the vehicle was very dark, it was a moonless night and as it went it blotted out the visible stars. as soon as she spoke the following event occured; another object\r\nappeared and it was the same size in my eyes and it must have been flying directly below or above the other one because it appeared to have been slingshot like on an elastic band and it oscillated back and forth a few times (while in the same forward motion) to and from the other unit and then like it locked into position - for us to the left of the other one and together they flew side by side without wavering westward into the sky towards the horizon where they disappeared into the haze in the distance. our bodies on the hood of the car were aligned with our heads due east and our feet towards the west. the roof of the house was east as well as a range of hills, we did not notice the event untill the objects were directly overhead. no sound or noise accompanied this event. my lady-friend is a level-headed english school-teacher who never before believed in these type of events. i have been an observer to several more events like this one in past times..Therefore i do not get excited anymore. i sometimes do try to attract attention by waving at them. the flightpath of these objects observed would have brought them near the island of puerto rico (vieques), they must also have flown directly over the airport of this small island (juliana airport).

was pulsating multiple colors, orb-like and somewhat bigger than the surrounding stars. it did not move as i was looking at it. it was also lower in the sky that the other stars in that view of the sky. i then went inside for binoculars, 7x35mm, to get a better look and asked my girlfriend to come outside for her impression and view of it, as well. she saw it, looked through the binoculars, and observed the same as i did. the circular edges were fuzzy and it was an indistinct, orb shape but the colors kept changing in an unnatural way. these colors were brighter and deeper in color/range than a more natural, star-like manner. my reaction was that it was interesting, definitely a ufo to me and to her, but i was not able to spend more than about 10 minutes looking at it. we went back

a hill. good visibility here. no city light to the east south and west.I turned off all lights and lay on the ground looking up letting my eyes get use to the dark.7:50 to 8:10 looking up seeing normal air traffic . at 8:20 i herd some noise to the south.I got up and went to the front of my atv and herd some howling . it was coyotes . 8:25 still standing looking south i turned and looked south west. i see a white light low moving from the south to the north. did not think anything of it till about 1 minute in. under the white light was a red light. it seem to pulse red once a second . still moving north it stopped then went back south vary vary quick then stopped for 2 seconds then started moving north again. i thought i was seeing things. still moving north the white light had an amber tint to it. still moving north its gone from south west to do west. getting closer it seemed. there was no sound from it. the only sounds i could here were the truck and car traffic on the highway 5 miles away. looking west watching this object still moving north it stops again shoots south again then stops then starts moving north again. i got the willies then started talking to myself . what is this.Do i see this. still the object is moving north . still seeing the white light with amber tint and red pulsating light under it. its now wnw of me moving north then it blinked off. when it went off i reached down for my binoculars and looked for the object up down left right it was gone. i did not want to grab the binoculars and take my eyes off it . i have spent thousands of hours out side fishing/camping ext. and thousands looking up. i know what normal aircraft look and sound like.   the 4 to 5 minutes i was watching this object it traveled about 8 miles. i know the object i saw was not something i can identify . when this object stopped and went south twice it traveled about 2 miles in a tenth of a second . humans have not built anything like that   yet   .
