of what i believe to be that disc-shaped ship.  although, it was completely invisible to the naked eye, the camera was able to pick up on it.  i went outside again and took more pictures and i was

a boomerang shaped object came over head. we were both shocked. i would say it was as big as a 747 jet flying low enough to  look about 6 inches across if you were mesuring with a ruler. maybe that way you could get a heighth . there was no sound , flying very, very slow with what looked like heat around it. it was a clear night and the shape was as easy to see as the trees aorund the area. it flew over straight going north west. some ask how we saw it at night. now that is a dumb question. on a clear night you can see the outline of trees, houses, or what ever. the point is 2 weeks later we saw the same shape coming out of the south but much, much higher, glowing a golden color and traveling very fast. it again went straight over our house. but then again,2 weeks after that the same object came out of the southwest , higher again this time and traveling so fast i could just barely catch that it was the same object. i looked on line about the kaufman county ufo that someome took a daylight photo of and it is the same shape. but then again we saw an object that flew straight over the house from the north to south about a year ago that the wings were swept back just a little. it was harder to see but was a little higher than the fisrt object we saw but was slow, no lights, and no sound. my wife and i asked ourselves why we have seen these over the house and i guess it is because we sit out and star gaze.Just to let you know though. i do not belive in little green men. i do believe that the us has been able to do alot more than they will ever say. look at what germany was doing during wwii. i would love to know what they are though. i think the american people can handle antything. thanks for your

\r\n\troute 49 runs north/south through voluntown and sterling and is a rural farming area that runs over the tops of many hills with thousands of open acreage of harvested corn fields. you can see for miles east and west in the stretch of 49 where this happened. \r\n\tas i was driving i noticed what appeared to be an aircraft marker light that was blinking brilliant blue/white similar to a halogen light. it appeared to be flying low and fast. the light came out of the east just above the horizon and was moving west. it became brighter and changed to more like a flashing flood light when it got overhead. i looked west when it got overhead to see what it was. it did not continue west but instead followed me overhead and was now lighting up the road around me. \r\n\tthe flashing light was now so intense that it lit up the interior of my car as i had the roof window canopy opened with the glass was closed. i slowed down. it kept pace with my car, extremely bright and  flashing . \r\n\ti  pulled off the road just long enough to open the roof window. i immediately noticed that there was no noise. the light was blinding when i looked up at it. it was hovering overhead.\r\n\ti closed the roof window and canopy. i locked my doors and drove off as fast as i could. i was in flight mode, in a cold sweat and focused on getting out of there. the flashing light kept pace overhead briefly. it then changed from a flood type light back to the initial blinking light that i had first noticed as it abruptly left me by turning quickly back to the east.\r\n\tthis light came out of the east traveling west and perpendicular to route 49. when it got overhead it followed me north. when it left me it returned to the east. i have no  knowledge of aircraft that are able to make what appeared to me to be 90 degree turns or that can slow so fast and then hover silently. the light was silent and changed to more of a flashing flood light while overhead. i did not see any features of a craft during the whole incident which lasted only a couple of minutes.\r\n\t i didn���t notice any other cars on this stretch of road at the time this happened.  i have found nothing similar to this on your website. i am wondering if i am the only person to have experienced this before?","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

high (from when i 1st saw it). it was at this point i called my wife out and we both observed it. their was a police helicopter at a 2oclock position from it, further back in the sky. you could cleary see the difference. the object had no flashing lights, no collision lights etc. just very bright yellow. i thought for a moment that it may have been a helicopter search light merely pointed in my general direction. the object hovered for a duration of 2-3 seconds, leveled off and started flying directly towards us due east towards padadena. i'm in north glendale above glenoaks off of pacific. from my vantage point, i assumed it was somewhere over toll middle school initially.���\r\n���������once it leveled off we got really excited. at this point my wife ran inside for the camera. i stood staring and could clearly see a bright yellow oval shaped light in front, with red and blue circles side by side, evenly spaced underneath it towards the back. it was a bright night, so i was able 2 make out a definite shape. by the time my wife ran back out to balcony the object was no more than 400 yards away. there was absolutely no noise. at this point we were 100% certain that it was not a helicopter, plane, blimp, balloon(s), or optical illusion of any kind. the quality of the 2 photos i was able 2 take were garbage. due to my patio light being right next 2 camera and my adrenaline high. all lights on object were rigid, and can cleary see outline. it was elongated, best way i can describe it as a chubby looking plane w/ no wings. it was flat on bottom, bright light in front, and as it past directly overhead and out of my line of site(couldn't see past roof of my building), i saw a much duller light in back. closer to the blue/red lights. at closest point it was as big as a stamp in sky, furthest point it was about a 1/3 of 1. we face towards burbank airport so planes/choppers etc are super common. u can hear helicopter rotor blades from miles, this thing glided overhead silently. wondering if anyone seen similar?Area? time? was pretty amazing. not cigar shaped, wider a bit flat on bottom.���","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown,

and tiangong space stations flyovers at 7 & 7:15pm. a few minutes later, i caught a small flash from the western sky. it was easy to see the first faint star-size light coming at me. but then i notice two more lights, one on each side of the first and further behind. 2 seconds has gone by, i now know that it's not planes off in the distance, flashed headlights from traffic, of fireworks. now it has shape, a triangle, but longer in front. another second goes by, and i am trying to see a form, but it's like looking thru water. the star light behind the object is being bent around it. only a slightly dark silhouette is moving thru the sky. 4 seconds have past now, and i have a clear view at maximum azimuth. now i need to figure out, how high is it? my first impression was low earth orbit. but this thing is moving fast, 2x the speed of the space stations i saw earlier. now i'm lowering my guess, because what i see is huge. possibly 2 miles long and 1 mile wide. the cloak made it hard to determine attitude, could have 100 miles up, or maybe just 20 miles up. after following it down range for another 4 or 5 seconds, it appeared to be up higher, around 100 miles. \r\n\r\ni saw a video that was taken in georgia during the summer of 2011. it was taken using night vision goggles in front of a camcorder. he captured the famed flying triangle flying in l.E.O.. in the video, you first see a jet 10 miles up, then by luck he catches the lights of the triangle at 100 miles up,and it is still bigger than the plane. that would be one huge piece of hardware, viewed from 10 times the distance.? i'd have to say that's probably what i saw too, the shape looked the same.\r\n\r\ni have been watching satellites for 3 years. evenly with the coolest apps for smartphones, i still see unknown satellites. also saw a 90 degree turn in feb 2011. but this one was awwwwwwwessssssome!","distance":"Over One

weeks to check for a particular star as it comes into view over the treetops around that time every night. i look for it every night because it's always the brightest star in view over my house.  i saw it in its usual spot, but then i noticed another, brighter star that was twinkling through the trees a little to the east of my star.  as i focused on it, i realized that it wasn't twinkling ... it was flashing. my husband was out with me and i called his attention to it.  i asked him if it was the space station (which i thought my star was) but as we watched it, it flashed brighter with multicolored lights.  red, blue, green, yellow, orange.  we got up and walked out into the yard, thinking to see it better through the trees.  \r\n\r\nit hovered the whole time ... but would raise and lower a little bit, but randomly.  it wasn't a trick of the eye, though.  we noticed at the same time.  then i saw it split into two lights, twinkling different colors.  the second, new one raised up from the first only slightly and hovered a few seconds, before merging back into the first. that's when i went in to get the camera.  \r\n\r\ni called my friend in carl junction to ask if she could see it from her house.  i told her which direction, she went outside and almost immediately spotted it.  she described to me exactly what i was seeing ... the flashing, multicolored lights, the slight rising and falling ... it was like nothing any of us have ever seen before.  she also started filming from her vantage point. \r\n\r\ni filmed ... i don't know ... 30 minutes or so over the course of an hour, and got several very clear still shots.  this object followed a track across the sky -- but slower than all the rest of the stars, i think.  i have no idea what this object is ... it could very well be the space station. but i would like a very thorough explanation and demonstration as to why this thing broke apart, merged, and flashed so many different colors for so long. it was like nothing i'd ever seen before.

ask our friends to check it out, we all agree on what we saw. military planes? keep streaking across the sky leaving vapor trails, at the same elevation but keeping distance. after my experience the other day, i ask my friend if he wanted to stay i was going home to be with my family, he also was good to go. we were heading south twards the ohio river and bam there was #3 across the river look like it was over henderson just like the other 2, and maybe 5 miles northeast #4 just like 1,2,3. just before dropping my buddy at his home, we took a few minutes to regroup in a parking lot that is located in an ideal location to look out over the city of evansville. one after another objects were crossing the sky, 4 orbs emmitting multi-colors hovering (7:45pm), i dropped my friend and headed home. i spoke with a mufon member a couple days ago, i was to talk with him, last couple days been trying to get a grip after my encounter a couple days ago, having may good friends around to witness

and the way their flight characteristics and the light was not blinking, i new it was sonething i'd never seen before ,then the object started changing it's flight pattern by making a turn and it also moved from side to side slightly. the object was a perfect round ball of pure white light. i could not hear any sounds of aircraft. since it was moving so slow i ran in the house to get my mother and she also saw the object. i ran inside to get her, it only took a few seconds to get back to viewing the object. by the time she got outside it was no longer directly above me it was moving away from the house and we both said it looked to be getting lower and then dissapered behind the tree line. that's the last we saw of this object. there was heavy airplane traffic afterwards in the area that i noticed because i stayed outside for awhile afterwards to grill pork chops.I could hear the planes as they went by and they where even higher that the object. i think the object may have been visible

gazed at that hour before, but i was looking for some meteors before getting ready for work. it was a real clear sky and i was excited to see several meteors but then all of a sudden from the west came this shape of blurry white/yellow lights in the shape of a boomerang with space between each light. at first i thought it must be a flock of birds because of its shape ( that is the only thing i could think of making that type of shape in the sky) but i couldn't understand how it would be glowing. and why would there be darkness between the lights as if every other bird was lite up. but as it went over my head i realized these weren't birds. my brain was trying to process what i was seeing and come up with a rational explanation, but i have none. there were 5 lights but they were blurry glowing like behind a mist and  i watched it go right over my head and to the east in a straight path until it disappeared. i have no idea how high it was, except to say that it wasn't like looking at a jet way up high.  it was much closer than that. and much larger.  it took about 6 seconds for it to pass. i was in complete shock as to what i had just seen. i had wished more than anything that my husband had been outside with me, but he was sound asleep.  i am not one to have ever visited this or any other ufo site, but i have talked to several people about what i saw and one of them told me about this web site. i checked the local news when i got home, but no one reported anything, but then again neither did i. so if someone out there can give me an explanation as to what it could of been i would love it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

at the moon. as i glanced up i noticed what i thought was a star at 10 pm to the moon the next day i went out the same star was now at 5 pm position. the 3rd day i went out it was at 7pm position with a clear ring around the moon. i went out to night all though there is some cloud cover the bright star is gone. i am very excited about this  because it is my first sighting. this star slowly rotated around the moon for at least 3 days and then vanished i would like to know if any body else noticed this. i truley believe this is an alien aircraft observig earth. stars do not rotate around the

miles with turns south, east, then south again, we go east one more mile before turning south onto the long stretch of dirt road that leads us to hy-way 10. the road before we make that last south turn has some trees and a house with other out buildings on the corner where we turn south. when we made the turn going south i noticed what i thought was a low, slanted, thick, white jet stream. as i'm driving i realized that what i thought was a jet stream was not getting longer or dissipating. then i saw that there was not a plane or jet at either end. i said to my kids, \"look at that white line in the sky. i thought it was a jet stream but i can't find a jet.\" but of course, no one was paying any attention to me. she was listening to her i-pod in the front seat and he was playing his pcp in the back seat.  i tapped on her arm to get her attention and then this was the conversation and what happened during it. i said, \"look at that weird jet stream\", she said, \"where?, and i said, \"there!\", she says, \"where?\" i yelled, \"there (pointing), right there, are ya blind?\" then at that time it kinda dropped or fell like a leaf tilting back and forth causing it to reflect a brilliant silver just like the mercury inside a thermometer. i said,\"what the h***? look at what it's doing, look, what is it? look at that s***! no way! do ya see it?\" she said, \"no, where is it?\" at some point, i don't know when, i had attracted my sons attention to. then, i did not see it either. i said, \"it's gone! where is it? where did it go?\" i looked to the south and saw a black round shape about the size of a quarter at an arms length. i said, \"there it is! right there. see that black thing? my silly daughter still can't find it. she said, \"where?\", my son reached his arm over the front seat and pointed. he said, \"there, there it is. now do you see it\"? i said, \"to late. it's gone. no it isn't, look!\". now it had zipped south then west and was about the size of a dime this time. then i said, \"it moved again, it's gone again, it's gone, you missed it. you have got to be blind as a bat!\" my son pointed again and said, \"no, look a little bit right. it's really little now.\" he was right, there it was. it had zipped south, and a bit west again. now it was about the size of a pea. i don't remember if my daughter wound up finding it or not. i really don't understand why she could not find it at first. i think i'm gonna make my son sit in the front from now on. lol! just joking. any way, we lost sight of it for good after that. for the first couple of days after that i thought about it off and on. then thought about it more and more trying to make sense of the white line that i first thought was a jet stream, or trail. now i can see a big difference between the white line and a jet stream. jet streams will sometimes, swell, take on different shapes, grow longer in front, fade or dissipate at their end. the white line did none of these. it was wider than a jet stream. it did not get longer or shorter. it was a pure white color, a solid white that had straight edges, not the rolling puffy looking edges. now i think about it all the time. it all happened so fast after the white line showed itself to be something other than a jet stream. it was an extremely shocking and unexpected experience!!! \r\n\r\nif you try to contact me please dial the number 2 times in a row so i will know to pick up. i don't answer my phone if i don't recognize the phone number due to past stalking incident. you can also text me and let me know your going to call or you can email me to set up a time when you would like to call. \r\n\r\nthanks for your time.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
