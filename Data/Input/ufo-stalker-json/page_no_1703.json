another star. it had no flashing lights like a plane would. i live near the airport so no planes are ever that high up and never move that fast or in a zigzag pattern like this one did.Moved way too fast and was too high up to be a jet. moved too slow and erratic to be a comet or satellite.I am going back outside to watch for others. i felt like it was ignoring me, unlike my last sighting in 1982

i believe in them and have always looked to the skies for an opportunity to see one.\r\n\r\ni thought the object was a star or meteor because there was a shower occurring the same night. \r\n\r\ni looked to the sw and the bright object caught my attention. i kept asking myself if it was a star, plane, or other object. i decided to go in my home and bring my wife out to look at it as well. when we returned to look at the object it had moved and that was when i knew it was not a star and had to be some type of flying object. i brought my video camera and binoculars with me and tried to look at it first with the binoculars then take film of it. my wife looked at it through the binoculars and her first impression was that it was a star but was really to big to be a star. she also concluded that it could not be a star because it had changed positions in the sky. we were slowly stepping back from where we started. \r\n\r\ni then went and got my friend and he came out to take a look and he saw the object move from left to right very quickly. while all of this was going on i started to film the object but have to admit that looking at the object through the binoculars was much more clear. the object was at a distance and my video camera could not really focus on the object for a clear view. you can see the pulsating lights though and it was revolving very quickly with red, blue, and green light. the lights were turning in a clockwise motion very quickly changing from the three colors i mentioned before. the object was in continuous motion because i had to change my footing each time the object moved. i was on top of a car in my driveway at this time. i did start filming from ground level. the object was traveling to the west and as far as i could tell from past experiences seeing helicopters flying around the city from my home was that it was approximately over the city of west los angeles/westwood/santa monica areas. as i am filming i am trying to keep my hand as still as possible and i know that i was not moving as much as the film suggests. my friend who witnessed me filming told me that he was looking at me and my filming and that there was no way i was moving around as much as the object was in the film. when viewing the object through the binoculars you could not tell it was making the movements that you could see through the film. when looking at it through the binoculars the object was just pulsating the three lights. you could actually see that with the naked eye. when i was filming you could see the rapid movements of the object through the viewfinder. we were amazed at how quickly it moved from one point to the next in a zig zag trail. all along it was still going out towards the west. though the film is blurred you can see the pulsating lights in the clockwise motion and can tell that it is not a star, helicopter, plane, or any other type of manned vehicle we know of. \r\n\r\nwe tried to debunk and rule out everything we could before we figured it was an ufo. we just want to know if there were any reports of strange lights at all anywhere in the greater los angeles area especially in the before mentioned cities. my wife thought it was a star and looked up how stars move on line but she ruled that out. i had already ruled that out because there was always movement by the object. it wasn't a meteor from the shower because of the pulsating lights. it was not a helicopter because to our knowledge there are no helicopters with lights that act the way these did. plane ruled out completely after we saw the rapid movement of the object. \r\n\r\nalso, just before i started to film there were two helicopters that i saw. one was your standard law enforcement helicopter but the other had only white/cream colored lights and they were much brighter than your normal beacons on helicopters. as a matter of fact we saw that the law enforcement helicopter has a red beacon and spotlight but again the second helicopter only had what looked like two large light white/cream in color and it speeded towards the object. i did not follow that helicopter but it was flying in that general direction heading west while the law enforcement helicopter proceeded over my home towards the hollywood hills. the duration of time between the time i saw the first helicopter going towards the object and the law enforcement helicopter passing over my home was probably about 30 seconds. the law enforcement helicopter had to have seen the unidentified helicopter.\r\n\r\nthis event was very exciting to us as my wife is a skeptic even she said she could not explain what the object was. we all had never seen anything like this object before. we still are in disbelief in terms of how we never thought we would see a ufo.\r\n\r\nthanks for your time and i hope you have some answers for us one way or the other.\r\n\r\nwitnesses...\r\n\r\n(witness names moved to fi box) cms 01/05/12 03:36 cst

hovering amber/gold blow about 100 - 200 feet above the trees.  the light first appeared round then looked to flowing like it had a tail.  initially i thought the home builder had a balloon floating in the air, but there were no stings or flags coming down to a fixed point on the ground.  the light was no blinking and way too big for a helicopter and was no way an airplane b/c was too low to the ground a stationary.  on the night of the event it was cold out, with low cloud cover.  as i approached the stop light at virginia and lake forest blvd i noticed the light had moved a little bit for where it was orig. stationed.  once i stopped at the light, the object's light turned off and a huge black triangle shaped object appeared with no lights, no sign of any engines, blades, etc., and made absolutely no sound.  i had all my windows down and sunroof so i could clearly make out the dark object hovering there completely still.  the black object  hovered high enough to not reflect any ground lights, but low enough to not reflect any light reflecting off the low cloud cover.  the object was blacker than the night sky that would appear between the cloud cover as the clouds raced eastward.  it hovered there for about 15 - 20 seconds and then moved in a straight line east/north east with out a sound; completely stealth.  i could make out the black object as it moved east/northeast because it was darker than the sky and the clouds.  once the light turned green i crossed lake forest blvd traveling east, raced down the small hill and up to the top of the hill where i had a great view of the sky and the area the object traveled, but it was no where in sight.  \r\n\r\nthe object traveled on a complete straight path, like it was flying on a perfect flat plane with no swaying.  it's like object put out a mast and sailed with the wind in a complete straight path with no wavering or sound.  i couldn't believe what i saw and tried several drive to several hill tops that give me a clear view of the night sky and the huge object was no where to be seen.\r\n\r\nwhat i saw that night has bugged me for months and months and i'd love to know what i saw that night.

moving slightly left then right, then left then right, the up, then down, then left then right, etc.  it also changed shapes, and the colored lights changed from red to blue to green to yellow, etc.\r\n\r\nin wonder, i yelled for my husband to come see.  he was downstairs, i was up.  instead, he yelled, ���what is it?��� to which i told him i was looking at a ufo.  he looked out the window and just moments later yelled, ���i see it!��� and then verified where in the sky i was seeing it.\r\n\r\nit continued to ���wiggle��� in the sky and change colors.  it also changed shapes from round or spherical to oblong or blimp shape.  as it changed shapes, the colors changed.  it was almost like it was rotating.  we called our son who lives about 1/6 mile down the road.  he went outside and he saw it too.  he reported seeing the shape stay the same, but the colors changing and it appearing to move.\r\n\r\nwe could see the color changing and movement with the naked eye.  we looked at it through the binoculars, and it was definitely colored.  it was like looking into a spectrum.  all kinds of color!  yet the next time you looked at through the binoculars it was all white.  mostly it was colored.\r\n\r\nit appeared to be high in the sky like a star, light up like a plane, and hovering like a helicopter.  it was too high to be a helicopter and it didn���t make any noise that we heard.  it stayed in the night sky and we decided to go to bed.  the next day, i posted on facebook and friends told me it was a planet or comet or something.\r\n\r\nnovember 6, 2011 ���again, we saw the same ufo in the night sky, again changing colors just as much, but moving back and forth and up and down just a little less.  of course- when we saw it this night, we were at my son���s house and remember he didn���t report seeing the same movement we did.\r\n\r\njanuary 3, 2012 - my best friend ��� who lives about 15 miles away saw a ufo, possibly the same one.  \r\n\r\ntonight, january 4, 2012 - due to her sighting, i looked into the night sky, and the color changing orb is back.  movement is not as strong, but the color changing is definitely there.  we talked on the phone and although trees and such near her house made it where she couldn���t see it earlier in the night, she did spot it later this evening.\r\n\r\ncommentary - it might be a star or planet or something, and maybe pollution is causing the colors, but what is causing the movement?  it is usually about in the same spot (when it���s out there ��� it���s not always there) near orion���s belt.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":34608,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.497039102709074,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01042012-0028","longitude":-81.81728907754054,"occurred":1320476400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"South

buddy was ready to go we was'nt sure if we were going because of how cold it was going to be. he is my neighbor directly next door. i stood on my front steps drinking my coffee and smoking a cigarette. i looked through his front door to see if i see him but his lights were off so i figured he wasn't ready yet so i decided to stay outside and wait for him. i strangly noticed how warm it was out when the temperature was around 15 degress farenheit and i did'nt have a hat or gloves on. i proceeded to sit on my railing on my front patio for about a minute or two. i stood back up then walk over two the front of my door just standing there drinking my coffee and smoking my cigarette. at about 4:39 a.M. i noticed lights appearing from up the street approaching from behind the houses on my side of the street. as the light were getting closer i noticed the craft was descending at the first instant i though it was a plane but i realised i did'nt hear any noise so i figured the the engines did not work and it was about to crash but as soon as it got directly across the street from my house i heard a low airplane sound normally like you'll hear when there real high but this thing was just above roof about 10 feet there was a white light in front like it would have been landing gear lights or something than it was two white wing lights one on each side i did'nt really focus on the look of the object because like i said i thought it was a plane about to crash and it did not register to me the characteristics of hand so i walk to the corner of my street in the same path it was traveling to see because like i said i thought it was going to crash and the way it was traveling there's no airport in that direction especially that close for it to be descending that low so when i got top the top of the block it was gone. now i was standing in the middle of lancaster ave that's a busy street and when i walked in the street i was so fixaded on trying to relocate the object i didnt even look for cars coming i just walked in the street looking up and around. now the strangest thing was that i stayed outside on the steps so i could tell my friend what i saw and i was outside until 5:30 a.M. now i was outside in 15 degree weather with no hat or gloves on and i was not cold i get cold very easily and i was out there for an hour and i did'nt bother me after i went in the house i came back out to talk to my friend at 6:30 a.M. before he took his daughter to catch the bus for school and be out there for two minutes i was freezing i needed gloves and a hat. i never thought i would see one but i know what i saw and it wasn't no airplane or helicopter no blimp ballons nothing of that nature i live in the ghetto and theres no reason for military flights to be flying over my neighborhood and also it was traveling so slow that if it was a plane with no engine running it would have dropped out the sky like a rock. the person i was going hunting with was awake and he didnt hear anything so if it was a plane or helicopter he would have heard it.","distance":"21-100

come flying past near those objects) when i got out of the car and went into the restaurant.When i came out about 30 min. later they were gone.I know what an airplane looks like in the sky.What i saw , an airplane can't do.But today when i was telling about the incident to my mom and sister, i remembered the airplane, but it was vague. weird.I was thinking at first that what i saw must be a star or a planet. there weren't that many  \r\nstars visible,besides, it was bigger than a star,and much lower in the sky, but the few stars that were out, were up really high,where they usually are and this bright light was way, way below compared to the star or two i could see. it was just after dark.I looked over to the west to see what the sky looked like that way.....There was still a faint bit of light,with clouds, i guess from the sunset? i don't know, it was kind of pinkish, but that light was not in the eastern sky where i was looking.This is the 4th time i have seen a bright light like this since early dec. 2011, however, this is the first time i have seen objects shoot out from it and put on a show. i figure i was meant to see it for a reason, just don't know the reason? hopefully someone else saw this happen as well. i did not report the other sightings. my sister and mother who are aware of the other sightings suggested i report this to you.\r\nthanks for listening.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":34602,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.0912971,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01042012-0022","longitude":-94.510641,"occurred":1325642100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1325730692000,"summary":"Saw a bright light hovering still...3 objects shot up and away darting then stood still blinking....The large light then started to float slowly towards the ground until it was out of sight","tags":["light","hovering"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"64801","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Joplin, Missouri","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:17857"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82758,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1703}
