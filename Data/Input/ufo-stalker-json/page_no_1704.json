is supposed to show up on youtube shortly- search under {youtube title moved to fi section/cms/tg]\r\n   \r\n   my 12 yr old and i witnessed stationary lights in the sky again above oswego, il today. it was the same place and time of day as last november's sighting, 3:25pm in the western sky. the sun was getting lower in the sky and there were scattered clouds, though the sky was mostly sunny. the conditions were very similar to our sighting in november. one light appeared to the lower right (west) of the sun and the other was farther to the right (slightly northwest). we only saw them for a minute and then lost them and had to keep driving.\r\n   when i got to our home, about a mile away, i got out our sony handycam and caught the lights on it. the stationary lights were in the clouds directly west, to the right of the setting sun, and the lights were lower and bigger than the airplanes that were present before and after. i focused in on one light 2 minutes into the first video and it appeared almost a triangular shape with fuzzy edges and it was a glowing reddish-pink on the top point, white in the center and green on the bottom two points. i was inside and there is dirt on the window. the video is shaky but if you pause on it you can really see the colors. i didn't know it at the time but i also caught three lights later in the video.\r\n   these objects were stationary, not airplanes, as i was also watching and comparing them to airplanes with their contrails. there were no helicopters or small planes in the area when the lights appeared. \r\n   as i was looking at the second video i noticed that i caught what appears to be a dark disc skipping across the sky at minute 2:59. i don't think it was a bird because in the same area are geese with wings flapping and this was circular and much, much faster.\r\n   also, in the third video a dark helicopter flew by about 20 minutes after the lights were filmed, about 10 minutes after the disc. \r\n   right after the events our wii froze and wouldn't turn off, has never happened before, and our cell phone wasn't responding when we wanted to play songs, which also hasn't happened before. i am also having problems sending this, have tried twice and it isn't working. the video files in my email also aren't working.\r\n   strange events here in oswego today!\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

a helicopter closer and closer. then i noticed no flashing light and no sound. just a smooth constant slow movement closer and closer. i realized it was something i've never seen before. i just observed and studied the object and it looked to me like 3 brightly colored arms attached in the center spread out equally like a 3 pointed star. the object was 500-1000 feet in the air i suppose. it

various turns the light remained bright, and not dimming.This i thought to be unusual.I crossed over philmont ave and noticed that it was closer to me now in the sky. within 45 seconds i noticed 5 bright white lights in a straight line just above the tree line and approaching me. i pulled over my car and got out. i observed these bright lights as it flew directly over me. it was a clear night and what i saw was a triangular shaped craft with a red and green light in the front center of the craft. also were two sets of bright white lights on what appeared to be its wings. it was about 500

i couldn't explain it. i have since been leaning towards the explanation of it being a meteorite. based on its path which was almost directly down at close to a 90 degree angle, and the fact it was fairly light out, it would not be like any meteorite i have ever scene, but as far as logical explanations, that would have to be what it was. case solved! until this morning, again with my wife, thank god. driving my wife to work at 7:15 am, we both witness something that i cannot find a logical explanation for. headed west on rt 72 near elgin il, out of the front window and slightly to the right which is south, we saw a burst of light similar to that of a camera flash. this light descended straight down as if on a rope rapidly. in my opinion and these are all estimations, the light descend from the elevation of about 3000 ft to about 100 ft in a fraction of a second and was gone. if my wife hadn't immediately reacted to the sighting i would have absolutely thought i had imagined it. i know this is not a triangle vehicle doing loopedy loops in the sky but it is something i cannot explain. what also is intriguing to me is it proximity to our last sighting, in the same general area. it will continue to puzzle me thus the reason i share this story. it is the first time i have ever posted on this sight. keep your eyes to the skies my friends.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":34590,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.1034412,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01042012-0010","longitude":-88.3352261,"occurred":1325690100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1325702544000,"summary":"Bright light descending rapidly.","tags":["triangle"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Elgin, Illinois","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:17898"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Vero Beach","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I officially saw my first ufo!.... i was walking my dogs in the back yard, and i thought someone shot off a roman candle from across the water from the other neighborhood. it was a brilliant orange/amber orb with color flickering. it made no sound at all and was very beautiful. it was about 300-400 feet above me and i followed it till it disappeared to the east. a few seconds later another orb followed the same exact path rising from out of the tree line area across the water like the first one did. i couldn't get over how close it was and how quiet it was. i kept thinking it might be a helicopter with a spotlight, but the object was flickering/glowing and totally silent as it passed overhead and then faded into the east.\r\n\r\n\r\ni was very excited and thrilled when i was watching this event, i was not scared but amazed how brilliant and bright in color the object was.  i kept squinting my eyes trying to focus on the object to make out what it really was, but the object was to bright.

out the front door to watch. she went back inside for a video camera and we watched the show from the front door. the vids are posted on youtube. they didnot look like airplanes or helicopters. in fact an airplane flys by in the video clearly showing a contrast to the moving lights. i also called my friend who lives elswhere and he went outside his front door and watched the event from his house. there was one big white ball light that seemed to be accompnied by smaller red/orange lights. the white light hovered while the orange lights moved around in paths sometimes in formation. sometimes three sometimes four orange lights at a time would move about and change directions completely unlike an airplane or helecopter. they could fly in formation or break apart from eachother. sometimes they would disappear into space sometimes they would just go dark. more red/orange lights would appear to take their place. the whole event lasted about 20 minuets or half an hour. in the end the large white light dropped below the treetops taking the smaller orange lights with it. my wife and i where completely excited and wonderous of what we had just seen and recorded. my others around the world have posted the exact same thing over the next few days. here is a link to the vids\r\n[youtube link moved to fi section/cms/tg]","distance":"Over One

(at this point i had a suspicion already...Turned off the car and radio) got out of the car and looked directly at it......And as it was coming closer, i could begin to see inside the \"orb\" which was only a layer of light glowing around the craft, and inside was a disc shaped craft, with a classic bubble top, spinning, and gyrating, in a rocking motion, syncronius with the tilt of the rainlike red beams, at 1/2 second intervals.... there was also light \"spikes\" on the top and sides, giving the orb-like shape a triangle overlay kinda. as i was watching this saying \"omg, omg... do you see that\" my friend told me there was another one...  and there was, coming from the exact same area. they all passed overhead about ten seconds apart...As one dissappeared over the horizon, another would appear, and one would be overhead; so there were 3 visable all the time, one always close overhead scanning, as they all did. we saw 7 total, and very close, maybe 500 feet away as they passed, almost directly overhead. lots of detail in the \"lightshow\" but the craft were spinning and gyrating, so we couldn't make out small features. the orb shape, and the trialgle points were all bright orange-yellow, but the beams were like red rain scans that abriptly ended about 50 ft below the craft in a circular pattern, as if hitting an invisable surface. they were all identical as far as we could tell. all was silent. i could hear nothing from the sky. but my hair seemed to stand up a bit as each craft passed. it gave me chills and warm flashes. they seemed holographic almost. i am just in shock. they really are here. i have so many questions now...","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Window(s)","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":34566,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":19.5773768,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01032012-0023","longitude":-155.0653426,"occurred":1325403600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Hawaii","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,   Sphere,   Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1325645685000,"summary":"7 craft, orb sheilds with triangular points, but spinning discs inside, all traveling single-file, scanning, about 10 seconds between each craft traveling to the south from our north","tags":["disc"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/34566_submitter_file1__DSC00093.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2,"locationName":"Kurtistown, Hawaii","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:17918"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82758,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1704}
