another. then we saw a bigger object, same color of lights and shape, just bigger. i t had a small object flying all around it, it also looked as if it may have been changing shape. after about 11 mins of seeing these lights. there were no more and the other lights were out of sight. i worked in air and missile defense systems and know my way around aircraft of all types. what we saw was nothing that i have heard rumors of or have seen ever. if you guys have any theories or explanations please let me know cause my wife is a little \"freaked out\" after seeing what ever it was we saw that night. they all flew in the same pattern and direction, trajectory was a little different for each one. i could not get a pic and didn't think to get the camcorder, im still kicking myself in the

engaged in the energy that emanated from them.  later that same evening at about 8 pm i saw the orbs but this time they were much further away and their shape seemed to be less defined as if they were

southbound on route 9 in middletown, en route to an engagement with friends. when we were approximately 1 mile north of the randolph rd. exit, i noticed a glowing light above the jeep, traveling in the same direction (keep in mind, the top was off the jeep). the light was a gold/amber, and encompassed the entire object, which was egg/oval in shape. the light did not flash or emit a beam of any sort. there was also no noticeable vapor or sound (though we were on the highway, and it would have been difficult to discern sound). i realized this was no reflection, nor was it a conventional aircraft of any sort. its shape was distinct, and the entire object glowed. we began exiting on to the randolph road ramp (exit 11), which is a very long ramp that circles around and eventually travels north before ending at randolph rd. ironically, the object circled around in the same direction as the ramp (as if following us), but was now off to our left, beyond xavier high school, but probably not beyond route 17. as we approached the end of the ramp, i told my friend what i was witnessing. he immediately looked up to his left, and saw the object for a couple of seconds, before the object completely disappeared (as if someone turned off a light). it was dark at this time, and we did not notice any object after the light disappeared. we both were totally creeped out, and had the distinct feeling that whatever intelligence was controlling this object was aware of us and \"heard\" me tell my friend about its existence (thus the disappearing act). to this day, i feel as though the object was following us, as it only made the sharp right hand turn after we had already done so when exiting the highway (explaining why it was now to our left once we reached the end of the ramp). because this incident occurred over a decade ago, i may not have the date entirely correct. but i do remember it was labor day weekend, and i did file a hard copy report with mufon shortly after the incident. i'm only rehashing it today because there is a very similar report from someone (submitted on 1/3/2012), which recently occurred on the same highway in the same town.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

been admiring the christmas decorations through a very small town and just as we passed this town and was back on the dark roads i just happen to look up and notice 7 lights in a curved line, except 2 that were side by side lowest to ground, then 1 light after the two side by side ones, about powerline distance from the ground. it initially appeared to be near a powerline, but as i continued to drive, it was clearly not a part of the powerline. i could not stop looking in its direction and i was driving, i yelled and said \"do you see that\" repeatedly. i knew that they were not normal lights! witnessed by me and another(scared them)very defined, soft red-orange lights. as i was looking back in my rear view mirror i saw one quickly float away and then we were out of view as if they all vanished. i am not a ufo tracker, this is just something i wanted to share because it was something like i'd never seen before. i thought maybe fireworks, but the lights were there like a strung chrismtas decor (which it was totally not)and it was to defined and glowing, nothing visible to see any connection. the formation was almost like the side of the mcdonald's \"m\" and it was not a bulb type glow. the only thing is that i wish i would have taken a picture, but i do believe that by the time i would have had access to my phone or a camera it would have been gone after i saw it vanish. as we continued to travel i was a bit shakened and continued to look around in the sky hoping to see it again. fyi, this was a dark rural area with very few vehicles and much land for farming. as we'd continued i also saw a bright white light, i thought that from the distance it caught my eye that it was a planet, well we got a little closer and i shared that maybe that was a helicopter, however, it had no sound... i am totally freaked out by this time... this was about 30 minutes apart and they were not similar at all, totally different. the white lights (2)  looked as if it was under a helicopter, but again no sound and you could hear anything on that dark road, and it hovered as if it was still. the sky was so clear i think that i saw every star in the constellation that night, i even saw a falling star. but the lights i can not explain. maybe the military was testing... i don't know. i just know that it was creepy.

at the sky and stars, i must have been starring at the sky for about 30 to 40 minutes, when a large glowing yellow disc, flew across my field of view, from my left to my right, across the sky, i could'nt keep following it with my eyes because my neighbors house was blocking my view. i quikly sat up in bed, because i knew what i saw, it was clear, and just by the way it was moving, i knew it was'nt normal. it moved straight across the sky, but it made a sudden left to right move, as if it were trying to avoid something in the sky. from where i witnessed it, it was bigger than a softball, but smaller than a basketball. it seemed like it was high in the sky, but it wasnt covered by clouds, so it was'nt higher than a mile or so. i could clearly make out a perfect circle inside another circle, with a dot in the middle, it was glowing yellow, like a bulb. it was a quite night, because no one had electricity. i did'nt hear a pin drop, and i know i should've heard something, because when i see a plane miles high in the sky, i can still hear a plane moving through the clouds. the disc was flying lower than a plane would, but no sound at all, no trails, and just by the akward movement, i know it was'nt something normal. i would have to say if it looked like the size of a mini basketball from where i was, and it looked like it was no higher than 2 miles in the sky, then it had to be large. i was able to look at it for at least 2 seconds, i did'nt have time to take pictures, but i drew out a sketch of what i saw that nite. if we had electricity, then i would have never witnessed this, because i normally don't lay in bed starring at the sky after waking up. i have thought about what i saw alot, it was'nt a fire fly, because it was way too cold, not a plane or helicopter, because i did'nt hear a sound, and not a reflection of a car driving by, because i did'nt hear any cars at the time, and there were trees knocked down around my streets for anyone to drive. it was moving fast, but i think i could've followed it with my finger if i could. my friend told me i should look online, to check to see if anyone else witnessed it, but i did'nt feel like i had to, because i know what i saw, and don't think anyone had a better view than me.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

awesome, such a clear night, the milky way was beautiful. orion, perseus, sirius, polaris,,, jupiter, were all magnificent. i saw 3 meteorites and right before midnight the moon set. one of the best new years, ever!!! then on my way back i came around the corner towards moab, and there they were. two orange lights. i don't know what they were, but they were ascending slowly and to the east of ursa major.They weren't helicopters.They were orange-red, about 5 times larger than jupiter and 1 magnitude brighter than sirius that night. i would have to guess about 2,000 - 3,000 feet above sand flats. i called the local law enforcement dispatch and asked if their deputies were reporting anything. i reassured her that i am not crazy, haven't had alcohol in months and i don't do drugs and as a matter of fact i used to work for this law enforcement agency. she suggested they were fireworks.. i advised her they were not fireworks, the light was constant and had been there for 4 minutes. then, one faded in about 5 seconds, the other faded about 30 seconds later at the same rate as the first.

location is orlando-sanford int'l.  \r\n\r\nupon randomly opening my back door looking out to the southern sky after dark, i noticed the (questioned) object right away.  at least two (known) small aircraft with common running and landing light gear (as well as \"sound\") were in the area, thus gaining my focused attention to the object. i immediately proceeded outside my home and exited a screen enclosure to reduce my view obstruction.\r\n\r\ni categorize this object as \"out of the ordinary\". it was a large orb-like object, bright copper/bronze color, traveling north/northeast from the northern area of the st. john's river branch west of i-4 causeway.  it ran totally silent, in acute contrast to the aforementioned aircraft in the area. it did not blink, pulse, or otherwise display any color variation whatsoever.  it appeared larger (about the size of 2-3 common police helicopters, but without the distinct engine noise of same) as it proceeded closer to my point of observation. as it continued its path, the object made a left 30 degree arcing turn followed by a 60 degree arc to the right (an \"s\" configuration if you will).  it proceeded in a southeasterly direction and faded out of sight.  the object maintained a constant altitude of approx.400 to 600 feet.  at the time of the event, i had no immediate access to a multimedia device and just wanted to maintain visual contact for as long as i could.\r\n\r\nafter the event, i elected not to immediately report the sighting, as i was compelled to re-evaluate the event and make other comparisons before

church. i looked up and saw a rectangular object with strobe lights flashing on the left of the rectangle and i could barely see the white strobe light flashing on the far right of the triangle because of the trees.The center strip had an orange glow .The trees were obstructing some of the view, and the street lights were blending in with the lighted object. this object was as wide as two traffic lanes and about two to three hundred feet above the top of the trees. i immediatly thought it was a traffic helicopter but soon realized it was hovering. i had the moon roof shield open and watched this object go over my car over the top of the trees, and as i looked to the rear of my car at the object i soon realized i could still see the orange glow and thought then the glow was coming from under the object.I immediatly thought of turning around and following the object as it moved southeast , but soon realized ward parkway is one way for both sides. i really did not know what to think. i would also mention there were people across from the church on the road going east and west standing on the curb or sidewalk. i do not know if they were waiting for the traffic to move so they could cross the street to go to the church, or were watching this rectangular object. this experience is strange in that i did not really put all the information together until i got home. i know there is a plane service that you can rent to view the plaza lights by air and thought that was what i had seen. but what i saw was a lot lower in altitude towards the ground. i had the radio on
