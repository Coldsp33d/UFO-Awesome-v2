object at least two other times.\r\n\r\nthe first time we noticed the object, it was earlier in 2011 (may or april) at around midnight.  it pulsated and lit up and wobbled, wiggled back and forth and went every which way for about 10 minutes.  we even reported it to marion county sheriff department.  by the time the sheriff arrived, the object disappeared into the west.\r\n\r\naround 12/15/12 i was sleeping with my window open.  at about 5 am i was awoken by a bright light pulsating above our neighbor's house. i was very scared and told myself it wasn't really happening, but as i thought about it more and looked up, it very much so was there and real. so i got up, went to my window and looked at the object for about 3 minutes making sure of what i saw. i then went into the bathroom and made sure my eyes were adjusted to the light. when i returned it was still there, it was really close and stayed about another 2 - 3 minutes.  the object was similar to the object(s) i have seen prior but much closer, brighter and active.\r\n\r\nafter that event, i decided to purchase a hd video camera that would capture the object at night.  i then checked the sky more frequently at times i had seen it prior and making sure it wasn't a star,planet or other identifiable object.\r\n \r\nthen on 12/26/11, at about 8pm i walked out of my house and looked to the western sky where i have seen the object(s) before and to my amazement, there was the/a pulsating light above the horizon. i right away ran inside and grabbed my video camera and captured the light in the night sky. i was very nervous, so the video wasn't the best, but i did capture as much as i could. the light hung around for about 5-7 min moving in different direction and then slowly disappeared going west towards the gulf of mexico.\r\n\r\nsix days later on 1/1/12 i decided to check the sky at the time i have been seeing it, like i do regularly now, and it again was in the western sky. being less scared this time i grabbed my camera and videoed it, about 5 min, till it disappeared to the west the same direction it always goes.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

there were 2 sets of 2 white lights on each side of the craft. they flashed but a lot slower that airplanes lights do, it had 3 oval window like things on the very bottom and their was a soft yellow light coming through them. i told my son that i didn't think it was helicopter, and it kind of looked like an airplane, my creative son said it was a space craft looking for us. it continued on without sound, i didn't watch it very long after as it is really cold and i had to get my son inside. after an online search showed no airplanes or anything like this i decided maybe i should report

party of five of us witnessed a ufo in houston, tx in the se side of the city. we were on the balcony patio of my apartment with a great view of the sky looking to the west from the se side of houston in la porte. it had 6-7 bright lights in the shape of a circle spinning around in all directions not just from left to right. it also had a spotlight that seemed to extend about 20ft out from it that would come on at random times. it was going all the way up to the fog and flying fast across the se area. the lights were changing from red, blue, green, gold, and white. it was amazing. i was looking thru my telescope viewfinder and could see the lights clearly spinning in formation in a perfect circle but there was nothing in between the lights or the center of the aircraft. we had binoculars as well. five of us saw it and a friend of my girlfriend at another house was looking at it and may have gotten video. i'm going to see if it comes out again tonight. never seen anything like it. it was either some amazing very large remote controlled device or a real life ufo. but based on the fast darting speed, nothing seen in between the lights or in the center and that it hovered at times in one place and went up to the clouds it had to be out of this world. i hope it comes again because i have my camera ready. it was only there several minutes, went down in the horizon and a few moments later came back up for several more minutes. the lights spun left to right and up and down and at angles. it was nuts! i can't find any remote controlled devices like that anywhere online. it wasn't a jet, plane or helicopter. i see those all the time around here. also, based on how plane's look in the sky from our patio this thing could have been as big as a plane or slightly

at the trees & sky facing the east. a bright white dot appeared suddenly appeared to the east about seventy degrees from horizon line. i watched it for about 30 secs & it didn't move at all. i quickly grabbed the binoculars from right inside the door, always looking up:). i looked back to the same spot & didn't see it any longer. i looked through the binoculars & found it, i focused & another 30 secs or so  passed then another appeared. another two minutes passed, my arms stared to tingle, the second one just disappeared as it had appeared. the first one still hadn't move any further away & in the same spot. i looked away couldn't see anything with my naked eye, i then found the original again through binoculars & watched for another minute or so & it seemed to start to slowy get smaller. it lasted for about 5or 6 minutes total.  both of the objects were round & seemed to pulse with a bright fire like yellowish glowingness. i only felt happy & thankful to see these orbs...I waved, said hi and wished they'd come on down.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":34499,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.956635,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01012012-0050","longitude":-82.4547876,"occurred":1325380500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,
