her bunny cage, then came back in, as\r\nshe did a orange light caught my eye i said 'what the heck is that'\r\nand bent over to look closer...Still couldn't figure it out so\r\nmentioned to my kids about it, only one got up with me as they were\r\nfocused on the tv music performance, but she and i went to the porch\r\nand saw the orange star-like through the trees.\r\nwe both were amazed, and trying to figure out what they could be. we\r\nnoticed venus on the other side of the sky and noted it was smaller\r\nand dimmer than the orange light on the other side of the house, near\r\nthe lower left side stars of orion. we decided it was not a star as it\r\nwas rising very slowly, too slowly to be a plane or fireworks. so\r\nslowly i likely would not have even noticed it was moving had it not\r\nbeen orange and so bright.\r\nthen suddenly at about 25 degrees above the horizon it disappeared,\r\nthere was no flash or explosion like fireworks would have made and\r\nagain it had been rising too slowly for 3 or 4 minutes (from just 5 or\r\n10 degrees above the horizon when i first saw it) before disappearing.\r\nwe watched for about 30 seconds to one minute, then it reappeared in\r\nthe same spot, with another one exactly like it slightly higher and to\r\nits left. then they both started rising again very slowly...Steadily.\r\nafter 2 or 3 more minutes. i had time to run inside and get my camera\r\nto take 2 photos, my daughter tried to take 2 on her iphone too both lights disappeared again without any flash, sound, or explosion. at about 45 degrees above the horizon for the first one and maybe 50 degrees up for the 2nd higher one, they just winked out. they seemed very far off from us, but we heard no sounds.\r\nwe both watched for several minutes but they did not reappear, and we\r\nchecked for the next hour or so but never saw the lights again. our\r\npictures were so dark, nothing could be seen. after lightening and\r\nturning the contrast all the way up on the computer the photos would\r\nshow the outline of the trees in the foreground but not the lights.\r\ni am an artist, and painted what we saw the next morning, as the photos didn't turn out. the painting shows the final moments when both lights were seen at the highest point nearing orion's stars. the first one had risen from the horizon of mountains off in the distance to a mid point,through the trees in the foreground... then winked out then came back with the second one before both started rising up to that final highest point at about 45 degrees up. \r\n\r\n\r\n

so we left early about 10:25pm est. as we were walking down the driveway toward the car i noticed a red glowing light in the sky. it seemed very unusual because it was floating way to low to be a plane and was also much lower than i see helicopters typically fly in my area. i gave the object the benefit of the doubt thinking it may just be a helicopter coming at us from head on. yet as i continued to watch the object and as it got closer to us is when it became definitive that this object was flying way to low to be a helicopter.  in addition to the low altitude this object was flying at, there were no faa lights on the object and this object made absolutely no noise as it slowly made its way past us. it was just a glowing red orb. \r\n\r\nthe object's distance from us was about a block over and about 100 yards or so above the tree tops. the object flew in a north to south direction. \r\n\r\nwhile watching the object the two of us had an eerie feeling because of how out of ordinary it was.  the object was moving slow enough that i was able to get out my girlfriend's camera and take a video of the object.  unfortunately, the video does not do the sighting justice. what you can notice from the video is the color of the object (bright glowing red) and that there is no sound from this object. what you cannot tell from the video is how slow the object was traveling and how low the object was to the ground. i zoomed in and out in the video so that is why the object appears larger and smaller. we were able to watch the object until it was so far away it went out of sight. the entire time of the sighting the speed of the object never changed and it did not change its flight path.

8 people total including me. two friends and i were near the river watching fireworks when we saw a bright orange light hovering over north horizon, close to where fireworks had been set off. i was interested because it stationary, figured it was related to fireworks. then, right when i pointed it out to my friends, it began moving toward sse at a steady pace. the orange light faded into a hazy oval/egg shape that was a very dim pinkish violet and almost translucent against clear sky, then disappeard over trees. was maybe a few thousand feet.\r\n\r\ni pulled my husband aside and told him about it and decided not to mention it to the others thinking it was a fluke. then five minutes later i spotted two more from same origin and alerted the rest of the party, who all witnessed the lights too. the lights seemed to travel a similar path as the first one, then they veered slightly away from eachother, then faded out of sight.\r\n\r\nfrom then on for about an hour several more appeared, moving about the same speed, some brightening then dimming, but eventually all of them dimmed and disappeared altogether.\r\n\r\nwe counted 30, but supposed there may have been more during the time we weren't looking for them.  the last four seemed to appear at the same time. one disappeared and the remaining three formed a triangular shape, held the shape and then all disappeared at the same time. we didn't see anymore after that (about 12:45am).\r\n\r\nwe ruled out all possibilities-they were not flares, too fast for hot air balloons, couldn't have been aircraft because they were completely silent, were definitely not satelites or shooting stars because some changed direction and were traveling too slow.\r\n\r\nmy husband recorded about 7 minutes on his cell phone. most of it cannot be seen, but a few were captured, however very dim. we considered reporting the incident but felt we would not be taken seriously as it was new year's and lights were going off everywhere.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path

a reddish orange ball of light in the sky. it seemed to be hovering in the sky to the right of orion's belt in the western sky. i then located jupiter, mars, sirius and betelgeuse, the brightest objects i could think of. this object was none of them. i never took my eyes off of the object. i wanted to know what this thing was. we were traveling north at approx. 10 miles per hour. the object seemed to be moving very slowly to the south. no noise, no aircraft lights. the object looked twice as big as jupiter does in the sky. i work at an airport and can say for sure that this was not a commercial airplane. it seemed to move very slowly to the south for approx. 20-30 seconds and then dimmed out to nothing, just vanished. there was sea fog in the area at the time, so i dont know if the object vanished into thin air or thick fog. i was very excited to have seen this object. we arrived to our destination about 10 seconds after the object disappeared. we were talking about it and found that another group of people (3) had seen it as well from their golf cart. i have never before seen anything out of the ordinary in the skies. i feel that the object may have been a ufo, since i have found no other explanation. i periodically scanned the night skies until 1am, but never saw the object again. i hope others have seen the same thing to help verify my
