airplane or a helicopter, but slow enough it looked deliberate. at first we saw two, then a third and a fourth. they sped their way from the south headed northwest and we ran up a small hill for a better view, two of us pulled out our phones trying to capture this, but nothing would show on the screens. one guy yelled for another adult to come out to watch. the fourth ball of light bobbled in a short up& down fashion. as they crossed our viewing area, the third ball seemed to wane in color and eventually disappear from sight. when we thought they had all passed, maybe a minute had gone by, two more came from exactly the same direction- heading in the same direction. it was commented as odd that their flight pattern was so close, low and without a single sound! since we were leaving anyways, i got in my car and drove to the very top of the ridge, that is all farm land and pulled over to watch the last two fly overhead (as the visibility stretched probably 20miles in that

of the car to go inside (in the passenger seat), and when i looked out my passenger side window, there it was. i yelled for my mom to look because she was getting out of the car as well. we both darted behind the car, and stood in our drive way completely mesmerized by the motionless, hovering, ball of red light. after about 5 or 10 second of watching, the hovering ball of light slowly lowered. it didn't zig zag or anything, simply just lowered. the second it began to lower, the quiet neighborhood all at once became loud with every single dog barking. it was so weird because they all started barking at the exact same time, when it started lowering. it was like it was rehearsed. it went below the trees after about 15 or so seconds of watching it. since i couldn't see the light anymore, i ran inside and immediately called my boyfriend to see if he could see it (he was on iroquois road)and he went outside and said yes, he could see it. he told me it was red, pretty small and looked like a glowing red star (which is odd because it was huge when my mom and i saw it) and he said it was going up at an extremely fast pace. he told me he lost sight, but said he'd keep an eye on it, and i never heard anything more of him.\r\n\r\ni've spent so many hours of my life watching alien shows,and i never thought i would actually be the one entering my report to mufon myself. this is a sighting i will never forget. it's changed my life.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then
