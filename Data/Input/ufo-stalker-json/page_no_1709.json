Unknown","city":"Mattoon","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was a lovely middle august evening, and i was home playing a game of cards with my mother while also watching the television sporadically. at the time we lived in a low income housing project set up like a very long cul-de-sac of duplex apartment buildings. the sun had just set and we were enjoying our card game when the cable service went out. i thought to myself, \"ah, this is just a random cable outage\", and didn't really give it a second thought. then around 5 or 10 minutes after the cable went out, the power went out as well. it was a clear night, so it wasn't an outage from a thunderstorm and we rarely get brownouts, let alone blackouts even in the height of summer. i decide to carefully work my way through the dark house and get a look out the kitchen window. at this time i was beginning to become a litte more concerned because this was becoming a rather unusual circumstance, as the entire neighborhood and surrounding area as far as i could see was pitch black. about 5 minutes or so passed from the time the power in the apartment went out to when it came back on, but all of the street lights in the area remained out as well as some of the homes visible across the small field. some of the housing project tenants were outside talking to each other, most likely about the outage and i never did go outside myself to get a real good look around (regrettably). i went back to my bedroom and looked out the windows to see if i could see any type of lights on anywhere in those directions to figure out how widespread this outage was. as i looked out the southward facing window in my bedroom, i noticed a light in the sky towards the southeast that seemed very out of place. i had always been fascinated by the night sky for as long as i could remember and was very good at telling the difference between stars, planets, comets, planes, helicopters, satellites, etc, and the light in the sky resembled none of the above. i even opened my window to listen outside to see if there was any noise coming from the direction of the light in the sky, just to be positive that it was not a helicopter searchlight and i could discern nothing audible coming from that way. this just confirmed my initial thoughts that this didn't fit the appearance a helicopter searchlight, because there is a visible shaft of light that comes down in the direction it is pointed, and this object was just a stationary sphere of light hovering in place. i wasn't able to very accurately gauge the distance away from my apartment that this object was, but it was roughly a mile or two away at the most and around about a mile up in the air possibly. from my perspective, it was around 45-55 degrees above the horizon. it was larger than a star by roughly tenfold, but it didn't shine much brighter than one. i watched the light just sit in one place for at least 45 minutes, maybe an hour at most. the whole time that i am watching it, i am pleading to my mother to come and see this light so that i can have at least one other witness to corroborate this event. finally, i was able to convince my mother to come and observe the light through the window. no more than a minute or so after my mother got to the window and observed it as well, the light just accelerates towards the northwest directly over the apartments at an unknown, but very high rate of speed and was long gone before i even had a chance to get to another vantage point. i wasn't able to see whether or not it was ascending as it shot off in the northwesterly direction, so i have no clue where it headed after that initial rapid acceleration. i really wish i had owned a camera or camcorder at the time, i would have loved to have recorded this occasion in another location besides my still vivid memory of the event. maybe someone besides me and my mother witnessed this as well and had the privilege of filming it, but i won't get my hopes up.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

the clouds as visible by the half moon that night. one cloud caught my attention because it appeared to be shape shifting. as i continued to observe and look for a clarification, it appeared that the cloud wasn't moving, but an object was gliding under the cover of the clouds. denver has very large low hanging clouds. this object would be estimated to be 1000 feet wide or larger. it appeared for 30 seconds from the time i saw it overhead until it vanished quietly in the night sky. my conclusion was that this craft was only seen because of the contrast from the low hanging clouds and the half moonlight creating a difficulty to cloak itself. it had no lights of any kind, and i heard no sounds from the night sky. to place a comparison, there were jets flying so high that night that were barely visible, but yet a sonic roar across the sky could be heard. \r\ni have a professional background in the field of observations and inspections, so i have a very skilled and trained eye with a

took off at about 45 to 60 degree angle heading north and then west over the land then took a southern heading at a speed too fast to be an airplane or helocopter. not quite the speed of a shooting

far left (fast) lane & joked with my friend about the sedona 'wanna-be' \"hollywood\" sign on the mini-mountain to my right.  my friend said \"that's the landmark just prior to the exit we needed to get off of.  he told me to move over to the far right lane.  at that moment my car radio went to static.  since i needed to pay attention to the traffic & move to the far right lane i asked him to tune the radio while looking at it.  i looked up in to my rear view mirror only to see 5 white compact cars behind me.  i mentioned that it was odd asking him \"where did all of the traffic go?\"  all 5 cars passed me on the left.  i noticed all 5 cars had nevada plates. a few seconds later i saw a freeway sign that said kingston - 50 miles.  i asked my friend \"isn't kingston near laughlin, nv?\"  i came to a crest of freeway only to view laughlin which bordered bullhead city, ca. at that point i realized i was now heading west on i-40.  freaked out, i pulled over & we both paced the side of the road trying to figure out how we got there.  we got back in the car & turned around heading east on i-40 & came upon a van.  i honked & my friend asked the driver what time it was.  it was 5:30pm, 3 hours & 20 minutes had passed.  to this day, i've heard 3 other stories of missing time on this stretch of road, one of which was from a trucker.  truckers had to log there time & miles.  this confirmed we were not crazy.  it's been nearly 18 years since this incident.  neither of us experienced any physical or psychological trauma.  i would like to know if anyone else can't relate to what
