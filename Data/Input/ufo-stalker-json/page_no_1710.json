across the sky in a straight line. i almost couldn't see it but it had a soft white glow. i thought it was a fast moving cloud in the night sky but no other clouds are visible, clear skies. and i have never seen a cloud move that fast. the shape reminded me of a bomber but with no wings. it did have a very prominent \"tail\" like a bomber would. i heard no sounds from its direction. i watched it fly across the horizon for about 20 seconds and then it was gone behind the treeline, moving east.\r\n\r\nit might sound crazy but it really looked like a ghostly image. i also thought it might be some kind of a cloud but it kept its shape the entire time i watched it. it could have been a smoke cloud from someone's fire but i've never seen smoke in such a shape or moving so fast and in a direct flight path when i felt no wind.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

was on a cold evening in january that i was alone at home, sitting at my desk writing when i suddenly had the urgent need to go to the kitchen. so i stood up from my desk when i entered the kitchen i heard a low humming sound coming from outside and whan i looked at the window i saw bright lights coming from a disk shaped thing -where from the humming sound came - and the lights were very bright - yellow,green and red-orange.\r\ni was absolutely amazed and stood still looking at this happening. the thing was at a distance about  ca.10-15 metres outside just in front of the parking area so the cars were at the other side of the light object.\r\ni felt i shouldn't move - had the feeling that i couldn't move anyway - and i heard the constant humming coming from the object that was hovering over the earth ca.4-5 metres above the ground. when i had been standing there looking for some time i suddenly felt that i should call my friend to ask him if he saw what i was looking at. to my surprise i managed to walk into the next room to call him and told him what i was looking at and asked him if he could see it too(this was really rather silly as he lived at some distance from my house and couldn't have seen the object)but he told me to get my binoculats to try to see better and if there was somebody inside the object. so i went back to the kitchen with the binoculars and thought that the object would likely have disappeared but to my surprice it was still there. when i looked through the binoculars nothing had changed - the object was still there hovering and glowing in green,yellow and red-orange colours. i saw this very clearly.I could only stand there and look but suddenly i could hear that the drumming sound changed somehow and became a little deeper and at the downside of the object there appeared a black metallic looking cylinder ca.1 1/2 meter wide and this cylinder moved slowly down towards the surface of the ground. i was completely stunned at this sight and didn't know what was happening. i had the impression that i should go on looking and so i did. after ca.2 minutes the cylinder touched the ground and began boring down under the surface -still with this drumming sound. now i began to wonder if some neighbours were looking at this too but i saw nobody - and couldn't hear any voices from outside. i thought this was quite suprising and wondered that maybe my neighbours were too afraid to utter a sound.\r\ni remember looking at my watch and realized that i had been looking at this object for more than half an hour as the clock now was half past nine( it was just nine o'clock when it began). i stood there and saw that the cylinder was still boring in the ground and the cylinder had to be pretty long as it had been boring down in the ground all this time. after some time i saw the cylinder move up again from the surface - very slowly - untill it disappeared again into the oval object. i couldn't imagine what the purpose could be of boring into the earth in front of the building like this, but when the cylinder had completely joined the object again the summing became lower like it was in the beginning of the event. \r\nthen, again - the summing sound changed a little and the colours were blinking a little quicker as the object began to move upwards slowly higher and higher until i saw it in the air about ca. 100 metres high. then suddenly it moved slowly to north  and still went further up - higher and higher - and at last flew rather quickly in the north direction to the mountains in north of the town. the night was still and clear - you could see the stars in the sky but i saw how the object flew rather slowly longer in the north direction until i lost sight of it. \r\ni looked at my watch and it was a few minutes past ten when i lost sight of it.So i had been looking at the object for a whole hour. i thought how amazing this had been and  was sure that many people had been looking at the phenomenon besides me - and there would be some articles in the papers and some news about this \"ufo\" - sighting next day. to my big surprise nothing of this sort happened - no articles - nothing - and when i asked my neighbours the next day if they had seen something unusual the night before - just outside the building - nobody  remembered having seen anything unusual. today i'm still wondered what really happened and why i alone(?) had been seeing this object. wish i could get an explanation....","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

went to work and as i looked out into the back yard; i noticed that there was a bright band of what looked like clouds traveling straith up into the air. it did not look like any cloud that i had ever seen; so i looked closer and realized that what i was seeing was impossible. i ran back into the house and asked my daugther to bring her digital camera and i pointed out the thing to her and she took a photo of it. what we could see with our eyes was not what showed up on the digital screen on the back of her camera; we could see this double band of bright white/yellow goldish cloud like thing that extended straight up and down for about 3 to 4 miles (this was very visible against the dark rain clouds in the backgroud). what was  visible on the camera was a thin trail that went straight up for about a mile before taking a sharpe 90 degree left turn that went out for about half a mile before taking a 45 degree turn back into the opposite direction then it turned another 90 degree turn and continued of the screen. what we saw with our eyes, was not what the camera picked up. we went inot the house and i showed the photo to my wife and she finally agreed with me that very strange things are happening in the skies over our community. this is the 3rd sighting that i have witnessed and the first to be caught on camera. this is the truth as i know it to be; i served 21 years in the us army and now work as dod employee here in germany. this incident made it impossible for me not to make this report; i have seen a lot of unexplained things, but this one was just to close to

and traveling overhead to the northeastern part of the sky.  at first i thought it was some kind of low flying plane or helicopter, but it was fuzzy in appearance and flaring outward in all directions. it moved slowly. soon afterwards it flew directly over me, and behind the cloud deck off to the northeast. next about 20 seconds later, i saw two more orange lights traveling in formation, heading on the same course as the first object.  the two objects appeared from the same direction, same course, same speed, and same altitude, flying in a single file pattern. as i tried to get a closer look at them, i noticed that each was a fuzzy, glowing, light orange ball or orb. they did not appear to have any solid noticeable center, and their outlines were faint and semitransparent (almost halo-like). these objects made no sound at all, had no beacons or flashing lights on them, and just seemed to float along. their speed would be equivalent to a small plane or helicopter. they were not moving very fast. but these lights were definitely not aircraft. i have no idea how large they may have been or how far away they actually were. what is interesting is that when the objects were directly overhead, i noticed a slight wobble and floating movement (unconventional propulsion), in which one of objects moved slightly away from the other one, slowing down for a moment and then speeding up again to meet back in formation with the other object.  after a few seconds they continued to travel at the same speed towards the northeast.  my thoughts were that these two strange orange orbs were following, or catching up with the first orange orb.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

the objects because they were brighter than airplanes and seemed to be hovering over the ?Lafyette? area. i thought it was just an airplane with the airport near by but these objects were brighter than the stars and airplanes i'm used to seeing. the objects didn't do anything they just seemed to hover there, the less brighter one higher the brightest. i don't really have any feelings about what i saw because i'm not sure what it was...Plane? flares? helicopter? i'm just not sure, if anything i'm just confused. i lost sight od them after turning onto 120th east bound to go home.

back to the report i filed with mufon that happened on 7/13/11 when i sighted a 250'-500' triangle while eastbound on i-10 at mm345.  read this report first because on this same night after seeing my first ufo my eyes where searching the night sky as i continued driving toward san antonio, tx.  keep in mind that i leave ft. stockton between 8-10 pm and arrive san antonio 1-3 am.  at about mm485 just east of kerrville i noticed a large star (4-5 times larger than normal) at a low altitude, about 5-10 degrees above the horizon.  sometimes the hills and trees would block my view of it.  i kept sight of it all the way into san antonio after i had taken the i-410e loop and continued north on i-35.  at this point it was at a 45 degree angle up and about 15 degrees to the east of the interstate.  then i exit at mm175.  i continued to see this same sequence daily (monday-friday) for about 4-6 weeks.  then i started noticing the star farther west, earlier in the evening.  in mid september i saw it from the ft. stockton yard (mm259) at 8 pm.  i had always watched it closely and i couldn't really see if it was moving, sometimes i thought it was, but being in a big truck bouncing around i was never sure, even though i had stopped on occasion and watched it for a few minutes.  i continued to see this star almost every night (m-f) in different locations.  it would be below the high clouds but the low clouds would block my view of it.  on november 23, 2011, at 10:25 pm i stopped at mm361 near ozona, tx to watch this star that was a little south of ozona, as i watched it did a little dance and then moved up and down, i really was not sure if i saw the dance or if it was in my head but i knew that i saw it move up and down.  it appeared to be about 2-5 miles away and i kept sight of it at a 20 degree angle all the way into san antonio mm550.  i'm on my return trip home, same night, november 24 now, and i see this star object at i-10 mm545, it's just a little south of the interstate and i keep sight of it off and on through kerrville mm508, at 4:25am i stop at a parking area mm498 and watch this thing for a couple of minutes and i'll be damned if it didn't do another little dance in the sky and then start moving west.  i jumped in the truck and continued west on i-10 and kept sight of it until mm488 when it disappeared over the horizon.  i was traveling at 65 mph and estimate it was traveling about 150 mph.  i won't go into detail about all of the sightings, but i have seen them move up and down, left and right often.  i've seen them turn off their lights at dawn as they speed up heading west.  it seems that they travel east later evening and travel west early morning, but this does not hold true to all sightings.  lately i've been seeing 2-3 objects over ft. stockton about 7-9pm, often i see one just south of ozona about 9-11pm, i don't see much over sonora.  just after christmas 2011 i saw 3 objects se of junction at about 6am, and lately they have been over sw san antonio on a regular basis.  since christmas i have seen an increase.  on 12/28 i saw 5 star-like objects on my way to san antonio and on 12/29 i saw 9 on my to sa.  i looked at one with low power binoculars and i could see the constant glowing/pulsing white light and a small red flashing light off one side with a little bit of a blue/green light.\r\ni have pointed these out to some of the other drivers but they seem not to care or don't want to know.","distance":"Over One
