something like what was reported.  i live in carson near wilmington near 220th street.  i lived in carson for 11 years now and just recently (the last 2 years) i have had a couple of ufo sightings in carson.  one time a 1 1/2 years ago while pumping gas at arco across from the sheriff station i saw a red glowing pulsating object  high in the sky.  it looked like a sighting i saw in culver city in the early 80's, it was a bright white object that moved like a fire fly high in the night sky.  but what concerns me is the recent sightings, which seems to be too close to home.  at night (actually morning) about 1am - 5:30am (off and on) there is a strange light that (which source has to be coming from the north) only eliminating in a certain section of my bedroom. what is really eerie, it makes my ceiling fan glow a faint light.  when i started looking for the light source i saw this brilliant light in the sky through my window (that resembled 2 car head in the sky) between 2 roof tops.  the next day i started to look for possible light source (e.G. street lights, neighborhood light, and power lines) but i could not find a legitimate light source.  \r\n\r\nthis has been happening intermittently throughout the month.  so this morning (12/26/2011 at 5am) when i saw this strange light shining on my wall i grabbed my cell phone and recorded the event about 3 times.  then i found my cannon camera and recorded better video footage.  so all together i recorded the event 6 times.  to make sure i wasn't dreaming i woke up my daughter and she looked out my window and she saw the same thing. \r\n \r\nnote: i did what i could to record this event, but the footage is not the best quality because i was recording inferior equipment (i.E., lg cell phone, and cannon digital camera), plus i recorded the event through my bedroom window which is dirty with finger prints, plus i was trying to record through some aluminum blinds, so there was a lot of jerky movement.  i would have gone outside in backyard, but quite frankly i was scared.  \r\n\r\ni would like to talk to someone about this before this is published (if it is published) to the

\"squad\" was moving along the perimeter of the park closest to i-96. my friend jason was the first to notice the lights and point them out. we looked ne across the park to see 8 orange glowing ufos paired off in a staggered formation about 30-40 degrees above the horizon. as we looked across the highway at the gerald ford international airport we saw searchlights moving across the sky over the airport.\r\n\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\r\nmy first impression based on the pulsating glow of the objects was that of aerial flares. however the night was breezy and if the objects had indeed been flares they would have been drifting in the wind. \r\n\r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions in detail.\r\nthe 8 objects remained stationary,

(the image included is a approximation of the event superimposed on a screenshot from the google road cam.)\r\n\r\n6.How did you lose sight of the object?\r\nthe objects disappeared one by one over the course of 45 seconds to a minute, i personally witnessed at least two of the objects disappear as we continued moving along the perimeter of the park. by the time we came to a halt, the objects had all vanished.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":34363,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.20679,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12282011-0008","longitude":-91.8305334,"occurred":1255590000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arkansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1325138683000,"summary":"Formation of 8 paired, glowing orange lights, steady but pulsating slightly","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/34363_submitter_file1__UFOsighting.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":804,"locationName":"Grand Rapids, Arkansas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:19380"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Destin","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On the night of may 13, 2010 at about 9pm, my companion and i were sitting on the beach in destin, fl just behind pompano joe's restaurant on old hwy 98.  we were taking in the waves and watching the stars.  my attention was focused on one 'star' that was moving.  we had just watched the launch of space shuttle atlantis from cape kennedy earlier that day and having seen the iss, satellites, etc. move overhead in the past, it appeared to be about the same size and speed.  i thought this may be the shuttle going overhead -

south in the 13000 block of roe in leawood, ks. when we spotted two amber/orange lights approaching approx 30 degrees in the sky, as if they were from an aircraft. we thought the color was odd for an approaching aircraft. the lights were fairly close together and horizontal from one another. they then grew a little further apart and then became vertical in their positioning with one another, as if the craft was in a 90 degree banking position. we thought that wasn't possible if it was an aircraft. the lights then moved next to one another and stopped and hovered for about 15 seconds. at this point they were about 30 degrees off the horizon and made no sound. it was eerily quiet. we were stopped in our tracks in awe wondering what in the world we were experiencing!! it was definately not an airplane! initially we thought it was one craft with two lights, but now we believe the lights are on two separate craft. at this time of night there is no traffic on the street at all. all of a sudden the lead light starts to fade and appears to change direction to the south so the light disappears. seconds later the second light does the same. just at that moment one car (the only car we saw that night) headed south on roe stops and the two occupants asked if we just saw what they saw. they were excited like us and we talked for approx 30 seconds. they couldn't believe what they saw as well and had no explanation for the sighting. we all thought that what we saw was crazy, unbelievable and incredible!! i contacted the local fox affiliate the next morning and they advised me that

rumble above me, similar to the sound of a harley idiling. when i looked up i seen what was an all white medium size plane,flying low in the sky. the only way to describe it, is like a harley fat boy. it was all white and had 3 thick black lines on its underbelly, fat wings , came out from the side of the plane with its wing tips up, but not too high. their were no visible call numbers or writing of any kind on it. a fellow walking towards me heard the sound thru his head phones and stopped to see where it was coming from. we both watched it for about 2 minutes. by the time i took out my binoculars to get a better look it was gone, poof sound and all. how can something flying that low and loud, suddenly disappear, sound and all. we waited 5 minutes for it to reappear out of the low cloud cover but it never did. i walked thru the park watching the sky for another 15 minutes but it never returned. i can see loosing it in the cloud cover but how could such a rumble and a whole plane disappear like that.  back to the harley point again , when they are touring down the street we can sometimes hear them for blocks, but this sound was gone immediatly as was the low flying

docks at his lakehouse cabin. every fall we take them out due to the lake freezing. after working to install the docks and shorestation (2.5 hours) we walked up to his deck\\porch and relaxed on the patio laying in deck chairs that reclined back. this was around noon and after about ten minutes of catching our breath and getting hydrated my cousin had said, \"that satellite hasnt moved in 5 minutes\". it took us a couple of minutes to locate what he was looking at and determined this was either too big or too low to be a satellite. after grabbing my nephews telescopes inside the cabin we struggled to get the object in view due to low qulity telescope and for every mm we turned to dcope we seemed to moves miles in the wrong direction in the sky. about the time we were taking turns trying to get this object in the telescope three military fighter jets came from three different directions over the forest we were nestled in, we didnt even hear them until they had passed and our chests shook from the vibrations from the jets, that how fast they were flying. the only known air force base in the area closed almost 20 years ago.The jets each took a turn moving closer to the stationary object we had been trying to get a closer look at for 20 minutes and each jet would get about the same distance away and the free fall and fly in the opposite direction never to be seen again. the stationary object remained. then about 5 minutes later my cousin had had yelled to me to come quick to where was standing and said i just missed it. missed what i said, he said he doesnt know how to explain what he saw, then all of a sudden 2 balls of light rose from the tree line behind the cabin, moved like they were biological and moving in no pattern but left to right up and down arcing and weaving, this happened for only 6 or 7 seconds before the pulsated three times going from silver to orange to amber back and forth then skyrocketed across the lake at about 100' in the air and left some sort of vapor trail that lasted for about 1.5 seconds. i checked local papers and nobody else reported seeing this. i must state that the three of us never saw anything like this before, never believed in this before and rarely talk about this today. we are all family men with responsible jobs and have drug use or any reason to make this up. my brother wont even talk to me about what we saw because he deals with mathematical science and cant grasp what we saw.","distance":"Over One

experience in the same area on december 16th with red and white pulsating lights and i hoped to see those again, to determine what they might be. i took a drive out into the country. we live in a semi-rural area and i drove to a much more rural area where the stars are quite plentiful. i drove out into the country, taking back country roads, taking note of stars and the constellations as best i could. i started heading back on cth tc, going due west and i saw two light stars just above the horizon, about 45 degrees. \r\n\r\nmy attention was diverted to driving for a moment and then looked at those stars again. i saw three stars this time, and all three of them made a perfect triangle. they were very bright, with the bottom \"star\" being the brightest of the three. it was so odd because i kept thinking, \"there were only two stars there a moment ago and now there are three.\" i looked to see whether the stars were blinking or flashing like planes in the sky, but there was no flashing, only a solid bright white light. just when i was getting used to the bright triangle shape in the sky (about 5 seconds, perhaps), the bottom most \"star,\" the one that hadn't been there moments before, began to move in an arch between the two other stars above it, and it moved in a southeasterly direction. i could see the other two stars get lighter in intensity and the bright star which was moving began to fade a bit as it moved across the sky. as it came approximately directly over my vehicle (and hence, i couldn't see it anymore), it faded from view.\r\n\r\ni tried to tell myself it was a satellite or a plane, but it just didn't look like that. it looked like a star that moved. a bright star that moved, and it made the two stars near it bright, until it passed by. i can't explain that. i watched those two stars for quite some time afterwards and they didn't seem to do anything different than twinkle normally. this was no shooting star and i could see no evidence of anything else moving (like a satellite would) after it faded out. \r\n\r\nsomething strange i did notice was there were a lot of planes that seemed to fly directly \"between\" those two stars, including one that made a triangle with them. these planes had flashing lights that looked like regular aircraft. perhaps that was a normal flight path but it just seemed so odd to see three or four planes fly between those two stars like that.\r\n\r\nthere was a sliver of a moon and i identified venus in the sw horizon and jupiter above me. this was not a planet but a moving \"star.\"

ground floor apartment patio, talking on the phone. i saw a light grey, roundish, filmy substance moving toward me from the southeast, traveling northwesterly. the substance appeared to be unsolid - possibly gaseous. i had absolutely no idea what it could be as i had never seen anything like that before in my life. it grew larger as it approached and then took the shape of a craft. it was an oblong, six-sided craft with rounded ends. i saw a dull light grey and metallic-looking craft - my husband saw gray and black. it moved slowly, perhaps no more than 20 mph and no less than 10 mph. it moved very smoothly and as it continued to approach i noticed two appendages protruding from the closest end to me. they appeared to be something like very long antenas pointed downward. i was describing what i saw to the person i was talking to on the phone. then i yelled for my husband to come out and he saw it as well. the craft moved steadily and was completely silent. there were no exterior lights. the end farthest from me had windows and they seemed to contain one small golden light in each window. i think there were 4-6 windows. the craft flew over the parking lot and was approximately 300-500 ft. in altitude and approximately 300 ft. away from me at the closest point. it was hard to tell how high it was or how far away but it was very, very close. my husband said he wished he would have had a flashlight to shine on it because it probably would have reflected. my husband saw geometric shapes on the outside bottom of the craft. this was not writing, but black, wide lines that appeared to be more for functionality. \r\nmy husband ran into the apartment and out the front door and out through the back parking lot to watch it. i went out the front door straight to the west. the craft soon went back to the original shape of a roundish, unsolid object. i saw the craft for about 30 seconds - my husband saw it for about 10 seconds. \r\n\r\nduring and after the sighting i felt very peaceful and loving. during the sighting i was also very excited and all i could say was, \"oh my god!\", over and over again. this sighting was in chandler,

that night falls until dawn. i usually go out and begin observing them at about 8pm.\r\n\r\ni first noticed them the night of 19 dec. 2011. i was standing outside staring at the night sky in central florida from my home in the villages at somewhere between 01:00am and 03:00am when i noticed that one of the stars i was looking at was unusually bright. to my surprise as i was looking at it, it began to \"wiggle\".\r\n\r\nover the nest minute or so the wiggling became movement back and forth on the horizontal axis. this object was about a 45 degree angle from me on the horizon and i could see that it was not only going back and forth in place but it was occasionally making small spirals in place as well.\r\n\r\ni looked around at stars in the local area to make sure i wasn't imagining movement and the other stars in the area were static (not moving).\r\n\r\ni ran inside and got my friend and asked him to watch this \"star\" for a minute and tell me what he saw just to be entirely sure that i was not imagining the movement and as we watched it began to move back and forth and in zig-zag patterns. my friend confirmed for me that i was not imagining the movement.\r\n\r\nwe have been observing them every night since (as i said they are there from dusk until dawn).\r\n\r\n3-4 nights ago my friend and i woke up his mother at about 03:00am to observe the objects we had been telling her about (and she was quite amazed by the \"moving stars\" but what we all saw next was even more amazing) and while we were observing the objects (approx. 03:15am) i noticed a light blink into existence on the horizon. we watched as a small metallic clam-shaped object (we could only compare it to the craft from \"flight of the navigator\") approximately 4-6 feet in length and approximately 1-2 feet high (like a sideways teardrop or clam-shell) flew down to just above the rooftops in our neighborhood approximately 200 feet away from us right down the street.\r\n\r\nthe object hovered in place in clear view with street lights illuminating and reflecting off of it then it flew behind some rooftops and was gone.\r\n\r\nwe assumed because of it's size that it was an unmanned probe of some type.\r\n\r\na few nights ago my friend and i both saw one \"dancing\" in and out of the clouds making short, erratic bursts of movement and we are pretty sure we saw bursts of light that were straight lines of light (like a white laser) which flashed very quickly being emitted from the craft. we assumed they might have been sending communications to another craft in the area.\r\n\r\nthe night before last i saw seven scattered about the sky (i am an amateur astronomer but i will try to describe their locations the best i can). they were each a large distance away from each other, they are always unnaturally bright, brighter than the brightest stars in the sky. they look like someone has a flashlight at a very far distance away in pitch black and all you can see is a white dot moving in unnatural ways. some strobe, some are solid white.\r\n\r\nnow again, i am an amateur astronomer but we have been seeing them in the area of orion's belt, the dippers, ursus major, and other places i don't know the names of but i can walk out on any given night and point out where they are/will be.\r\n\r\nmovement: movements i have seen over the past week are fast movement in short bursts in one direction then immediately reversing direction, effectively wiggling back and forth, not very fast, but fast. i have seen them make small spirals on their horizontal axis. i have seen clouds moving east to west and the objects fly behind the clouds then come back out of the front of the clouds (showing that they move towards the cloud ((west to east)) and then reverse direction to come back out of the clouds traveling in the same direction as the clouds ((east to west))).\r\n\r\nthese craft have the ability to make these movements at will and can perform them going from a stationary hover and can immediately resume their stationary hover after performing these acts.\r\n\r\ni am ex u.S. navy and a fan of flight and aircraft and i can say with certainty that these craft are not weather balloons, they are not helicopters, they are either in low orbit or just inside the mesosphere or stratosphere (i favor the belief that they are in the upper stratosphere) and they are not any publicly known aircraft, military or civilian.\r\n\r\ni do not have a quality hd night-shot set-up but i am currently seeking some quality equipment to capture what i can.\r\n\r\ni have a couple of really bad videos of them, but they are amateur with no tripod set-up and no night-vision. so essentially all i have is a poorly stabilized video of a light in pitch black, but i'm willing to share it with anyone who would like to see it.\r\n\r\nif you live in central florida, please keep your eyes open for these craft, they are there and not hard to find if you know what you're looking. i would love to see what someone captures on a stabilized set-up with telescopic lenses.\r\n\r\nthank you for reading my story and i thank anyone in advance who can help figure out what these craft are.\r\n\r\nattached videos are short and entirely unedited. they were shot on two separate nights. they are poorly stabilized but note the lack of stars in the sky the only light you can see is the craft.\r\n\r\ni apologize for the pitch black at the beginning of the second video, it took me a minute to find the craft with the camera and i wanted to keep both videos in their entirely unedited state (i didn't even change the file names after transferring from camera).\r\n\r\nthese videos were both shot with a kodak m530 (12 mp - 3x max optical zoom).\r\n\r\nenjoy!!!\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"10:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line

out the back of our house which faces west.  we looked out and saw innumerable lights off in the distance moving from north to south along a relatively straight path.  we proceeded out onto the deck and continued to observe these lights.  as they moved to the south, they then appeared to head more west and appeared to climb and then disappear rather rapidly one by one.  as we looked to the north, more lights continued to appear.  this was a constant stream that we saw for at least 10 minutes, lights disappearing into the sky to the south and west and more lights appearing from the north.  i would estimate that several hundred of these objects passed by during this time all taking the same path before turning to the west and up into the sky and disappearing.  i had grabbed my cell phone on the way out to the deck and tried to record the objects but the quality is not great.  in fact, some of the objects which i could see with the naked eye did not appear on the camera screen while others did.  i am attaching the video clip.  there are some christmas lights from a few nearby houses along the bottom of the screen, not to be confused with the moving lights which appear much smaller.  we could not make out any sound from these objects.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

of binoculars set up in our studio which has always been focused on breeding ospray. the set up is at the base of a set of stairs which lead down to a lower level art studio. when upstairs visiting,i would quickly peek at them as i entered or left her personal space.\r\nthis day,past the nest, i clearly saw this hovering object as high as an airplane.\r\ni immediately notified my wife who in her amazement, watched this object.\r\nnow this is the peculiar issue....As she looked at it, and i stood by, i noticed it was completely invisible to the naked eye. completely. it should have been easily seen with the naked eye for i had low power binoculars. i would then peer into the binoculars to see it once again. it was obviously cloaked to the naked eye...Simply astonishing.\r\n\r\nwe watched it for around fifteen minutes just hovering in place, not moving but maybe slightly rotating. then poof, it vanished.\r\n\r\ni went home and searched the internet and to my amazement, saw the identical
