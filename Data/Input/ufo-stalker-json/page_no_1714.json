west) of my house as the crow flies. my driveway is .2 miles straight and the entrance faces mayville. at 18:45 i went to walk to the mail box. above the grain bin lights of mayville, i noticed a ball of white light with red, blue, and green intermittent lights which weren���t blinking, just appearing then disappearing in a seemingly random pattern. at first i thought it may have been a helicopter, no noise, it was just hovering. i then noticed 3 single engine prop planes (used extensively in the area for crop dusting). these 3 planes were coming from different directions. you could hear their engine noises. their flight pattern suggested there was a destination ��� one was heading north, one heading east, the other heading south. their moving lights and sound suggested they were close to mayville at the normal altitude positioned between me and the orb light. the orb light i saw was moving slowly toward the west and in comparison to the prop planes was extremely bright. after ruling out a helicopter, i thought it might have been a star. a star cannot move and the cloud cover was at first above the light then the light went into the cloud cover. you could see a ���glow��� from the clouds. this was ruled out when it disappeared into the low flying clouds. the feelings i experienced at first sighting was, 'why is there a light above the grain bins? this time of night?'. i walked a few more feet down the driveway and stopped. the light was still there. i thought it must be a helicopter. this was ruled out when i noticed it moving away slowly. my mind tried to rationalize it being a helicopter, but there wasn't any sound until the planes appeared. you could hear their buzzing plane noise then those sounds slowly disappeared leaving the orb light which was fading into a cloud. i then thought it may be a star, the orb light was clearly moving unlike the other stars. i was excited, went to get my fiance to view it, but when i came back, the whitish colored orb turned reddish in a cloud cover and the light dissipated and was gone. i was bummed because i wanted to share the event, but i didn't want to leave it because i didn't want to miss anything.

always take the time to observe the sky when it is clear.  as i was outside, i noticed something that i have not seen before.  it seemed to be a bright orb like object that was either flikering or pulsating blue and red lights.  it seemed like it was hovering over the tanana river.  it was kinda jerky in movement.  it would hover with that jerky like motion for a while, then would clearly move.  when i say clearly move, what i mean is that may cabin is surrounded by tall spruce trees, and as it would move i would have to relocate to see thru the trees.  it would move and then hover with that jerky like motion.  not a sound.  clearly pulsating blue and red lights.  initially it scared the crap out of me once i realized that i could not rationalize what i was looking at.  i went inside, locked my doors, and turned on my outside lights.  after about ten minutes, i went back outside and it was still in the same general area, doing the same thing i observed before.  as i write this, it is 0246 hrs and it is clearly still out there.  it seems to be over the river at a angle of about 20 degrees above the horizon.  i tried to call the state mufon rep that lives about fifty miles from here in nanana but did not have any luck.  i then called the assistant state rep and was able to leave a message as i was observing the object.  there was a second object noticed in a different location, but i focused on the one that i was able to clearly see.  the fairbanks international airport is a few miles accross the river and i observe aircraft on a regular basis and am familiar with

i saw 5 lights in the sky.  i took my cell phone out to take a picture and ran back into house to notify my partner to come outside and witness this event.\r\n\r\nthen we went outside to the front of the house and they were still there hovering.  right after we got out there, more of them appeared... close to ten of them.   they were all hovering but some were stationary and others moved around slightly in relation to the others.  they formed shapes like a big dipper shape.  then they started disappearing.  when there were three left, the three formed a triangle shape.  an additional lone object approached the hovering ones.  the hovering ones disappeared, and the approaching one was nearer to us than the hovering ones had been.  \r\n\r\nmy partner had no coat on and was desperate to

looked at some documentaries about ufo sightings to see what other people were seeing at night, and the bright star- like objects were exactly what we saw both today and two  months ago. \r\n\r\nin

were returning from shopping late on that evening, it had already gotten pitch dark. it was a little after 7pm. i was looking out the passenger window at the businesses as we passed by them, something caught my eye and i looked in the sky, above everything. i saw this thing that looked almost like a ball of light, it was shining a beam of light out of the top of it into the sky above it. the beam shown very high above it, probably 50-100ft above it. you could see it fade into nothingnes.   like when you shine the beam of a flash light on a itch black night, you can see where the beam ends. that's how this was. it was also about 25-50fy acro. a quick note i'm estimating here, i maybe way off not sure. i tried to get my husband to see it but he wasn't able to for fear of wrecking. we drove about a block or two with it still doing this and staying stationary. i turned my head for a moment i believe to tell my husband something and once i turned my attention back this craft had turned off the beam of light. now it  just looked like a ball of light just np where near as bright. i could now see one single red blinking light on it. i could sorta make out a shape even though it was dark. it was sorta ball/saucery like shaped. of course i'm sure the darkness didn't help me any in knowing the exact shape. during this whole time i was just kinda amazed and curious about it. the road made a turn and i lost sight if it, then found it again. only to lose it again and never find it again. which i find very strange that something like that could just completely disappear with out a trace with all the light it was amitting. the speed of the craft the whole time seemed very slow. so that's how i don't see it disappearing like that even i'd it dis speed away. at first it just hovered there while ir shunned the beam.  i've never sen anything like it. my first thought was it was a helicopter, but what doesn't make sense is the thing looking like a ball of light even after the beam of light. i mean i know helicopters can have search lights so you can't use that as a point to show it wasn't one. i suppose you can be the judge of what you think it was. to me i'm unsure but it sure seemed strange for a helicopter.

have spent the whole night looking for explanations and i can't seem to find anything or any additional reports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ni live in new york city in midtown manhattan. i was sitting on top of my rooftop just hanging out with my friend while she smoked a cigarette. all of a sudden we both saw these dullish lights start fading into view at about 65-75 degrees in the sky. we kind of blew it off due to the fact that there was some slight cloud cover.\r\n\r\nit was whitish light in small blotches similar to the lights over phoenix sky several years ago that i saw on the news. suddenly a small orb seems to shoot out around the object and made a very quick and sudden movement then faded from view. this object looked like a star moving...Or some sort of small craft.\r\n\r\nthen about 15 minutes passed while we waited and tried to figure out a way to take some pictures or video. we have no way to take night photos or video because we both only had an iphone and blackberry. then a bright flash came down from the sky above the alliance building in nyc sort of like a meteor . it looked like it was falling into the city but may have fallen past the city line but it really was a bright bright white ball that didn't have a tail.\r\n\r\nthen about 5 minutes later the circular shaped dull lights started to fade into view directly above our heads high in the sky. they were fairly bright at this time, and extremely obvious. they stayed in place for about 15 minutes but would occasionally shine in and out, changing the overall shape. sometimes it would appear as a circle, sometimes it would appear as a circle with a small tail. it almost appeared as a set of constellations in the sky. it was actually incredibly beautiful, and we keep checking the news in hopes that other people were watching skyward.\r\n\r\nwe checked later to see if there was some event that took place in the city but there is nothing that can explain what we saw. we know there is the ursa minor meteor shower at peaks tonight, but that would only explain one part of the phenomenon we experienced.\r\n\r\nto add, several planes were scrambled and passed over the general area in the sky. two non commercial jets and a high altitude plane that came out of nowhere.\r\n\r\nhowever this is nyc and it can get really busy with planes during the holiday season. this still doesn't explain the lights. afterwards we just felt like we had experienced something really life changing and actually we both felt a bit scared. we are not really sure who else to bring this information to because this is our first time doing something like this, but we are sure of what we saw.\r\n\r\nwe have gone back outside to see if the lights have come back but its now raining and impossible to see anything. we will check again tomorrow night.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then

slowly passing overhead in a south to northern direction. there was a bright white light on each corner and the craft traveled with one point forward. a red blinking light could be seen on the bottom of the craft. the craft seemed to be making no noise whatsoever but creating a hum in my bedroom and lots of static electricty (my hair stood on end). i woke my mom and she looked out the window to see it hovering over the trees about 270 feet away (about 10' over the trees). i figure the width of it as it passed overhead and over the trees was about twice the size of the back (widht of the

portugal, which is surrounded by mountains. the mountains are not large like the ones in british columbia but large none the less. i saw a very bright light which the only other thing that high up could have been is the front end of an airplane with the front headlight pointed exactly towards where i was driving behind other cars heading home. there is an airport not to far away in the city of faro, which is where i was leaving. being here a while now i can generally tell the flight patterns and with this wide open sky i can differ from certain types of planes and helicopters.. anyway.. this particular light i saw was near dusk and lower than any normal star and brighter than normal. i was mentioning the mountains before because that is what i am using as a reference. the light was not much higher than the mountain and i kept my yes on the road but constantly looking at the light which i noticed it move a bit back and forth. it was basically almost straight ahead of me at this point about 5 miles ahead or so when suddenly it veered at a super speed and still lit about a mile south or so then instantly took off upwards and it was gone. the catch is that i've now seen it 3 night in a row. today i got off work at 3pm and did some errands reached home here about 6. i saw it again tonight and when i came inside to grab something the light which i've seen now for the last few night was basically in the same sort of area and when i came back outside it was gone. i know it was what i saw the last few nights because of the location. this week i am going to purchase a good night vision video camera because with this big open sky that i have above me i would like to get some get some great video of this. \r\n if you have any questions please feel to call my cell phone or email me. with the phone numbers that i left you do not include area codes, just the straight numbers. thanks.
