work on rt 45 west toward state college, pa. \r\nas i was driving along a particularly dark and sparsely populated stretch of the two lane country road a few miles past woodward, i suddenly noticed this band of very bright lights, seemingly sitting up on a hill, a couple miles off the road to my left.  the slightly curved downward band was approximately 80 feet long and made up of adjoining rectangular lights of graduating colors that ranged from a very light peach to deeper orange tones.  while all lights remained brightly lit, they were further illuminated by a pulse-like, fluid, wave motion proceeding and repeating from my left to right.  the lights, and one tea-rose/melon one in particular, struck me as utterly beautiful and it took a concerted effort to refocus on the dark, windy country road.\r\nmy initial response was \"oh, they must be doing some road work over there\" and wondering why they'd be still working so late. it took a second or two to realize that there was no road but only a wooded ridge over there, and the lights were not like anything in terms of colors or formation, i had ever seen at a road construction site, or anywhere else for that matter.  i did a double take and looked back at the lights with my rational mind shifting into overdrive in an attempt to make sense out what i was seeing.\r\nthe road, now curving downward toward one of the amish farms along the way on the right, again demanded my attention and a rather high bank on my left, temporarily, obscured my view of the lights.  when i emerged out of the dip in the road on the other side, apx 10 seconds later, and looked back again, i saw a vastly smaller version of the light formation i had seen way back in the distance.  i saw no trace of the large formation but did not know if that was due to obstructing features in the terrain, or if that formation had receded quite a distance back within the 10 seconds out of my sight.  the small formation in the distance disappeared from my view with the next turn in the road.\r\nagain, my rational mind raced to make sense out of this but none of the data wanted to compute. was there one or two formations, and were they communicating with their pulsating light waves?  or was there only one that receded in an incredibly short time span? i felt rather confused and increasingly scared ... and called a friend to inquire what she'd make out of this chain of events. i was never so glad to reach the town of aaronsburg a short time later and felt much relief in the perceived protection of civilization. \r\ni have engaged in reality testing ever since whenever i travel along that spot in the road once or twice a week.  i verified in day time that there is absolutely nothing but a wooded ridge where i had seen the lights , and came to realize that, based on their location, they must have hovered over the trees.  when returning in the evening, i have ruled out other potential sources of lights.  there are absolutely none along that stretch.\r\ni have not seen the lights again ... but find myself strangely yearning to see them again ... and especially the one color that appealed to me in particular.  when i think or speak about that light, i find myself getting goose bumps along my left forearm.  other than that ... there is no noticeable effect of the events.

heard what we thought was a loud truck or piece of farm equipment outside (we live in the country).  it continued to get louder, then much louder.  our dog's ears laid back and she started to growl.  i muted the tv.  the sound increased as whatever it was got closer.  it was then the house started to vibrate and a high pitched whine (the sound you hear before a crash)mixed itself with the roar that sounded like a jet engine with a slow, low rpm.  my wife cried out \"something is going to hit the house!\"  i rushed to the front door and opened it to see what it could be.  as i opened the door i got scared.  i truly believed that a jet or something huge was about to hit the house or the neighborhood.  \"oh my god\" i said.  \"it's going to crash!\"  i have a roof over my front porch so i couldn't see directly overhead.  by then the noise was scary.  i ran through the kitchen and out the back door onto the deck as i shouted for my wife to come out.  she ran out just as the object was passing by overhead no more that two to three hundred feet above us and to my left.  i can't tell you how stunned i was.  the object had passed by and now i could just see the back of it.  it was larger than my house and completely black except for the four visible lights on the back of it.  one white light in each corner with two smaller red lights toward the bottom and slightly inward.  \"what the hell is that?\" i asked, not believing what i was witnessing.  \"karen, objects that big can't go that slowly and remain aloft...It's impossible.  i know the stall-speed of a small plane is about 55 or sixty mph.  this thing was doing 25...Maybe.  i wish i could describe the sound of that engine more accurately.  it was the most powerful thing i have ever heard.  the freaky thing is that it was just idling.  that thing wasn't turning 1500 rpms.  it was just idling and carrying that ship easily, quietly, except for the engine noise which sounded as though it were coming out the back.  no color.  no flame.  no heat.  freaky.  it just drifted along at maybe 25-30 mph.  incredulous. anyway, we watched it fade over the field behind our house then my son came out and we could still hear the engine fading after the craft had disappeared for maybe twenty more seconds.\r\n\r\nmy son was back in his room with earphones on and heard nothing until he came out back.  he heard it then but it had faded from sight.  so we jumped in the car and ran down our zig-zaggy country roads in an effort to see it again but to no avail.  this thing was going as the crow flies and we never saw it again.\r\n\r\nthe next morning at church i asked if anyone had seen the object friday night.  most had already gone to bed.  however, mike (who lives over the hill)said his dogs went crazy at 9:30 and when he went out to check he heard what he thought was a sonic boom then sirens but saw nothing.\r\n\r\nthat's about it. oh, one more thing.  this morning at the library a family heard me asking if anyone there had seen anything strange on friday night when a woman and her two young sons (12 & 8?)approached me and the boys said at about 9:30 friday night they heard it and went outside and the older one caught a glimpse of it.  the younger child stated to me that his tv remote went haywire and started changing channels on its own and doing strange things.  none of that happened to me.  \r\n\r\nwell, that's about it.  i am dieing that i didn't grab a camera but it was already too late by the time i figured out it was something weird in the sky above the house.  the entire event probably took 30 or forty seconds.  but it was awe inspiring to see something that big move so slowly through the air so close to the ground.  and it was loud.  that engine sounded as though it had the power to leave the planet.  it effortlessly carried that huge craft at a mere idle.  freaky.\r\n\r\nokay then, that's my very true story.  we live in an area that has a good bit of very loud military helicopters and large cargo planes that traverse the skies but this was none of those...Not even close.\r\n\r\nhave a very merry christmas!\r\n(name moved to fi box) cms 12/21/11 09:21 cst

(central standard time).\r\n\r\nestimated time watching these lights, about 6 minutes. the pulsating never varied, always the red for one second, then the white for a second, and these were exactly equal in time pulsing, then nothing, black. then back again, and always the same very wide distance apart, a bit on an angle. at times we thought it was one craft, and other times we thought they could be two. it looked like the aircraft banked at one moment before we lost sight of it behind the trees. when we came to the other side of the stand of trees, the lights were very faint and far away. it seemed in no great hurry, and was headed in the direction of oshkosh/appleton, over lake winnebago.\r\n\r\nwe were not scared or concerned, just amazed at these pulsating lights. my daughter and i haven't spoken of it since.\r\n\r\nif it was a very large aircraft, i would be happy to know it. as it is, i'm not sure what we saw but it was definitely something unusual. this is the third report i'm filing with mufon in the past 2 1/2 years. we're seeing some interesting things in this area.","distance":"Over One

from beyond the treeline.  they  flew rapidly across the sky, with most appearing to ascend until they disappeared from view.  one or two would continue on an easterly trajectory vice the steeper ascent and fade from view.  there was a group of about 10-12, then a pause of a few seconds, then a 2nd group of similar size flew the same route in about the same pattern and speed.  we began to go back inside, when after a pause of about 60-90 seconds a 3rd group repeated the display.  most of the shapes were evenly spaced, but occassionally one would slow down and the gap would close. after calming down i rang a neighbors doorbell so that they could see what was happening.  by the time he came out, he witnessed the last of the objects as it faded from view on the easterly trajectory.

30' tall. again, i had crested the hill and i had a clear, unobstructed view of the sandhill rd. junction approximately 1/8th to 1/4 mile in front of me. i immediately saw what i first thought was a pure white private aircraft barely clearing the treetops from the south and crossing the roadway at 20 -30 ft of altitude in a northbound flightpath. as it crossed hydesville i thought i could detect it starting to ascend at the same rate as sandhill rd. duration of this sighting was probably less than a second considering it's estimated speed of 50mph combined with my field of view of perhaps 100 or so feet from my reported distance away, which, again, i estimate at 1/8th to 1/4 mile. \r\n\r\nin the split second i observed this object it became very clear to me that this was not a private aircraft as it had no wings, vertical stabilizer, cockpit, registration number, graphics, and any landing gear was non-evident. nor did it have a perceptible smooth surface that an aircraft would have. if anything, it appeared to have clearly defined protrusions that stuck out at fairly acute angles. i can only describe it as having a lego-type structure - an all white, lego-type structure. the angles and protrusions were that clearly defined. overall length i would have to estimate at less than 25' as it did not take up both lanes of hydesville rd as it passed over.\r\n\r\ni knew i wanted to see more of whatever it was i just saw. it took me a few seconds to get to sandhill rd. i turned north on sandhill and progressed up a slight hill where the view went from fairly heavily wooded to a moderately open area where visibility widened substantially. i saw nothing. whatever it was had either eluded my view, crashed, or simply vanished. considering the speed at which it was traveling, relative to the time it took me to get to, and turn up, sandhill rd., i should have seen, at the very least, a glimpse of whatever this anomaly actually was. \r\n\r\ni was sadly disappointed as the object managed to elude additional sighting. my frustration level is enormous as i only caught enough of a glimpse of this object to know that i have no clue what it was. but i do know what it wasn't -
