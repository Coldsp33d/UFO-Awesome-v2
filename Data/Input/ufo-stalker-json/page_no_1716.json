daughters spotted a helicopter and stated it was an airplane. after a few seconds of debate she realized she saw the propellers. ahead of the craft i noticed a new set of lights that reminded me of an airplane but before i could say, \"see child, there's an airplane\", it had descended down (above the trees) super fast and disappeared into nothingness.\" within an instant i realized at that speed it was destined to crash, also i realized it couldn't be a plane at that speed. how did it dissapear? and did i just see that? before i could open my mouth my mom said, \"did you see that?\" i replyed, \"did we both really just see that?, so you just saw that, what did you see?\" i asked to varify my sighting. \"it just dissapeared\",she remarked. i couldn't believe it took twenty-two years to see another ufo. this time it was so quick it was unbelievable. if my mom had not have caught those lights in her periphial vision in just enough time to see the lights dissappear from her view before even  making out what we were looking at... i don't know if i would have believed my own eyes and mind. i'm pretty sure the helicopter pilot saw it because they were approaching from above opposite direction. i couldnt believe mom finally got a chance to see one. one oppertunity missed her in 1996 when my dad, mom, and brother who was on his way to a mlitary acadamy, were driving down to clinton,nc. my dad said maybe she wasn't meant to see it because she never once turned her head while the incident was taking place. they were on the highway and quite unusually their were just two cars, them and a green van. he noticed that the car was keeping exact pace with them. in the back seat was my brother. ironically, i suppose in the van the father was driving, the mother the passenger and a boy around the age of ten or twelve was in the back seat. the parents in the van never once turned their heads to look over at my father. however he noticed when he would pick up speed so would they. as so when he declined speed, so would the other vehicle as to keep alolngside of the vehicle. the boy in the backseat smiled mockingly and stretched only his neck, but a good twelve inches. my daddy said he then stepped on the gas and they did not persue. my dad swears on poppa's (his own father's) grave that what he told me was the truth. when i was twelve in the fall of 1989, while standing on my front porch next to the dixie classic fairgrounds staring into the sky, spotting the north star, big and little dipper, i noticed there were two north stars. one brighter than the other. except one of them was not in positon of the north. after spending a few wandering moments pondering on how this was not that north star but that one was. and trying to figure where this star came from, i thought i would turn around reach my head into the door and call my father quickly who was sittng just two feet from the door. but i knew i couldn't turn my head because that wasn't suppose to be there. before i could open my mouth to say daddy, come here, the craft made three immediate quick movements in the sky. a very wide precise triangle path as it dissappeared into the atmosphere opposite the direction of the sky it was in. i found it amazing the speed at which it could abruptly change directions. out of this world, literally!","distance":"21-100

object, maybe about 30 feet across, highly reflective, at about several thousand feet in the sky (just below some clouds in a clear blue sky, 80 degrees f., easterly breeze, i believe) it appeared almost the size of the full moon to our relative view.\r\n\r\nit was very clear, razor sharp in our view.\r\n\r\nwhen it turned sideways it was very thin, and as it turned, it's \"bottom\" surface appeared shaded, and it's highly reflective upper surface showed a wide, low bulge nearly filling the diameter.\r\n\r\nit was definitely a disk, and definitely nearly flat on it's \"upper\" and \"lower\" surfaces.\r\n\r\nit was seen above mcgregor and summerlin avenues, fort myers florida, at about 2:30 pm, and we watched it for about a minute.\r\n\r\nit behaved like a balloon, drifting and turning, climbing and dipping, bobbing weightlessly, in a more or less easterly direction, for several hundred feet problably, and did not appear to be under \"control\" or \"doing\" anything.\r\n\r\nit was big.\r\n\r\nit was absolutely a disk.\r\n\r\nour view of it was very clear, and it was definitely \"hardware,\" not a cloud, etc.\r\n\r\nit was not a round weather balloon or a party balloon.\r\n\r\ni was not alone. i did not notice any other motorists watching it, and traffic moved on, and we lost our view of it.\r\n\r\nnearby air fields are: paige field, and sw florida

disappear from sight.\r\n\r\na subsequent lightly conducted search of internet sites selling professional weather balloons, and large advertising balloons (national and international) and other possibly related items, found nothing similar, so far.\r\n\r\nactually, it appeared during this lightly conducted search that weather balloons might not even come in \"hard\" silver, or at least i have not yet found any.\r\n\r\nweather balloons do come with telemetry packages and parachutes which are strung below the balloon on longish cable. this object has none visible.\r\n==========================================================================\r\nreported to mufon by email, 12/2/11:\r\n\r\ni am a 66 year old former private investigator and courtroom certified expert witness to photos and video. at one time i emplyed 125 people.\r\n\r\ni was taking insurance photos of my florida home prior to a hurricane, sometime around 2004 when i captured the attached image of an unknown black object at the ceiling of my house.\r\n\r\n* * it had not been visible to my unaided eye when i took the photo. i only noticed it in the picture much later.\r\n\r\nokay, i know it looks like a fraud hockey puck on a string. its not; i'll say this once: if i had wanted to construct a hoax i could have made it less hoaxed looking.\r\n\r\ni note how it appears solid and reflects light. it is not a camera artifact; i tried but could not reproduce it.\r\n\r\nit is not somehow a repeat of the sink stopper below it on the sink.\r\n\r\ni have a second shot of it in a different positiion, blurred as if moving. the shots were a few moments apart.\r\n\r\ni have sent it out to maybe a dozen venues for comment but no one has gotten back to me.\r\n\r\na few weeks prior to this incident i had reported a ufo to one of the websites. it had been an object i saw in the sky along with a witness in my car. it was a clear and hard as a car in a parking lot. it struck me as a silver disc, black on the bottom, some sort of decontrolled surveillance device. it rolled and banked slowly like a ferris wheel. when traffic moved we left it behind in the sky at about 3000 feet above fort myers florida.\r\n\r\n(a few years later i found an illustration of it, a ratheon hard balloon surveillance device \"being developed.\")\r\n\r\nat the time, i reported it to the sw florida international airport because it was close to the  approach path. i was referred to an faa answering machine. a few days later a mr. smith or jones called to say there had been nothing in ghe sky at that time. he told me to report it to the ufo website, which i did. \r\n\r\ncan you help me out here?\r\n\r\nwhen i show these pics to anybody their eyes glaze over. even if they accept it as real, the implications seem ungraspable to them.\r\n\r\ni grasp that i may have reported a classified surveillance operation that had gone out of control due to some nearby radio towers which were present. i grasp that i may have been investigated by some sort of other advanced surveillance device. i know the government withholds advanced science for around 30-50 years, and i think this was an advanced surveillance platform using some sort of invisibility \r\n\r\n\r\n(link moved to fi report box) cms 12/19/11 19:32 cst flg\r\n\r\nthe website operator stated on his site that i was very credible and invited me on the air for that night with art bell, but i declined.\r\n\r\nim sending this to you because i saw your video and image expert on tv today. is it d'antonio?\r\n\r\nwould you please investigate this? i have photos of the thing in my house.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Path

simple purpose of recording them.\r\n\r\nto begin, i have recently become attuned to certain aspects of esp (unintentionally). i mention this because seeing this object brought on a familiar psychological reaction that would normally come with intense concentration on a fellow human or object. the mere sight of this object made me drawn to it; where i had to observe it relentlessly. this was before i realized it was a ufo.\r\n\r\ni was gazing up at the stars on a clear, cold night when i noticed an especially bright light. it had the appearance of a star, when viewed from a distance, though there was a certain glow and aura emitting from it. having caught my eye, i positioned myself in a vantage point that allowed me to monitor slight movements of the object (by contrasting it with a nearby rooftop in my line of vision). \r\n\r\nafter a few minutes, i determined that the object wasn't a plane due to it's weird vertical and horizontal hovering motions. the nearest airport that would require a plane to hover for an extended period such as this was over 60 miles away.\r\n\r\nthere seemed to be a small trails of light coming from the object, forming what looked to be a boomerang type shape (or a rounded mountain top). the light trails would taper off on each respective end of the boomerang.  the trails themselves gave off a spectral rainbow glow (this glow is what caused the object to catch my eye in the first place). \r\n\r\nthe object slowly moved out of my view, so i went outside my apartment for a better vantage point. i re-spotted the hovering light and continued to observe it. after a few minutes, i decided to run into my apartment and grab my camera. returning outside no more than 30 seconds later, the light was completely gone. for some reason, i knew this would happen. the instant i walked inside the feeling that i had felt left me and i knew the object would be gone upon my return. i checked around the rest of the sky and there was no trace or sign of the light. the total time of observation was approximately 10-15 minutes, while the object itself had already been hovering in the sky when it was spotted.\r\n\r\ni've never seen or have

plane but saw none.I motioned for my dad to step out and he also saw the object,we both observed what i would call a normal passenger plane passing lower and in a south to north track to said object.In comparison the passenger plane was much duller[it had the usual lights of any passenger plane ive seen at night]and probably 1/4 the size of object.I would guess the object was somewhere between 40k and 60k feet in alltitude.When me and my dad lost sight of object behind the trees,we watched it till you couldn't see it anymore.We both felt that it was too big,bright, brilliantly vivid of a white glow to have any normal explanation for.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

mine that i met when i was in middle school and two others that lived close from my house. over the summer we hanged out in my garage, had the garage door open and we would sit at times outside in my ally.It was late nothing excising was happening, sky's as clear as can be. it was getting late about 3:ooam when i had the urge to look to my left, i turn my head and to my astonishment i see gold! it literally had the color of gold illuminating off the orb which was solid,  shaped like a oval/disk with a dome on top. whats even more strange is that i seen the craft and it was silver but it illuminated golden color from itself to a point were the gold color looked like a aura around the silver craft.After turning my head to the left i guess it seen me and started to move,fast, my adrenalin kicked(never had such a intense adrenalin rush, first thought in my mind is my friends and brother are not going to see and believe me because this thing reacted fast. my next thought was to yell at the top of my voice to get the attention of both my brother and my friends,even though they close to me, i yelled and pointed at the thing yelling \"look dammit look, to the left above the wires by the light pole, %&#king look were im pointing. do you see that please tell me you are seeing this s%@t\" i went trough all that in almost one second i had to respond quick because as soon as i seen it; this craft increased glow and started quickly swinging to the left and right of itself.Each swing to the left and right increased it's speed. the craft rocked back and forth 4-5 times. it was going so fast that a tail started showing,  was glowing more and more intensive. once the first swing came in and then the second the thing started to produce a tail like a meteorite but its tail glowed like it was creating its own light. first thing that came to my mind is this thing is speeding past the speed of light, hitting the air so fast that plasma/fusion was being created from the heat of the acceleration of this spacecraft. glow was getting more intense, what we noticed was that all five of us felt as if we were looking at god. glow was so bright but not throughout the sky and only in were it flew trough. by now were like 8 secs into looking and the hair on my back is up in the air. you could feel a strong static energy flow and even hear it,heard quick pulses never experienced anything like it. the craft then changed direction and was going up and down then a super swift left turn;by now the craft is past any speed i can even comprehend.. i said \"this must be going at least 100,000mph maybe more\". shocked at what were looking at and at the fact we heard no noises, just static,fast pulsing. then once it made that left turn i swear on everything the craft shot up so fast that the light from the craft itself bend and like the thing went past the speed of light. like it kicked in some type of drive and left earths atmosphere. after it was gone and its tail was dispersing and going out like light going out slowly.. \r\nwe still felt the static.. we did not say a word besides \"wow\" for a good five minutes then we started talking about what we just saw. two of my other friends that were there would never believe this if they were not there. there hood so \"ufo\" is a joke to them but both of my friends had fear in there eyes. shaking as if they just witnessed the end of the world. one said \" no that wasn't a ufo, it was a government secret aircraft drone.. he soon cleared up his head along with my other friend. now they look into the skis everyday. my friend from middle school was just shocked and all he was saying \"wow now i believe you, at first i  thought you were bs with the ufo sighting that you had 6 years ago. that was at the same time,but six years apart. difference is that i seen a golden sphere egg shaped disk with 4 round windows and i seen someone in those windows as my neighbors, family seen it.This also happened at 3in the morning(don't know what day). was a long time ago and i was still kinda young that time but i got so scared that i ran into the house and prayed it was a dream but it wasn't i woke up and people told me what we saw.  \r\ni also want to talk to someone about myself its very important and would want someone who can help me out this year for me has been crazy michigan is the place to come to if you wanna see a ufo ive seen over this year about 11 of them.. last time i saw something was 6 years ago.","distance":"101-500

star. at least at first i thought it was a star till it started moving. it was very large and a very bright white light. it was just behind a tree line which is what made me really notice the movement. i would get a clear view of it then it would almost play peek a boo with you. still unsure of what i was seeing i got my husband to clarify that it was moving. still thinking at this point it was a plane or helicopter i grabbed my high power binoculars to look for the classic blinking lights. instead i saw the huge white light no pulsing but the white light was surrounded by a greenish blue color not visible with the necked eye.  i obseved this strange left then right up than down flight of this object for over an hour till it was no longer visible. let me just say right now that i have watched this same sky my whole life! i know ever star, planet, satellite, plane, comet, helicopter, and shooting star. this was nothing like i had seen in my life!!!! on the other hand it was something i have waited my whole life to see. later around 11pm i again went outside out of pure curiosity to gaze at the sky. in the same general direction as the first encounter there were 2 moving almost in tandome this time. one was way way way up in the atmosphere and almost did look like a satellite. the second object was following behind the first and seemed much bigger and brighter. i continued to watch them clime into the heavens until neither was visible. planes don't do that and satillites follow a clear flight path. i am not the only one seeing these strange moving lights in sc!!! last night an hour before my first sighting a woman in polk county florida had also seen something similar.  i had posted on earth sky on facebook trying to get a logical answer. they tried to tell me  it's venus. ummmm i know venus and sorry it does not move left to right up then down. when i stated that in my post they never replied again. like i stated before i know this sky!!!! that was
