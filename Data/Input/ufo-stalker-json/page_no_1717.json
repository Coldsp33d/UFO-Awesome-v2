Unknown","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":" i check the database for recent sightings in my state of wyoming just to see if there are any sightings that were similar to mine in october of 2010. the recent sighting that was reported in wyoming just today (12/16 0r 17) sounds very similar to mine which i have reported through mufon before.\r\n  i happened to step outside for a cigarette on october 14th of 2010 if i can remember about 330ish am, when i noticed a star like light flickering to the north of town. i used to live in an apartment building across the street of the cole shopping center safeway, which it was across the parking lot, nrth of town that i noticed this star like object. from my view point and location it appeared to be in the area of where the water tower north of cheyenne is. i kept my eyes paced because it would rapidly change colors from green to red, white, purple, blue back to green, at a rapid pace, sort of how some stars in the galaxy do so at certain elevations from the sun's reflection. the thing that threw me off a bit was the fact that it looked like a star, but too bright for where it was located, which from my perception was right outside of town. it was just too bright and too close to be a \"star.\" as i watched the beautiful show of color change happen, i took notice to movement of this star. throughout the safeway parking lot are light post. it was set up slightly to the left of one of them from my location. as i observed, this star like object appeared to slowly move to the right, right behind the light post and stopped. it was very odd, but i didn't want to rule it out as a \"ufo\" since it had star like features. as i moved over to the right so i could see it it my view again, it then moved over to the left very slowly, right behind the light post again. at this point i was pretty creeped out, thinking that this was something other than a star because you don't see a star move left to right, right to left at slow speeds. to reassure myself that i was seeing what i was, i moved back over to the left for this \"star\" to be back in my view. next thing you know, it moves again over to the right, right behind the light post again! it was off in the distance but i strongly felt that whatever i spotted knew that i had it locked on. i couldn't believe what was going on, so i ran inside to get another witness (my girlfriend) just to reassure that i wasn't just seeing things like some sort of lunatic! i woke her out of bed and had her come outside to view this occurrence. as we stepped outside i pointed it out and it was stationary, sitting dead still like a star would. she sort of got upset at the fact that i dragged her out of bed to see a \"star\" but as i told her to keep watching, probably about a minute or so later, this \"star\" started moving again, slowly towards the right and slightly upwards (eastern direction.) she took notice right away at the fact that it went from dead still to moving towards the east at a somewhat faster rate of speed than i saw it move earlier. she then stated \"it looks like it's moving towards the right...\" and no sooner as she finished that sentence, this light stopped dead still again, rose, and disappeared as if it \"beamed\" out. i felt like falling over from being highly overwhelmed at what i just saw and she became highly uncomfortable as if something was watching us. i didn't want to have that feeling at the time i witnessed it before i brought her into the picture but i in fact in the back of my mind felt like this \"star\" knew that i was watching it. i couldn't believe what i had seen, and as we went back into the our apartment, i was pretty uneasy and just in shock at what had just happened. i had seen strange occurrences before that, but nothing as in the flesh as that, and to this day almost every single day that pops up in my mind, therefore anytime i step outside, i tend to gaze to the sky, day or night to see if i witness anything as spectacular and unexplainable as we did that early morning. \r\n as i stated before, i can relate to this recent sighting made in this month (december 2011) because i in fact feel that these star like/lights know that you are watching and that no matter how far away you are, etc... it'll do whatever it can to \"blend\" in as a star or some sort of man made aircraft and once somebody actually takes notice, that is when you notice its evasiveness. \r\n  i also want to state that i was contacted by wyoming's mufon investigator through an email, and as i replied to the email that i received, which i believe was back in january or february, i never received a reply back about this occurrence. i have had within this past year and a half, about 3 or 4 other occurrences happen, all that i have reported on. all i can say is, keep your eyes peeled at the sky and don't be afraid to speak up about anything odd that you see but know how to decipher something that is man made opposed to unidentifiable.

now it can be. i hope that it might be associated with other events in the area about that time, providing added proof that something did occur in the area of the maheur national forest, nw of burns oregon at that time. the month is correct (oct), the day could have been any day during deer season. \r\nmy aunt, uncle and a large group of friends were camped at morgan springs in the malheur national forest. it was dark and the days hunt over. as usual everyone was around the fire. this was rugged country. i've been to this spot in the 70's and 80's. very hard to find and to get there with vehicles. theirs was the only group at that site.\r\nlet me state that my aunt was the national chairman of a prestigious real estate concern. listed in who's who, very successful, logical and level headed.\r\nshe was walking around the group with a tray of snacks. she stated that it soundlessly glided into view just above the tree tops. these would be large ponderosa pines. it stopped, hovering, not directly overhead but about 50 feet away at a 45 degree angle, about 100 ft above the ground. about half the craft was visible, saucer shaped, she estimated it to be at least 100 ft wide, but i don't recall how thick it was. \r\neveryone freaked out, women screamed, men yelling, some went for their hunting rifles. she said it was so close and so obvious what it was, that nobody said anything like \"what is it\". everyone knew. there were \"windows\", for lack of a better term. i don't recall if they were visible as it came into sight or not. i think she said they appeared after it stopped to hover. a yellow light was visible, apparently eminatting from the crafts interior. she said the shapes of more than one humanoid body was visible and movement was easily discerned with the yellow back light. no features were seen as no light was directed in to the craft from the outside. she said that the movements were fluid, natural, but seemed uncharictoristic of normal human movement. proportions were odd as well. she said they seemed to be curious about them, moving to get diffent looks into the campsight. \r\nat this point, only a few seconds have passed. she was a camera buff and she dropped the tray and ran to the camping vehicle to get her 35mm. she had to load it and said she may have been inside the camper for 3 minutes max.\r\nwhen she emerged, camera in hand, the entire group was still and calm. the craft gone. some of those that hadn't left the fire area were again seated. a couple of the group that ran were slowly walking back. two men with hunting rifles were stone still and seemed catatonic for another couple of minutes.\r\nshe asked what happened, where the saucer went, etc.\r\nslowly, she started to get responses, simple ones, like \"what\"? soon, they regained their wits.\r\nshe was frantic, demanding answers... they all, including her husband, acted like she'd lost her mind. they had no explanation or memory of why some were away from the fire, holding guns or unable to recall the tray of snacks being dropped by her as she ran for her camera. she was incredulus, and being a strong willed, confident woman, she demanded answers and insisted her story was true and it was they who were daft. it got heated. her husband, my uncle, finally felt embarrassed enough to demand her silence and in the coming days she agreed, at his request, to never tell this story. to my knowledge, i am the only one she told.\r\nobviously, she believes the metal skin of the camper protected her from whatever caused the memory loss to the others.\r\nher and my uncle are the greatest people i've ever known. i need no additional proof. i simply believe her. hopefully, if any other events took place in that area, this will add weight to their accounts.\r\nthe biggest hole in my story is that i am unsure of the year. she told me this story in the early 70's i and can't recall how many years previously the event happened. sorry about that.\r\ngood luck with your efforts, hope we all get concrete proof one day soon.","distance":"21-100

the back, and i in the passenger seat of a ford king cab truck. i had been very depressed, and i began daydreaming as i looked to the stars in the sky. not actually the stars, \"one star\".  i recall being so sad about my life and how messed up it seemed. thinking about my children and how much i felt i'd failed being a good parent. while i continued contemplating what to do in my life, i noticed the star i'd been staring at begin to quiver, and because i had been so deep in thought, i began blinking to assure that my eyes were clear, and that i had actually seen what i thought i'd seen, and low and behold, it was real! i made sure i didn't take my eyes off that quivering star, as i didnt want to miss anything i was seeing, and that is when the quivering star id been watching, actually began to bounce like a bouncing ball. when it would almost be done bouncing, it shot off to the side, left then right, bouncing, as i stated like a child that would drop a bouncing ball, and then walk away from it, it would eventually bounce less and less, until it would stop.  i, once i was sure that i was seeing this amazing event, was so ecstatic, i said to my son, \"son i want you to look up into the sky, straight up, and tell me your seeing what i am seeing, he then turned and looked into the sky, and said \"is it going like this?\", as he began to pretend he was bouncing a ball in his hand.  i said, \"yes it is,\" and remember thinking to myself, thank god he saw it too!  we watched that bouncing star from omaha, all the way back home, at the time in roca, ne., which is about an hour away from each other. shortly before the event,just days actually, my brother had loaned me his telescope and my son and i watched our bouncing star for about a 1/2 hour, and then i began to sense a strong fear, and decided i'd seen enough, and my son and i went inside, where i felt we'd be safe.","distance":"Over One

with windows and blinds open, on our house watching tv in her and my dads room. my step-sister was sitting in the living room with the windows and the blinds open, both step-mom and step-sister letting the night air in. both parties sitting next to open windows were on the same side of the sighting.\r\n   \r\n     my father and i were located in my bedroom and were playing a video game. my blinds and window was also open due to the nice night. the air was cool and the skys were partly cloudy. as my dad and i were playing the game, we were destirbed by lots of neighborhood dogs barking and gathering in the street. the dogs were congragating near a light post located approximatley 75 to 100 feet from my bedroom window and directly in front of the house. we paused the game and began watching the dogs. after a few minutes, my dad left the room and went to his room to retrieve a pair of bynoculars to get a closer look at the dogs. i had a pair in my room and i retrieved mine as well. when my dad returned to my room, we turned the tv off to darken the room and began trying to focuse on the pack of dogs.\r\n\r\n     the part of the whole ordeal seemed strange becsuse some of the neighborhood dogs that were gathered would normaly not get along. we began to focuse in on the dogs. we noticed the dogs were barking while looking up into the sky. we talked about why they might be behaving like this for a few moments then began to look towards the sky, to the right of the house, when all of the sudden a bright light from up above burst in through the window causing my father and i to fall backwards onto the floor. prior to the light, my dad and i were on our knees looking out the window. when we came to and regained our sight. we were laying on the floor next to each other. now we both understand that our bynoculars would have magnified the light, but i know the light was bright to begin with. i looked back out the window and caught a glimps of a craft in the air that appeared to slowly floating away. the craft floated behind a cloud or into some type of fog and disapeared for good.\r\n\r\n     when we regained our composure, we went into the living room and said \"did you see that\" to my step sister. she stated \"what are yall talking about\". we stated \"the dogs and the bright light\". she stated \"no\" and went back to watching tv. we left the living room and went to my dads room where my step-mother had been sitting in the bay window watching tv. we asked her the same questions and she stated she had heard the dogs earlier but had not observed any type of flash or light. \r\n\r\n     my dad and i looked out the bay window real fast and realized that the dogs were gone. my dad and i went outside of the residence and walked to the neighbors house. the neighbor was outside working in and around his gargage. we asked him if he had observed anything and he stated no. he did state that his dog had ran off earlier, but the dog had returned sometime earlier. after investigating the situation for sometime, my dad and i concluded that all the dogs that we had observed were back at their homes and that people had observed the dogs acting funny but had not observed the light.\r\n\r\n     the part of the incident that still puzzles my dad and i is the fact that what seemed to take a few seconds, like looking at the dogs, seeing the light and coming to on the floor had apparently taking some time because everyone stated they had observed anbd heard the dogs ealrier but not recently when asked. we thought that the flashj happened and a few seconds later we were up and asking about the incident. we dont remember the, as people stated \"some time\" went. the dogs had been home for \"somne time\", we heard the dogs \"earlier\", we observed the dogs \"earlier\". there is time missing and neither my dad or i remember what happened during the missing time.\r\n\r\np.S. i am an investigator at a local police department and this has puzzled my to this day.\r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

seemed to appear out of nowhere and i had probably been outside for ten minutes at this point.  as i watched it flashed and expanded into a long cylinder shape, horizontally.  it stayed orange but seemed to almost radiate.  it was intense in color and brightness, but almost seemed to have a softness to it, nit like street lamps.  it appeared to just be on the outskirts of town, which is less than a mile from me, but it was really hard to judge distance, i must know it looked big.  \r\n  shortly after it changed size it began to move in my direction.  i tried to stay and watch but it scared me and i went inside my house.  i had an eerie feeling that it noticed me, which made me quite unnerved, but it could have just been the surprise as it appeared out of nowhere.  \r\n  after about ten minutes i went back out to see if it was still there.  i could not immediate spot it.  after scanning the sky i noticed a bright orange sphere much higher in the sky, directly overhead and appearing to be similar.  i watched it for awhile not noticing any movement.  i went out several more times throughout the night not seeing anything else.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

lit up over a field like daytime but it was about 9:45 pm at night. i stopped to try and get pictures of the sky thinking that my camera would pick that up because it's so bright (my camera is not night time friendly) but got more than i realized. while taking a picture of the skyline, i captured the source, 3 lights hovering around this field. very interesting to see what ever it was! the lights were at times very low to the ground almost touching it and sometimes up to the treeline, after about 4 to 5 mins they took off out of sight maybe behind a cloud. it was cloudy and rainy out as well.\r\n\r\n*dec 14 wednesday - headed for that same field area: just the night before we seen a orange star like object that was just ahead of us as we were driving, it headed to a flashing air plane tower (or whatever those are called radio/tv towers?) that's by the gas station. i got out of the car at the gas station and watched it hover over the tower for about 3 mins. then it started heading right for me as it got closer directly over my head i could make out the lights to be 4 total - 3 white and 1 red it was shaped like a triangle and was dark, possibly black or very dark grey. there was absolutely no sound and the odd part was it went right to the tower, hovered, then back to me but i did not see it turn around or make any turn what so ever,like it just went in reverse? after it went by me it headed back toward the same field where i seen the smaller lights on thursday dec 15 it flew off very fast and was gone.\r\n*from a distance this object looks like a moving star, just a single light,orange or amber in color(almost like its on fire). this is the first time i got a good close look at it from underneath! i have seen this object in the area now a few times. it has been showing up allot this past week in the same area. almost like it's on a path there and back every time with brief hovering stops along the way.\r\n\r\ni briefly looked around and seen 2 people getting into their car at the gas pump they were looking at it as well. they drove off slowly toward the tower watching and then went on i am assuming.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

were much closer.  we lived on a hill very near 2 water towers.  we and other neighbors were on our front porches watching for the lights to appear.  out of no where appeared 1 very large white light.  it zipped across the sky at amazing speed, making no noise and moving faster than any plane or jet.  it stopped suddenly hovered for a few minutes.  \r\n\r\n3 disc shaped objects appeared from behind the white light.  2 moved together and disappeared over a hill.  the other traveled from east to west away from the large bright light.  the large bright light just disappeared.  we all watched the smaller object move across the sky at amazing speed, stopping, ascending at even higher speeds then reappearing in a different part of the sky and then zigzagging back and forth rapidly.  the larger object eventually reappeared a bit closer to our house.  the small disc moved to the larger object and hovered nearby.  the other 2 discs appeared flying over the water towers, probably clearing them by no more then 50 feet.  one was slightly in front of the other as in a formation.  both were domed disc shaped objects, approximately 75 - 100 ft. in diameter, with what appeared to be windows but we couldn't see in them.  both also had lights circling the bottom of the discs that alternated in a red to green pattern.  \r\n\r\nthere was no noise as they glided past us and toward the bright white object.  i ran toward their flight path.  my mother was yelling at me to get back to the porch.  i just wanted to see them up close and was hoping they would actually land and make contact.  as they approached the bright white object, they, along with the third disc, begin flying in patterns circling around the white object.  they seemed to somehow join with the white object which then began glowing even brighter.  suddenly, it shot straight up with such speed it quickly became a small dot like the stars in the sky and then disappeared.\r\n\r\nthere was no doubt these were not any sort of plane or jet or anything made on this earth.  i was around 8 years old at the time.  all the adults were excited about what had just happened.  we didn't see the lights anymore that summer but did in

pass going south towards pearland, tx.  i slowed down to get a closer looked at this object- it was suspended 12��� to 14��� above dixie farm rd next to the race track gas station.  i looked for cables or something that it could be hanging from, but nothing, it was stationary in sky on its own.  i drove under it and kept going.  i looked in my rear view mirror half the distance to beamer and it was still there, i know, i was not the only one that saw this object. the sky was clear ������blue bird day���, something came over me- (traumatized), i carry a camera with me all the time, which i use with my job.  it���s funny; i never thought about stopping and calling 911 or take a photo of the object. \r\n    the objected it looked like a surveillance probe; cjylinder with pdark windows around the top, the object was 4 to 5 feet in length, approx 10 inches to 12inches  in diameter.    the object was stationary in a vertical stance and never moved-no noise- i heard about ufo probes before, but never seen one like this.. when i got home i told my wife about what i had saw.   the sky was so clear it would have made a great clear photo��� i called my brother-n-law and told him what i had seen.   he said, he saw something like this on discovery channel... that the fbi and cia...Might have.\r\n   this photo is the area where the probe was seen and the photo of the probe is one that i made on photo-shop model to show what i saw.  this is not the original photo of the probe���but is of the location and what the probe looked liked.     i���iepm an certified aircraft inspector and been around aircraft for forty-two years,   i have seen two ufo disc -- one over arizona in 1974 when the vietnam war was ending...  the disc was flying below the airline in a zigzagged motion

process of moving to another fishing locations when i looked up to the horizon to get my bearing for the next fishing spot.    when, i looked up just about the horizon was a glowing red orange dish moving slow away from me.  the craft was about, maybe two miles moving east. here is a website of the disc i saw.    as i was watching the craft it just vanished.  no clouds in the sky over the area of the craft...      \r\noctober 10, 2011  \r\n leave for work at 5:30 am and will traveling west on hwy-35, i saw a shooting star streak across my windshield over horizon..Coming in a northeast direction. while  watching it, the object came to an abrupt stop in middle  of the sky for a few seconds and started travel to the north at a slower speed.  i watched it fade out in the north skies.  i have been working on aircraft an around them for forty some years and never seen an aircraft streaking across the sky and come to a full stop in less than a second. \r\n(name moved to fi box) cms

they appeared to be pulsating and getting brighter and larger at times.  they were unusually low in the sky (for stars) as well.  at varying intervals they would both illuminate around their edges and reveal their definite circular shape.  sometimes they almost looked like planets with an eclipse, with the light source behind them. \r\n\r\nchanged position in the sky\r\nover the course of 2 hours

one.\r\n\r\nnoise\r\na lot of the time there was a very soft, high-pitched beeping (key of c?) that seemed to be everywhere, sort of like when a neighbor goes to work and their clock radio alarm goes off while they're gone, and it goes on and on and on...... the sound appeared to be surrounding me instead of being from a definite source that i could turn my ear to.  i was so engaged with the

for almost an hour. i called news 12 long island but they said there wasn't anything they could do. i called mufon and got the number of an investigator in ny and called him. i spoke to him while still watching this lite now slowly moving west. at around 6:05 the object was moving in a northern direction and was still visible behind the treeline in the distance about 2 miles away as it slowly moved beyond my sight.\r\ni've seen many things in the skies here on long island and clearly there's some major activity that needs immediate investigation.\r\ni want to know what's been flying through our skies!!! \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path

city school district this morning at 6:14 a.M. and went into the board building to take care of some things.  then, at 6:35 a.M., i had to go to another building. upon exiting my building, i looked up and the sky was very clear.  it was still completely dark out, and the moon was crystal clear and very bright to look at.  \r\n\r\nat this point, i noticed a definite electric blue glow around the moon -- less/thinner on the rounded side (left) and a wider band on the flatter side (right).  the bands of blue were not from the edge of the moon outwards, like a lighting effect shining off the moon, but inside the perimiter of the moon itself covering the actual white part of the moon.  it did not appear in the darkness around the moon. \r\n\r\nat first, i thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, so i covered one and then the other to see if perhaps one eye was spazzing out or something.  what i saw with both eyes, i saw also with each one individually.  then i thought maybe my eyes are watering, so i blinked, but there were no excess tears to wipe away.  next, i looked at the stars.  the sky was very clear and stars were everywhere.  none of them had a hint of this electric blue color to them.\r\n\r\nthis seemed very strange to me.  i don't remember ever having seen this effect before.  i thought perhaps it was the proverbial \"blue moon,\" which must not happen very often, since the phrase \"once in a blue moon\" seems to have the connotation of \"not very often\" or \"almost never.\"  and, i always thought the \"blue moon\" was a full-moon.\r\n\r\nit was probably some kind of optical effect, though i'm curious to know if anyone else has seen it, or if my eyes truly were playing a trick on me.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":34050,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.45311947095791,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12162011-0004","longitude":-76.50091592785853,"occurred":1324046100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New
