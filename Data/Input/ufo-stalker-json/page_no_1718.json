husband came in from smoking. while out he got a creepy feeling like he was being watched & looked around & noticed this weird light move around all weird. he came in to get me & i watched it from the window. the first second or 2 i thought oh thats prob just a plane but then i noticed all the light changes (red, yellow, blue-violet, orange, green, & white, with no more than 2-3 at a time) it started to fly up, down, north, south, closer(east), further (west), s patterns, right angles, hovering, wiggles. when i saw that i knew this wasn't normal. i grabbed my phone (which dosen't have vid) to take a pic, but the light wasn't bright enough. i then started to voice record what i was seeing. i have a 10 min recording & a 2 min recording. it's cold out so the window started to fog so i grabed a jacket and went outside. i could see it much better outside. i was having a hard time lighting my cig cuz i didn't want to look away & truthfully it was starting to sink in & i was getting freaked out. after afew mins we began to hear a helicptor or jet (something loud) comming from the north. now where were at most planes fly in angles or east west heading to or from chicago. sometimes you'll see north south but they're pretty far to the west. anyway, shortly after this it just went off (now the whole time it would go on and off but come back pretty quick) we thought it was gone & stopped my first recording. about 30 sec latter it came back on and a flash fell from the sky but to the north of it. it could've been a shooting star though, but still kind of odd. we then noticed that we no longer heard the jet sound (we never saw a plane) but we started to hear a weird hum sound from the east & saw a small blinking light to the north. we got freaked out and went in at that point. a few mins latter my husband went out & it was gone. within 5 mins after comming in my eyes started to hurt and they're killing me right now. i'm actually having a hard time writing this cuz i've now got a bad migrane. i was fine before. while i've been writing this my husband has been surfing to see if anything has been going on around here lately. he happen to think of the base thtas about under the where object was (you could see it had a shape & wasn't just a light) anyway this base is an old nike missle site. i guess parts are open to the public so he was like hey whats it like over there & honestly i have no clue it's almost hidden by vegitation ever since i can remember. at least as far back as 1984. the weird thing is the base is closed to the public starting dec 16th which it now is. my eyes & head are hurting bad. this base is about a mile west of us. about a mile or 2 south-east of portage,

mall area in fairless hills, when a bright orange steady light caught my eye as i was driving up a steep hill.  it caught my attention because it was much brighter than any star in the sky, yet it seems far away since it was close to the horizon and moving slowly.  it was too orange-yellow and orange-red to be an aircraft landing light (which i've seen many times since i live over the flight path of philalphia international airport and ewing nj airport).  the light in getting progressively brighter as it approaches my location.  now i'm intrigued because it's so bright and the light hue is abnormal, so i pulled over in the cvs parking lot after watching it for about a minute while driving.  after about a minute, its overhead (out of my sight) so thats why i pulled over and got out of my car at cvs on south oxford valley rd.  i've seen both commercial aircraft and military aircraft flying at night for many years around here, and i've been an aviation buff for 30+ years.  i can tell you that the light that i saw was too bright to be landing lights, too yellow-orange-red to be aircraft lights, not navigation lights, and not afterburners on a military jet for one simple reason.......The light was intense coming and going.  landing lights would have disappeared as it flew away from me.  afterburner flames can only be seen with intensity as the plane is flying away from me.  this glowing light was clearly visible and steady the entire time (strongest in intensity when directly overhead), with fluctuating blend of colors orange (mainly), yellow and red.  the red was not a regular pulsating red light you see on planes.  instead the red appeared intermittently and around the edges of the glowing orange-yellow light. the most striking effect was a \"heatwave\" effect.  the edges of the light were blurred and the intensity seemed to \"warble\" at random, as if the image of the light was being distorted by heat or magnetism.  there was no detectable sound as it flew overhead.  i was trying to hear for the whine of a jet engine......Nothing.  i flew nearly directly overhead (approx 85 degrees from horizon).  i tracked it as it flew in a near linear path and it disappeared about a minute later due to distance and light cloud cover.  the whole tracking of the light took about 2 minutes, from horizon approaching to horizon departing.  anybody out there see the same thing?  any clues as to what this was?

usually something out there. i have had chickens being took at night by a fox or some predator, so i put on my shoes and my coonlight and grabed my 22 pistol and went out to investigate. very quiet, not the usual quiet for out here during winter, but very quiet and no breeze, it kind of bothered me, but my first concern to check my chickens. i have a very bright light on my head for spotting coon in trees, this has been a childhood hobby. the chickens were fine, so i scanned the sheds, vehicles, house, to see if i would catch any eyes of whatever they were barking at. they seemed to bark towards the house. i shut off my light and got the dogs quiet so i could listen. i caught what looked like a camera flash come from the front of the house. thought someone is playing or messing around out hear, so i ran to the front, scanned with my light, nothing, as i was looking towards the west, i caught a shadow of what i swear looked as someone running by me but no one was there that i could see. after a bit more looking decided to go in. i sat down in my chair, and then heard feet upstairs, thinking it was the boy, went up there and checked, he was asleep. as i came down stairs, sounded as if something was in the walls. got down stairs and sat down, as soon as i did, something large was moving and making a lot of noise in the drop ceiling in the kitchen. i grabbed a ruler and started poking at the tiles to get whatever it was out. it stopped and then heard more noise from my chimmeny which goes to the basement, mustered the courage and went down to see with of course a weapon, checked all around, but nothing, noise from upstairs again, went back upstairs locked all doors and sat and listened, after a bit no more noise. so i went on with my night. haven't had anything like

some relief from the kids as i am a single father. i do this every night that conditions allow and at the same general time. i waited for nearly 15 minutes to see them again, but i was not really in the mood for the visit. i have a feeling they can sense this, so i closed my eyes and took several deep breaths as to slow my heart rate. i was starting to focus better in my mind and heart. with my eyes still closed i began to.... well... pray. yes i know this sounds a bit odd, but that's the truth of it and that's what i do when i'm alone and things are quiet. seconds passed and i felt them, from a distance. i opened my eyes and the first orb was to my left which is due south. the orb was visible through the trees, but  was physically right at the tree tops and moving slowly towards my position due north. the intensity of the object was great and constant as it hovered towards me nearly at the edge of the tree line and out into the open. i'v seen this sight before, but every time is like the first. it never gets old. the thought then crossed my mind that another one was watching me so i took a visual and mental note as to the exact location of the first object, then i turned to find the other one. right away i was able to locate the position of the second orb directly over my head at about 5000 feet up, dimly illuminated and slowly hovering towards the south. i thought out loud the words \"there you are my friend\" and immediately upon thinking this the object intensified in illumination at least 10 fold. this was just a bit frightening because as the object illuminated, he also grew in size as if instantly appearing overhead some 3000 feet closer in less than a second. both objects were illuminated to the same intensity and so i took my high powered led flashlight and flashed one time at the object overhead. the object in-turn flashed one time. i then flashed two times. then the object in-response flashed back two times and then folded in on itself and completely disappeared. i then turned my attention on the first object which was now appearing in open sky and very low. i took my flashlight and shined on it one time and the object immediately

dogs in my back yard, which was illuminated by 2 flood lights.  the sky was clear with no overcast at all.  the home, situated on 1 ��������� acres, is located in a small, quiet, rural town in mid-state delaware.  the area is heavily wooded on 3 sides.  the neighborhood homes are situated on a minimum of 1 ��������� to 10 acres each.  across the street is a state park, and 2 schools are located ��������� mile to the west.  there is a major 4 lane highway 1 ��������� mile to the west with heavy private and commercial traffic during the day and medium traffic at night.  my road carries medium traffic during the day and very light traffic at night.\r\n\r\ni looked toward the western sky and saw a very bright, white light.  i thought it was a large star or a planet.  since it didn���������t twinkle, i decided it must be a planet.  after 3-5 minutes, i was startled when the object began to move.  it moved a short distance to the northeast, at which point, i saw very bright red and white lights on the underside, which appeared to rotate in a circle.  the object stopped and hovered in place in complete silence ��������� there was no engine noise at all.  the estimated altitude was less than one mile and approximately 1 mile distance.  i did not witness its journey to this location ��������� it was there when i looked up.  it moved very, very slowly to the right or northeast.\r\n\r\nthen, i noticed 2 secondary objects, also with bright red and white rotating lights, at a much higher altitude, estimated at 10,000 feet.  these ���������secondary��������� objects were scattered in a random pattern high and above, flanking the ���������primary���������, one to the south and the other to the north.\r\n\r\nafter hovering silently for approximately 5 minutes, the primary craft began to look smaller, and i realized it was moving upward.  it moved slowly upward, until it reached the approximate altitude of the 2 secondary objects ��������� or 6,000 to 10,000 feet.  then, it began to move out, toward the northeast at an extremely slow rate of speed, with its red and white rotating lights very bright and visible.  \r\n\r\ni was astounded at what i was witnessing.  my heart rate went way up; i found it hard to breathe.  i continued to watch the 3 objects.  the ���������primary��������� continued to the northeast at an extremely slow rate of speed ��������� estimated at under 50 mph.  i decided this was definitely not an airplane, because it was moving at a slower rate than is necessary to maintain fixed wing airspeed.  as the ���������primary��������� moved, the 2 secondary objects followed in the same direction, but at a very wide distance behind.  it was at this point, i nicknamed them ���������the guardians���������, because that���������s what it appeared they were doing ��������� guarding the ���������primary��������� object.\r\n\r\nthe ���������primary��������� object travelled for approximately 3 minutes and disappeared at the tree line in the northeast.  the 2 ���������guardians��������� followed behind, and within 3-5 minutes, also disappeared at the northeastern tree line.\r\n\r\nafterwards, i did get quite upset and decided i should call someone.  i called the local police department, but that was a major mistake.  they ridiculed me terribly and began asking very personal questions about my history.  a few days later, i decided to phone the national ufo center in washington state.  someone returned my call and requested that i send a report.  i did file a report, but heard nothing further from the center.\r\n\r\ni have continued to witness multiple sightings almost every day for nearly one year ��������� from january 4, 2011 to the current date of december 14, 2011.  they never appear during the day, and the only evenings they don���������t appear is when the sky is overcast.   on some days, i have witnessed up to 5 different sightings at 5 different times in the same day.  lately, i���������ve become aware that as i am observing my visitors, my heart rate will increase and i  experience some chest pain.  when this happens, i explain to ���������them���������, ���������i can���������t do this tonight ��������� i have to go inside���������.  i don���������t really know why i think it���������s necessary to explain to them why i���������m leaving ��������� maybe it���������s my upbringing.  but, somehow, i do feel they can hear what i���������m saying.  i also get the distinct impression that they are ���������performing��������� their tricks just for me.  it seems interesting that every time i turn my back yard flood lights on, they are always there ��������� waiting for me to look up.  and, i���������ll say to them, ���������oh my god, you���������re already here.  or ��������� oh, you are very low tonight.  or ��������� you are very bright tonight.  or ��������� you are so beautiful.  or ��������� oh, you���������re ���������moving out��������� so soon?  or, you���������re not in your right place tonight, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nbut mostly out of frustration, and having no one to witness these events, i began asking out loud, ���������who are you?���������, ���������why are you here?���������, ���������are you an angel in a space ship?���������, \r\n���������doesn���������t anyone else see this���������?, and the big question ��������� ���������what are you trying to tell me?���������  i really feel that there is a message in these visitations but, of course, i���������ve gotten no answers.  after hundreds of sightings to date, it has become a bit scary to go out to the back yard, because i know they will always be back ��������� night after night.  it is, in fact, exciting but traumatic at the same time.  many nights i experience heavy breathing and chest pain.  i sometimes have to go indoors early because of this problem.  as a matter of fact, i���������m experiencing the same symptoms while i���������m writing this report.  so, it appears that this situation is more upsetting to me than i even realize.\r\n\r\non october 6, 2011, i decided to document these sightings in a log.  the contents of this ufo log include date of sighting, number of craft, location in the sky, elevation, distance, speed, actions, etc.  the ���������routine��������� as outlined above continued for many months with little change in detail.  then, i began to notice some changes in the routine and other details ... 1) the number of ���������guardians��������� would increase or decrease, 2) the number of ���������primary objects��������� would increase, 3) change in location in the sky, 4) change in altitude, 5) change in distance, 6) change in direction of departure, 7) change in brightness of lights, 8) change in speed of ascent.  here are some of those incidents:\r\n \r\nprimary ascends at high speed (1st time)\r\n10/23/11, 8:50 p.M., est:  primary craft seen very low in the west (1/2 mile) with its extremely bright, white light plus 1 vs. 2 guardians very high at 8,000 to 10,000 feet.  i asked out loud, ���������are you an angel in a space ship?���������  the craft immediately went straight up at a high rate of speed.  wow.  this never happened before.  the action of the craft made me believe that they could hear what i was saying and reacted to what i had said.  that was absolutely exhilarating.  about 5-10 minutes later, the primary came back to its usual westerly position at the normal altitude.  i didn���������t see it travel to the location; it just appeared there when i looked back.  it seemed to be a way of telling me that i didn���������t scare them off, and they were happy to pick up where they left off.  it hovered silently for 1-2 minutes, then headed out to the northeast as usual.\r\n\r\n1) 3 events in one night (first time)\r\n2) 3 guardians vs. 2 (first time)\r\n3) 0 guardians, vs. 2 (first time)\r\n10/30/11, 7:30 p.M. est:  1 primary in west, normal altitude at 1 mile, 3 guardians vs. 2.\r\n10/30/11, 11:30 p.M. est: 1 primary very low in west, altitude about ��������� to ��������� mile, 1 guardian vs. 2.\r\n10/30/11, 11:45 p.M. est:  1 primary very low in west, altitude about ��������� to ��������� mile, no guardians vs. 2.  primary went solo for the first time.\r\n\r\n1) 2 primary craft seen together (first time)\r\n2) 4 primary craft seen in 1 night, 2 events (1st time)\r\n11/06/11, 9:10 p.M. est:  2 primary, 1 above the other in west, both low altitude, ��������� to ��������� mile, plus 2 guardians ���������.. amazing to watch.\r\n2 primary craft seen together (second time ��������� same night)\r\n1 guardian vs. 2 (first time)\r\n11/06/11, 9:30 p.M. est:  2 primary, 1 above the other in west, both low altitude, ��������� to ��������� mile, plus 1 guardian vs. 2.  shocking to see this display in one night.\r\n\r\nnew location further west (1st time)\r\n11/07/11, 6:10 p.M. est:  1 primary, at low altitude, ��������� to ��������� mile, \r\n.  not in usual location ��������� about ��������� mile further to west, plus 2 guardians.\r\n.  i said out loud, ���������you are in the wrong place ��������� are you visiting others?���������.  no reaction.\r\n\r\n1) 3 primary craft in one night, 3 events (1st time)\r\n2) short hover time (1st time)\r\n11/12/11, 7:10 p.M. est:  1 primary low in west, plus 1 guardian vs. 2, headed n.E.\r\n11/12/11, 7:15 p.M. est:  1 primary low in west, plus 2 guardians, headed n.E.\r\n11/12/11, 7:30 p.M. est:  1 primary low in west, plus 2 guardians, headed n.E.\r\n.  hover time for each was 1 minute or less before heading out.\r\n \r\n\r\n1) 5 primary craft in one night (first time)\r\n2) 5 events in one night (first time)\r\n3) earliest evening sightings (first time)\r\n4) no guardians (first time)\r\n11/14/11, 5:15 p.M. est:  1 primary, low west, ��������� mile, to n.E, 0 vs. 2 guardians\r\n11/14/11, 5:18 p.M. est:  1 primary, low, ��������� mile, to n.E. in 1 vs. 5 min., 0 vs. 2 guardians\r\n11/14/11, 5:22 p.M. est:  1 primary, low, ��������� mile, to n.E. in 1 vs. 5 min., 0 vs. 2 guardians\r\n11/14/11, 5:27 p.M. est:  1 primary, low, ��������� mile, to n.E. in 1 vs. 5 min., 0 vs. 2 guardians\r\neach primary ���������appeared��������� one right after the other.  i still did not see its trip to the westerly location; it just ���������appeared��������� there each time i looked back.  took several digital photos ��������� no images were captured.  very strange to me.\r\n11/14/11, 7:40 p.M. est:  1 primary, low, ��������� mile, to n.E. in 1 vs. 5 min., 1 vs. 2 guardians.\r\non phone with friend; shared my observations with him.\r\n\r\nnew location ��������� east vs. west (2nd time)\r\n11/17/11, 5:50 p.M. est:  1 primary, low, ��������� mile, in east vs. west, 1 vs. 2 guardians.\r\n\r\n** 1)  23 craft in one night (first time)\r\n** 2)  first witness (friend)\r\n** 3)  new arrival location ��������� north vs. west (firt time)\r\n** 4)  new departure direction ��������� east vs. northeast (first time)\r\n** 5)  primary turned off lights (first time)        \r\n11/27/11, 8:00-8:45 p.M., est:  the evening began when i walked to my back yard with my friend, who would be my first witness.  i was very excited and hopeful that we would see something.  it began almost immediately, as if on cue.  one primary, low in the west, ��������� mile with 1 guardian.  then we spotted multiple guardians all at once ��������� we counted 12 guardians, scattered throughout the night sky.  it was amazing.  a few minutes later, we saw 2 primary, low, ��������� mile, in the north vs. west (first time ever), plus 2 guardians.  while we were watching the 2 primary craft, one blinked out, turned off his lights.  that was a stunner.  i had always thought that the primary craft travelled in stealth (no lights) to its location and then, turn on his lights.  after seeing this, i���������m convinced that it���������s true.  the craft will not allow its witness to see its approach.  they will maneuver to their intended location, and then turn on the flood lights.  wow ��������� amazing!  and, the evening wasn���������t over yet.  at this point, we had counted 19 craft total.  at approximately 8:45 p.M., my friend had just left for home.  i walked out to the west side of my property from the front yard, and there again was one more primary in the west, plus 3 guardians.  after hovering for 2-3 minutes, it began to depart, but it headed due east, right over my head (first time ever).  i was so stunned that i could hardly breathe.  never before did any craft make this departure in an easterly direction.  it was always northeast, never due east.  all 3 guardians followed the primary in the easterly direction.  total craft for the night ��������� 23.  amazing.  later, i thought that perhaps they knew i was having a friend for dinner, and they decided to put on a huge show or perhaps a grand finale.  i mean, seriously?  what else would a person conclude?\r\n\r\n \r\n2 primary craft ascending quickly (1st time)\r\n12/01/11, 11:25 p.M. est:  no craft in sight.  looked toward west 2 minutes later, 2 primary in west ��������� 1 low and 2nd one low and to right but behind the first.  #1 primary went very high, very quickly (that���������s new) and then headed out to the northeast.  #2 primary took his place, then went high very quickly (like #1) and headed out to the northeast.  no guardians at all.\r\n\r\nprimary craft turned lights on (1st time)\r\n12/11/11, 6:30 p.M. est:  1 primary already headed to northeast, plus 1 guardian vs. 2.\r\n12/11/11, 9:10 p.M. est:  1 primary low (1/2 mile) plus 1 guardian vs. 2.\r\n12/11/11, 9:12 p.M. est:  1 primary blinked on ��������� turned lights on ��������� i was shocked.  there it was ��������� what i had suspected for months ��������� confirmation that these craft travel to their preferred location, then turn their lights on.  wow.  this primary was lower and more northerly.  he hovered for over 5 minutes (much longer than normal) and then headed out to the northeast, as usual.  no guardians.\r\n\r\nbrighter lights (1st time)\r\n12/12/11, 11:10 p.M. est:  1 primary, low, ��������� mile, no guardian.  while i watched, he made his lights much, much brighter.  it was stunning.  it was almost like he was showing off or winking at me.  i commented out loud ��������� ���������wow, that was beautiful���������.  for some reason, i really think he heard me.  he kept his lights at the bright level, then dimmed them and headed to the northeast, as usual.  amazing night!\r\n\r\nnew location ��������� south (1st time)\r\n12/13/11, 5:50 p.M. est:  1 primary, new position in south.  i began to doubt that this was a primary craft, for 3 reasons ��������� 1) it didn���������t move at all, 2) it held this position for over 10 minutes,which was never done before, and 3) this is the first time a primary has appeared in the south.  i was beginning to think that this was perhaps the microwave tower, which is nearby, but the light was very white and not blinking at all, which the tower light would do.  i waited in the extreme cold for the full 10 minutes, but then i said out loud ��������� ���������ok, if you are a primary, i���������m just too cold ��������� i have to go inside���������.  and so, i did go inside.\r\n\r\n12/13/11, 7:50 p.M. est:  the primary that i observed in the south 2 hours earlier was gone.  so, apparently this was an actual sighting in a brand new location ��������� in the south.  i looked around for other primaries, but there were none.  there were 5 guardians, and all headed from the south to the northeast.\r\n \r\n\r\nmy conclusions:        \r\n  \r\nafter almost one year of observations, i have come to a few conclusions ���������\r\n\r\n1)  there are a lot more craft out there than the 23 that i observed in one day.\r\n2)  i believe that all craft take turns at being a primary craft.  at other times, they fill the role of guardian.\r\n3)  they prefer not to reveal their approach to their selected position, therefore, they travel in darkness and then turn on the lights when they arrive.\r\n4)  they enjoy being creative and entertaining and may even have a sense of humor.\r\n5)  as far as understanding their mission or purpose for being here ��������� i���������ll leave that to the experts to discover.  i haven���������t a clue.\r\n6)  my final conclusion is ��������������������������� they are not from earth. \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

two look like a thick bed sheet doubled over hanging in the air.(you can see the fold where the back on one side is off from the front.)i showed that to the 'local' mufon guy)\r\ni didn't see the object with my eyes so by the time i saw it on the camera it wasn't there.I don't know how or where it disappeared.However,i then took pictures of the night view in the oposite direction and got the neighbors double lighted two lampposts in their drive.The first came out perfect and then the next i got a very strange contortion of lighting...It formed a thin see through substance in the form of a tent and the top folded over like a four fold envelope. both of these images can be seen on the local sky watchers facebook sight.There are about eighteen people who joined together to share the stuff we see. several of us have cameras and we are getting a lot ogf the same stuff as far as various bright lighted 'balls' in a lot of colors.Sometime alone other times joined with one to five others.For the 'pink drapoe' i am the only one to see it...(actually i didn't even see it...The camera picked it up)so the answer below to witness is not how many are seeing the other things...That is at least ten i'm not sure how to attach the photos.If you have more than four or they don't match the descriptions above,delete them and get back with mei haven't sent the other 'shields or 'cloaking' as i'm not sure these are going to go through(not too computer savvy)","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":34033,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.07072869131758,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12152011-0005","longitude":-82.8212831449838,"occurred":1323244800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Tennessee","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1323971567000,"summary":"Pink
