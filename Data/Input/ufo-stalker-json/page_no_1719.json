dark out but not late enough for me to be starving, so i had time to cook!  i was driving down route 9w going north towards marlboro, highland area.  when i reached the firehouse on the right a couple miles up from hwy 84, i noticed some tall circular lights (gold and red) in the sky up ahead.  i thought that's weird, it must be a crane working at night.  the traffic on 9w is always heavy and since it is only a 2 lane north/south lane road, you have to watch what you are doing carefully because people stop to turn left/right and so on.  as i got closer i could not take my eyes of the lights, something was weird about them.  they were high in the air but low to the ground and only seconds after i first noticed them, i realized there was no way it was a crane, it was a plane-the lights gave the impression of a huge plane?  it was moving in the air....Very slowly <15mph? and it was way to low to the ground to be heading for a landing at stewart international airport (which does has a airforce base close by i believe)  i could not keep my eyes off of it, and worried about crashing i pulled over in a small in drivway, not even taking the time to turn completly in....I just put my emergency flashers on and turned off the car, opening the door and standing there.  seeng this huge piece of machine? just floating there not really moving, definatly not a plane now, but i could not make out its exact shape but i could hear it, there was no noise per say, like a car engine would make it was more like the sound of air pushing thru it, it was so strange.  i tried to call out on my phone, but the call was unable to connect because some sort of data connection was preventing me from calling out? very soon after, it started moving again, i wanted to follow it so i jumped in my car and tried to get back on 9w but going the oppusite direction because this thing went south.  it was probably only 100 yards in the sky but it was about 400 yards out from the road.  the traffic was so bad i could no jump out into it to follow the thing but it was moving away sort of slow, so i thought i could catch up but then it must of picked up speed because it was gone just like that and the strange thing is the second it disappeared this car driving south had sparks flying underneath the car!  like his whole engine was falling out...I tagged behind him and honked and flashed him so he pulled over.  he said he new his exhaust pipe must have fallen? i realized i lost whatever it was and stayed in the stewart parking lot and tried to call out on my virgin mobile phone, but was unable to because of some data connection error?  so i turned it off, hoping to reset it...Determined to tell someone?  i drove high in the hills hoping i'd see some sign of this thing but the lights did seem to flash/pulse the way i planes might and since the colors were similar, there was no way to tell.  i saw several planes in the sky.

road.  two of us women were in the front seat and one in the back seat.  we left the town we were in around 6:00 pm and from then until 7:11 pm we were driving around it seemed as if in circles or backwards.  we knew we were on the right road and then the other lady driving the car and i realized we had changed direction from where we were.   we traveled and went down different roads.   we stopped 3 times for directions and each time, we could not follow the directions.   the last time we were given directions to get back on our road, they said it would take us 12 miles to get there.  we were given several left and right turns to take.  we were suppose to turn to the left when we left the convenience store and as soon as we turned left it seemed a matter of minutes we were right back on the right road they we had started on 1 hr and 11 minutes earlier.   we were relieved that we were on our way home.   it is about 1 1/2 to 2 hours to where we live.   after riding for a few minutes the driver asked the passenger in the back if she was ok.  it took her a few minutes to answer.  finally, she said \"oh, i was just looking at the ufo and it separated.  it was so pretty.\"  neither one of us in the front said anything and just kept going.  about 20 minutes later i looked over to my right, i was on the passenger side in the front, and there it was.  just hovering to my right and then it was over the car and could see the shape clearly with the green lights and seemed like landing legs or tripods.  i asked the other lady if that was a plane, but knew it wasn't.   all we could do was just look in awe.  it seemed as if we could not move but just look.  the lady in the back heard us talking and moved forward and saw the object also.   she is usually very vocal but was almost serene.   slowly the object moved over the trees to the left and now, i think about it, it was giving off light as it ascended towards the sky and i could see it so clearly when it turned back towards the road and thought it was coming back.  seemed like a flash it was down the road in front of us again and then the lady in the back and i saw it go back over to the right of us and then it just hovered.  we could see the lights thru the trees and that is the last we saw of it.   after so long we were discussing it and trying to figure out all the events of the night.   then we realized that we had heard no sound, not even the sounds of the car.  how did this object keep level with us hovering and we were probably traveling 45 to 55 mph.   it was like we were in a trance.  now, i think why didn't i take a picture, but it was like we were dazed.   the longer it goes on i have certain things that come to my mind.   i know will never have an answer, but would like to know why this object approached us and why no sounds.  we didn't even pass any other vehicles on the road during this time.   i know there is more to write but at the moment this is as clear as i can put down.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

driving home i noticed two very bright lights low in the air. one off to the right of me and one off to the left. i guess what made me notice them was that they moved very little if at all, they seemed very large and low in the sky. they seemed like stars that were literally right there close and low in the sky. i assumed maybe they were helicopters or a small aircraft. but that idea slowly disappeared after i noticed these objects tend to hover and that they didn't seem to make noise. the one to the left seemed to move more and farther distances. the one on the right seemed to hover more. the road is very rural and winds through the valley between two mountain ranges. at times i would go around the bend and my view would be obscured, then i would drive further and the hovering light would be right in front of me or close by off to the right. at one point i mentioned it to my 15 year old daughter who was in the car with me and she said she had noticed it up in the sky even before we had turned on our road. both of us wondered what it was because it didn't appear to move, just hovered. when we got to our driveway, i pulled in and shut everything off and rolled the windows down because i wanted to hear if there was an engine noise or a propeller noise from a helicopter or a small plane. there was nothing but silence. it was very close. maybe the distance of 2 to 3 football fields away. if it was making a noise we definitely would have heard it. it was completely silent. then i drove down my driveway which winds through the woods and lost sight of it for a period of time. when i entered the house i went directly to my bedroom and got my binoculars, went outside on the porch and it appeared that the unidentified object was hovering directly in front of me over the field in the valley behind my house. i would say no more than 3 football fields away. i looked through the binoculars and saw a very large, bright light. if it wasn't dark i feel like i would have been able to see the actual object better but i really could only see a very bright light. i texted my boyfriend who was in a neighboring town on the other side of the massanutten mountain. he called and said he had been watching what appeared to be a hovering light above the mountain range. we got off the phone and i tried to take a photo which did not work out since it was so dark and i don't have a good enough camera. ten  minutes later he called back again, this time from his friends house and his friend saw it and said he thought i should report it to the local sheriffs office. i called and they sent someone out to see if they could find it. by that time it had travelled in a straight path, slowly and disappeared out of my view. the sheriff's dispatch called me back and said that they were unable to locate the lights and that they had called the faa and there were no aircraft known to be in this area at that time. my feelings started out as simple curiosity and then

our attention on the object it turned instantly ,the light turned off, and it headed straight towards us. at that point you could see a huge,gray-ish object materializing.When fully materialized we could see that it was about the size of four [4] shopping malls in size,that is to include the parking lots. it passed slowly over head,about 500 to 700 ft. above the deck. lights could be seen,through what must have been windows,and three or four levels to the craft were clearly visable. we were absolutely mesmerized,and could not take our eyes off this thing until it was completely out of sight. which took about 15 to 20 minutes. we were standing beside mercer rd.In decatur,ga. during the twilight hour in late august of 1967 when this occured. i remember the three of us knowing that this thing somehow knew that we had observed it,that's when it abrutly turned,the light went out and it began to materialize. afterwards we told our parents. the parents of my two \"friends\" who also witnessed the object,thought we were  \"crazy,lying,or smoking pot.\" to the contrary my mother decided to call the sheriffs department,who informed her of other reports of a similar nature. i also remember a small newspaper article,on the back page of course,reporting  the incident a few days there after. reporting the sighting to our parents taught me that most people will think you're completly over the edge if you mention ufo's. after all, this took place in 1967. in recent years,however given the number of tv shows,news reports,etc...I feel more comfortable coming foward with this story. in the past i was very carefull about who i talked with on the subject of ufo's. although i've remained absolutely fascinatied with the subject.In closing i'd like to say they're many verses in the bible that speak of things like,ufo's,other beings in the universe etc... that i would be happy to share ,if anyone is interested i.E... has anyone considered the star of bethlehem that led the magi to the nativity.Stars don't move,but ufo's do,at least the one i saw did. \r\n","distance":"101-500

night there -- may 9th -- i first noticed a strange slanted beam of light after dusk -- 7:11 pm to be exact.  the light was focused, not diffuse, and lasted about five minutes. i took 13 photos of the beam from it's brightest to fading completely over the five minutes.  that same night, at 9:48 pm, i noticed in the same vicinity a bright white glowing light, which appeared brighter that a fishing boat and did not glide across the horizon as fishing boats do.  the light appeared stationary.  i slid back the window, stuck my camera out in the dark and just started shooting one photo after another. i shot nine photos in two minutes and what appeared on camera is not what i saw.  while all i ever saw was a bright white glowing egg shaped light, the photos each reveal something entirely different.  the first photo shows a horizontal cylinder of glowing white light with a while line of light hovering above.  at the top of the photo appears a brownish object with two red lights.  i did not see that.  the second photo is a long squiggly line of glowing white light.  two other photos have similar squiggly glowing white lights in different formations.  the fifth photo is the most interesting to me.  when blown up there appears to be a triangular patterned craft hovering over a glowing triangular light below, with a tube of black appearing to connect the two.  the brownish object with red lights is hovering above.  the other photos show the simple glowing oval shaped light.  believing i took photos of nothing but a speck of white light on the horizon, i didn't really pay attention until a few hours later when i reviewed the photos i took that day.  that's when i realized what i witnessed.  my friends -- not serious believers in ufos -- were convinced when the saw the photos, several of which are very similar to those in the book \"examining the earthlight theory:  the yakima ufo microcosm.\" my reactions were total excitement and regret that i did not look at the photos i took sooner.  i would have taken many more.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

going to be a pretty good meteor shower on 12/14 so i looked up to see if there was anything i could see. as i was watching the sky, i did actually see about 4 shooting stars.\r\n\r\ni was looking almost straight up when something different from what i had seen of the shooting stars showed up.\r\n\r\ni didn't know what it could possibly be. we have planes flying over our home all time because we live near an airport so i have seen my fair share of lights in the sky. this object was totally unfamiliar to me.\r\n\r\nit was a pentagon shape made up of 6 orb-like dull green (swamp green) spheres. i couldn't see the actual object (if there was one); only the spheres that made up the shape. the spheres were located at each point of the pentagon and one in the middle of the object. the reason i say \"orb-like\" is because they didn't emit any light as i would expect them to. when it came into view, it was as if it were coming out of a cloak. i could see the object for about 2 seconds (flying straight) before it vanished the same way it came into view (cloaked). if you were in the dark with a flashlight and something passed by the beam of light, that's what it looked like except a light shining on this object would have made it more visible in my opinion.\r\n\r\nit took a second for me to realize i could have just witnessed a ufo. i contemplated in my mind what it could possibly have been to no avail. i stayed outside for a little longer to see if it came back or more could be visible but there was nothing else. there was not much time to analyze more detail of what i had just seen as it was here and gone so fast (about the speed of a shooting star).\r\n\r\ni finished my cigarette and went inside but didn't tell my wife about it immediately. i cleaned up the living room a little bit, grabbed a sheet of paper and a pen. i drew out the shape of the pentagram and showed it to my wife. i said, \"i just saw this in the sky.\" she asked if it had any lights on it and i said no then gave her the description from above.\r\n\r\ni went outside with my camera to try to take some long exposure shots of the sky to see if i could catch anything else but didn't see anything more.\r\n\r\ni wanted to make sure i remembered what i saw, so explaining it to my wife was my backup. this morning, i decided to make an animated gif image of what i had seen. i tried to make it as accurate as possible so i used a background image of last nights sky.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

cloudy outside. this object was grey but very bright to the point where it appeared to be reflective. there was a faint yellow glow around the perimeter of the object. as far as i could tell i'd have to say it was between 35 and 55 feet in diameter. i could not tell how thick it was as i could not see the top of the object as it was in the clouds, but the part of the object that was visible appeared to be around 7 or 8 feet thick. i wasn't sure what to make of the object as i had never seen anything like that in my life, and i felt that i was indeed seeing something that could have very easily been from another world, but as i was unable to make out exactly how thick/tall this object was there was no way of knowing for sure. after standing outside and observing it for just over a minute and a half i went inside to grab my digital camera and when i went back outside the object had vanished much to my disappointment. i did not in any way feel scared or threatened by this object

dinner. it takes about ten minutes to get to the top of the (address moved to fi box) cms 12/13/11 09:27 cst flg. overpass from my moms. i was heading east on boon rd and off to my left past the entrance ramp behind the clam river on the ground was what i thought at first was a fire truck because of it���s size, and color of the lights. i slowed down to 25 put my truck in third by the time i made the bottom, and gazed into the woods at what it could be. i passed what i call ���the bridge to nowhere\" a newly installed bridge over the clam river off boon everyone who misses their exit turns around there. there is a thin tree line the rest is clearcut. the car behind me slowed down too at the top of the overpass with an open left lane too pass me. they saw it too. i pulled around in the car pool parking lot they continued on. i went back, and parked at the bridge to nowhere before the us 131 north exit. it was blocked off by cement blockers and chain. it was right then i knew it wasn���t a vehicle unless it drove in through the back on dirt country roads. this thing was too big for that. i got out of the truck it was sleet and rain. all i had on was one coat, and a crappy pair of converse. i went out anyway. i just kept thinking in my head. this isn���t how it���s supposed to happen. like there is some way this should have happened... i walked as far as to the edge of the tree line i wanted cover. when i looked back i couldn���t see the road it was too dark and sleeting too hard. all i could see were the lights. these lights were not caused by blinking bulbs. i dont know what caused the lights, but they flickered like fire, or like magic. red, yellow, white. only on the edges the rest looked black metal it was dark it was a disk i couldn���t tell how thick or tall it was, but it was big as to compare it to the size of a fire truck or larger. i pulled my hood down after about a minute of watching the lights to see if i could hear anything other than the sleet hitting my hood. the lights made no noise, but i felt a low humming. like inside my in my chest. i could hear the sticks on the ground around me cracking. like something was moving around. by now my heart is beating out of my chest i should mention i have a heart condition so i did think i may die of awe or fright. i remember seeing three shadows in front of the light more cracking. then the lights turned off. it was like it was gone. i could see nothing i turned and ran as fast as i could. i slipped right when i took off and hurt my wrist, and my pinky finger. i made it too the truck, and locked the doors. i stared into the woods with rain on my windshield for about five minutes before i drove home. i went inside to tell my dad what had happened, and to go back with me, but he was sleeping. his girlfriend was drunk on the couch him and her got into a fight. so i didn���t disturb him. i went back outside to call my girlfriend i told her i saw some lights, and i want to go back in the morning and check it out. i didn���t mention stopping just mentioned it, and she continued to ignore it and chew me out for not having a job instead. two days later i���m telling my roommates about it in full detail, and they ask me what time did you call your girlfriend. so i looked in my phone it was 12:46 pm i called her moments after i got home. my sighting was three miles down the road from my bedroom. it didn���t take two hours to see this. i didn���t understand why my father was in bed at what i thought was early ten o clock ten thirty. i went back in the morning, and didn���t see any sign of cars or trucks back there. no burns or indents. i think it wasn���t touching the ground.  i didnt think it would be like this. what i saw that night was beautiful, and terrifying. i still don���t understand. what don���t i remember. it took a lot to write this down. it kind of makes it feel concrete, but in the end it feels good just to say it. i don���t know where i wan���t this to go. i have no pictures i have no video only my word. what i saw happened. this is my own backyard for the most part. i���ve had sightings before, but not like this. this one was here on the ground. it seems to make a bigger impact. each sighting seems to leave me with more questions than answers i wish i had a support group, or someone i could talk to about this. everyone thinks your���e just crazy when you talk about this. well i���m not crazy yet. i know what saw i���m just sharing now. which is a lot harder than listening.
