he dose when there is a thunderstorm outside. he will shake and act irratically and often pant quite heavily, ( there was no thunder storm it was a mostly clear night). i got up to take him outside and decided i too would go out and watch him from the patio. immediately i noticed the bright light and thought it was a low flying airplane, but it wasn't moving towards or flying over us. now i'm thinking it is a helicopter but there is no noise from any type of engine and it appeared to be hovering higher than what a helicopter would. i continued to watch the object move left to right and up and down at a very slow steady speed for approximately 20 minutes. i went back into the house and woke my wife and we both went back outside to watch the light in the sky and we could see three distinct small lights that formed a triangle within the round white/silver circle that would come on and off a couple of times. it was now my wife noticed the object was spinning as it was hovering in the sky. we then decided to video what we were seeing and my wife went into the house to get the ipad while i continued to watch. we videotaped this object for 30 minutes doing what i described earlier. she now left to go back inside and i continued to watch the object. this was all happening in the eastern sky and the sun was just starting to come up, as it got lighter out the object started to rise at a steady rate until it disappeared from view. upon viewing the video i too could now see the spinning motion that i did not see earlier and the video also showed a distinct cross pattern underneath the object. the next morning i viewed the same object at the same time doing the same type of movements for approximately 13 minutes before it disappeared into the clouds! we all wondered what it was and it has spawned a lot of curiosity and research on my part. i hope you can help out with what we have seen now a couple more times. thanks.","distance":"20 Feet or

ontario. the sky viewing is often very good there, and a favorite past time for me is to watch the sky for iridium satellites or the iss using an app called iss detector.  the sky was quite clear overhead, though there was some high thin cloud to the north. i had just observed several satellites, as well as the iss, which was still in view when the unknown object appeared.  the moon was also up and about half full in the southern sky.  the iss was not particularly bright that night, so i was just about to go inside when my peripheral vision caught something moving. it came from the south and moved almost directly overhead. it had a bluish white halo around a bright centre.  the trailing edge of it seemed brighter, so when i looked directly at it, it had a bit of a horseshoe look to it.  but when i looked slightly away from it, i could tell the halo seemed to surround the inner light.  at this point i was very excited, and wished someone was viewing it with me, as i knew this was unlike anything i'd seen before.  i tried taking some pictures since i had my phone with me running the  iss detector app, but not much showed up. i watched it proceed northward, and the inner light varied in intensity.  i thought at first it might be splitting up but it seemed to stay as a single light with the fuzzy halo.  eventually the light was obscured by high cloud to the north, but the glow produced in the cloud was bright enough to light an area as large as a full moon, (though not as bright of course). the glow lasted perhaps a full minute.  i managed to take two more pictures when the light was at it brightest, and the object did show up on the pictures,  though unfortunately there is little detail in the pictures.  but the pictures at least are indicative of the brightness of the object.  there was never any noise from the object.\r\n\r\ni have been sky watching for decades, having viewed countless satellites, meteors and planes, but have never seen an object like this.  i believe this is the same object that was viewed by several other witnesses who have logged sightings on this site.  they were in manitoba, so we were separated by at least 1000 km, which would rule out a low flying object like a jet.  the object must have been at satellite height at least.  i hope more people will come forward. i wonder if it might have been a satellite that was starting to fall out of orbit and burn up. i'm not sure how to find that information out.  of course, it would be way cooler to find out it was an alien spacecraft, but at this point such a conclusion is pure speculation.

learning that i have been abducted by total of 6 times. last night as i do any evening that i'm outside, i put my phone on record because it's just a matter of time and they come. at this point i have seen 20 or 30 different kinds of crafts and aliens themselves. they do talk on my videos in which i did a presentation last month here in san antonio at the mufon meeting. last night i witnessed one of the largest metallic cylinder ufo i've ever heard of. it was right in front of my face. a different ship picked me up and that's where we went. i have photo's and a partial video. i cannot recall if they even do anything to me besides when they put me out to put me on the ship placing me on a silver table. i have also set in seats and looked out windows. i'm not terrified and they've never hurt me. they did have me for the first time place my face in a very large round silver contraption that was form-fitted to my face. i was in an upright sitting position  also on my video. i'm not sure what exactly they were doing the test for. i do have a diamond shape scoop between my eyes  in which a paranormal investigator stated inside changes almost on a daily basis. i got it on video and was able to take pictures. one of the aliens actually took a picture of me sitting at this contraption. it was almost like a black light inside the ship. i have witnessed every color, shape, size and at this point i can count 20 or 30 different aliens. the most at one time last night. hungry howie's able to capture most of them in the video last night. when we got to our destination it was a very dark place it was lived in there were different looking aliens colors and entities all together. i even got a picture of an alien with a baby strapped to his back and it was smiling. one of my favorite pictures now. attached is the huge cylinder ship that was already at destination point. i am interested in sharing all of these with you. what stands out the most is when an alien told me your god is our god.  after i told him that i believe in god and i read his word the bible.  i find this very important because  a lot of the world believes that  if we knew for a fact there were other civilizations, religion would change.  god is, was, and always will be our great creator.Thank you so much for your time.","distance":"20 Feet or

very bright single red light. i have seen hundreds of planes and helicopters of all kinds living in the city and i have never seen a shape or color red light like that so i observed it heading easterly in my direction.  about a block down (1 min or so)the red light was just about over me in the sky. bright red light looked to be in the bottom center of the object as it passed. as it passed the light went off.  planes and copters never shut off lights so this perplexed me even further.  looking very hard for the object i did see it continuing in the same path but without the light and it was a hazy dark object but was sorta reflecting the star light.  it was not flying at a very high altitude like a coast to coast flight and was not the space station or stars.  i lost site of the object as it headed east and was too dark to make out against the darkness.  no noise at all.  i do want to say i do live in a landing corridor for planes coming into ord (ohare) but this was lower at all times then when planes come into land and it was heading in w to e, whereas the landings come in from e to w.\r\nmy best guess as to how high it was off the ground is about 500-1000ft. \r\nwhen the light went off and it was cruising along the object had a weird haze over it sorta like invisibility cloak look in halo or ghost in the shell but just like in them you could see something was there just not details. it was by far the weirdest object i have seen in my life and in that area. i have lived over the same area for a decade and never have seen a red light like that before.  red lights on the planes overhead are not as crimson colored as this light and this was only 1 light and again no noise what so ever.  landing planes are very very loud near me and helicopters make noise cause of the buildings sound reflects off.  the big shock was the light to start but then when it went off and it was still there cruising, planes never have no lights! i am sorry but my phone is about 5yrs old and the camera/video is bad so no pics or video.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
