brighter than earlier because the moon was visible in the ne sky (the cloud cover had mostly cleared). as i was looking northward to see how much the cloud cover had cleared, i noticed a bright orangish light become visible over/between some houses to the nnw of mine. the light was intensely orange, but not like a flare or roman candle, roughly roundish in shape, and initially was about the size of a pencil eraser held at arm's length (roughly a quarter-inch in diameter). it initially attracted my attention because it was much brighter than the usual planes and helicopters that fly overhead, and because of the odd color which was unlike the usual air traffic.\r\n\r\nthe light appeared to arc upwards and towards me before moving parallel eastward, visible above two houses across the street, then gained altitude and disappeared (growing smaller until not visible) at an angle upwards and to the north. it was visible for approximately two minutes, moving at a slow, steady pace. as the light moved eastward, it became more yellow-orange in color (though orange was still the primary color) and seemed to strobe slightly or perhaps flicker like flame.\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw the light, i watched it for 20-30 seconds before backing up on my deck to the door and yelling for my wife to come see it too. she arrived promptly and was able to view it for approximately 45 seconds. we went back in the house at 8:04pm after spending roughly 60 seconds after it disappeared watching to see if anything else became visible.\r\n\r\nafter thinking about it overnight, i suppose the object could have been a chinese lantern. the light \"flickered\" but never looked like flame and seemed a lot brighter than a candle relative to its distance, but i suppose it could have been a glow inside a paper bag. the apparent direction (southeast, east, then north) could have been an illusion and the actual direction more of a straight eastward arc with the light burning brightly at first (thus larger), then lessening (thus seeming to move northwards). however, if so the launch was pretty much a failure (the lantern would have risen in one neighborhood and burned out in another a mile or so apart).","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

wasn't anything we'd ever seen before.\r\n\r\nit was just after 5:30pm in los angeles. near the 101 and barham.\r\nit went from the southwest to the northeast. it went directly over universal studios and through their big beacon/spot llights. when it passed through the light it refracted it and looked like something moving in water, not light! it was moving too fast to be a blimp. it was completely silent so it wasn't a helicopter. they pass over the house often and are so loud they rattle our windows.\r\n\r\nit was a cylinder shape. it flew with the longer side leading and the short ends were up and down. and the craft was at a slight angle from where we saw it.\r\n\r\nupon seeing the craft we were not scared or frightened. just excited and bewildered. \r\n\r\nwe lost sight of it as it continued on its path towards the northeast. our deck faces straight west with partial views of the north and south. so once the craft went beyond universal studios we could no longer see it.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

be explained. i was approaching a red light preparing to make a left at a four way intersection. as i stopped three large, yellow lights appeared in what was, only a second ago, a dark winter night sky. these lights were the same size, and were side by side in a horizontal line. there were no lights that would give away the location of an aircraft nearby, like blinking lights on a helicopter. these three lights literally appeared out of no where, they were only a few hundred feet in front of me and were no more than 200 feet in the sky. when the lights illuminated, it was clear they were a part of a larger \"craft\". the craft itself was triangular in shape. i couldn't make out any significant detail on the craft, but its shape and size were unmistakable. the three lights were at least 80-100 feet in length from one end to the other, and about 40 feet from top to bottom. the lights were a brilliant white/yellow color. they did not blink, pulsate, or illuminate the surrounding area, rather just illuminated and stayed solid. the lights were facing me directly, as if i was looking at the rear of the \"craft\". once the lights illuminated they paused for one second without moving the slightest bit, and then the \"craft\" shot off in an eastward trajectory at a 30-45 degree angle into the night sky. i was listening to my car radio at the time with my windows up so i couldn't detect any sound, but something accelerating at that speed so close to the ground must have made some kind of noise, i would assume. this event happened very close to multiple residences and if it was a jet or something of that nature than it would've made an ear piercing sound. the craft accelerated at an impossible speed traveling miles in only a few seconds. it left a yellow trail from each side that dissipated as the \"craft\" moved, then simply disappeared. the entire event, from when the lights first illuminated until it disappeared lasted about 5 seconds, but it felt as if time stood still. whatever this was, it was flying low to the ground in a highly populated area at night. the acceleration of this object from a standstill was jaw dropping, it went from a few hundred feet from my car to miles away in seconds and then was just gone. the immense size and speed of it, and it being so close to the ground was frightening to say the least. i can't help but feel like i saw something i wasn't supposed to, and it can't be explained. upon further investigation on my part there is a hill only about 300 feet away from the stoplight and there are power lines that run along it. the lights appeared in between me and the hill, and disappeared over the hill and out of sight. i contacted the local air traffic control and was transferred to a man who had authority there. he did not dismiss my report or call me crazy, but instead listened to what i had to report. he told me that it didn't fit the description of anything they know of, and also assured me that nothing abnormal was picked up on the radar. he said there was a good chance that what i saw would go unanswered, and assured me that neither i nor the local residents had anything to worry about. while i can't know how many phone calls they receive of this nature, the man certainly didn't dismiss my claims and seemed honest and genuine with his answers. if this was military in nature than i must say i would feel a huge relief. knowing that our military possess technology like this would make me feel more safe and secure, and if they did keeping it a secret is completely understood. if this is not military in nature than i will continue to feel unsure of my safety. i have absolute confidence in our military, and hope, for all of our sakes, that what i saw is of military origin. if it is not then many things i once considered debatable are now unmistakable. when an event of this magnitude happens right in front of you it's impossible to avoid or dismiss it. what i saw was 100% real and not a single bit of information i provided is false.

balloon hovering close by their 400ft sunroom. when i saw it is was backlight so i only saw the silhouette of it. i thought it was a mylar balloon the ones with the leg that say something like happy graduation, or congrats. so, being i'm a noisy person, and i thought to myself \"oh one of these rich people had a party and one of the balloons had flown away. i wanted to see what type of event it was so i fixed my eyes on it. i floated close and closer from the darkness more to the light the mansion emitted(outside lights). it was about 100 feet in the air about 200 ft from me. that is when i noticed the surface of the creature, it was in the shape of butterfly wings that were fixed they were not fluttering, its legs where like chicken legs with 3 toes dangling, the surface of this thing was like raw hide, and the wings were \r\nexto-skeleton(meaning the bones ran along the perimeter of the wings. i thought to myself \"oh please dont scare me\", because i knew i was going to see this creature eye to eye.  i turned away and in that same second it create a great suctioning sound like a giant suction vacuum then a car appeared on the street at the source of the sound, which was hard for me to believe after the incident because on that street you can hear car come from miles away in that direction, i looked back and the creature was gone.\r\nthe night was still meaning no wind. years after i saw a balloon being tossed around in high winds and it reminded me of that night how this balloon like floating creature was steadily floated towards me. slow, steady.\r\ni never thought about reporting this but i feel i should. i never saw anything like this in ufo reports or the small men creatures i see portrayed in films.I know i saw a live being flying out on the horizon not far from me. if the balloon was picked up by wind i would of seen it because like i said i had the city light lighting up the sky. i have like superman vision i see things from a far. i would of been able to track this balloon. after the sound and what i saw i ran inside, i was scared.\r\nnothing else ever has happened after this.\r\n","distance":"101-500
