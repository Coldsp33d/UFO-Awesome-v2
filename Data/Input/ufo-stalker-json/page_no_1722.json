(my phone did not have a video or camera on it) once we got backed to my house we discussed what we saw, tried to call a couple of news stations, but they all thought we were crazy, and tried to find something that matched the description of what we saw online. my friend and i aslo sketched what we saw which was a diamond shaped craft with lights on the bottom. as we searched ufo images i came across this one that struct me in particular, because you can see right through it and besides a blue and red light where some of the yellow lights are on the top strip. it is pretty much the exact

(blackness) overhead in the south-eastern sky, a row of 3 neon green lights appeared, that looked to be lined up evenly on the back of what i perceived to be something solid. when it first appeared, it seemed to be stationary, but after a split second, out of each of the 3 green lights, came a trail, yellow in color, that curved upwards, propelling the object up and out of sight within two more split seconds.  it did not cross much of the sky, but dissapeared into nothing, just as it had appeared out of nothing.  my sense was that either it was flying at \"warp speed\" and it just left the area too fast to register much of its departure, or it actually became invisible again, just as it must have been before the green lights had appeared. judging from how clear i could see the detail, it could not initially have been that high in the sky.  it seemed to be in the direction, from my judgement, of the ia city airport, though, though it could have been beyond the airport, and just

not the same year tho. i was searching thru archives to see if there were any other sightings the same night as mine, 10 year difference but so similar it i knew i have to report mine now as well. \r\n\r\n jan 11, 1996- i had a second floor apartment in a section of manahawkin called beach haven west. it was maybe 500-800 feet from rt 72, and right before you get on the bridge to lbi. where i was in my apartment i would be overlooking the marshes to the north of rt 72. i had broken my leg badly, literally in half, in october and was in a cast from my toes to my hip. my girlfriend had left for the night, i was laying in bed watching tv. i had a long bedroom, and the window i was facing was to the north. i noticed a flicker of amber light thru that window, thought nothing of it. maybe a helicopter. continued to watch tv, every couple minutes seeing that amber light kinda go up and down slowly, light getting bigger. this went on for awhile, and i started to think maybe they were looking for something in the marsh, but didnt see any spotlights or nothing. its been out there for a good 20 minutes, 1/2 hr. now im watching the light more than the tv. it barely looks like its moving, gaining and losing a minimum amount of altitude, but enough for me to be watching it. ok, itll get closer, the house will shake, itll be a helicopter..Still watching, after a couple minutes it was getting closer and there were no green and red flying lights that i can see. at this point, even if it was a helicopter i had to see whats going on. it took a couple minutes to get out of bed and to the window, it was not easy, i was in alot of pain, and i was having complications i didnt know about till i had to go back to the doctor. i opened the window and propped myself up on the sill. \r\n at this point, i knew it wasnt a helicopter, and i knew it wasnt a plane. helicopters are out here all the time, coast guard, mosquito commission, etc. i also grew up 5 minutes from jfk airport. when we were talking on the phone back home, every 4 minutes youd have to tell whoever your talking to to hold on while the planes went overhead because you couldnt hear them. i know what a plane looks like. theres also a big military presence out here, warthogs, bombers, you name it. (to mufon, the phoenix lights are flares. i stupidly stood in a cul de sac pointing up to the sky because of lights appearing in the sky and hovering there, only to have a gentleman walk up to me and show me the plane that was dropping flares, exact same effect.)\r\nanyway, light kept getting closer and i can start to see how low it was, and how slow it was going. literally nothing more than 20-30 mph. about now it about 2-3 miles away over the marshes to the north and headed straight for me. it was getting close enough now that i saw it had more lights, the amber was the forward bottom of it, and a red and green to the other corners. much bigger than the lights on an airplane would be and steady, not flashing. now, i had to get outside. on crutches and hurting i hobbled out of the room thru the kitchen and onto my small screen deck. i wanted a clearer view than thru the screens and i had to hobble down a step or 2 outside the deck to get a wide open unobstructed view. this thing was getting closer and on a path to go directly overhead. i can start to make out a shape and it was a triangle, and it looked big. i watched it go over the marsh heading south, and watched as it crossed over rt 72 and eventually right over me. it was a huge black traingle with three lights, one on each corner,and not much of anything else. it passed literally 100-200 feet overhead, enough to know if a had a gun i could have hit it easily.

miles at high speed, observed for 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nthis observation occured on aug. 17th, 2005, at about 6:00 pm.\r\ni was driving back home after shopping at the mall in ontario, ohio.\r\nthere were few clouds in the sky.  the sun was shining brightly.  trafiic was light.  i was taking the short cut betwwen lex-spring mill rd and st rt 97, going south east.\r\n\r\ni stopped at the stop sign and looked for traffic, before pulling out onto rt 97 east.\r\n\r\nlexington, ohio is a medium sized town.  the area that i was in was urban, but i was right on the s-e edge of town.  just across the road from my car was a big field, which had corn in it.\r\n \r\nas i looked left into the north-east bound traffic lane, i saw a single-file formation of crafts coming stright toward my stopped position.\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw them, they were coming toward me from the north east. and if they did not change course, just before i saw them, the craft passed over the far western section of mansfield. the lexington area is slightly rolling and more hilly toward the n-e horizon direction.\r\n\r\nfrom where i was stopped in my car, i could see n-e approx. 5  miles at the altitude of 1000 ft. which is th ealtitude that i estimated the 5 crafts to be flying at. \r\n\r\nwhere ti was setting, there were no obstructions to my n-e or in front of me either. as i said, grain field was directly across the street from my car.\r\n\r\nwhere i was stopped at this state route 97 intersection.  i was just ready to pull out onto state route 97 east bound, from this side street.\r\n\r\nto set the stage, to visualize this encounter, i will say that:\r\nbecause there are no homes or businesses between my stopped position( in my car) and the n-e horizon, i could see clearly the approaching multiple craft formation very very clearly. i did not need to get out, nor was there time for that! \r\n\r\nwith the afternoon summer sun shining directly on the x5 crafts' near sides.   i saw them very clearly!\r\nthe crafts formation was flying toward me very very low and very fast, traveling from a n-e in a s-w direction.\r\n\r\nthe summer sun was shining on my car's rear end, as i sat with my car pointed only slightly southeast. \r\nand as i turned my head and looked n-e in an effort to look for on-coming traffic. there they were, right in my field of view.\r\n no cars were behind me, at this side street stop sign, so i did not move my stopped car, until the formation was out of sight through my right side window.  \r\n\r\nmy first impulse was to follow the ships, but they were flying very fast and very low toward the s.W.  \r\nthat was exciting enough,  but what the x5 crafts did, while they were flying toward and past me (from n-e) and also away from me (s-w), \r\nliterally blew me away:\r\ntry to visualize x5 each round gray metallic 200 ft od sized disc-shaped craft flying very fast and very low. the craft were aprprox.  1/2 mile away horizontally, as they passed in front of my car at approx. 1000 ft altitude. \r\n\r\nall the time as the ships were flying forward they were also playing \"leap frog\" as they passed over s-e lexington, ohio.  \r\nit was almost funny, maybe it was meant to be for our amusement?\r\n\r\nthe x5 craft were playing this leap frog (game), when i saw them approaching my position and they continued to leap frog, until i saw them fly out of sight 10 seconds later.  the x5 craft crossed my field of vision in approx. in 10 seconds.  you can do your own math on that, if you like.  i estimated their speed to be at approx. 350 mph.\r\n\r\nto explain the leap frog maneuvers, visualize x5 f15 jet air craft flying at 350 mph, all five in a single-file line -- following each other. \r\nexcept when they leap froged each other... each one moving in turn at (what appeared to be right angles in and out of this straight line formation) - they seemed to know when it was their turn, some times a craft would leap frog over (vertically) other craft, then other craft would leap frog around (horizontally) other craft.  it looked like robotic movements and must have been computer controlled.\r\n\r\nnote: (these ships were in no way (i repeat no way) our jet craft).  \r\nnote: we can/could not build anything with that precision, not even at area 51 or at the skunk works.\r\n\r\nthink about the navy blue angels trick-flying team and multiple their skill level by a factor of  x1000.  that's how fantastic these (pilots) were.  \r\nbut they must have been young, as old people don't need to take such risks!\r\nat any given time, as the ships approached my position and passed me by, there were no less than x1 craft simultaneously leap froging the other crafts.  and some times x2 craft were leap froging the others simultaneously, not one at a time like the navy does it. \r\n \r\nin after thought, it seems like they were thumbing their noses at us!!! they obviously did not care that they were being seen by humans.  it remained me of a air show, only much more dangerous.\r\n\r\nnote: to reach lexington from that n-e angle, the crafts had to fly right over eastern ontario,  which is just west of mansfield, ohio.\r\n\r\ni wanted to follow the crafts in the worst way, but there was no time to get all that done and there are no fast roads that would take me s-w, from where i was stopped. i was headed the wrong direction to follow them, and i was also on the wrong side of the river -- to back track to a road that went south. it would have taken me too much time.\r\n\r\nas i said, i was setting at a stop sign, ready to pull out onto state route 97 and drive the 15 minutes home.\r\n\r\nif the ships would have been very high in the sky, i could have watched them for a much longer time.\r\nmy car was setting on a level spot at this stop sign, and when the crafts flew over head, i could see them clearly in the middle of my left side window and then in my wind shield, and finally in my right side window.  the crafts were no more than 1/2 mile (horizontally) away from me, when they passed over head/ in front of my car, at the altitude of approx. 1000 ft.\r\n\r\nnote:  \r\nin mansfield, at the air national guard, we currently have c130s stationed there still. \r\nthese big planes (during shake down check out maneuvers) fly at about the same altitude, when they make their wide turns over my house, to fly back to mansfield, ohio. \r\nthese x5 ufo round metallic crafts were all identical to my eyes, and at that altitude the crafts must have been about 200 ft in od.  the leap frog maneuvers could have been a similar shake-down flight type of process?\r\n\r\nthe x5 crafts were flying very close to each other, and in line with each other, with no more than 200 feet max. between the x5 craft.\r\neach crafts leap frog maneuver (for each craft)  took about 1 second max. from start to finish, so i was able to see them do their individual leap froging several times each.  \r\nit was so fascinating to watch!  it's hard to describe it.\r\n\r\nin the 10 seconds that i watched and saw them, at 350 mph approx., the x5 craft had time to make several leap frog passes each.\r\ni have found only one other reference to ufos utilizing this flying leap frog maneuver. so i thought it good to share it with others.   \r\n\r\nevery new item helps to solidify a picture of these amazing craft.\r\nthe night time photos and night time sightings are okay, but they can in many cases be explained away,  and they are for the most part! but day time sightings of quality are more rare. \r\n\r\nif you numbered these x5 crafts 1 through 5 sequentially, i would say that craft #1 leap froged vertically over craft #3, while almost simultaneously craft #2 leap froged around craft #4 horizontally. \r\nand then craft # 4 leap froged over craft #5 vertically, and so on as they flew across.  it looked just like a kid's game to me!!  that was definitely not something the blue angels would have tried in their wildest dreams.\r\n and so this leap frog maneuvering continued like that for the full 10 seconds, that i watched them.  and because they were flying right toward me from teh n-e, i could see their leap froging clearly.  but it was more impressive to watch it as they passed in front of me. \r\n\r\ni did not see any cars around me during those 10 seconds.\r\n\r\n now to the part that drives men to watch for these elusive craft - their special xxx shape:  \r\ndon't laugh, the x5 crafts were round in the horizontal plane, being x8 wider in circumference at the very middle area, where there was a wide convex ring. above and below this middle area, the ships had elongated dooms on the top and bottom sections. the ships were of a silver metallic \r\ncolor, without lights.  the exact shape of the x5 craft were very clearly evident.\r\n\r\nthat's as good as i wish to do, without drafting you a literal drawing - which i can do, having had two quarters of drafting in college.\r\n\r\nthese x5 craft made no sounds, they had no visual appearance of a jet propulsion system. nor did they show the (jet wing-tip) vapor trails that the f15, etc.,  jets show flying low, in heavy damp air. \r\n\r\ni would not call them ufos, because i could and have identify them pretty well,  they were not ufos, nor were they un-identifiable!!!L  they were way to close to be ufos!!!\r\n\r\n i saw them very clearly with the sun behind me, with the sun shinning directly on all x5 crafts, but not so harshly that their shape was blurred.\r\nand they passed right in front of me.\r\n\r\nnote:\r\ni love air shows.\r\ni have been to many air shows and i love to watch the b17(s), b29(s), b52 (s),  f14 tomcats, the f15(s) and f16(s), etc. the newer jets do their air show fly bys... right on the deck, as they say.  \r\nthese air show us military jets seem to come out of no where, because they are so low to the ground vertically and also so close to you horizontally, and they seem to appear in your vision and in a flash they are gone again. \r\n\r\nthese  x5 round crafts were not that close to me, (as in an air show close up jet fly by), so i had much more time to watch them,  but still 10 seconds is not a long time either.  \r\n\r\ni estimated the x5 crafts to be flying low, so that i was looking up at a 25 degree angle to my forward horizontal direction, when they were directly in front of me.  and each one was the size of my closed man-sized fist - held at 3 ft from my eyes.  if that helps to fix their size?\r\n\r\nthe mansfield air port is on the n-e side of mansfield, which is not so close, and there are no power plants nearby. many sightings appear to be\r\nsome type of search pattern.  so what are they looking for, rare mineral deposits? \r\n\r\ni am still an excited witness 6 yrs later.  i am a highly trained and educated man with an engineering degree and 40 yrs in engrg.\r\n\r\nend of report. 12-09-2011\r\n\r\n","distance":"501

real slow towards me, after a few seconds another light turned on and then a few seconds another light turned on. the lights were so bright that there was a halo around each orb. the 1st orb changed from yellow to red ( it seemed to flow from yellow to red, like water sloshing from side to side slowly) and the other 2 orbs stayed yellow. the night was cloudy at about 800 to 900 foot cloud cover.

light up the bottom of the ship and it is still a dark color. the sky above the ship is grey cloud cover so the dark ship stands out.\r\n\r\nthe \"mothership\" hovered for 20 to 30 seconds, then

city expressway - saw a large triangle in the sky nearly overhead - it didn't appear to be moving - as i got nearly under it (though it was a little over to my left) i pulled over to see if i could identify it and take note of details - i was curious since it didn't appear to be moving and i'd never seen anything like it ie. how was it staying up there ? ........It was a triangle - large - there were 3 lights on the bottom of the craft at the corners, shining downwards - lights were constant and didn't change - i lowered my window to listen - there was no sound and the craft didn't move.......After maybe what seemed like 5 minutes i decided it was probably associated with the air force base in new jersey and i pulled back on the highway and proceeded to the shore house in ocean city - i have no idea how long it 'hovered' there after i drove away.........When i got home my husband asked me what i had been doing that i was an hour late ie. i had called him right before i left philadelphia.........So i guess i 'lost' approx an hour of time\r\n\r\ni recently saw a couple of ufo programs on tv where picture of large triangles like the one i saw were shown and the one i saw was identical - in the 90's i began to have trouble with my muscles and eventually participated in a study at univ of rochester where my ck levels were again seen as elevated - the info i got at the time was people like 'me' were being included in study which was originally designed solely for myotonic dystrophy - i apparently have a 'new' kind of muscular dystrophy - so do others in my family........Since that time a gene has been found for some people in the study in 'my category', though no gene has been found for mine that i know of, to date.............It was the show i saw on elevated ck levels that prompted me to make this contact with the account of what i saw\r\n\r\nthe date is approx, as is the time, since i chalked it up for so long as associated with the

the sky results of the photo or anything to argue with would be minimal at best. so, i've always made it a habit of taking photos in sequence. in that way enabling me to decide whether or not something belongs or doesn't belong. i took approximately 4 to 5 photos of a clear area somewhat to the left of the sun and clouds. in the very last photo there is an orb-like object. it doesn't appear to be moving- if it was, i couldn't tell. it definitely is not a glare from the sun. i also took other photos on other days, and noticed glowing lights that didn't belong. and in those sequence of photos, you can see that the object is moving. if i ran my photos from left to right in sudden sequence, you can see that the glowing light is moving. it's only obvious.\r\n i understand that there are people out there faking pics, but i can tell you that isn't the case with mine. you are more than welcome to look at them and study them any way you feel that is necessary.\r\ni'm not reporting that i saw a ufo. i'm reporting exactly what i've filed my pics under- \"doesn't belong\". but if it doesn't belong, and it can't be explained, then i personally would have no choice but to say it was a ufo.\r\nbut i'm not the expert, that may be for you to decide. and at the same time, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to tell me what it is or isn't.\r\nif you're interested please call me. if not, i'll just put these on \"facebook\" and share them with others. \r\ni'm 53 years old, and i definitely do not have time for games, here. if you guys are legit, or just out there treating this stuff like tabloid material, i will know based on how you respond.\r\ni also saw what i have no choice but to assume was a satellite being maneuvered until it came to a complete stop. and to this day, that object what i think is a satellite is still there. i would like for you to confirm that for me as well, if you don't mind.\r\ni thank you for your time.   jack
