them thoroughly, using a huge hdtv to zoom in, and he told me i should report this.\r\n\r\n3.  i thought it must be a ufo, seeing as it is unidentifiable thusfar.\r\n\r\n4.  according to my photos,  it seems to have moved significantly in aprox. six seconds between the two photos, and in the first one it's a little white circle or saucer looking shape, but the second photo it's in a different

approximate date above so i can get more information immediately. i am working on finding the exact date and time, but i am extremely eager to see if anyone else in the chicago area saw what we did.  there are several million people within 30nm of my location, i hope to find other people who saw what we did.  maybe they have more details to what we saw, or maybe we can corroborate their sighting as well.\r\n\r\ni will have to look in my records to pinpoint the date and time, but i did report the event to the ufo hotline the faa kankakee flight service station gave me the number to:  \r\n\r\nas a pilot of 22 years, flying everything from relatively large passenger jet aircraft to aerobatic aircraft i am pretty familiar with objects in the sky.  i have personally seen military flares, astronomical phenomena,  military aircraft, satellites, and nothing compares to what we saw in the cold early morning a few years back.\r\n\r\nstanding outside in the cold for my friend to smoke,  there was an abnormally bright star in the sky. it gained in brightness and my first reaction was that it must be a commercial flight descending from high altitude above kord (o'hare intl) and that the angle must have been just right to seem as if it was standing still and gaining in intensity as it got closer to us.. but it soon became evident that was not the case.\r\n\r\nit was so bright, and so pure a white color that we started looking at the object way before it started moving.  in fact, that is what was so curious about it at first, usually the atmosphere will appear to make something flicker, and show different colors (like a prism).  but there were no navigation lights, no strobes, and it didn't have multiple lights, but rather just that extremely bright light we described. \r\n\r\n after several minutes of talking to each other the we noticed the object started moving in a zig zag pattern across the sky.  not believing what i was seeing i used fixed objects, the garage roof, power line attached to the house, and side of the house itself as static reference points.  many times people experience a visual illusion of a bright light in darkness - i knew that from flight school.  so i used the fixed points to see if it was in fact moving in a zig-zag pattern or just an illusion.  i then paid very close attention to the power line to ensure it was not swaying - which it was not.  there was no wind, not even a calm wind.  the sky was clear and crisp. other \"fixed\" objects in the sky kept a relative position compared to it. obviously even the stars move, but over a much longer period of time.  only this one light/object had motion.\r\n\r\ngiven there was no noise, the object had to be very far away or it was silent... and for it to zig sag and turn so abruptly it would cause incredible g-forces on any object.  i felt then, as i do today that there is no reason i can imagine in which this would be an efficient flight path.  we talked about it for several minutes.  \r\n\r\nthis happened for a few minutes and then the object froze again in the sky and just stayed there for several minutes.  there were no recognition lights, or strobes, or wings, it must have been a round-like object either emitting light or reflecting light from the sun still beyond the horizon.  \r\n\r\nthen, still without any noise, the object accelerated to an unimaginable velocity in a steep turning arc to the northeast.  we saw it disappear over the houses and ran to the front lawn in an attempt to keep the object in sight longer.  \r\n\r\ninterestingly, several minutes later a second object seemed to chase after the first object, but rather than coming from a slightly western/overhead object like the first one - this object seemed to come from the south-southwest at an even greater velocity toward the same point the first one went.  \r\n\r\nat no time did any of these objects make any noise - and there were other aircraft during this period, from time to time, even at this time of night some traffic continued to either arrive or depart from o'hare.  all the rest of the objects were easy to identify as aircraft, both at low and high altitude.  \r\n\r\nim not saying that this was extra-terrestrial, all i know is that it did not portray any known flight characteristics i have ever seen in any aircraft, and that the velocity the objects traveled at the end is beyond anything i have ever seen before.  even at a medium altitude it would have been hypersonic.  yet there was no noise.  and the higher the object was the faster the object was traveling.  it could have been military, it could have been from anywhere - i have no idea.  but one thing is for sure, i have never seen another object like it before or after.  \r\n\r\ni am not interested in being on tv - but i would like to find out if there is anything else regarding this sighting from other people.

under the car and fred was under the hood, as i pulled myself out from under the car to get something (i was on my back facing the sky)i spotted a bright light, no bigger than the surrounding stars, but it was making a zig-zag pattern across the sky and traversed about 1/4 mile in about 2 seconds, it then lowered at about light speed to about 1500 ft. zipped back to it's original starting point (500 ft. lower) and did it again.\r\nfred and i watched this thing do this 2 more times untill it was at about 500 ft, we could then discern a shape of the thing, it was white and was comprised of three equally sized spheres connected in a triangle by 3 tubes.\r\nas the craft did it's pattern again it veered from the pattern and began to fall toward us as a leaf would from a tree, somewhat erratic but controlled, we fled like scared mice and ran toward the street (about 100yds. from my dad's parking lot) we tried to get two other people to just look up and they would have seen it too but both would not. \r\nwe watched the craft hover above a tree in the yard of a house next to the iga store where we had ran to.\r\ni could have hit the thing with a rock, it was an irridescent white, (like the inside of a clam shell) each sphere was approx. 20ft. in dia. and each sphere was approx. 10 ft. from each other' the thickness of the tubes was about 4-5 ft. i am quite sure of the measurements as i have worked construction all of my life, and having been in the navy i am quite sure of the altitudes also.\r\nwe both remember watching this thing above the tree, the entire episode lasted about 20 minutes (to our memory) but niether of us remember going back to the car, we did end up there though and our last recollection is that it was about 3:30 am.\r\ni have watched shows of yours and similar ones as well, i have not seen any other descriptions of this craft in recent years, but i have seen it in the distant past, there was a woman (in oregon i believe) on a similar show who actually painted portraits of the same craft.\r\nif you have no interest in this sighting can you at least put me in touch with someone who has seen the same thing, the afforementioned woman had an up-close and personal encounter, and i srtrongly believe that we have also.\r\n\r\nand last but not least, please take this seriously, we have wanted information about this most of our lives, we know what we saw! we know it wasn't from around here! we just want some answers, or to speak to someone who saw the same thing.\r\nthank you very much.\r\nyou may contact me for further information if you wish at the number or e-mail i disclosed.\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path then

mid continent airport when winds are from the south.  needless to say, i know what aircraft look like, and the lights on civilian and military aircraft.  i had made a campfire, was listening to music and chilling out by myself.  the owner of the fishing lease (sandpit) was having a get together across the lake and about 20 feet in elevation above me.  i was facing due east.  for some reason i felt compelled to turn around and face the west.  when i did i noticed this round sphere of light moving from west to east appx 500-1000 feet in the air.   it moved slowly, maybe 10-20 mph judging by the distance i observed it in the time allotted.  it moved directly above my head.  as it  was getting nearer to me, i became a bit concerned and decided to grab my nikon d70 camera out of my trunk.  i was a professional photographer in the past.  i figured it was going to get me, at least i would leave evidence!! lol.  anyway, it paused directly overhead of me and i managed to get one pic before it moved off.  the object was pulsating red/white/red/white.  it dissapeared above the tree line.  i went out to the edge of the shore to locate the object but i was unable to see it any longer.  what i found odd was the several people that were on the opposite shore and above my elevation, made no reaction to the object.  i listened to hear if they spotted it, but, there was no indication that they say anything at all.  weird, but, they might not have been looking my direction.  i do have a photo that i want to submit for analysis, which is the very reason i have decided to report this incident

(in a ssw direction)i was beside myself trying to think of what it could have been. i keep looking in the direction it went and tryed to decide if i should call 911 or the sheriffs dept. i decided against that. i then returned to where i had been sitting (on the diving board of my swimming pool) when i notice another bright light coming from the same direction and the same altitude. i'll be damned if it wasn't another one exactly like the first one that had just disappeared. it was like an instant replay of the first one. it also disappeared into the distance. it is very difficult to measure the total time but i think it was possibly 15 minutes from start to finish. there were no commercial aircraft at that time and this thing was totally silent. this all really confused me because my brain could not tell me what i was looking at. i have let over a month pass before reporting this but i just can't get it out of my mind. what the heck did i see?

then at 11pm while watching a movie, my boyfriend & i noticed from the window that there was something weird w the sky, despite the blinds being completely closed. we opened them and witnessed the densely cloudy/snowy sky, become incredibly illuminated 2 separate times, by bright organge/green and mostly blue flashes of lights. like lightening but with out the bolt.  just light.  it had been a very cold snowy day, the sky at this time was extremely cloudy and dense there is no way this could have been siren lights or a plane or helicopter.  there was about a 5 min lapse between our 2 sightings of the flashing lights. the 1st lasted about 10 seconds. the 2nd was just quick.  we camped out on our porch waiting for more but never saw any more.  we heard others on our block from their windows screaming \"come look, it is happening again\" this was from about 11-1130pm est.Also, after the 2 light occurrances we'd witnessed, sirens went off each time, but for a very brief period of time. however, over the hill across from our apt, the sky was dark gray and cloudy with the exception of a portion in the trees on the hill - it looked like how headlights illuminate a foggy night, you cannot see the individual 2 headlights but rather you see a bright white illumination coming your way. it was mostly stationary and broad. but sorta shifted from right to left at one point. very slowly. almost unnoticeable. again this was not a beam or singular light, but a white glowing on the hill through the pine trees. \r\nmy boyfriend and i immediately posted our experience, albeit small and explainable, online via facebook.  immediately there were responses of other witnesses from all over our small western pa town.  one friend, said she had been closing up at work at the mall around 9pm and the entire department store went pitch black. the local mall is about 20 minutes from my home.  ironically the mall is also within a few miles of the military base and a small local airport.  my boyfriend works very close to the airport and when he left work that evening at about 445pm he said a certain road was closed off, and there was a detour. there was a fire truck and policeman directing traffic.  on this particualr day, we had our 1st real snow/winter occur.  however, he saw no real reason why a road was closed or why there would be officials directing traffic.  the roads were not good but they were not horrible. people from all over town responded on facebook saying they had flickering lights or a power outage in their homes or business. my mother had called me telling me when going home from work she witnessed a slew of police and fire engines driving like mad in one direction towards a main street that is located between the mall and where i live. \r\n\r\nhere are a couple of posts from my facebook newsfeed of individuals who actually saw some crazy stuff in the sky!!  i have given them this link and have urged them to report their stories as mine pails in comparison to what they witnessed.  \r\n\r\n\"about 11 pm my husband went to the gas station in moxham. but then called home to tell us about \"flashes\" of freaky rainbow colored lights. of course we laughed at him and told him to shut him up, but then we looked out the window... it was as if there were a stage light from overhead with a lens that would change colors with each flash of light. we saw red, then orange, yellow, then green. it would flash blue a little longer than the other colors. richland direction looked really bright and towards moxham it was very dark grays and black. the lights did seem the brightest looking up through the gully towards walters ave/ galleria direction (where the mall and military bases are located).It was so bright it was like daylight. if you find out what it was, please post it because had we not seen this ourselves, we wouldn't have believed it. my husband said also said he and his friend saw the colored lights earlier along with 2 silver balls of light. it was only when it the flashing colorful sky happened, that he decided to call and tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\" so -- good to know im not crazy and that others saw this..I was headed home from work late last night & i was talking to my boyfriend on my cell & i abruptly stopped & was like \"woah what is that?\" i saw blueish like flashing coming from the sky. i thought maybe it was cops or an ambulance siren but there was none around. i was on the highway and would have seen them. then, what i thought at 1st was a shooting star,came straight down on the right hand side of 219 (highway) and descended into the woods. when it came closer it was a bright green ball of light. it was strange & i thought \"i am crazy\". lol\"\r\n\r\nunfortunately no one was able to capture anything on video or a picture.

(approx south to north) \r\nthe craft was dark triangle wider than long, similar in ratio to the b2 stealth bomber (without the cutouts at back). it was approx. 500-1000 ft away at approx. 200-500 ft above ground. like report from mo,us the characteristics that were the most striking were the complete absence of sound and the way it slipped through the air 'gliding' at such a smooth and constant rate (other than the brief zig-zag) that it stood out as odd. i have thought about that many times, and my best guess is that when we see an airplane moving through the air it must have tiny fluctuations in velocity, yaw, altitude or combination that are extremely tiny but that we can register. and when an object moves in front of you with an exact smooth path, with zero fluctuations in path or speed it stands out as looking odd.\r\nanyway, the craft we saw did not appear to have the mist that you describe around it, but did appear to have a very faint distortion of atmosphere around it, maybe heat waves ? the craft had several very very very dim lights clustered around the wing tips approx. 5/6 per side. the 'lights' did not appear to be emitting light but closer to infrared (similar in some ways to the infrared leds on security cameras). this is not a case where 'we think we saw something', this thing was pretty close, could see the shape clearly. if it was a plane it would have been very loud, but no (zero) sound. unfortunately because of the angle and darkness we did not get a good idea of how thick the craft was (height). we can describe and draw (we did) the bottom shape of the craft with some detail, but sorry no info on 3d shape and detail on top.\r\nthe craft traveled away from us, then it simply vanished. we were looking at it, it was darker than the sky behind it, as it got farther away (< 1 km away) we just instantly lost sight of it. could be that it just faded into night sky, but it did feel as though it instantly disappeared... \r\ntotal duration of sighting 6-8 seconds.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:08","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":33892,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.262915,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-12082011-0009","longitude":-85.3186139,"occurred":1287633600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1323372717000,"summary":"Re:

observed a bright white/yellow light. as soon as i saw the first light, almost a second or so later i so another light identical to the first light up directly parallel and to the left to the first. i exclaimed and drew the attention of my friend. as she turned and looked a third light illuminated again directly parallel and to the left of the other two lights. all three lights hovered and stayed illuminated for approximately 3 to 4 seconds then completely disappeared. we kept watching the sky in the same spot we had seen the lights and after watching for approximately 30 seconds or so a forth light appeared a considerable distance from were we saw the other three. it hovered and was completely stationary for a few seconds then another light appeared in the exact spot that i had observed the initial series of three lights. the last light that illuminated appeared to be in the exact spot that the second light i initially had observed had been. these two lights stayed illuminated for approximately 10 seconds and then disappeared. none of the lights i saw ever moved, and the three initial ones all appeared to be lit up in a perfectly straight line with some distance apart from each other. \r\ni attempted to use my cell phone camcorder to record the lights however by the time i could get the camera up and running the lights were never seen again. all i could record was the exact area they were seen, and our reaction right after they disappeared. we watched the area for another 10 or 15 minutes and never saw anything else.\r\ni've been a law enforcement officer for 9 years, and my friend that was with me been a cop for almost 10 years. i've also grown up on southside savannah near the army air base and i've never seen anything like that. i can say with 100% confidence it was not a plane and it was not a helicopter. i don't know a lot about flares but i can't imagine that one would only light up for a few seconds. additionally i can't see how someone could shoot three flares moments apart had have them all line up in an exact straight line from each other had stay completely stationary. also the forth light that was seen based on my best guess of the distance had it been a flare fired from the ground someone would have had to have been a considerable distance even miles from the other three then fifth light. i also never heard any planes, or sounds at all indicating that these lights could have been coming flares fired off by a plane playing war games. the definitely were not in rapid session in the manner in which i've seen flares fired from fighter aircraft before.

about to close the passenger side door of the car when my 7 1/2 year old grandaughter, in the back seat passenger side, said, \"look, the moon is moving.\"  so i looked up (up and to the east)and explained that it was the clouds that were moving fast past the moon which looked almost full but not quite.  then, i noticed a large, maybe circular, kind of fuzzy edges, but not sure, shadow below to the left of the moon.  it appeared to be moving back and forth when all of a sudden, it shot across the sky, still behind the moving clouds, to the right (south) then down then south like a zorro elongated \"z\" and then disappeared behind heavier clouds.  after that i thought i may have seen a very distant airplane further to the south in a break in the clouds by virtue of the lights and movement.  my grandaughter immediately said, \"what was that?  a big bird, a shooting star?\"  i couldn't believe she saw it, too and i told her that i saw it and was excited because i had never seen anything like it. she even said that maybe it was an alien ship and i said it does seem like a ufo.  we talked about how all of a sudden there were no clouds by the moon anymore, only to the south.  anyway,.......My bad....She is terribly upset and frightened now, thinking it's an alien ship.  now, we are hoping it was santa practicing his run....This was amazing and highly unusual and i may have dismissed it if she didn't see it, too.\r\n\r\n(names moved to fi box)  cms 12/07/11 20:31 cst

urgency in her voice and i quickly leapt out of bed.  i went out back to see what she was looking at, and there was a bright yellowish greenish light in the sky just above the treetops to our south. i went back in to grab the binooculars as it seemed fairly far away.  it first appeared to be static, but withing seconds looked as if the lights were pulsing and changing shape, and sometimes just completely shutting off, with a faint outline of the dark object, and a single dim red light in the center.  fairly soon after watching it, it hovered/floated slowly out of view.\r\nthen the following evening, after we had finished up the work day, my girlfriend was on the back porch, having a smoke, and i hear her again calling for me to come quick.  it was a little after 6 pm and i went for the binoculars again, and got a good view of it.  this time the object appeared to be yellow-orange and the light was more in the shape of an oval. it may have been slightly closer this time, but it seemed larger thand just the outline of the light.  then it acted the same as before, shutting the bright light on and off. when the light was off, even though it was dark you could still make out a faint outline of the object, hard to tell the shape though.  creepy.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
