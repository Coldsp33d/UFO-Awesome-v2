a lil to the left of me. i was looking at the stars and saw two orange orbs, very close together sort of dart in from the trees, headed away from the river on the opposite/to the left of the pit. like it came from the badger rd. northpole area. they came in to about the center of the pit. they shuffled and bounced around eachother while still going in the same direction. one of the orbs \"shuffled\" in place in the center while the other went past, up, and looped around to the other one, hitting it. it seemed like they were chasing eachother and the other one missed the first stopping and came back around. after the one hit the other they just vanished. they didnt blaze, dart, or fly. they stayed were they were and were just gone. the whole thing lasted maybe 30 sec. and i think one other person may have seen something as well. i was in a group of about 10-20 people, the objects made absolutely no noise. i thought it was strange but kind of dismissed them, until about 2-3 weeks later. my boyfriend was checking the rants and raves section of craigslist and came across a strange article. the \"man\" who posted the note said that he lived, or was in the badger rd. area a few weeks prior and saw 2 strange objects. he said that they were small orbs that glowed a bright orange/yellow color. he said he saw them move from his area and head back toward the river/fairbanks direction. it aslo said that he thought they were possibly fighting. unfortunately the add was removed before i could reply and i have no idea who this person was. i found this very coincidental and i could not ignore what i saw.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

only be described  as an organic looking connected formation of lights that hovered about 100 feet above the lake. the object moved towards my location initially then moved to the right slowly, while at the same time it changed shape and colour. i remember seeing red, purple, green ,orange and blue. the object's reflection could clearly be seen in the dark lake.  at one point the object even seemed to form a face and arms. it was not a craft or ship of any time was certainly not man made. but it was clearly glowing and and a defined image. it kept moving right before it dropped below the

summer since looking for more. theres a creek down the street to where my first sighting took place, and around the creek is trees and forests. thought i'd go down there since that is the area where the flying saucer of my first sighting seemed to materialize hoping i'd catch more. didn't really know how lucky i'd be but it was worth a shot. around 1900 hours i begin my trek to the creek. scanned the skies and horizons around me, all i can see are \"airplanes\". thought to myself, \"the skies seem a little too busy... i dont think these are airplanes...\" but to give rationalism the benefit of the doubt, let's just say they really were airplanes. so for a while nothing but \"airplanes\". and one airplane behaving suspiciously caught my eye, seemed to be going very very slow, almost hovering and coming slightly off towards me from northwest-ish (..I want to say?) so to keep myself from being silly i assume it is an airplane, it is then i look the opposite direction of the \"airplane\". and saw a sphere like object hovering over the trees in the distant horizon. it was orange in color, the same exact color of our orange street lights, so naturally, that is the first thought of rationalism that came to my mind. \"it's a huge street light!\" i presumed. this sphere was about the width of, maybe, two pine trees off in the horizon it sat. so immediately the second thought that came to mind was a hot air ballon. something that big, hovering, of course it's a hot air balloon... \"at this hour???.. in the dark???.. can't see the electric lines! why would somebody be flying a hot air balloon in the dark running the risk of hitting power lines???\" i questioned myself. every inch of it was glowing orange, it lit up the trees surrounding it with orange light from its glow. and of course, common sense told me, they don't make street lights that big, nor do i think that is a hot air balloon. so i knew then, that this was what i set out to find. so i keep starring at it, and about 5 - 10 mins of hovering, it starts to move. it moved slowly and deliberately, towards me but slightly off of my direction. and what seemed to be very far away from me at first off in the horizon, only took maybe 30 secs. to maybe a minute to get to within maybe .. .. i want to say 40 - 60 ft. away from me on the opposite side of the creek. my view was constantly obstructed by trees when it began its flight path. the only time i got a clear view of it was when it was hovering over tree tops in the horizon. i think that it changed its elevation and direction because the height of the horizon is significantly higher then the height i was at, and from the direction it began its flight path to where i last saw it, through the trees, the object was very close to me. even seemed like it was going to cross the creek at one point as it flew closer and closer, gradually moving closer to the creek. i eventually lost sight of the object and can no longer see any kind of orange light anywhere whatsoever, even through the trees. so that is where my sighting ends. but the same time i lost sight of the orange sphere, an \"airplane\" flew out of the tree tops above in the sky, in the same exact spot where i lost sight of it, around the same exact elevation of the object and headed east. an airplane with strobe lights and all, flying pretty low in elevation making no noise whatsoever, slowly going east. now, i'm not going to jump to silly conclusions, but i will say that is one helluva coincidence.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

been circulating in town) as to why all the jets have been in over our city)as well as it was just above the power-lines, as if it had an intelligent navigation system. the object swooped down from the hill behind me, as i kept my eye on it since i was looking in the same direction it was going. and it moved to fast to be so low towards the ground, without zero sound. i lost visual after it vanished among the small hill moving east. \r\n\r\n4. the object was very soft in color, as yellow white/gold and it had a cast off as in a backwards c shape like a white see through yellow from it's

would say about as big as my mid size vehicle, maybe a little bigger, but not much. \r\n\r\n5. i stopped and looked behind me, to see if any of my neighbors were out and seen, but i was alone. i immediately grabbed my cell phhone in which, for the 1st time since i've owned it did not have a signal so i took my phone outside and with one bar!
