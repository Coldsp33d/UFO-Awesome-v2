the intersection if 291 highway and 150 hwy when i noticed a round object with very bright white lights to my west.  it would take a baseball held at arm's length to cover the object. the white lights had a blue hue to them and all of the lights were on the bottom of the craft.  the lights were strobing, and there was no sound whatsoever.  it was a clear night with no cloud cover, and the oject was very low, just above treetop level.  i watched as it hovered, and filmed it with the dash cam on my patrol car for approximately 15 minutes, then finally turned the camera off because i didn't want to use up memory on the camera.  i called dispatch, who got a good laugh out of it, but they wouldn't take me seriously.  i requested a copy of the video when i arrived at the station and will forward that to mufon when i get it. the object then moved to the west slowly at first, then sped up very quickly and was out of sight in a couple of seconds.  i stopped at quick trip and several families came up to me and asked if i saw the ufo. i assumed that they would call in a report, but according to dispatch there were no other reports received. i am disturbed that something like this was not taken more seriously by my supervisor and looked into.  i searched the internet and found missouri mufon, and decided to file an official report. i am a former marine, have been a police officer for six years, and have never seen anything like this before.  i am familiar with conventional aircraft, and this was not any type of normal aircraft. \r\ni saw a similar object on october 31 in the same location but did not file a report about it.  this object was closer than the other one. i called another officer to come out and he saw the object, too. we both want to remain anonymous at this time.

so it was either early spring, or late fall of 1980, unfortunately i do not recall which one.  the event occurred just west of i-435 on e 55th st in kansas city, missouri.  my mother and i were in a chair under a blanket before bed time looking at the stars.  on the same piece of property on it's north line is the far end of brush creek.  here the creek is tree lined.  we were sitting there and suddenly, without have noticed anything previous a bright white orb appeared.  even at that age i noticed that it was very odd in the respect that although bright, it did not cast light on the trees and ground around it.  the orb was larger than aspirin sized but smaller than a dime.  this orb remained lit for nearly a minute.  the light then went out.  without seeing any dark object, a few seconds later the orb reappeared 30-50 feet right of the position it had been previously.  this time the orb appeared a deep dark crimson red, again casting no light.  the orb remained lit for approximately the same amount of time it did originally.  the light then went out and nothing more was seen of it.  i remember discussing it with my mother, on how odd it was, and that it couldn't have been a helicopter as it made no noise at all.  to this day, and in the past, my mother has no recollection of this event.  my mother and i lived with my grandmother at this home.  she was home, and inside at the time.  i remember my mother and i telling my grandmother what we had seen.  she too has never had any recollection of this event.","distance":"101-500

property we own in a very secluded part of an unpopulated area to start a fire and get some rest before continuing north. around 4 am i noticed an orb straight above a hill that hadn't been there before and it moved in a light circular pattern. i knew right away it was too bright to be a star but wasn't making a sound so it couldn't be a helicopter. i grabbed my i-phone and hoped it'd be able to catch it. luckily it was the only object in the sky bright enough even though there where planets and thousands of stars out. after taking a couple short videos i became a bit uncomfortable being miles from the nearest human and out of cell distance for at least an hour. i got in my car and drove to the gate to lock it and leave but then when i got out from my car i saw the orb moving from the hill towards me, so i jumped in my car and left the gate open. i drove to the nearest house and parked outside but didn't want to alarm anyone at the easy risk of sounding like a crazy person. so i waited there knowing if anything happened i could honk my horn. i took a couple more videos of the orb which had followed me and soon decided to drive further to the next place i knew people lived and there was a land line. it followed me miles down the road where i stopped again. i took some more videos and felt a little less scared now. i had rationalized that if it was going to hurt me it would have already done it. i remembered that i needed to lock the gate so i reluctantly went back to lock it and the orb followed me back. day was starting to break and i had drained the battery on my phone from all the videos but the orb continued to be visible during early morning after all stars disappeared. after i locked the gate i continued to drive home and look back every now and then but i lost the orb in the morning fog and never saw it again. as soon as i got home i told my parents even though i new it sounded crazy, i just felt i had to tell someone. they believed me because they knew i wouldn't lie about something like this. i'm a pretty skeptical person myself so i showed the videos to them and a couple friends. they didnt come out as good as i thought they would because the movement of the object was hard to see with my hand shaking and also on the i-phone the object appeared much smaller and less bright than in real life. i thought about reporting the sighting right away but didn't like the fact that already i was getting skeptical feed back from my friends and decided to stop telling people about it or showing the videos. but after hearing from many of the neighbors in that area, some very credible, that they had seen similar orbs, i decided to make this report.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

east-southeast on nebraska highway 2. my brother says he looked over towards the southwest and saw a larger than normal light blink off. at first he thought he had caught a reflection of headlights off of the windshield but as he continued to watch he saw another light blink on followed by the first light blinking on again. he got my attention and i wanted to view the lights without worrying about driving off the road so i pulled onto the nearest gravel road and started heading south. the two lights were equidistant from each other and seemed to be drifting north-northwest slowly. we noticed three planes nearby, we could easily see their wing lights blinking in the sky. as we followed the country road south, first one light dimmed and then pulsed out then the other one. so we turned around and followed the gravel road back to the highway. we had no more than turned back onto highway 2 (again headed southeast) when my brother shouted that the lights were back and brighter this time. so we again turned onto the next nearest road headed south. this time the lights were positioned further east of where they had been before. just like before the lights would dim then brighten before they finally dimmed completely and then blinked out. once again we turned around and headed back for highway 2. we were back on highway 2 just past palmyra when once again the lights appeared and this time there were three bright yellowish orange lights that formed a boomerang shape. we watched for about three minutes as the outside lights would perform the brighten and dim pattern they had been doing previously while the center light stayed on and never dimmed or pulsed. after about three minutes the light on the left side dimmed quickly and went out, closely followed by the right one. the center light stayed on for about 30 more seconds before it too dimmed and went out. we did not see the lights again even though we continued to look for them for about 20

grandfather's house in scranton. it was early evening in summertime just after dark. we were on the scranton expressway heading east when we saw cars bumper to bumper pulled over.  then we saw three objects hovering low approximately 300 yards from the highway.  traffic slowed to a crawl watching these objects.  they were golden in color and had some kind of appendage sticking out what i assume to be the front.  we were totally awe struck by what we saw. there was no room to pull over so we kept going.  i never observed the objects do anything but hover.\r\n\r\nwhen we got home we assumed it would be covered on the local news. it wasn't.  i thought it would surely be covered in the scranton times newspaper.  i searched the paper for days afterward but there was never any mention of it.  there had to be at least fifty witnesses but i have never found anything more about it.\r\n\r\nthis event stuck with my mother and i for a long time.  my mother would sometimes look for objects in the night sky.  \r\n\r\nin 1974 there was a ufo \"hoax\" nearby in carbondale, pa.  i quote hoax because my mother believed there was probably something to the story but was covered up.  my mother was not the kind of person to believe in elaborate government conspiracies or anything but she truly believed, based on our experience there is something to the ufo phenomenon. \r\n\r\nover the years i put it out of my mind almost afraid to talk about it.  i figured people would either think i'm crazy or a liar.  things are different now.  i have a lot of company.\r\n\r\ni have tried to find out more about what i saw but can't.  i thought if i posted my account maybe someone else who was there that night might see it and add details i can no longer remember.","distance":"101-500
