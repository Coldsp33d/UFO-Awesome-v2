\r\ni was the southern california desert driving south on winding a two lane highway west of palm springs at about midnight many years ago. i was laying in the backseat of a sedan looking out the rear window. \r\n\r\nthe object caught my eye because it was moving and was so much brighter/bigger than the stars in the sky. \r\n\r\nit was a round or spherical object emitting bright light in all directions (like a mini-sun). the light was bright white/yellowish in appearance. the interesting thing was that several helicopters were circling the object, close enough to it that the helicopters were illuminated by it. only one chopper at first then several more joined it for a total of 5 or 6 then eventually only one helicopter remained. the object would move up and down and the helicopters would seem to follow. this happened for 10-15 minutes when eventually the object flew off into the desert. the object did not move quickly but sort of floated/lumbered along. there was no engine noise

also seemed extremely solid.  i tried to scream, but i could not muster up a voice. i walked around the neighborhood staring at it making sure not to take my eyes off, and the object didn't budge or disappear. since nobody seemed to be noticing me in the middle of the street, i decided that it seemed that my friend was in immediate danger and that i should get as close to the object as possible and let them know there's an egg on their house. to approach the house and make a noise i had to knock on a door or a window which required taking my eye off the object for a second or 2. i decided it was worth the risk since my voice wouldn't work (probably due to nervousness), and i knocked on the door, jumped back to where i could see the object, and it was completely gone. at this point the sky

one or two hundred yards away and no more than a hundred yards in the air, but it was dark and i had no terms of reference. i thought it might be float plane coming in to land but the lights didn't move. then they seemed to turn a little to the north because the right hand two lights (vertically arranged) dimmed slightly, but again they didn't come any closer. then the lights turned towards me and started moving. at that point i could see two flashing red lights between and even with the lower pair of 'headlights'. again i assumed that it must be a float plane coming in to land (i was at a marina). but whatever it was moved incredibly slowly - much slower than a sunday driver, maybe 15-20 mph - and flew almost directly over head - i'd guess at no more than a hundred feet up.\r\ni could not make out any outline of what it was - the lights didn't appear to reflect off of anything. but the strangest thing was that it was totally, totally silent. a helicopter or even an ultralight would

girlfriend's condo. we arrived home from work, ate supper and settled-in for the evening. after making love in the down stairs livingroom we, unfortunately, argued about something stupid. she fell asleep on the couch and i on the floor in front of the couch. some time later i was woken by the strangest sensation - like i was levatating, while in the lying (back-side) postion, unable to move like i was paralyzed. i was terrified as i realized that i was sort of floating back to my original place in front of the sofa, literally several inches off the floor. i instinctively knew that i was being \"returned\". though i was paralyzed, i tried to scream, but could not. my eyes were free to move about, though, and off to my left i could see what can only be described as a translucent orb above the front entrance/door which led to the driveway. a thin translucent cord extended from my mid section, and as the orb began to move toward me, eventually positioning directly overhead, i could see that the cord and orb were one, like a beam of light. the orb disappeared and i fell free. i jumped up and, in a panick, woke my girlfriend, blabbering this story to her. she dismissed it as a bad dream and led me upstairs to bed.\r\nfor many years afterward i would find myself in a fight to wake up from these strange moments of feeling paralyzed when asleep at night, sometimes waking not in my bed but on the floor or even in another part of the house. after such events, i intuitively knew that i had somehow been \"taken\" somewhere and then returned. was i sleep-walking, i thought? as a child my parents told me that i was prone to sleep-walking. but my gut told me that this was different. i have only woken during a return event twice, and they have become less frequent. i think that i am able to resist - \"fight off\" - these events as i have grown older, but i can't be sure. i have recently become increasingly agitated and unable (and unwilling) to sleep. something in the back of my mind is keeping me confused and anxious, as if an event were going to take place very soon. \r\nwell, there you have it. i'm either crazy

direction, but the intensity of the light changed from very strong to almost dissapear, it was random no secuence. i saw it for aprox. 2 minutes untill it disappeared on the horizon. 8 minutes later appeared another ufo about the same direction, and 15 seconds later another one appeared following a liitle faster with a slight different direction. both were with the exact same description of the

called my mom so she can see them. i took about 80 pictures of the ufo with dgital zoom, because of the broken screen i only got one good picture. it's actually strange for me that at first look the

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Started with one light in the sky that had been in the same spot for at least 45 minutes. i was driving during the whole sighting and was headed toward this light for like i said around 45 minutes, never changing size or character. i thought it could have been a planet because it was slightly brighter than your usual star with a faint reddish flicker. \r\n\r\nwell to my great surprise, this light all of a sudden started to morph into multiple lights then multi colored lights. i at first was trying to discover what sort of helicopter or plane it was even though i was astonished that any of this was even taking place. my father and brother are both pilots, one commercial and the other just retired from the national guard flying chinook helicopters. at some point i considered the lights could be coming from a chinook helicopter due to the distance between the lights and the strange angles at which it was flying... first what would appear to be the nose of the craft nose down for a bit then alternated to nose up. well i was quite happy with this assumption until it changed direction and started to what appeared to be tumbling like aerobatics turning and twisting but at a very slow relaxed pace and speed. at one point it was right above my car. i have a sun roof and i opened it for the occasion. it remained directly above me for a would say a good minute, and that is when i got the best look at the craft. it continued on with this same movement pattern and the multi colored lights continued in their sequence change and patterns. it appeared as though each individual light changed multi colors and so forth. for the space craft itself, i had never seen anything like it and still do not know what to make of it. it did have some straight lines and angles, but the actual shape of it i still cannot make out to you. it i would like to say was more triangular shaped at some angles it looked diamond shaped with again, sharp angles with smooth and rounded off shapes as well. the bright alternating lights unfortunately impaired my vision to get a really clear image of its entirety. \r\n\r\ni was so focused on what was above me that i almost missed what was happening in my periphery. \r\nso just like the original light i saw, one very similar light appeared out of no where in the distance, then suddenly morphed into multiple lights then into multiple colors and shapes. had similar speed and movements. very agile and elegant like the first. then another, and another and another. they started appearing every where. somewhat evely spaced and similar flight patterns and paths. they all started i would say around 10 to 20 miles away then creeped in much closer in a very quick and effortless amount of time. then once again made a descent into the distance turning into the one bright light, then vanished. \r\n\r\ni was in shock and trying to keep focused on there movements and behavior to really feel anything, as well as occasionally focusing on the road and fellow travelers on the road not to collide with any to really feel anything until it was all over. i do have to say though, when that one was hovering above me, i was overwhelmed with many sensations, one being that i felt like it was connecting with me in some way. as if it new i was fully aware of its presents and sought me out. it was like it headed straight for me. when all of this was initially occurring, i called a friend of mine that i had just hung up with explaining what i was experiencing. as soon as i had left multiple messages on his phone and finally gave up, it took a b line straight towards me, then hovered above me like i explained earlier. \r\n\r\nonce they all vanished, i did experience a strange smell. a smell not like i have ever experienced like in this area, or ever in such magnitude. it was like a chemical burn or something like that. not to pungent but very strong and quite heavy for that sort of smell. smelt it for about a mile or so. \r\n\r\nwell, thanks for your time. oh, yes, i do want to expand a bit on my location. i live in san francisco and was was heading to stockton. i had just crossed the altamonte pass approaching the i5 junction to la all the way up to tracy. i do believe they have air force bases there, not too sure though. there is pretty much a whole bunch of nothing out there but hill billy's, cows and power plants. just in case you where interested.\r\n\r\nthanks again,\r\n(name removed to fi

does that look like a plane to you?���  he agreed with me that it was definitely not a plane.  at that moment, i called my girlfriend to see if she could see it from her place since she lives right near the lake, but she was not home at the time. the object moved from south to north in a pretty straight path, it was below the cloud cover, and it made no sound whatsoever.  i witnessed it from the southern edge of lakewood and my brother and i watched it move in the sky until it was not visible anymore; which was somewhere over lake erie.  it took roughly 2 minutes for it to make that path.  i definitely know the difference between airplanes (commercial, small craft, and military) and helicopters.  this was 110 percent not any of these.  it was not a meteor as it moved too slowly.  it was definitely under intelligent control. \r\nhere is something interesting too��� about 3 or 4 weeks ago, the local news reported the times when you can view the international space station in the sky.  my other brothers��� friend went outside at that time to check it out.  he was with a friend of his, and he said that after looking in the sky for a while he saw an orange fireball below the cloud line moving from south to north, making no sound over the same city.  i believe what my brother and i saw is the same ufo my brother���s friend had seen weeks earlier. amazing!\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":33715,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.5161162,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11292011-0024","longitude":-82.9965425,"occurred":1322623680000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1322637365000,"summary":"Fireball like object moving south to north over eastern/central lakewood.","tags":["fireball"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"44107","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Lakewood, Ohio","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:22325"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Nashua","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was up very early soothing an infant. while lying on the couch i happened to notice what appeared to be an airliner jet pass by, which is very common for the area. i thought nothing of it at first, but then the object, which up to that point i could only make out as a series of blinking lights, abruptly started going in the opposite direction. airplanes don't do that, i was thinking. i then observed the object move back and forth in a zigzag manner, then started strobing like a police car flashing, but only white light. okay, weird. itremained stationary while puting on this display. after about what seemed like a minute it became a very bright, single point of light which proceeded to move in an apparent straight line from south to north. it quickly went out of my line of sight and i had to run to a window at the opposite side of the house. i was able to get sight of it again and watched it for about another minute until it disappeared beyond the horizon. i was never scared. on the contrary, i was fascinated.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":33714,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.7697662,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11292011-0023","longitude":-71.465156,"occurred":1321710600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Hampshire","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1322634420000,"summary":"Strobing light in sky. moved straight like plane at first, then made zig zag maneuvers. stopped strobing, became single bright white light moving from one end of the hoizon to the other, making abrupt minor course corrections.","tags":["light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"03062","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":10,"locationName":"Nashua, New Hampshire","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:22326"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82758,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1727}
