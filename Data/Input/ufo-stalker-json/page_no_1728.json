our home. my brothers remember hearing a screaching sound, which sent them running to the front yard to hopefully see a cool car speeding away. after their disappointment they returned to the back where we noticed, near the same time, a disk shaped ship hovering over the back of our next door neighbors house. i saw the door slide open and a short (3 foot tall) ape-like being walk out onto a narrow catwalk that appeared to encircle the ship. he walked a few steps to my right and kneeled down and opened a small door on the side of the craft. he used a small tool to make some type of adjustment, and closed the small door before returning inside. while he was out, a second being walked to the door and watched him. the second guy was taller, maybe 5 feet. they were both covered in thick brown hair, but well groomed. both were wearing a coverall but not anything resembeling a space suit like our nasa guys wear. after the door slid back down, the ship started ascending at a slow speed. when it reached about 100 feet, it ascended almost straight up and out of sight in 1 or 2 seconds. the beings made no audible communication between each other, and didn't pay any attention to the 3 boys silently staring at undoubtable proof of life on other planets. my brothers knew they were looking at alliens, i didn't. i knew i had never seen anything like this before, but i wasn't old

i was in my house in stafford, va.  i was by myself at the time.  the weather was clear.  i walked over to close my back door and noticed through my sliding door a very bright object in the sky, toward the east.  the angle of elevation from my viewpoint was probably about 45 degrees.  the big lights were white, but it also had a few blinking red lights, not the normal red and green lights you would see on the wings of a commercial airplane.  i am accustomed to seeing planes in the night sky as we are on a path toward the dc airports.  this was much lower than the planes normally fly and was traveling roughly north to south rather than the normal south to north-flying planes we are accustomed to seeing at night heading toward the airports.  my first thought was that it must be a helicopter with searchlights and i wondered for whom or what they might be searching.  there was another plane in the area when i noticed the object, but it was much higher and appeared to be just a plane on its normal route toward the airport.\r\n\r\n     as i continued to watch it, the object moved very slowly in a southerly direction.  i noticed that the extremely bright lights were not aimed at the ground as if it were a search helicopter.  it moved behind the trees in back of my house.  i thought it was strange, but figured i���d seen the last of it so i went and sat down.  from my chair where i was watching tv i can see that same section of the sky. maybe 5 or 10 minutes later, i saw what i assume was the same object traveling back this way, south to north.  as it got closer, it slowly turned and moved toward my house, just over the power lines.  when it turned toward me i could see that it was very large and had 3 huge, round white lights spaced widely and evenly across the front.  i could see for certain by now that it was not a helicopter.  plus, we see and hear plenty of helicopters here due to our proximity to the quantico marine corps base and other military installations.  i am very familiar with the loud sound of a helicopter going by.  as it approached, i began to hear that it was only making a low sound.  \r\n\r\n     i walked out onto my back porch and watched as it got closer and closer.  it appeared to be getting lower toward the ground.  for some reason, i wasn���t afraid that it was going to crash, i assume because i could tell how slowly it was moving and it seemed to be under control.  it was simply mesmerizing and i was transfixed watching it.  i was frustrated that i was home alone and couldn���t yell for someone to come see what i was seeing.  as i watched with my jaw dropped, it glided by very slowly and rather quietly, but not silently, almost overhead.  from my porch, it appeared to pass about 30-50 feet to the south of me.  i would compare the sound and movement to a boat with a trolling motor, only flying, or the sound somewhat like a lawnmower in the distance.  it certainly wasn���t the sound of a normal plane engine, which would have been rather deafening at that close range.  i am not familiar with a plane that can fly that quietly and slowly or with the configuration of the 3 huge lights.  \r\n\r\n     as it passed by, the intensity of the lights was no longer interfering with my view of the object.  i was looking at it from underneath so i could make out the shape, probably aided by the small streetlight that is almost below where it passed.  it was dark and appeared to be somewhat of a boomerang shape.  there were no lights on the underneath side.  if i were to compare it to a full moon, i���d estimate that from side to side it would be larger than 10 or 12 moons.  it���s difficult to say at night, but i���d guess it was about 200 feet above the ground.  from the time it first came into view from underneath until it went over the trees was about 10 seconds.  i could still see it through the small stand of trees beside my house, but i didn���t have an unobstructed view any more.  it was like standing on the runway if a 747 could glide quietly in for a landing, except it wasn���t shaped like a commercial airplane.  it was quite large. \r\n\r\n     it continued gliding across the road in front of my house, and across the field as it curved toward the south and disappeared beyond the trees.  i continued to watch for a while, then went inside to find a camera in case it came back.  my husband had taken our camera on a trip, our video camera's battery was dead (probably not caused by the object), and our old film camera also had a dead 6-volt battery, for which i had no replacement.  i plugged in the battery for the video camera just in case, but never got a picture.  i turned on the radio to see if anyone called in a report, but didn't hear any news.  \r\n\r\n     a little while later, maybe 15 or 20 minutes, one of my sons came home and i told him what i had seen.  within about another 20 minutes, i saw bright lights again traveling from north to south, similar to where i had seen them the first time.  at this point, my son looked out and saw the object and commented on how bright and low it was.  he watched until it disappeared behind the trees in our yard.  typical of his not wanting to appear too excited and since he hadn���t witnessed what i had seen before, he went back into the kitchen, but i walked out behind my house so i could see behind the trees and watched as it moved south.  it never disappeared from sight, but eventually i determined that it was moving closer again and a little higher in the sky.  oddly, the appearance of the lights didn���t change like it had turned around ��� more like it was backing up.  the bright lights were no longer visible.  it came back the way it went, behind my house, higher this time and moving more quickly, but with no white lights on the front, just the red flashing lights on the body.  i watched as it flew north and out of sight.  that was the last i saw of it.  \r\n\r\n     there are several rows of high-tension power lines behind my house, running somewhat north and south.  it was over these at some points, but didn���t necessarily follow the lines, especially when it headed south ��� the lines run a little more south-west and it traveled a little more south-east.  and, of course, when it turned and came toward me and continued in a slow circle to the south it wasn���t over the lines.  other than my son, who just got a brief look at the object when it was more in the distance, i���m not aware of any other witnesses, although i don���t know how anyone out at that time could have missed it if it passed near them as low and slow as it was here.  \r\n\r\n     this is the second time i have seen something unusual behind my house.  the first time was a night almost two years ago and involved something large with only red lights, some blinking and some steady, descending into view through my back door then quickly flipping one end downward and rapidly descending out of sight behind the small hill in my back yard, at about a 45 ��� 50 degree angle, into the trees or the creek.  that whole incident lasted only maybe 5 or 10 seconds.  my first thought was that a plane had caught a wing on the power line and gone down.  my husband and i ran outside but never saw anything more.  from where he was sitting, he didn���t see the lights but followed me out based on my reaction of shock.  as i thought about it, i realized it didn���t have any white lights like a plane or helicopter would normally have at night and there was no loud noise as a plane or helicopter would have made at that distance.\r\n\r\n     i���ve lived in this house for 24 years and have seen plenty of planes and helicopters out the back door and windows, as that is where my den is and my chair faces toward that direction.  these two incidents were definitely unusual.  i know what they weren���t ��� weather balloons, swamp gas, ball lightning��� but i���d certainly like to know what they were.  if the large object that nearly flew over my house is military and it���s ours, then good for us.  i don���t know why they would test fly it low over a housing development in northern virginia, though.  very puzzling.  i can���t say that what i saw was an extra-terrestrial ufo, but it was f. and it was an o. and it was definitely u. to me.  if someone can give me a plausible explanation that would be great because no one with whom i���ve spoken has been able to come up with one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis is the statement from my son:\r\n\r\n     on the night of november 19, 2011 i came home around 11:00 pm and saw my mom standing on the back deck looking up into the sky.  she explained to me that she had just been watching a large aircraft that had been slowly moving through the sky at a low altitude, with a strange light pattern that didn���t resemble an airplane.  because we live near quantico, i said it could have been one of their planes and went inside.  about 20 minutes later, she said she saw it outside again so we walked out onto the back porch and saw a much brighter than normal aircraft flying just over the tree line, heading south.    it was moving slower than the airplanes that we frequently see.  the lights on it didn���t resemble the lights on a normal airplane.  it had extremely large front white lights that didn���t shoot a beam forward like headlights, but lit up a large area around the front of the aircraft.  it seemed to be very large, bigger than a regular jet airplane, which we often see flying behind our house.  \r\n\r\n     the aircraft continued along the tree line from our vantage point until i could no longer see it through the trees from the porch.  i thought it was gone, so i walked back into the house, but my mom walked back up onto the hill to see if she could get a better look at it.  i have seen airplanes fly over the house my entire life since we are on one of the flight paths for washington airports and we live near quantico.  this didn���t resemble any passenger jet or any other aircraft i���ve seen over the years.  when passenger jets, helicopters and military aircraft fly over, they make a clearly audible sound.  during the time i observed the aircraft, i didn���t hear any sound coming from it.  i���m curious to know what it was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet,

but then one of the lights (it was blue) moved slowly under a red light and i realized there were four independent lights. i believe one was blue and three were red (the primary colors of each). they formed a triangle shape in the air with three on the left side and a seperate one forming the triangle to the right. they hovered blinking and changing colors from red to blue, bright intense, glowing light. i was telling my boyfriend this on the phone, and of course, he didn't believe me. even thought the formation was \"stationary\" the orbs/lights moved extremely fast in each small area they were \"staying\" in, and if i squinted, i could see beams or trails left where each one was moving within its allotted space without breaking the triangle formation. i briefly considered going back inside to get my co-workers, but by this time, the lights/orbs were moving away from me towards the northeast, at a fair pace. not two minutes later, two helicopters headed in that general direction. by this time i was out of the parking lot and driving south, towards home, but saw the helicopters pass over me, going northeast.\r\n\r\nthis didn't surprise me much because i've seen a couple of \"unusual\" objects in my neighborhood, but at a greater distance, lately (i live near an airport), but neither of the objects was a plane, helicopter or anything else. one was a white round orb, that went straight up into the air and disappeared (it reminded me of a bubble in a glass of soda rising, it was quick but graceful) and i saw something else that looked like a star that was at a great distance, but it looked like it was changing colors. through binoculars i could make out that it was triangular, pyramidal shaped, transparent, but glowing with different colors like a web of plasma or electricity running around the outside of it (very bright, but very far away). it rotated and tumbled in place. i watched it for about an hour before i went into the house. i also called a tv station to see if there were any reports of it (there weren't). it was about 2:30 a.M. in mid-october. a neighbor and my boyfriend also witnessed that one, but my boyfriend thinks it was a star. it was not.

heading from town (manchester,tn.) toward the interstate and a bp gas station(busy corner truck stop and market). we (3 of us in the car) have witnessed this 3 different times now within a months time. all 3 events each time took place about mid-way on this 6 mile stretch. around where some fields are.\r\n\r\nwe witnessed a good size orange to amber colored orb hovering just above the treeline, it almost looked like a big orange star but stars do not hover above a treeline, that's what caught our eye, it's placement seemed odd. \r\n\r\nwe take this road 5 times a week and noticed as we were driving up on it that it looked very out of place. i then pulled over on the shoulder of the road to get a better look. the orb hovered for a few seconds more and then seem to disappear or change into what looked like a white star like object, it moved through the sky very fluently and went over to what we thought was just a star (also pretty low in the sky), it connected to it and moved off as one. then it seemed to turn into a white flashing light object and began moving at a high velocity, we watched it until it moved out of our field of vision. the orange orb thing was almost like a portal or host that this object came out of or so it seemed? it was very amazing to see to say the least... \r\n","distance":"101-500

her\"if those were planes flying in formation\" to which she replied \"planes make a noise when they fly that low and that was not planes\". the craft seemed to move south and then continue to hover

house and was distracted by 6 or 7 bright orange lights rising to the east over the wasatch mountain range.   it was a very clear night just a little after 9pm.  at first, there were 5 or 6 lights rising in a column which then separated, spreading out in different directions.  i stood for a moment, wondering what the heck they were.  they were brighter and larger than the stars in the sky and moving in an upward direction.  i stepped into the house and asked for my husband to come look.  he is retired military and seems to know a great deal about aircraft, so i thought he could tell me what they were.  he stepped outside with me and just stood and watched with me in silence for a few moments and then said, \"i don't know what those are.  they're not planes.  it's totally quiet, though.  listen to the dogs.\"  the neighborhood dogs all seemed to be barking.  he stepped into the house, turned off all the lights, and asked for the other two adults in the house to come outside.  \r\n   together, we watched as all but one blinked out after only a few minutes, and the last one remained stationary for another minute or so.  as that one blinked out, we noticed another rising more slowly below it.  this final light was the brightest, and we were able to watch it for nearly 5 minutes as it rose upward then sat stationary for about 30 seconds.  it flashed red and blinked out, also.  i thought it was gone, but one of the other adults pointed out that the object was still faintly visible.  it appeared white and ascended to the north for several minutes, where we finally lost track of it.  \r\n    we live near hill air force base, and we are accustomed to seeing objects in the sky.  we agreed that they were not jets, helicopters, or any other aircraft that we are used to seeing.  we never did hear any sound other than barking dogs.  i initially thought perhaps they were flares, but the objects moved upward, hovered, and changed direction.  also, the lights were orange and round/symmetrical.  the odd way the last light flashed red before blinking out was unlike anything i have seen before.  \r\n    i have been listening to local news for reports of weather balloons or flares or any kind of military testing in the area; although, i'm sure that's not what this was.  i have also been checking ufo reporting sites, and looking online for any blog or other reports from anyone else who may have seen these lights.  we live in a very populated area, so i don't understand why no one else noticed or reported them.  the joke around our house is that the e.T.'s are coming.  we laugh about it, but all of us feel that we saw something we don't understand.  my husband said that he felt very unsafe when he saw those lights.  the were just too different from anything he has ever seen (the way they moved quickly, stopped, then changed direction, then blinking out but still being present).

700 knots, and would have an actual diameter of 10 to 15 feet.  as the object was traveling away, it was observed to slightly vary its course from left to right and back, rather than follow a ballistic trajectory. this made it seem to me to be in to be in controlled flight. i was observing this very slight \"sidewinder\" motion as if looking from the rear of the object, rather than the underside, due to its relatively low altitude (i.E. if it were a jet i would have been looking up the tailpipe.)  in about 5 seconds it passed out of sight beyond the top of the north side of the football stadium. i thought immediately that it was a controlled flying object which was neither civilian nor military. my wife was in awe and said \"what was that?\"  i was quite elated, and said \"that was a ufo!\". i do not know if any of the other 25,000 people at the game saw this object, but i am quite sure that someone else must have seen it.  if you draw a n -s line on a map or photo over jmu's football field, you will have the part of the trajectory which we observed.\r\n\r\n(name moved to fi box) cms 11/28/11 13:43 cst flg\r\n\r\n(i actually signed up as mufon field investigator in 1994.)","distance":"501 Feet -
