or was this beyond that? regardless, this object appeared to me to be \"floating in the wind\" at first but then i saw it start to head towards the right (southwest). the jet continued to circle and climb while maneuvering towards the left side of the unknown object.  the unknown object then started moving to the left, towards the jet.  their apparent altitudes were different however so it wasn't like they were going to crash.\r\n\r\nthis is when the loud roar became really loud and i witness three more planes come from the west.  i could tell immediately that these were planes, not something unknown, and that they were most likely the same type of jet.  now i am thinking that this must be a training exercise and because of the heavy and low overcast they are doing their drills much lower, even though the first plane was uncomfortably low. but then the unknown object started to climb and circle around and descend while the planes were all maneuvering in the sky.  this seriously looked like a shot in \"top gun\".  i am still in disbelief. all these objects appeared to be dogfighting or practicing evasion techniques.  this lasted for about 2-3 minutes.  passengers planes were also within the area.  they were pretty low too as the other planes and such were dancing with each other. the unknown object then got smaller and smaller and a pretty quick pace as it fled south.  the jets did follow pursuit and the loud roaring diminished. \r\n\r\nabout 10 minutes later the roaring was back and growing in loudness.  i could hear the jet overhead but didn't see it at first.  it was up in the clouds now was flying back north and the roaring faded away. the other jets and the unknown object were nowhere to be seen. another 5- 10 minutes pass and i hear the red shift effect of the roaring jet coming back over head heading in a different direction.  this cycle repeated several more times.  i got the impression that this jet was searching for something.  could be possible that it was just running some type of drills. \r\n\r\nultimately i want to know what exactly i saw.  is there anyway for me to find out if the military just ran a training mission over my apartment at an extremely low altitude?  was the unknown object really a jet and just looked different? and why did the unknown object seem to float around before maneuvering more drastically?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":85698,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.59262686985605,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08062017-0023","longitude":-74.46390450653432,"occurred":1502026800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Jersey","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1502040033000,"summary":"Possible ufo sighting with fighter jets/possible extremely low fighter jet training session","tags":["photo","sound","ufo","floating","crash"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":1502054820253,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/85698_submitter_file1__MilitaryTrainingUFO080617.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"07060","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"North Plainfield, New Jersey","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:3102"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover), Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Woodbridge","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"While standing on my deck i notice an extremely bright cylinder like object moving very fast in the sky. much faster than i have ever seen flying in the sky. it caught my eye because it was very bright, had cylinder shape, moving fast and the back drop was a clear blue sky. this object was not a conventional aircraft ie plain etc. i happen to have my cell phone in hand and i took pictures of the object. this object was very far away from my position yet i saw this light clearly. \r\n\r\nwhen looking at the photo please note there are 2 homes in the picture. look at the home to the right and you will see 2 vent pipes sticking out the top. the first pipe to your left look strait up. blow the picture up a little and you will see what i am talking about.

time. i have seen, and can identify planes at night.. and do not mis-identify a plane for a ufo. for example, i know that planes on approach (moving directly towards the observer) can appear very bright and seem to hover. other times you may not see the red & green lights, but only a red light due to the distance, or the angle of the plane. i know helicopter lights, have seen countless satellites, as well as meteors. i know many constellations, and know what planets are observable in the night sky at all times. what i am about to explain is none of these.\r\n\r\nalso.. this is my first post to mufon, and the first time in all my years where i have seen something and cannot explain. i can't say this is extra-terrestrial.. only very different from what i have ever seen. this is not a fantastic sighting.. merely very odd.\r\n\r\nat approximately 9pm on 8/4 i observed a flash of white light in the sky out of my bathroom window. it was brief, and did not reoccur for several seconds after. i watched the section of sky for about 10 seconds and the light appeared again, then vanished. this time i believe the light was white and some red. i quickly went outside to the back yard as i knew this was not a normal object. it took about 10 seconds to get to the back. once outside i saw the flash again and told my wife to come out and see. from this point on both my wife and i observed this object together.\r\n\r\nupon first seeing the object it was at approximately 335 degrees (nw) in the sky, and within the vicinity of the constellation ursa minor. it traveled in what i believe was a straight line, and the last i observed it was at about 35 degrees (ne) of me.. just to the east of the constellation cassiopeia. there were no clouds in the night sky and it was very clear.\r\n\r\nthe lights were not like a satellite, plane, or helicopter:\r\nthe object would either emit a single bright flash (like a strobe), or phase in and out. each time there was approximately a 10-15 second delay between flashes. at times when it would flash it was very dim and hardly observable, but at others (usually when it would flash like a strobe) it would be as bright as the planet jupiter (about a -2.5 magnitude). each time it emitted light it was a bit further along on its path towards the east. \r\n\r\nobject speed:\r\nthe speed of the object did not match that of a plane, or satellite. it took approximately 12-15 minutes to travel about 60 degrees (335 to 35) across the night sky. in my experience if this were a satellite it would have taken half the time or less to travel this distance... and most certainly if it were a plane it would have traveled that distance much quicker.\r\n\r\nin summary - the speed did not match any object i have formerly observed, and the flashing was also very odd. other than that the sighting was quite benign. odd though.\r\n\r\ni have attached a video of the object. you can only see it a couple of times when it flashed.. it was difficult for me to determine if this object was within the field of view of the camera since it was not a constant light. you can see it flash at :20, :40 and 2:40.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

when i stopped meditating to observe the airplanes noisily passing above my head. i was looking west and i noticed two planes crossing paths, one north and one south, at different altitudes/distances. this is when i noticed a translucent object making maneuvers beyond the planes (what seemed like hoboken new jersey). the pattern of the maneuvers (i witnessed it loop around horizontally, then upwards in a diagonal direction toward where i was on the east side of manhattan) at first made me assume that this must be an eagle. after catching myself mid-thought, and realizing that there is no way an eagle could appear so big from so far away (for it outsized the planes which were at a much closer distance) and it moved with such abrupt acrobatics and with such great speed, along with the fact that this object was not flapping wings or making bird like movements, i automatically assumed i was seeing things and maybe it was an eye floater i was following (because of the translucent nature/size/speed of the object seemed incomprehensible to rationalize it as being any man made plane that i have ever seen or heard of before. so i quickly moved my eyes around and saw the floaters move but the object continued on its path. at this moment (about 12 seconds into the sighting) after the object made its upwards diagonal climb (it climbed what seemed to be 1,000 feet in a matter of a few seconds, and it began to head towards me, it went behind a cloud. this cloud stretched from the westside of manhattan and ended just above where i was on my roof. i said to myself \"i will look above at the exit point where i would assume if something was flying, it would come out and continue its path.\" expecting at least 20 seconds to pass by before i would (maybe) see the object again, for that was what seemed to be the rational assumption based on the speed i saw the object moving at, about 3 seconds later i witnessed the object come from behind the cloud and enter my view directly above me. it had a boomerang shape but was a bit straighter, i'd say it was more like a 165 degree angle. it was completely silent, and i was still thrown off into disbelief by the fact that it was translucent yet i could completely make out the shape. i could only see the outline of the object because it appeared to be a little blurred on the edges and i could make out 5 distinct circular spots on the bottom of it (these spots were equally dispersed along the \"wings\"  -2 on each wing and 1 in the middle, and they had no distinct color except the fact that they were a little bit blurred round the edges in the same way the edges of the entire object was.) once the object was in view over my head, i probably witnessed it for about 7 seconds. after crossing over the eastern part of manhattan it flew behind another cloud that was over what had to be williamsburg, brooklyn. this was the last i saw of the object. at first i thought it was flying seemingly slow, low to the city, and that it wasn't that big... then 10 seconds later another plane passed over head near the flight path of this object and i realized then that the object was thousands of feet higher in altitude than the plane, at least 20 times bigger than the plane, and moving at a speed that made the planes speed seem like a snail. at this point in time i called my father to tell him what i saw and he asked me why i didn't record or take a picture. well, i was completely in disbelief of what i was witnessing, and the event happened entirely to quickly for me to be able to understand what i was actually witnessing. and to be completely honest, due to the translucent nature and speed of this ufo i do not believe that a camera would have captured an adequate video that would have interpreted the object accurately.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:00:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings,

work at 11:30 pm.I got on my bike and started heading northbound on the boulevard towards my house.Around ten to fifteen minutes of pedaling i decided to look up at an airplane that was very high up in the air.Then a few seconds later i decided to look again at this plane.When i did ,i all of a sudden  see with my peripheral some bright light.I turned and looked and there was this bright white basketball size round orb just above the train tracks.I got confused and started thinking what this object probably is.So i went thru a list of possible things that it could be,for example:a firefly,radio controlled toy like a helicopter or plane etc..Then after this i realize that is the real deal.I panicked and got very afraid and confusion set in.Did not know what to do ,wether try to run away or call for help.I soon realize that i dont stand a chance against this, in case it wants to kidnap me.So i builded up my confidence.At this time the object started to move foward and descend.I kept following in my bike,but it was faster than me,so i kept following it the best that i could and watching it from some distance now.From about 200 to 500 feet away.This orb was noiseless the whole time.I saw that it descended very low and it cross the intersection of northeast boulevard and elmer rd. over to the other side of the boulevard.At this point i thought that this white orb was going to land in the middle of the road.When it was about approximately 6 feet from the ground,this round object dissapeared.This time i couldnt believe what i was seeing ,i was speechless and really confused.It was time for me to decide ,should i go over and take a look to see if i find it or just continue home. i decided to look,so i cross over and stopped where i thought was the place

to get brighter. i pointed it out to my wife and as soon as she noticed it as well it began to move in irregular patterns. it would move up, down, side to side and then in a zig zag pattern. after a moment it would become stationary again. the longer we watched we noticed two other starlike lights were moving with it. the two new lights weren't nearly as bright as the first, but seemed to be equidistant forming a perfect triangle. we continued to watch in amazement. as one light moved the other moved in unison, same speed and same direction, leading us to believe they were attached. but as they continued to dance and move they began to move independently of one another. at first i was having a hard time believing what we were seeing. we watched for approx 2 hours before going to bed.

down in my lawnchair to take a short break and leaned my head against the back of my chair and looked up. almost straight above me, but more to the east of my home, i saw a disc-like object moving very slowly towards the west at a very high altitude (approx. 30k ft.?). it appeared at first to be stationary but as i staired at it i could tell it was moving in relation to the tree i was sitting near, in my backyard. i thought through all of the things it could be (plane, balloon, drone, etc...), but judging by behavior, shape, altitude and size, i came to the realization that it was a ufo.\r\nit appeared to be flying at or above about 30k ft (in clear skies) and the size of about two passenger jets side by side, it was tan in color and shaped like a doughnut with edges that tapered to a point and in the center instead of a hole was a sort of dome at the bottom (i never saw the top of it).\r\ni went inside my house to get my phone to take a picture of it. i took two photos, but after viewing them on the phones screen i felt that they were not good enough and unfortunatley i deleted them. i'm still mad at myself for doing that.\r\nas i continued to stare at it clouds were beginning to form to the west of it and they cast a shadow up on to the craft. minutes before passing over the clouds it started to rotate (or bank to the north) then the most bizare thing happened and the best way i can describe it is it sort of \"pixilated\" like a wave moving over it from one side to the other it took about three or four seconds to just vanish. it didnt fly away, it just disapeared.\r\nthe entire event lasted approx. fifteen minutes from the time i first noticed it.\r\ni've seen strange things in my life but nothing as definitive as this. i needed to tell someone
