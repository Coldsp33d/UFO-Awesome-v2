very fast from west to east in a straight line. the object appeared solid with 1 dim white light at each corner. had i not been observing the stars above me at the precise moment, i would not have noticed this object. if this object was not moving it would have appeared to blend in with the stars in its background. the object did not make any noise. there is a small airport near our house and we often get aircraft flying nearby. at the apparent altitude of this craft it should have been audible but was not. it was difficult to tell how big the object was because it moved so fast and was out of my view very quickly. i immediately pointed to the object when i noticed it and my wife glimpsed it as well. i have never seen an object move this fast, appearing to be low in altitude and not making any noise.\r\n\r\noddly enough, approx 10 minutes after this event, i noted a bright blue shooting star towards the south east that appeared to be falling downward instead of across the sky. it

and went to check the back sliding door to be sure it was locked. i noticed an extremely bright white light in the western sky. larger than all the other stars. we live in a flight path so at first i though it was an airplane. the \"airplane\" did not move (did not get any closer). the object appeared to be an oval shaped disk with what appeared to be a solid band of lights around it, with one light larger and brighter than the rest. i could make out the outline of the object and the underside appeared dark, almost black in the night sky. it would randomly blink red and greenish-blue lights. every so often i would see like short beams of light coming out at an angle from the underside. like a child would draw lines around a sun to depict rays. i made two other people observe this object. i stayed up for 1 1/2 hours observing these lights (and disk shaped object) that never moved from its position and finally went to bed at 2:40 am. it was a perfectly clear night. my reaction was at first it must be an airplane, when it never moved and i went outside to get a better look and realized the shape of it i thought, this has to be a ufo. i started looking online to see if any other reports were posted anywhere. did find one in ohio. i tried to get a picture and a video of it on my cell phone but that did not work. a planet is not oval shaped and does not pulse colored lights. helicopters make noise. i kept going outside to try to get a better look and memorize what i was seeing. it scared me and excited me at the same time and i am very frustrated that so far no one else saw this. i would like to know what i was seeing.

something i could not identify. it was probably several hundred feet wide and had vents which released an intense amber colored glow. it was long and thin, almost cigar shaped (however i do not believe this to be the true shape of the object). my parents stepped outside just as it \"collapsed\" upon itself. to my suprise it reappeared in a few seconds slightly north but at least a mile away. its amber glow was still clearly visible. the craft disappeared and reappeared at least once more, even further away. my parents claim two fighter jets flew over the area soon following the sighting. while i heard them, i did not see them. the amber lighted craft has been seen in this area on and off for over a year now.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

at 5:44 pm  made note of the time when my son's mother brought the light to my attention. after leaving a movie theatre in cherry hill nj and traveling down haddonfield rd in a southern direction, my son's mom pointed out a very bright white strobing light in the sky , fairly low and fairly fast.  at this hour there was plenty of other air traffic in the area with philly intl just a short distance from where we live in cherry hill.  it appeared to head in our direction from the south headed north.  it was very bright. based on the possible speed and height it seemed that it could be a helo or small plane.  position in the skyand rough distance would have put it just above haddonfield, a short distance from where we were.  the strobing white light fast and suddenly banked east then hard west again (towards philly / philly intl), and again fairly low in the skybased on buildings and other air traffic.  after banking west, the bright white strobe went out and 2 red strobing lights came on in a position rear of where the bright white light was.  the red lights were smaller and not as bright and strobed simultaneously side by side.  we were thrying to track it after turning onto marlton pike, rte 70, headed west with the lights off to our left , or south of our position.  road traffic was heavy so  we thought it safer to pull off to try and view and headed toward park dr. along the cooper river where we last spotted the red strobing lights head wsw.  after pulling off and getting out of the car, the lights were out of sight at that point, but tons of other air traffic that looked nothing like what we had just witnessed.  the speed was not inexplicably fast or erratic, but definitely faster than any other air traffic that was up there.  the entire sighting lasted roughly 4 mins. this is our first reported sighting in this area.  we have 2 others from 2008 when we lived in chestnut hill, a philly suburb.\r\n","distance":"Over One

of sparks and embers, and seemed to burn out and disappear before it traveled a quarter of the way from the object toward earth. this happened two or three more times, additional chunks falling in

in a vehicle accident where the assistant basketball coach \"joe sadovich\" who still works there today was driving a beige chevy suburban.  i was in the front passenger seat, \"joe sadovich\" was driving on the camps main road \"ries road\" now named \"lucky strike\"\r\nat that time it was partial dirt road. we came around one of the last curves to the left and a being stepped out of the forest and into the road and \"joe\" didnt see the being and struck the being at the last minute and dragged the being half way down the road and the suburban ripped off the left foot of this being which i will describe later then the suburban went over the side of the mountain. luckily the suburban came to a halt slamming into a tree suspended in the air by the roots of a tree beneath the suburban between the wheels.\r\nupon me climbing back up to \"ries road\"\r\ni found the foot of the being to describe this foot it was nothing i ever seen before. it had three toes with sharp talons black as nails i can describe more upon request. after me another person out the suburban made it to the top of the road his name was \"todd west\" todd went to eldorado high school in las vegas. i believe his first name was \"theodore\"  \"todd\" for short. as tood made it to the top of ries road he asked me what happened and i pointed at the foot and said we must have hit what ever this foot belonged to. just then we heard a noise on the cliff side of ries road. i went to look for what made the noise as it sounded like something moving in the grass area. we found a being laying on its stomach attempting to crawl away it heard me behind it and it flipped over on its back while crawling on its stomach it had a similarity of a crocodile the way the back looked and the tail and the mouth when it flipped over i saw it had 2 huge breast the size of  volley balls or bigger with a pattern on it that resembled the belly of a alligator or crocodile. it was female and had appendages that were similar to humans. when it realized i was there it crawled quickly toward the nearest tree and used the tree to support itself to stand on one leg with its back against the tree. this being looked at me and todd and began to cry with a voice that would sound like a child crying for help... i realized looking at this being standing on one leg balancing itself with the tree that it must be able to communicate some way. i instructed todd to do as i did and put down the sticks we were carrying as we were no match to fight this being even with it missing its left foot up to its calf. as we put down our weapons i communicated with it pointing at its foot and putting my back to the tree and asking it to sit down because it towered over us at 7-8 feet tall. three of my fingers wasnt equal to one if its fingers. it spoke had a loud voice. and as i asked it questions it asked me questions. this story gets deeper. because as we waited for help a teacher from camp left the camp to go home and found us on the road we all approached him the teacher and asked could he help by allowing us to put the being in his vehicle and we take it to the hospital. and he refused and said he would call someone when he got to the bottom of the mountain. well when night came coach \"joe\" had made it to the top of ries road with the remaining few  kids total of 5-6 kids and joe. and asked for us to walk back to camp and i told joe that i wanted to stay with it because i never seen anything die and i wanted to be there with her because we hit her and to leave the scene would be a hit and run. he insisted and we left as he promised to get help for her the being he hit.\r\nthe next day i was called into head coach \"snider\" office to meet with a man in a black suit with black hat and was told to tell him what happened as i told the story and got to the part of describing the being this person in black interrupted me and said \"it was a deer\" and i replied excuse me i was there and it was no deer and i began to describe it again and he rudely interrupted again and said, \"yes it was a deer\" mister  may i remind you that you are in custody and that we can keep you till your 26 so i replied it was a deer. mad because i was incarcerated to be rehabilitated and being forced to lie about the truth...\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

she didn't answer she just stood mesmerized by what she was looking at. we stood watching for another minute and they changed direction and were now heading south. i was yelling at \"j\" to take a picture, when i turned to look at her she was fooling with her new phone to get the camera up. she told me not to yell at her. i turned back to watch again and when the one in the lead got to a point in the sky that was between two stars it just dissapeared. i was yelling where did the first one go? where did it go? i looked back at \"j\" and she didn't say anything she was trying to watch the objects while  still fooling with her phone.  i got my phone out of my pocket and tried to get my camera up, (i heard \"j\"'s camera click on her phone)i looked back to the sky and the two objects were entering the same area between those two stars where the first one dissapeared, then at the same time they both dissapered as well. it wasn't like they shot out of veiw, they just dissapeared. i was screaming where did they go? where did they go? i heard \"j\" say \"they just turned off their lights\" \"j\" stood there about another 30 seconds and went back in the house without saying anything. i kept fixated on the sky for at least ten more minutes. then finally i realized they were gone. i went back into the house and asked \"j\" if she got a picture of them and she said no. i asked her what she thought, and she thought it was one big object, and the orange pulsating glow were afterburners. it took me hours to wind down. i am a military brat, prior military myself. lived in a military town my whole life (home of the blue angels) seen millions of planes take off and land from my backyard. seen the helicopters take off and land, even every once in a while a blimp even lands and takes off, what we saw on thanksgiving night was not anything from planet earth! it was an awesome experience! complete duration of entire sighting was approximately maybe 3 minutes. i will never forget it!!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":33606,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.489855492905697,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11252011-0023","longitude":-87.14905254656051,"occurred":1322185500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1322285393000,"summary":"Saw 3 huge orange glowing objects in the sky at about 5:45 or 6pm on 11/24/11. the first object was in front maybe 3000 ft away from trailing 2 objects who were traveling one above the other.
