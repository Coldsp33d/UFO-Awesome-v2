about another 1/3 mile to a clearing where i had clear view to the east, south, and west. that's when i saw more clusters of red lights to the south and west. they appeared to come straight at my

moving independently from oneanother. the lights were not attached to any solid object, i could see stars between the lights. the lights were about 20 times larger than navigation lights on airplanes. i observed them for about four minutes, during that time the lights were consistent in size and shape. they didn't pulsate, flicker, change color, or make any sound.Their speed was roughly about 60 to 80 mph. after about three minutes of observing i called 911 and was connected to a brookfield ct dispatcher to see if anyone else was watching the lights. he said know one has. as i was talking to the dispatcher the last cluster of four lights were passing to the south of my position. at that time a private jet passed over my head at roughly 5000 feet, traveling from the south and going north. at that time the jets engines were the only mechanical sounds i was hearing. the night was crystal clear and the temperature was about 35 degrees. visibility was excellent almost to the horizon and there

on my cell phone in the house so i went outside to my driveway to talk.  it was dark but the sky was clear.  looking to the northwest approximately 30 degrees or so above the horizon i noticed a bright orange glowing light.  it was probably the size of a couple of stars put together, or of an aircraft landing light in the distance.  i watched it for a few seconds because it was not the color of an aircraft landing light.  i also looked for strobe lights or aircraft navigation lights.  there were none.  i have seen the space shuttle take off from my house near ft. lauderdale and i'd characterize the light as similar but this was orange, not white.  the light moved across the sky and i ran to the door to the house to call my friend.  he came out and we both watched it as it moved to the south.  the light then seemed to hover in place on a magnetic heading of approximately 200 degrees.  the light then seemed to fade away as if it were moving off now directly away from us.  i asked my friend if he thought it could be an afterburner from a fighter.  he didn't think so because it was orange, not white.  i would have to agree because it seems that an afterburner would not be visible if the aircraft was moving horizontally across one's field of vision.  it would have to be flying away, especially as far away as the light seemed to be.  i went back in the house.  at 1842, just 17 minutes later, my friend called me back and i went back outside.  it was bizzare but there was another orange fireball like thing in the same place moving in the same direction.  this time i called for more of my guests and my wife, sister-in-law, and friend all came out.  they all saw it and we watched it do the same thing as the previous one.  each even probably lasted about a minute or so.   i should note that i am a 747 captain for a major u.S. airline.  i have been flying for 35 years and i have never witnessed anything like this.  the lights were not aircraft lights.  if anything this looked more like a very bright propulsion system or rocket exhaust but way off in the distance, thought it was very orange and circular.  there was no contrail or exhaust trail, just a glowing

outside directly because her reaction seemed so unusual. within seconds i observed the orange object to be aspirin sized at arm's length and moving quickly away from us in an easterly direction. within moments the object diminished in size until we could no longer see it.  it appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed. we heard no sound. the entire event took 60-90 seconds. mom noticed it because it was bright, oddly out of place, and moving too quickly. it may be of note that we saw at least one helicopter in our field of view after the light disappeared, but the helicopter was easily

the first of these objects.  he and his buddy were in the back yard having cigars when they noticed the first light.  he described seeing a single glowing red light (like a red lantern) moving low across the sky in a very direct west to east path.  they had no idea what they were seeing.  the object was definitely not a commercial airliner since it 1) had no blinking navigation lights and 2) was not following the take-off pattern of the other planes that were in clear view.  \r\n\r\nby the time he called me, he and his friend had watched a total of five \"orbs\" move across the sky in a period of about 25 minutes (some as singles, others in pairs).  as we were talking on the phone, he exclaimed that he was seeing another trek across the sky and told me in what direction to look.  i live about 3 miles to the north and west of him and could not see what he was describing.  i jumped in my car and drove to his house.  upon arriving at 10:05, he ushered me through the house to the back yard and we were standing there no longer than 5 seconds before he looked up and said, \"there!\"  sure enough, a group of three of these glowing red orbs was moving in the same west to east path that they had watched the last six cross.  i was stunned and immediately agreed that they looked like red lanterns.  their color and brightness were unwavering and they made absolutely no noise.  i could not believe how large they appeared as they had to be very close--it even seemed they could have been flying directly above highway 60 and at less than 1000 feet.  as they moved farther east, my friend said, \"look!\" and we saw a fourth coming from the west, following the others far behind.  then my friend said, \"now watch, as they get far enough east, they flicker and then vanish.\"  i watched in astonishment as each of the three in the first group, one by one, flickered out and then the fourth did the same when it reached the equivalent position in the sky.  it did not appear that they flew behind clouds (as there were fewer last night than tonight) and that they had not disappeared beyond the horizon (they would have had to have traveled a much greater distance at that speed to go beyond the horizon).  my friend (who knows planes) said that they appeared to be moving \"at about the speed of a cessna 150\".  unfortunately, we could not get an accurate idea of the actual shape of the objects due to the glowing. \r\n\r\nmy friend said the whole event made the hairs on the back of his neck stand up.  i cannot say the same since i was just shocked at viewing the four that i did.  if i had also stood there and watched the whole procession or had seen more come, i would have been equally creeped out.  i did manage to get video footage on my iphone but i have not downloaded it yet and i will have to edit the audio before posting it (thanks to the many expletives delivered by yours truly).  the thought did cross our minds while watching, \"are we being invaded???\"\r\n\r\nafter waiting for over an hour, we never saw another orb.  we find it hard to believe that no one else saw the objects because they were so obvious in the sky.  just before making this post, i read a very similar account of a sighting tonight from a witness nearby in chandler.  i cannot help but think that it could be the very same thing.

craft was off to the left hand side of the road 50 to 100 feet and up a few hundred feet off of the ground.  it was hovering above a small grouping of trees.  it was triangular shaped with a round-point nose, wings that cut off at the tip at about a 75 degree angle, with a boomerang style rear, as it cut in a bit into the body of the craft.  there was some sort of patterning on the wings, perhaps paneling or seams but they protruded enough to cast shadows by its lights, making the pattern look to sit off of the body of the craft an inch or two.  there were three blue ring lights arranged like the finger holes on a bowling ball, one at the tip and then two behind that one, they took up the majority of the body of the craft.  toward the end of the wings there was a white light on one side and a red light on the other.  it was approximately the size of the average three bedroom, 50's ranch style house, or smaller, with the wing span wider than it was long.  the craft hovered there as i drove by it and as i watched for it in the rear view mirror i saw it slowly move to the other side of the highway, so slow i could barely tell it had moved except for that it was on the

during the previous year or two. i made contact ( by doing the equivalent  of loooking  into a crystal ball). the 'spirit', i'll call it, kept giving me a different name than my partner's, but i still tried to believe it was it was my partner. \r\n\r\nthe spirit didn't seem interested in answering questions.When i recalled an intimate moment with my partner, the spirit answered politely, \"cool\", but then i knew it wasn't my longtime boyfriend - and he'd used an uncharacteristic word. one thing the spirit kept repeating was \"hell is real\"  many times. it amost like a warning, or probably it was a warning.  i don't know who or what the spirit was, but it might have been human, because i had strong feeling he had experienced hell himself.\r\n\r\n so all you unkind, cruel, and  indifferent people out there - you might have time to change/right your wrongs.\r\n\r\ni'm giving extra details here, trying to make this encounter less crazy-sounding. i know i might be doing the opposite. now

pm on november 23rd, 2011.  \r\n\r\nwhile walking through a forest with dogs i came upon an area where the path goes down a hill.  upon taking this path i began to notice that my vision was acutely disturbed.  there began to appear to be distortions in the outside world and focusing on anything was extremely difficult.  i initially thought that it was just the darkness of the evening under the canopy of trees and continued walking down the path despite increasing difficulty with my vision and the commencement of a feeling of somatic pressure on my body which made movements increasingly difficult aswell.  at one point i decided to turn around because of the distortion in my visual field and walked several steps back up the path in the opposite direction.  this seemed to alleviate some of the feeling of pressure and my normal vision began to return.  i once again resumed my original course and turned back down the path.  this time i proceeded further than when i turned back, and this action increased the intensity of the visual distortions and the somatic pressure.  without proper use of my eyes i had to actually feel through the air for a tree to hold on to.  it was at this point that i became intensely curious as to what the effects were that had affected my body.  i noticed the start of a soft red glow that was illuminating my left hand that rested on the tree trunk, as well some of the trunk, the left side of my body and the ground around the base of the tree, this stood out primarily because my eyes had no trouble at all focusing on the illuminated objects and i clearly saw my hand in a red light.  upon looking outwards into the forest and at the sky in an attempt at locating a source of the light, the distortions were immediately present in my visual field.  the sensation was one of having a lens placed over the eyes that removed depth perception, contrast and colour and rendered my surrounding objects indistinguable.  \r\n\r\nafter witnessing the red glow, i made a final decision to remove myself from the area and i turned around and began groping at the air and slowly walking back up the path.  the effects on my body subsequently dropped away and stopped as i made my way farther from the area.  i continued to walk up the path back towards my car with the dogs and after approximately 5 minutes i turned around and looked into the sky.  there was a very bright, orangish/yellow star like light in the sky, which i took at first to be venus.  i was observing the light through the branches of a tree that was in between me and object.  after only 15 seconds i noticed that the light in the sky was in fact moving and had passed behind several of the tree branches.  at this time i ran into the field to remove the tree from between myself and the light to get as clear a view of it as possible.  after another 30 seconds of watching the light, it began to grow and resolved itself into 9 distinct yellowish/white lights in a definite triangular pattern.  the object was now moving directly towards me a constant rate of speed.  as the object came closer, there became visible several smaller lights positioned at irregular places on the greater unlit structure of the aeriel object.  the sound began as a low bass-like rumble that became a pulsating reverberation as the object came closer.  the larger structure of the object was greater than the triangle of lights, i could tell this because it was occluding some of the stars behind it as it moved towards me.  when it passed it went directly over my head, i estimate at approximately 500 to 1000 feet above me.  the only sound at this point was the pulsating reverberation.  the object continued along its trajectory and the sound was persistent until they left both my auditory and visual ability to detect them further.
