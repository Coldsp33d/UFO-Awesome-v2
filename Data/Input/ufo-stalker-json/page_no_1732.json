about the sightings of ufos, i had to witness the amazing surprise when observing the moon through an amateur telescope.\r\n\r\nthe reason that leads me to present this document is in the hope that, through its dissemination, it is possible to find new witnesses - which certainly exist - and thus, consolidate and confirm the truth of fact.\r\n\r\nechoing the other testimonies and proven, i hope to contribute to the official recognition of this extraordinary and transformative reality that is alien presence on earth.\r\n\r\ni am an agronomist, graduated from the federal university of lavras (ufla), and working in indigenous communities in the amazon since 1998. currently, i live in s���o paulo-sp, and despite what may seem, during the 13 years he has worked in favor of said local sightings, such as the amazon rainforest, have never witnessed any phenomenon that could be classified as alien nature. this fact does not make me a skeptic, however, doubt has always been a constant when i encountered it.\r\n\r\nbut now i am forced, in his own eyes, to recognize that we are actually visited by beings who at least have a sufficiently advanced technology to move into space at great speed. other questions and implications that raises the issue, i dare not speculate, i reserve just beginning research on a sincere search for the deeper truth of the ufo phenomenon.\r\n\r\nmy recent interest in ufo's, began in april 2011, when i attended the 7th meeting of ufology, in the city of peru���be, south coast of sp. later, i had the pleasure of attending the lecture entitled \"the alien presence in the space program,\" delivered in the house counselor in sp in the month of july.\r\n\r\nthe phenomenon in question took place on august 6, 2011, at around 23:00 / 23:30, and had a maximum duration of approximately 06 seconds only. i was on top of ed indiana, 5 floors, located in the borough of brooklyn, south of sao paulo, with a bezel (pictured) brand yamato (d = 60mm and f = 700mm, objective 6mm h), preparing to focus on the moon, which was, on occasion, currently the fourth-growing.\r\nspecs brand yamata\r\n \r\n\r\njust when it focused on the moon, an object colored black crossed in the right corner of the field of view telescope, vertically from top to bottom, relatively close to the lunar surface at a speed not too fast nor too slow, accompanied by an interesting trail also faded to black pass (with photo design. 1). the photos below were taken shortly after the sighting.\r\n\r\n \r\nphoto to drawing. 1\r\n\r\nabsolutely confused by what he had seen, i adjusted a bit more field of view when the object again crossed the lunar surface, this time, horizontally, from left to right at the bottom of the telescope's field of view, apparently at the same speed, followed the trail also black (photo with drawing. 2).\r\n \r\n\r\nphoto to drawing. 2\r\n\r\nat this point believing that the phenomenon could be repeated, adjusted the telescope's field of view in order to fill it completely with the view of the moon, in order to better observe and describe the object, or what could be. at the same instant, the object once again crosses the entire center of the telescope's field of view, more or less near the \"equator\" of the moon, leaving its trail at a speed equal to the other two appearances (photo with drawing. 3). at that moment, i noticed, though blurred, a disk-shaped dome of the object.\r\n \r\n\r\nphoto to drawing. 3\r\n\r\ngentlemen, deny or doubt the existence of such objects would be to deny the operation of my own eyes or at least admit that i have vision problems grim-faced, if not worse, of sanity.\r\n\r\ni ask that in order to help me pass information about similar sightings or even witnesses who had this astounding vision. i would like to share this experience, which is significantly changing paradigms internal personal imprint even spiritual.\r\n\r\ni believe it was not the only one to observe the phenomenon. someone who, at the same time, was focused with an instrument, amateur or professional, certainly had the same experience. finding such a person would be essential to support further testimony, giving it the credibility it deserves so that we can consolidate this reality.\r\n\r\ni thank for your time and look back.\r\n\r\nmarcelo cantu���rio

about the sightings of ufos, i had to witness the amazing surprise when observing the moon through an amateur telescope.\r\n\r\nthe reason that leads me to present this document is in the hope that, through its dissemination, it is possible to find new witnesses - which certainly exist - and thus, consolidate and confirm the truth of fact.\r\n\r\nechoing the other testimonies and proven, i hope to contribute to the official recognition of this extraordinary and transformative reality that is alien presence on earth.\r\n\r\ni am an agronomist, graduated from the federal university of lavras (ufla), and working in indigenous communities in the amazon since 1998. currently, i live in s���o paulo-sp, and despite what may seem, during the 13 years he has worked in favor of said local sightings, such as the amazon rainforest, have never witnessed any phenomenon that could be classified as alien nature. this fact does not make me a skeptic, however, doubt has always been a constant when i encountered it.\r\n\r\nbut now i am forced, in his own eyes, to recognize that we are actually visited by beings who at least have a sufficiently advanced technology to move into space at great speed. other questions and implications that raises the issue, i dare not speculate, i reserve just beginning research on a sincere search for the deeper truth of the ufo phenomenon.\r\n\r\nmy recent interest in ufo's, began in april 2011, when i attended the 7th meeting of ufology, in the city of peru���be, south coast of sp. later, i had the pleasure of attending the lecture entitled \"the alien presence in the space program,\" delivered in the house counselor in sp in the month of july.\r\n\r\nthe phenomenon in question took place on august 6, 2011, at around 23:00 / 23:30, and had a maximum duration of approximately 06 seconds only. i was on top of ed indiana, 5 floors, located in the borough of brooklyn, south of sao paulo, with a bezel (pictured) brand yamato (d = 60mm and f = 700mm, objective 6mm h), preparing to focus on the moon, which was, on occasion, currently the fourth-growing.\r\nspecs brand yamata\r\n \r\n\r\njust when it focused on the moon, an object colored black crossed in the right corner of the field of view telescope, vertically from top to bottom, relatively close to the lunar surface at a speed not too fast nor too slow, accompanied by an interesting trail also faded to black pass (with photo design. 1). the photos below were taken shortly after the sighting.\r\n\r\n \r\nphoto to drawing. 1\r\n\r\nabsolutely confused by what he had seen, i adjusted a bit more field of view when the object again crossed the lunar surface, this time, horizontally, from left to right at the bottom of the telescope's field of view, apparently at the same speed, followed the trail also black (photo with drawing. 2).\r\n \r\n\r\nphoto to drawing. 2\r\n\r\nat this point believing that the phenomenon could be repeated, adjusted the telescope's field of view in order to fill it completely with the view of the moon, in order to better observe and describe the object, or what could be. at the same instant, the object once again crosses the entire center of the telescope's field of view, more or less near the \"equator\" of the moon, leaving its trail at a speed equal to the other two appearances (photo with drawing. 3). at that moment, i noticed, though blurred, a disk-shaped dome of the object.\r\n \r\n\r\nphoto to drawing. 3\r\n\r\ngentlemen, deny or doubt the existence of such objects would be to deny the operation of my own eyes or at least admit that i have vision problems grim-faced, if not worse, of sanity.\r\n\r\ni ask that in order to help me pass information about similar sightings or even witnesses who had this astounding vision. i would like to share this experience, which is significantly changing paradigms internal personal imprint even spiritual.\r\n\r\ni believe it was not the only one to observe the phenomenon. someone who, at the same time, was focused with an instrument, amateur or professional, certainly had the same experience. finding such a person would be essential to support further testimony, giving it the credibility it deserves so that we can consolidate this reality.\r\n\r\ni thank for your time and look back.\r\n\r\nmarcelo cantu���rio

with the possiblity of video eveidence from a near by public location with 24/7 survaielance which i have not been brave enough to ask for footage.  they prob would not release it to me anyway.  on january 4th 2011 which i believe was a tuesday night, my uncle and i were driving from his home in lititz to molly's gas station in manheim for a casual drive for coffee and cigarettes.  it was app. 8:20pm.  it was me that noticed the orb first pulsating peach in color very high straight ahead as we reached about the trailer park between the 2 towns.  i was driving and chuckling i said\" look it's a ufo!\"  lancaster airport is only about 10 or less miles back toward lititz.  so i see lights and planes and helicopters daily.  at first it was strange but could have passed as a plane with its lights right at us.  we watched it closely and after heading around bend at doe run elementary school by the pond this object fell from the sky.  we thought it was actually crashing but it did not.  while at this point it is only a few 100 feet away the lights are very bright!  we were in disbelief because this object stopped falling right above school building hovered for a second, spun or maybe lights were just spinning horizontally then diagonally very super fast! then the object took off like spinning was charging it for its extreme take off or something!  it shot like a meteor but did not go straight.  it slithered like a snake in the night sky but first made another sharp turn. i think it was blueish in color when it took off. it was completely silent.  at that point when it took off i stepped on the gas obviously i wasnt going to catch up but i had to try!  the time we got to the light passed the school which is only 200 yds, this thing slithered past the west side of manheim right over town and prob by 283 alraedy out of our range of sight.  it was a very clear night.  i dont understand how we were the only ones who saw or reported this.  their was a car back behind us but who knows if they were too old to notice it or what. my uncle and i dont talk about it too much any lately because the conversation always leads to silence or deep thought.  to be honest this did effect me in some negative ways, but maybe thats because they just wont tell us the truth.  i was in shock for sure when i came home and told my wife. in fact i was in shock for a good week.  if your own wife doesnt believe you who do you tell?  it still worries me but i am much more clear minded and sane:) i just wish i could see it again...And again.  my uncle believes it may have been something of biblical, so i dont push the subject, but we both know it wasn't of our publically known technology.    11/22/11  ","distance":"101-500

road which falls at the fence of kirtland air force base. i set up my camera and immediately noticed a \"star\" traveling from east to west at an exceptionally fast rate. all of a sudden it changed direction (to ne), i thought it was a plane at first, then realized it was traveling at a very high rate of speed. all of a sudden, it stopped and began bouncing around in the sky. \r\n\r\nthe second \"ufo\" that i witnessed was mistaken for mars until it began bouncing around in the sky as well. this is not the first time i have witnessed this. in june of this year myself, a friend, and her 12 year old daughter watched something bounce all over the place in the sky for more than an hour and a half. i have audio of that event (just our conversation and reactions). i have seen this a total of three times since june of 2011.\r\n\r\nthe first time i witnessed these \"stars\" bouncing around in the sky i felt immediately awestruck, excited, and was in dis-belief that i was watching this happen.  then my excitement turned to fear, and eventually i was grateful to have seen what i saw.  following that sighting i was constantly looking to the night sky to see if i would witness another \"ufo\".  i eventually stopped obsessing over it because it seemed like it wasn't going to happen.  then, a few months later i saw another one and was excited that it happened again and that i could show the \"proof\" to my friend who was skeptical of my first account.  when i witnessed the same thing the other day i was very calm and determined to finally get some \"proof\" with my camera.  all of these events cause me to have a slight fear of \"what if they know i'm watching and do something to me\", but i don't feel that i am in any kind of danger.  i figure if something were going to happen to me it would have happened by now.  i'm very intrigued, and just wonder what it is that is happening and what they are doing.\r\n\r\n*i have audio from the very first sighting if you are interested to hear it.  it mostly has the reactions that my friend, her daughter and i were having while watching the \"star\" bounce around and change colors.\r\n\r\n*i have more pictures to submit if you are interested.  they are just copies of the photo's but zoomed in and cropped.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with
