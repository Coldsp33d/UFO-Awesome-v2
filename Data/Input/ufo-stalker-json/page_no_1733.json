15 car lengths in front of me.\r\n\r\n5. it happened very quickly. as the object(s) came heading seemingly straight for my windshield, i cursed and gasped, and braced for what i thought was going to be a serious, possibly deadly collision. the object veered sharply away when it was about 30-50 feet in front of me about 15-30 feet above the pavement. i tried to see where it went, but i was on the interstate driving east, and the object(s) veered off to the north, so i could not risk taking my eyes off of the road any longer than a few seconds.  i had slowed down from about 75 mph to about 60 mph in the few seconds that i froze (bracing for the impact that i thought was about to happen). my pulse was racing. i have never seen a ufo in my life.  before the object(s) got really close, i thought it was space debris or something like that --that was going to crash into my car and cause me to wreck at 75 mph.  when it was close enough for me to see the ring-light things, i still thought it was going to cause me to wreck. the feeling the event left with me was this: the feeling you have after a crazy driver runs a red-light at an intersection at high-speed and misses crashing directly into you by a couple of inches.\r\n\r\n6. i lost sight of the object(s)within a few seconds of it veering off to the north, while i continued driving east on the interstate.\r\n\r\nwhat was this thing????  i felt light-headed and exhilarated at first, but now i feel exhausted.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,  Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":33538,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.9751505,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11222011-0005","longitude":-105.0226635,"occurred":1321931700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Mexico","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Oval,   Other,   Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1321957007000,"summary":"Small ufo with 2 circle-moving lights came dangerously close to my car while i was driving on interstate","tags":["ufo","lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Pueblo of Laguna/Albuquer, New Mexico","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:23703"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Clovis","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was laying on picnic table in my yard looking at the stars.  my head was on s. side of the table, feet were on n.  the moon was at about 45 degrees from horizontal to the e. of me.  i was looking at stars with a small monocular golf range finder in the easterly direction.  with my peripheral vision i noticed a light almost directly above me that out-shown the moon-light that night.  and thought to myself, \"darn i missed whatever that was\".  thinking maybe it was a meteor.  i looked in the general direction of the light and was shocked a few seconds later to observe what can only be decribed as a cigar shaped craft descending into the atmosphere almost directly above me (no time to point the small range finder at the craft and get it in the field of vision)  the reason i say descending into the atmospehere is that when the craft appeared, it formed a halo affect around it that was bright and lit up the sky.  once again, brighter than the moon that night.  the halo which i would have to describe as somthing that looked like a ring of smoke that people can make while smoking - it looked almost like a cloud.  inside that ring were rays of light which at first glance appeared being emitting from the cylindrical obect, completely encircling it, but then i realized they weren't being emitted from or by the object - they both(the 2 rings of light around the object)appeared more like they were created from the entry of the object into our atmosphere.  to make this point clear, i would say that both rings of light were created by the entry or flight in our atmophere rather than being created by or being emitted by the object itself.  the object moved in what i beleive was direct entry into our atmosphere for about 7-9 seconds.  and, not in motion in which i would think would be the most effective or efficient.  it moved down with its ends facing north and south.  not head-on or perpendicular to the atmosphere at the entry point, nor at an angle into our atmosphere, but rather straight down. i guess an analogy would be - like a belly-flop into a pool. the object after what appeared to be the approximate 7-9 seconds entry, then traveled directly s. at a high rate of speed, again forming a cloud like shield around it, but this time, because of the curvature of the earth and it's atmosphere it must have exited the atmosphere.  at first, i thought it was traveling s. in our skies, but it disappeared so quickly out of sight, that i now believe it exited our atmosphere. that time span was probably 3-4 seconds.  the event seemed like it took longer than i was thinking, but now as i write it down, i know it took only 10-13 seconds from first sighting to conclusion.  the object must have been huge, being that i could discern it's shape being at that altitude.  i would say that if i put my thumb and first finger at arms length and tried to hold it between those 2 fingers the measurement would have been approximately 1/4 inch, and at that approximate altitude, you all can approximate it's size.  this was a real, what appeared to be solid, object.  certainly not any acknowledged man-made craft.  by the way, i have a b.S. in biology - i am trained in science.  trained to question things and then try to prove or disprove things.  i can't prove to you what i saw, but nobody out there will ever debunk what i saw, or make me believe i didn't see what i know i saw.  i just want you all to know that there are individuals out there, that are scientist that know something real is happening.  it may or may not be documented or verified at this moment, but the truth will eventually come out.  i may post drawings of what i saw on a future post.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Last winter or early spring i was walking in the ansonia nature center late at night as i sometimes do.  i reported witnessing a conical-egg like craft landed there near the nature center pond several years ago.  on this occasion, as i was returning home on the last leg of my walk through the woods at approximately 3:00am i was walking past a house on the outskirts of the woods.  all of the sudden a dear runs frantically across the street in front of me maybe 20ft ahead and skids and falls in front of me as it had been spooked badly by something.  i do not think that it was me that spooked the dear because if it had noticed me it would not have run literally right across my path.  i thought this somewhat spooky - and i realize this is completely subjective - due to the weird quietness in the air like something is about to happen.\r\n\r\ni continued walking towards home and took up a path along the border of the farm belonging to the last house next to the woods.  the path is next to the woods bordered by some open terrain and fields on the other side.  while i was walking my eyes were at a soft focus not paying attention to anything in particular.  then all of the sudden my body instinctively(?) stopped and my eyes focused on an entity approximately 25 yards ahead slightly crouched in a very aggressive posture staring right at me.  \r\n\r\nwhen i first saw the entity - and again this is entirely subjective - i already knew that it was an extraterrestrial alien of some kind without letting that thought occupy my mind as i was so involved in an instinctual stare down.  \r\n\r\ngranted, there are so many other possible explanations, logically speaking, of course but i will elaborate on the strangeness of the encounter with this entity anyway, even if it was not of extraterrestrial origin.  the entity glowed a dull grey-blue and if i remember correctly the moon was shining so there was some visibility as far as light is concerned. the strange thing was the entity uniformly glowed the dull grey-blue everywhere as if it were naked and had no cloths on.  i mean if it were blue-grey skin due to the moonlight, the entire entity would not have  been that color due to the fact that it should have been wearing clothing of some type if it were human.  no clothing was noticed on the creature.  i am not new to ufo and alien reports due to earlier sightings i have experienced and subsequent research, but the over-sized head, skinny legs and arms, large eyes were not present on this creature normally attributed to \"grays\".  in fact the entity seemed much more human-like in form, athletic, intense, focused, at the ready, aggressive in posture.  i did not notice any eyes on the creature in the grey-blue haze that was its form yet i could tell it was staring directly at me in a sort of stand-offish way like two animals in the wild that are infringing on each others terrain.  after locking eyes or glances for three seconds as if i had stumbled upon this entity and it was surprised to see me there or as if it was waiting for me and that i had noticed it too soon and been too alert, the entity very athletically turned and ran full speed into the woods at about a ninety degree angle to the line connecting our paths.  i heard the bushes rustle as the creature took off into the woods and also another sound to my immediate left that sounded like a dear going through the woods by the size of the sound as if it were chasing after the entity as the two paths sounded close or like they would eventually intersect when traveling at such a speed through the woods.\r\n\r\nright after the entity took off dashing headlong into the woods i yelled at it as loudly and aggressively as i could.  this is subjective again and is not really hard proof, but i sometimes get premonitions that i will encounter an et entity in the woods and that we are sometimes on similar mental bandwidth or thinking channels and that if we were to meet there should be a designated location to do this.  i had passed the designated location which i have thought about enough for it to be decided upon and familiar a location to meet at and i yelled at the creature as loud as i could to meet in the right spot (which of course may have been a little more boring of a scenario i later concluded) angered that the supposedly agreed upon location was ignored.  please pardon this craziness (or i feel crazy disclosing the experience in this way) i just thought i would add this anyway.  \r\n\r\ni told a friend about the incident and she said it was just some random person walking in the woods at night and that it was nothing.  this of course is very possible and could easily dismiss this incident away.  but there was a strange energy to the encounter and locking stares on each other to the extent that i was nervous and didn't want to continue the path i was going because i had the sense like i might be ambushed by something.  there was an extreme sense of tension, intrigue, and danger.  i walk back in the woods at night somewhat regularly and dear stalk and approach me within 15-20 feet at times and all other kinds of sounds occur and i do not become scared even though i can't see anything at all but what the small dim flash light can show me.  so this being the case, if it had been a real person, it would had to have been a very aggressive, intense, serious, one with a strange eerie aura about it to frighten me.  and from the people that i have seen walking back in the woods during the day, what on earth would cause him to stare at me in an overtly aggressive manner for three seconds after i saw him and then run head long full speed into the woods.  crazy right?  i went back to the spot the following day and looked at the spot where i thought the entity had approximately been and all along the path next to the woods there was very thick shrubbery, grass, trees, bushes, a tangled mess and i thought to myself, how on earth did this thing run full speed through this tangle.  it seemed simply impossible to me.\r\n\r\nright when i had decided to turn around to go an alternate route home instead of through the woods because i was nervous of an ambush and felt more safe going through a neighborhood with streetlights but i regretted for a moment not taking off after the creature myself.  but as i said it would have been impossible to go through the thick bushes and foliage to do that.  the strangest impression that i get from this incident is that when i locked eyes with the creature i felt like it had been waiting for me or was watching me and that i wasn't supposed to have seen it so soon so it was embarrassed or something and ran off.  and when it ran off, and this is very important, it was not in a scared manner but a very regimented, sure, quick, escape type of way but in a way that let you know it meant business and wasn't scared or nervous but just needed to get out of the area and for some reason it did not belong there because i saw it.  so i walked home the long way on a lit street through the neighborhood just going over the event and continually saying to myself that i was glad that i went the way i did, sure that if i had not i could have possibly been ambushed.  how strange that if i saw simply another human i would have had these impressions and feelings especially since i regularly go back there and am used to the place at dark.  it is just hard to believe than another human would have acted the way that this entity did.  all i can do is report what i saw, which is shaky at best.  nevertheless, the sighting of the landed conical craft that i witnessed prior to this sighting  a while back at approximately the same location in my mind lends credence to the feelings and impression that i have that this entity was something other than human.","distance":"21-100

of the roof. it traveled slow at first then sped up in the last second it was in my view. the distance i was able to watch it travel was approximately 20ft., maybe a little less. i was also approximately 20ft. from the object. i ran through the house and out the front door to see if it continued to travel or had hit my neighbor's house.  it was gone.\r\n\r\ni thought for a brief moment it could have been \"space junk,\" a meteor. but it didn't add up.  no tail, it was flying perfectly straight, it was such a strange green color, and if it were \"space junk\" at the straight level it was traveling along my roof it would have hit the south end of my neighbor's house which sits higher than mine when it disappeared out of my view.  on the same note, it would have had to clear the roof of the house next to mine on the south end of my property because it also sits higher than my house. i still can't explain it and i still go out often to check my roof line, and every year in july to see if it happens again.\r\n\r\ni have researched green orbs since but find either hokey video or stories that really don't sound truthful. i had an experience at 12 years old when i lived near langley afb that i can't explain to this day either.  for a brief moment, as odd as it sounds, i thought that \"they\" found me and were checking on me. honestly, when i couldn't make sense of the green orb intelligently and scientifically, that's truly what i thought.  okay, i know that sounds really out there, but i know what i experienced back in 1977 and i know what i saw july 17th of 2006. just unexplainable.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

20:41\r\n\tlocation: pasadena texans\r\n\ttype of craft observed: triangle\r\n\r\ndescription of event:\r\n\r\n\ton november 18, 2011, i was being driven back from austin texas after receiving medical care for my leg on east sam houston pkwy. prior to crossing the houston ship-channel, and when i looked into the mirror on the outside of the buick rendevous, i noticed a bright light in the sky.  i didn���t think too much about it then because i figured it was the front lights of an airplane.  a few moments later, however, i noticed the same bright glowing light at my 1500 position, and i the told driver to look at it as well.\r\n          it stayed motionless for about 30 seconds , then very quickly shot ahead and maintained it���s position at the new location.  distance gained in this very quick ���jump��� was in my calculated opinion, approximately 20 - 30 miles.   as we traveled, we kept maintaining visual contact on the object and once we reached pasadena and got off the highway, we kept going south with our eyes still on target, where it was in the south-western part of the sky in the direction of hobby airport, where it appeared to be hovering and maintaining it���s position.\r\n\tat the intersection of southmore and preston in pasadena, we pulled over into a parking lot to observe it more.  it was at this location as well, that i called the pasadena police dept. telling them of the craft.  the dispatcher then said that he would notify the patrol cars on the street.\r\n    within five minutes of placing this call, three air force planes were seen in the vicinity of the craft, and at the same time, the search lights from ellington airforce base, were scanning the sky.  the searchlights lasted for only a few moments, as i believe they did not want to alarm the populace due to the fact that i believe that most people, when seeing search-lights, would instinctively look to where they were pointing.\r\n        when the air force planes arrived (c-5, and c-17, plus an unidentifiable high altitude plane which appeared to be signaling with a very bright white light (pulsing,) the craft descended in position, after emitting a very bright white light around itself.  it was here, that you could discern the shape of the craft.  it was triangular in nature. with a reddish/orange circular light located at the top left position of the craft.  at this time also, another man was coming out of the pawn shop on the corner, and asked what we were doing, and we pointed up to where the craft was.  he was on the phone with his girlfriend and was telling her about the triangle he was now observing.  another man came out of the pawnshop, and asked what we were looking at, and when he saw it, he first said ���that���s a cell  phone tower,��� but when it moved, and he saw the triangle shape, he got pretty nervous and went back into the pawn shop. \r\n     after the aforementioned search- lights came on, and the planes arrived, the craft quickly disappeared, then reappeared.  from one of the planes, there appeared to be a giant signaling light which was pulsating sporadically, as if it was trying to communicate with the craft.  this plane was stationary, while the other two planes maintained a circling position, which i estimate to have been at about just outside of a mile from the craft.\r\nthen, with a very quick ���jump,��� the craft  changed positions and was in the south-eastern sky approximately 20 ��� 25 miles away, with the air force following to it���s new coordinates.  as we followed the direction it was going, it would suddenly disappear, and reappear at another location, seemingly using a n,w,e,s coordinate grid.  \r\nwe drove around the city looking for it, and when we would finally re-locate it, we would drive in the direction that we last saw it.  this continued for quite some time, and wherever the craft went, the airforce planes were in that location.  one plane, higher up, continued pulsating a white signaling light the entire time as well.\r\nfor a little while, we lost visual due to it���s sporadic nature of travel, but then we finally re-located it again, while driving along a road parallel to south interstate 45. we could see the craft in the sky due east of pasadena (red bluff road- genoa red bluff).  we then followed it to an intersection, where we observed it moving again due east, with one military craft about a mile behind it, and another circling  back to join the same direction as the first.  we then followed it in the direction it went, and after that, both the craft and the planes disappeared out of sight. although we continued to drive around, we could not locate anymore movement in the sky from either the airforce or the craft. \r\n \r\n","distance":"Over One

to be very faint but noticeable orb like light started as a light red/white then went to just a silent traveling white light. was not a shooting star was way to low and traveling way to slow. there was no sound whatsoever. it is extremely quiet up there in the catskill region at night. as i was watching this white orb like light i wanted to flim it but it happened so fast. then it kind of turned a deep redish color and either went into the clouds or faded out. i had an extremely erie feeling watching it, i think the fact that there was zero sound really intrigued me especially since it seemed so close. i would absolutely love to know what it was but i can def tell you what it wasn't. wasn't a plane, hellicopter, arial vehicle of any kind, blimp, satalite, (way to low for that) and definitely was not a shooting star, i have seen all of these very often in this area so i really have no idea. i have never witnessed anything quite like this before. at first i really thought i was seeing things and maybe half asleep but i know what i saw and it was actually a real thing, whatever it may have been lol. i have seen something up there before, same area, what seemed to be a red orangish meteor shooting across the sky also low but what was interesting was how at the end of its trail it went up instead of descending. there are lots of shooting stars up there you well know the difference if you are around there a lot like myself. if there is any type of plane or anything you hear it loud and clear because of how extremely quiet it is up there. only other thing i keep seeing is small glowing orblike white spheres \"way up\" in the sky, definitely space. traveling very slow, i was told those are however satillites, but then again who knows anymore.","distance":"101-500

previous day and how special energies were reported to have come to the planet. i commented that i had not experienced anything out of the ordinary. i added that another friend had mentioned hearing that this new energy would allow ufos to make more contact with us incrementally so the public wouldn't be frightened until we all were ready for first major contact.\r\n\r\nas i spoke, two other folks walked by and into my friend's lumber yard looking for wood.\r\n\r\nsuddenly, my friend looked behind me and upwards and asked, \"what in the hell is that?\"\r\n\r\ni turned to see what appeared to be the front single front light of an aircraft coming directly toward us from the north, through the gap in two large trees across the road. the light appeared to be quite a distance away, perhaps miles\r\n.\r\ni first thought it to be an aircraft coming on an unusual glidepath to either sacramento or san francisco airports but instead of the usual steady or blinking white landing lights turned on when starting a procedure that i have observed near airports on several occasions, the sole light was larger than usual, and reddish/orange with a tinge of yellow on top in color.\r\n\r\nthe light proceeded slowly and directly toward us then abruptly stopped, stayed still for a moment or two, then started slowly upward toward the ne behind the tree.\r\n\r\njust as the first one moved upward, a second light just like the first repeated the procedure, then a third, then a fourth, only the fourth one moved upward toward the nw, to the left.\r\n\r\nas we were gazing and commenting to each other about \"what the hell are we watching?\", the couple emerged from the yard and the woman exclaimed, \"what in the world is that?\"\r\n\r\nthe man suggested that they might be flares on parachutes but flares on parachutes definately do not move toward us, stop then move upward completely out of sight behind the trees as these lights did. and, except for the lights, there were no other things to be seen, like smoke or reflections of a parachute.\r\n\r\njust last week my friend called me to check out yahoo sports where a link was posted, \"ufos spotted above a highschool football game on oct.

am a professional newspaper journalist in southeast saskatchewan, canada. i am also a professional biographer and published author. i have been a lifelong aviation enthusiast, and have taken 60+ hours of pilot training, many of those hours as pilot in command (solo) on three different aircraft types. i am the former owner of a flight simulation company that had customers in 65 countries.\r\n\r\nat 20:35 on sunday nov. 20, i decided to take the dog for a walk and get a copy of one of the newspapers i have been reporting for. our town is small, about 700 population on the canadian prairie. tonight it is -18 degrees celcius, with a wind chill of -24. there are no clouds, the sky is crisp and clear, and visibility is unlimited. there is a recent fall of 4 inches of snow on the ground, so i did not want to be outside for long.\r\n\r\ni got the paper, (just a walk of about 200 yards from my back yard) and was on my way back to the house. as i have been studying the ufo phenomena in detail for a year now, as i was walking, looking down at the dog, i found myself thinking \"if you keep your eyes on the ground, you will never see anything.\" i looked up and did what i normally do on a clear night, started scanning the sky, admiring the brilliance of the stars in the frigid atmosphere.\r\n\r\nthen i saw it. in the northwest quadrant of the sky, at approximately 45 degrees above the horizon, there was a formation of lights. i assumed this would be a regional airliner coming from regina. i stopped walking and concentrated on the formation. there were clearly four red lights in a line, with an impression of a raised elevation for the two middle lights. my immediate question was, \"where is the green navigation light?\" there was none. \r\n\r\nthe lights blinked on and off, from left to right. at no time were all four lights on together, but the rapid pulsing was giving the impression of a solid object behind the lights, although there was no texture visible. i decided to walk forward until a tree in my yard was p[lacing branches across my line of sight. i positioned myself to that the light formation was visible through the branches. i wanted to stand still, viewing the lights through something also stationary in order to assess relative movement of the lights across the sky. there was no movement. the lights kept pulsating in order, and i said out loud \"bloody hell, it's hovering.\"\r\n\r\ni then noticed lights to the right of the first object. i hoped it might be an airliner so i could see it's movement relative to the unmoving position of the first. no chance, this was an exactly identical light formation. it was also motionless, showing the same characteristic of four pulsating red lights, blinking rapidly on and off from left to right.\r\n\r\nthe second object was perceptibly higher in the sly, relative to the horizon. if the first was 45 degrees up, this was somewhere between 50 and 60 degrees. \r\n\r\ni watched these light formations for maybe 45 seconds, though it seemed longer. if i put my hand out at arm's length and opened a gap between thumb and forefinger, i would say the \"length\" of each formation was somewhere in the region of two millimeters. the gap between the objects would have been similarly perceived as a foot and a half.\r\n\r\nthere was no sound, and no movement of the formations either across the sky or relative to each other. i did not feel any fear, just fascination. i decided i would run into the house and get my wife and daughter to see this, and no sooner had i thought that, than the higher object to the light simply faded out quickly. maybe two seconds later, the lower object to the left similarly faded. they were gone.\r\n\r\naircraft? not a chance. we are not on a major airway, and the only airliners that come over are typically from regina which is 150km away to the west. anything flying over us at altitude is normally above 30,000 ft.\r\nlight aircraft? no. in the total silence of the prairie, you hear aircraft before you see them at night, and besides, general aviation flying in this area is very rare at night. would you fly for fun tonight at these temperatures in a cessna, piper, cirrus, etc? i would not.\r\n\r\nsatellite? no. i have observed the sky enough times to know that a satellite would not appear as a line of four red pulsating lights, let alone two of them at the same time. i would also expect movement of a satellite.\r\n\r\nmeteor, comet, asteroid? no. again, the sighting does not fit with these type of phenomena, which i have witnessed this summer as we saw increased meteor activity recently.\r\n\r\nred lights, pulsating in sequence, dead still and silent in the clear night sky. two sets of them at different elevations and positions, high above this little prairie town. i cannot say what these were, they must thus be in my mind unidentified.\r\n\r\nif we are moving into a new age of greater disclosure, then we can expect to see more of such sightings. as a reporter, i am not afraid to write openly in the newspapers about them. i have witnessed quite a few things in the sky over my 54 years on planet earth, and i only hope that we will get definitive answers long before my time is over.\r\n\r\nwhat i saw just over an hour and 15 minutes ago was impressive. while i might have my suspicions of what i witnessed, based on study and a process of elimination, i refrain from being so bombastic as to say this is anything other than most unusual in our skies, clearly unidentified, and in my opinion, most welcomed.\r\n\r\ni hope this report adds to the growing repository of first-hand witness testimony.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":33511,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":49.903077,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-11202011-0016","longitude":-102.029075,"occurred":1321850400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Saskatchewan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1321858925000,"summary":"Two

witnessed a military craft in the area. regrettably, i was not carrying a camera, so realise that my report probably has some inaccuracies in it. however, i'll attempt to recreate the event, as it happened over a little bit over an hour ago, so maybe it won't be too hard. \r\n\r\ni'm visiting family members who live in an area near dalton called dawnville. a little over 2 miles away from dawnville elementary school (i will not give specific road names for their identity). so, i wanted to go outside of the house to get some air. i had my laptop with me, so me freaking out on someone and looking it chat logs is how i know the time is perfectly accurate. so, back to the story ...(sorry, this probably isn't as exciting as some of these logs, however, i'm seeking information on this event and a possible identification and origin on the craft)... \r\n\r\ni hear a low hum, it was faint, however, what really directed my attention to it was the fact that it was low altitude, and pretty large, as aircrafts tend to be. so, as walking outside, i look up to the star covered sky, and see a flat, triangle shaped aircraft, near the road, i could only see the under side of it. the underside, however, was covered in lights on the underside, probably the typical amount for an aircraft like that. the thing that got me was it's speed, it was going around 30-50mphs, unlike most aircrafts. i had time to get my relative to come outside; but not enough to get a camera. they provided some useful info, they said they've seen this aerocraft fly by before. so i thought i'd type a report. i've never seen anything like it before, other than concept designs for military crafts. i think it's odd they flew in a residential area; perhaps it was a unmanned arial vehicle doing some sort of sweep; typical things like that make more sense. however; uavs have strict rules in u.S. airways that this craft probably violated. thus, it makes me suspicious that it could've just been a normal aircraft. \r\n\r\nthe direction of the object seemed to be pretty uniform, it didn't make any sudden changes, it was just extremely slow moving; almost \"hovering\", going back to my information sweeping theory. i could try to say it was moving more towards dawnville; however, i lost sight of it whenever i started losing focus, so i can't be exact where it was heading. \r\n\r\nthis was a pretty interesting occurrence. i probably wouldn't have published a report, however, i thought it'd be informative to. so to summarize this report in case i missed crucial info; at around 19:52/7:52pm i spotted a aircraft that was triangular in shape, underside visible only, appeared flat, had several lights (most white, one or two red) heading towards dawnville at around 30-50mph, seemed to be either searching or \"sweeping\" for something. residents of the house say they've seen it before. craft was white in colour, markings were possible; but not observed.\r\n\r\n(note: sweeping as in data sweeps, which means that they picked up all frequencies and communications; which government officials have admitted to doing. also; potentially taking video or audio surveillance for unknown purposes) \r\n\r\ni look forward to any info i can get related to this event.\r\nthank you.","distance":"101-500

little bit too warm so i went to my window to open it ,get some fresh air in my room.  while sliding the window open i happened to notice what i at first thought was a fire in my neighbors yard. and i kind of did a double take... looked again...  and what i at first thought was a fire turned out to be something completely strange and unknown to me... let me take a moment to explain how and why i could see into my neighbors yard... my neighbor's homes were located on 13th st.  which ran north/south... so the fronts of their homes were facing east.. and their yards were facing west...  now the home where i grew up was located in what is often times called an alley. actually it was just a small side street at a 90 degree angle to 13th st....  the front of my house faced south and the back of my house faced north... the yard where i saw the object was south of my position... and i also had the advantage of being on the second floor... thereby overlooking the entire row of my neighbors yards...    there in my neighbors yard.. directly in front of the back door to their garage... hovering less than 12 inches above the ground...  a glowing, multi hued, shape... somewhat round... { toroid/torus}...  well, like a doughnut without the hole in the middle...  anyway...  because of how it glowed and seemed like the colors were changing within itself... i thought it was the most beautiful thing i had ever seen... also the most unexpected and unusual thing too... so i started shouting for my father and my brother to come see this thing in the neighbors yard... as i was doing that.. the ? {toroid} slowly began to ascend.. until it was just above the height of the garage...  then it changed direction as well... from straight up to approx.... 45 degree angle to the right which put it on a northward course.. and continued upward at this angle until i could no longed see it due to my position...{  2nd floor bedroom.. front of house... south facing window...} in the meantime my father and brother arrived at my room a couple of seconds too late... so they never got to see that incredible,beautiful,glowing ???... whatever it was...  and to this day i still remember that object... as if it happened yesterday...   unfortunately for me though. i do not remember the date or the month and year that this occurred...  i was maybe 14 years old at the time...  so that would make the time frame... approx..  1970,71...  as i said, to this day that object is on my mind....  i have often gone out into the countryside around allentown from then until now and watched the stars and waited in the hope that i would see that strange and beautiful thing again...  someday!!!                                                       forgot to mention it's size...  my estimate made by knowing the distance from my window to my neighbors yard....   remember donut shape...  24 to 30 inches across... and 12 to 18 inches high...   it was at least twice as wide as it was tall..    one more thing about this object that was and is memorable to me is the fact that although this thing was glowing very brightly....  the only thing it illuminated was itself.... the walls of the garage, the door of the garage, even the cement walkway underneath itself  although within 12 inches of the object.... were in fact not illuminated by the brightness it displayed...  personally i have never seen any kind of light display those kinds of qualities... when you light a light...  it always illuminates things around it...  not the toroid though... somehow it kept it's light to itself... just itself!!!                                              what was it?   what is it? will i ever see it again? or anything like it?....   sure hope so!!!...............
