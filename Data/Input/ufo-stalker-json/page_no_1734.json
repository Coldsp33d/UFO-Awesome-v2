(this was a third encounter with an unknown object for me; the other two being in tecumseh, michigan and flint, michigan.)  there were seven family members on the beach to verify there was no moon.  my husband and i have the picture.  i don't have the capability to send it in this report, but i have dated the picture on my camera. i will be happy the share it with mufon.

i stood there for several minutes trying to focus in on it and decide whether it was something that i could explain.  when i was satisfied that i would not be able to explain what it was i started looking around for someone else to ask if they were seeing what i was seeing and literally no one was around, which was also odd to me because we live in a community that is pretty active with young families especially at around 7:30 p.M. on a bueatiful and clear summer evening.  i got really scared and just ran home.  as i was running i kept looking back at it to see if it was still there and it was there, doing nothing but hovering in the sky.  the thought that was running through my head was that i couldn't be seperated from my dog and that i had to get my dog home.  after i got home (to what was an empty house because my husband was working nights) i don't remember what i did at all for the rest of the evening.  a weird thing (in my opinion) about this experience is that i didn't call my mom right away to tell her about this experience because she would have loved to hear about something like this.  she is obsessed with ufo's and aliens and is the only reason why i am reporting this.  i didn't remember any of this story until i was prompted by a conversation me and my mom where having the following tuesday.

car upon returning he noticed what looked like a spectacular meteor shower maybe 30-40 degrees above the horizon due south of where we were in ahwatukee. several (5-10) large objects were falling or re-entering the atmosphere at very steep angles, nearly straight straight down. they had long burning orange tails following the objects -what you would expect from a meteor or a satellite re-entering and burning up but i had never seen anything falling at such a steep angle or appear to be as large or as close (what looked like as close as 10-20 miles) as they were coming in. and it took some time. they were falling for a good 2-3 minutes before it got weird.\r\n\r\n after they were about 10-15 degrees above the horizon one of the objects appeared to change direction, not very much at first, then it just stopped moving for 2-3 seconds and took off at what looked like 90 degree angle extremely quickly. then another one of the burning objects began similar behavior in a different direction. around the time the objects began to appear solid and no longer looked like they were still on fire we noticed the sound of helicopters, maybe 4-5 coming in from the north. the helicopters didn't seem to be in formation but they were all traveling toward the direction of the objects. \r\n\r\nat this point 2-3 of the objects that were left ( the rest disappeared) appeared to be solid and well defined in shape and were now emitting greenish light from their surfaces. they were zig zagging somewhat randomly until all but one seemed to vanish. the last one then just seemed to hover for a minute or so.\r\n\r\nwe were all pretty weirded out by the experience (neighbors and a few friends that were meeting us at the residence had gathered to watch the phenomenon) and decided to get back to reality and go back in the house. \r\n\r\nabout 10min later i was curious to see if anything was still happening so i went outside to look in the same area of the sky and what do you know a fireworks show. no a real fireworks show, how convenient. turns out it was for some event the casino was having more or less in the same general direction. decided to go back inside. \r\n\r\nanother 5-10min past and decided to go outside again. now it appeared that what looked like one of the solid green objects seen prior was just hovering there but the light from its surface was illuminating a small round cloud a few hundred feet above its surface which was then indirectly lighting the object. \r\n\r\nhad seen enough for one evening  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

watched the sky with binoculars or naked eye and have seen numerous objects over the years.  i dont have the best camera but decided to try and take zoomed in photos now and then of objects i have seen.  the camera that took the photos in regards to this report is a digital with zoom that uses a floppy disk for storage.  i have debated wheather or not to file this report and submit the photos since i want to be absoultly sure that what is reported is accurate and not a waste of anybodys time.  the only manipulation that i have done on the photos submitted is to invert color & or zoom in & or sharpen in order to try and get the best view possible of the objects.  i would love if mufon or someone could enhance them better.  this was a clear sunny day late afternoon.  sitting on my deck looking up at approximately a 60 - 80 degree angle - approximately 5 or 10 degrees to the west of south.  offutt afb is 10 - 15 miles to the se.  millard airport is 1 mile straight south.  omaha eppley is 15 miles to the north east.  i was a jet mechanic in the navy and am quit familiar with military and commericial aircraft.  i have learned the incoming and outgoing flight paths for the above facilities.  i am guessing that the objects i observed and took photos of are approximately up around 30 - 40 thousand feet as they were hard to see with the naked eye but able to watch with binoculars and they still appeared to be distant.  when i took the photos - i didnt know if the pictures would turn out or not let alone capture anything since the objects seemed so far distance.  the most common factor in the photos is the small green circular light.  i first noticed the triangular object (which was hard to distinguish its shape at the time) and took its picture which i was supprised to see the triangular shape and more important to see a cicular area on the bottom of the craft which appears to be some sort of propulsion emission.  the two object photo - was one object then two, were there and then were gone.  i know what i saw, i know what i took pictures of and i know what the pictures are showing; i know that the objects are not any type of commericial or military aircraft that i have ever seen before.  no matter if you are a skeptic of ufo's or a believer in ufo's as i am - here are the pictures for you to view and decide for yourself what the objects are.  mufon or nuforc are encouraged by me to analyize these photos in depth because i would like to know what they decide the objects in the pictures might be.  mufon or nuforc are welcome to contact me for any additional questions or investigation.

(i have submitted information on all these sightings to the mufon investigator by mail.) \r\n\r\ni have recently discussed this particular sighting with my next door neighbor, since she and her teenage son witnessed this event in front of our properties.  i wanted to ask her if she saw what i saw that night.  because it was her first sighting of anything like this, she was visibly upset and was saying over and over \"this is weird, oh, this is just too weird!\", i did not want to upset her further.  as we were standing in her driveway observing this object, she handed me back my binocs at one point when the \"craft\" was flying over our heads toward the southeast from read mountain.  (i believe her realization that it was indeed a craft, not just lights, was the tipping point of her emotions, and that is why she handed me the binocs.)  i looked through the binocs and saw that the large \"bright light\" we had been observing was really what i can only describe as an elongated dumbell shaped craft.  on each end was a large, glowing, vivid cherry-red light.  stretched between them was an elongated oval that was a soft, tanish-yellow color, and in the middle of that oval was another smaller elongated oval that was a soft blue-white color.  i know this sounds weird, but that's what it looked like to me...And she confirmed to me that was basically what she saw as well.   \r\n\r\n[i personally believe that we were looking at the back side of the craft as it was flying away from us; and perhaps the soft, blue-white colored elongated oval in the middle might have been a long narrow window.] \r\n\r\nat one point, i handed her back the binocs because i too was in an emotional state.  she watched it continue to fly across the valley in a southeasterly direction toward the vinton area; she then stated, \"oh, that's weird, it just dropped straight down very fast and disappeared!\"  i was watching it fly across the valley without binocs, so to me, it looked like it just \"blinked\" out.\r\n\r\nneedless to say, my observation of several sightings over the past month have taken a toll on my desire to witness anymore.  i have decided to limit the number of evening potty trips for my dog and carefully pick the time frame of each to avoid any possible sighting again.  at this point, i refrain from looking out my front windows at night unless i really have to take my dog out to potty, and only do so once i think the sky is clear.  i keep telling myself they are not going to bother me, but it's just to soon to feel comfortable just yet!\r\n\r\ni truly do not want to see anymore of these \"things\"!!\r\n\r\n

at the intersection of myer and riverview and my eye was immediately drawn to a bright light visible in the sky directly ahead of me above the northern horizon. i saw that the light was reflecting from a metallic silver object, and i thought it was odd because it seemed so much brighter than the jets or planes i've seen before in the sky. my instant reaction was to think this was a conventional aircraft of some kind, and i watched it, thinking that in a second or two a wing structure would become visible as the craft moved toward the north-east. when no wing structure appeared after a few seconds, i called my wife's attention to the object. she immediately saw it at that point and was as puzzled by it as i was.\r\n     the object appeared to be cigar shaped. it was metallic and silvery looking. there were no wings, propellers, lights, or markings visible anywhere on it. the object left no contrail, nor could we hear any sound coming from it (although a sound would have been hard to

my youngest daughter was about 2 years old and whenever she saw an airplane she would point up and say, \"plane, mommie.\"  my husband wanted us to drive out with him to see about getting a tire fixed or replaced on our convertible caddilac.  it was a hot summer day, and my husband let the top down off the caddilac.  we arrived at the tire shop early it was after 10:00am, but i do not think after 12:00.  i remember thinking it was early and not much traffic was at the tire shop.  \r\n\r\nmy husband parked the car in the parking lot in front of the tire building and we decided to stay in the car.  after my husband left the car and went into the building a plane happened to be going by at some point.  my daughter saw it and said, \"look plane mommie.\"  i looked up and to my astonishment i saw about 7 or 8 bright lights in the sky.  they looked circular from the distance and they were bright like a star, reflecting light.  they were initally in some like of form as they moved closser in my direction, it seemed.  then suddenly they broke that formation and scattered about ramdomly it seemed.  they hovered and darted from side to side.  they moved from one spot to another and then hovered a bit.  an airliner was going by and i said to myself, surely they are seeing this on their radat.  i was in a state of bewilderment, i looked away for one instant to rub my eyes out of disbelief.  however, i know what i saw and when i looked back up within an instant, the moving, darting, circular, hovering, lights were gone. i looked around and no one was looking, if anyone was around.   i kept looking up at the sky to see if they returned but they did not.  then it occured to my that i could not be the only who saw the ufo's, sio i began to turn the radio station to hear about the sighting........To my surprize there were no sightings reported.\r\n\r\nwhen my husband returned to the car, i told him the story.  he did not know how to respond at first.  i was somewhat frantic and searching the radio for facts about recent sighting.  there were none.  later that day when we returned home, i turned from station to station on television news and there was nothing. \r\n\r\nnasa was close and the plane had to have picked up the activity from the plans, i assumed so how come there is nothing about the sighting i witnessed?  i had heard there was a cover up that began early in the sighting history in america, i now was beginning to believe that was true.  \r\n\r\nmy daughter is now 36 amd that happened when she was about 2 years old at the least and about 3 at the most, which means it was 1975 or 1976 when i saw this maurade of unidentified space crafts in the houston sky.  \r\n\r\nwhen i tried to tell my mother she refused to listen.  so, i have not shared it unless i am in the presence of someone who has had some paranormal experience or seen a ufo.  when i saw mufon i was given the mind to share my experience.  it is nothing i can prove, and it was so long ago, but i remember it vividly as if it was yesterday.  this happened in the daylight......And the lights were very visible, it was awesome.\r\n\r\nif anyone else saw these ufo's in houston, texas around 1975 ot 1976 please let me know.  i would love to hear your story.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then
