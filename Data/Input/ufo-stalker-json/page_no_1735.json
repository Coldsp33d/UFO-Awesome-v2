my habit nightly. i was sweeping the sky using my high power binoculars, when i saw something dark, blotting out the stars, moving north to south about 30-40 degrees above the horizon, as i looked east. i am a very experienced person at night, as i have always been a graveyard person and out at night. i had been working security for about 2-3 years by this time and used binoculars on a nightly basis, while sitting in the dark at various locations. \r\n     i just happened to sweep my binoculars south to north when something dark caught my eye, moving south. i quickly swept south and caught up with the dark object and followed it as it moved south almost directly in front of me from quite a distance away. it stopped just to the right of center and then 3 lights came on and i realized there were 3 of them, triangle shaped, with the tips of the triangle pointing up, long sides with a somewhat narrow bottom.  \r\n     each full triangle was completely lit up (white light) and they were all three in a triangle formation, one at the top, one bottom left, one bottom right. as i watched all 3 of them, at exactly the same time, they did 3 rotations to the right at about 1 to 1.5 seconds per rotation, finishing in the straight up position(s) they started in, then stopped for a second and then did 3 rotations to the left at about 1 to 1.5 seconds per rotation. again ending the 3 rotations in the straight up position. it was like they were each pinned in the middle, as there was only a rotation, no movement up down, left right, no wobble. they just turned 360 degrees, 3 times right, three times left. then stopped for a second or so and then all 3 lit up triangles, pulsed 3 times in unison and then in a second or two, all 3 went dark at exactly the same time and immediately moved off quickly. one went north, one south and one straight up. i again was able to find and track the one headed north, but lost it in a few seconds among the stars. i could not find or track the other two.\r\n     i should add that when i first saw this craft, blacked out moving south, i figured it was some kind of aircraft, not a ufo. as i tracked it, i saw no lights until all 3 came together in the triangle formation described. i was pretty well shock for the rest of the night, as i have never seen anything like this before (or after!) vance h. seibert  ","distance":"Over

us.  it was completely silent keeping in stride with us on the highway for about a half mile.  we just sat there completely silent smoking cigarettes as it watched us. for the half mile that it rode by us, it's bottom was at about tire height to the truck so we could not see the undercarriage of it until if pulled away from us departing into a cornfield while raising its side nearest to us.  the undercarriage had 3 small \"orbs\" located by its tips of the triangular bottom, and had on large \"orb\" centered in the middle of the craft.  the \"orbs\" were spherical and emitted no color other than the small amounts of ionized oxygen and nitrogen. we were not afraid at all, surprisingly, but the radio that was quietly on in the car received only static while the craft was near the car.  we now have reason to suspect that the beings inside the craft had/have something to do with the abandoned house because of the previous occurrences there(which i was not a part of), but that is purely

see that too\" ? and we just kept talking about it because weve never seen an image like that or object like that before. sam said he noticed the object because he was twisting his dreads and he seen it. the first thing i thought it was was a ufo automatically. it couldnt have been nothing else then i searched on google el paso ufo and we seen the same stuff. sam said he seen it go into 3 different pieces. the only thing we remember is seeing the light glow and leave so fast , and it didnt leave a trail so it wasnt a shooting start or nothing. my feelings was like did i really see that or was i just tripping , i was thinking about it all night and i even told my teacher and she told me to report it , i reacted so fast to it because it happened so fast. i lost sight of the object

shoot off beside it and remain in a straight horizontal line next to the bigger object (not falling to earth).  then all of the little ones would return to the bigger ball. each time the light became brightest or basically became visible again it was followed by a far off rumble similar to hearing a far off thunderstorm.  this all lasted about 10 min and then never observed it again. when i first saw it i thought i was a shooting star or asteroid but it and all the other smaller lights were stationary.  when observing it i racked my brain thinking what it could be.  i thought maybe a helicopter doing search and rescue with a spotlight that i could only see when it faced my direction but that doesnt explain the far off explosion or rumble that i heard at least 3-4 times.  the

light in a v-shape traveled across the night sky silently west to east. at first i was excited that i had seen my first set of the meteors. but after several hours of watching meteors after my first incounter i soon relized that what i saw was no meteor at all. so i began to research and have found countless cases of this same craft, it almost appears to have some type of cloaking device. i feel that the 8 balls of light i saw were the under lights to a much larger craft. if any one eles saw this please comment i would reall like to know what it is that we are all seeing out here. this lights i saw were barley visable, and the meteors i saw look just like shooting starts witch was nothing like this. i watch the craft travle from right above me in my back yard to the east horizon untill it
