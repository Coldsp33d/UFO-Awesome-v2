States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I have kept quiet about this for 47 years as i saw others ridiculed for reporting what they'd seen. now that i'm retired i could care less so here is my story. for the sake of brevity i will use the names jack and jim for my brothers.\r\n\r\nmy experience was in the fall of 1964 on a saturday night around 10:00 pm.  i lived three miles from the nearest town on a major highway 12 miles outside of erie, pennsylvania. my two younger twin brothers(13) and i (15) hitched a ride home from a skating rink and as we got out of the car that gave us a ride i noticed lights coming from the back of our property. this was about 300 yards from the highway and the lights were like a big glowing ball. nobody was home as my mother was working and all our weekly renters were out on the town. \r\n\r\n we had a storage shed at the very back of our property and the field in front of the shed was lower and shielded from view by a long picket fence and roses bushes.\r\n\r\ni unlocked the front door and we raced to the kitchen in the back of the house without turning on any lights. the kitchen was lite up from a light coming through the windows from large outside security lights. i got a flashlight out of a drawer as they looked out the window over the kitchen sink. i told them i was going to get my shotgun.\r\n\r\nwhen i returned to the kitchen my brother jim was learning on the stove shaking with fear and mumbling. jack was looking out the window in obvious fear. as i loaded the gun with the light from the flashlight i placed on the counter, i told them it was probably somebody trying to steal things out of the shed and we would scare the daylights out of them.\r\n\r\njack kept saying those are awfully strange looking lights and they don't look like lights from a car. i had a quick look out the window but nothing but a glowing light and the top of some structure.\r\n\r\nboth of my brothers were acting very weird and totally out of character. i told them to follow me and i went out the back door. i quickly realized they weren't behind me and so i went back in the house. they were still frozen with fear. i looked at them and said: \"what in the world is wrong with you two? why are the two of you acting like wimps?\" \r\n\r\njim yelled \"i'm not going down there\". he kept repeating this over and over like his brain was stuck as he still was leaning on the stove as fear obviously took out the use of his legs. i was completely dumb founded by his reaction to a glowing light. jack who was normally an arrogant loud mouth was dead quiet. i said come on jack let's go as he stood looking  blankly out the window. i said why are you guys wimping out on me like this? i have a gun and you know i never miss. jack slowly followed me out the door as i told him nothing would hurt him.\r\n\r\n we had five double motel units perpendicular from the highway beginning 75 feet from the back of the house and ending 125 yards at the edge of a field. the shed was another 300 feet from the front edge of the field. all lights were on as well as a dozen driveway lights and two pole lights. the area was lit up like a supermarket parking lot except where the craft landed. \r\n\r\nwe sneaked along the back of the units and jack having regained his courage moved ahead of me by  ten yards. he looked around the corner of the last motel unit and quickly came running back to me. he started shaking all over from fear. i asked him what he saw as he walked by me heading for the house. he said \"i don't know but i'm getting the hell out of here. i told him to wait and i then peered around the corner with my 16ga pump shotgun and holy shit i couldn't believe my eyes. there was a huge spacecraft and the outer diameter was only 30 to 40 yards away. i then ducked back around the corner and asked my brother what he thought and he said \"i don't know but i'm getting the hell out of here\". i told him to wait again and leaned the gun up against the back of the building as it was more apt to provoke an attack by these creatures. i peered around the corner again to have another look. i took a long hard look to get all the details but saw no alien creatures. i said do you think we could get closer for a better look. he looked at me like i'd lost my mind and said hell no and ran towards the house.\r\n\r\nbelieve it or not but i didn't have any fear just a fascination at what i had just seen. my heart was beating out of my chest and i realized i might be brave but i wasn't about to be down their all alone and quickly caught up to jack.\r\n\r\nthe spacecraft was roughly a hundred and fifty feet in diameter with a band of dim blue-green and crimson colored lights around the perimeter. it was around twenty feet high and a dull silver metallic looking craft. it was a beautiful looking machine with no obvious seams or rivets of any kind. it was like three different saucers one on top of another but looked like the whole thing was stamped out of one piece of material. it was supported by four landing legs and the lights were about 1 1/2 feet high by a 3 feet long of alternating blue and red around the biggest diameter of the craft. the lights were pulsating counterclockwise and it gave you a strange feeling. the top had too rectangular black windows about five feet long and two and a half to three feet high.\r\n\r\nwe were all big for our age and afraid of nothing before this experience. i being older really wanted to get closer but again i wasn't about to go it alone. we got back to the house and jim hadn't moved from his leaning on the stove. he asked what we had seen and jack said you don't want to know. i explained in detail exactly what we had seen. he said that was enough for him and said i'm outta here. i stopped him in his tracks as he was heading for the front door and said he shouldn't go outside alone.\r\n\r\nthere was a bar about a city block away and i had just enough money for three cokes. we ran the 275 yards as fast as we could run and walked quickly through the front door. we walked through the bar area and continued into the dining area. we took a seat all out of breath. both jim an jack were white as ghosts. the 8-12 patrons at the bar looked at us and probably wondered what the heck was going on with these strange acting kids.\r\n\r\nsix people in the dining area were looking at us as we took our seats. the old woman that owned the place with her husband quickly came to our table and asked me if there was anything wrong. i just smiled and said no we were just running and out of breath. i thought she was going to kick us out because of our age but she let us stay. she looked at my brothers and then back at me and said are you sure you're all right with a questioning look. i assured her nothing was wrong and ordered three cokes and pretzels. jim was shaking and looking down at the floor and jack was looking straight ahead out the window. both looked a complete mess. \r\n\r\nwe stayed there for three hours with this sweet old lady coming around every fifteen minutes with the same i know something's wrong look. we said nothing and agreed to keep our mouths shut as people would think we were crazy. we then went home and the craft was gone. we said nothing to our mother as she was having a difficult time with my father passing at 38 years old only two months ago and having to be the bread winner.\r\n\r\nthe next morning  jack and i checked out the site at daylight hoping to find some evidence. all we found were weeds flattened where the three foot diameter landing legs of the craft had been. jim refused to go any where near the site. the area was all gravel ground and it had been very dry and warm. you could have driven a semi-tractor trailer over this weed and \r\ngrass field and it wouldn't have left a tire track. i was hoping for burn marks or something but none existed.\r\n\r\nmy two brothers and i discussed that night only a few times as it very much upset them. january of 1966 i tried discussing this again as we moved and were not anywhere close to the site and they still reacted the same. then around six months later they couldn't remember a thing and said i was crazy. both have no memory of this event today although it took months for them to get over it. jack remembers the morning after when we looked for evidence of the spacecraft landing site.\r\n\r\nthe really strange thing was the quickness of their negative reaction. we could be laughing and telling jokes and one word from me about that night and it was like i'd flipped a switch in their brains. they would only look at each other and then the fear would start. it was like they had their own pact between them. i believe that night was the first close contact for me but not for them. this experience had happened to them before, i'm sure of it now as why would they react to a glowing light with such fear. it's the only logical explanation as only two things could have taken place for them not to remember. one is they were abducted and their memory erased or fear made them forget it. if fear made them forget then why did it take so long. to my knowledge neither have told anybody anything to this day. this disturbs jack as well as he remembers looking for evidence of a spaceship landing but can't remember why he was doing it. jim has absolutely no memory but he was never quite the same person after that night.\r\n\r\nafter talking to jack for months of things before and after the actual event to try to jog his memory he finally remembers. he called me one night and told me the whole story including details that i had forgotten.\r\n\r\nafter that event many sightings in the area were reported and of course people laughed and questioned those people's sanity. this cemented our initial pact to be silent. people on the news were saying the sightings were probably weather balloons or lights from the city reflecting off clouds.\r\n\r\nwell we didn't live in a city and this sure wasn't a weather balloon. i didn't see no little green men but wouldn't have been surprised if one tapped me on the shoulder that night. i was a pretty fast runner back then but i'm sure the olympic record would have been shattered for the mile if that would have happened.\r\n \r\ni wish i would have had a camera and taken a photo although it probably wouldn't have shown to much in the dark. it was  a very small area for this craft to land in as large 70 foot oak trees were across the back of the property and around the shed with am almost shear cliff to a creek 20 yards further. along one side was a grape vineyard and the other side had rows of three foot high black raspberry bushes. the craft itself took up at least half the field's depth and over a third of it's width. it was 250 yards from the back kitchen window of our house but only 86 yards from a neighbors house.\r\n\r\npeople today accept stories of sightings much better then they did back in 1964. i still get some strange looks when i tell this story by some people who think humans are the highest form of intelligence in the universe. they always say i'd walk right up to the craft and knock on the door. talk is cheap and until it actually happens to you it's just all speculation on how you would react. why i wasn't scared that night i have no idea. maybe it was my love of the old buck rogers tv program in the 1950's when i was a little kid. his spacecraft never looked anywhere near as good as this one.  \r\n\r\ni do know that one experience is enough and i don't wish for this to happen again at least not this close. i got within 90-120 feet of this thing and that was way too close. thinking back i must have been crazy for wanting to get closer but even now sometimes i wished i would have as i don't think i'll get another chance. after reading about some close encounters with some bad results jack might just have saved me some pain or even my life. we can only surmise what might have happened.\r\n\r\nif this ever happens to you i would suggest writing it down and have everybody sign it as i've read stories with similar results as my brothers losing their memory.\r\n\r\nupdate:\r\n\r\ni had only estimated the spacecraft's size and distances but decided yesterday to use google earth to view the landing location to see if i could scale the measurements. i had tried this before but couldn't get the scale right. my plan was to see if i could print a picture of an aerial view and then draw in the spacecraft. my family has not owned this property for 46 years and i have not lived in the area for 21 years.I did build a house 10 miles away and lived there for 18 years. i knew the dimensions of that property and used the dimensions to scale this property.\r\n\r\ni was looking at the property where the landing took place and saw something very startling. i could see an outline of a circle in the field exactly where the craft had landed. a lot of things had changed on the property but the field looked untouched. the huge expanse of lawn that was in front of the field was now a grape vineyard but the exact landing site was still there. the farmer was obviously driving over the one side of the circle to tend to his vineyard but the rest of circle is still there.\r\n\r\ni really don't know if this is just a case of other factors causing the existing circle but i find it interesting. the existing circle is 143 feet in diameter. i had originally from memory said the spacecraft was around 100 feet or over and had revised the estimate to 150 feet.\r\n\r\nthe link below shows the circle in the field. the other areas are grape vineyards or apple vineyards and that's why you see the lines running top to bottom. remember this was 47 years ago that this landing took place.\r\n\r\n( link moved to fi box) cms 11/18/11 08:05 cst

momentarily.After the slight turn to the north north east i figured good i will get to see the craft from the backside but then they vanished.Personal theroy invisable cloaking or time portal or

car it and they would be gone.I was courious about the crafts envioment who was pilots,what propultion?,what was it made of ,then scared,realized we were seeing something extra ordinary,never thought i / we would ever see anything out of this world.I and spouse never talked about it until 10 years later ,now i want anyone who will listen take note this was real as it gets.The objects disappeared into thin air.Vanished.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

start from the left of orion���s belt and continued through bottom part of the constellation.  the falling star was incredibly bright and it seemed like it took forever for it finally burn out.

went back outside sat down and noticed a figure sitting at the patio table on the 2nd floor of the condo building across the street.  i found it to be very strange because no one was occupying that unit.  i was staring in disbelief at how this figured looked.  it was sitting at the table like a human would, with its left arm resting on the table and it appeared his legs were crossed (for some reason, i feel as though it was male).  the figure was tall, big, muscular with a shadow/black like appearance and no visible features.  the head was elongated and it was very large.  i couldn���t believe i sat there because of what i seeing  i should have screamed and ran inside but didn���t. i could tell it knew i was there, but i eventually got up and left because it made no movement and i grew scared of what would happen.  as i closed the sliding glass door after going inside, the figure was still there.\r\nthat morning during the light, i tried to determine what could have made that figure on the deck and there was nothing on the deck but a table and 4 chairs.\r\ni will never forget what i saw and will believe until the day i die, that something visited ocean city in the wee

one the middle with 2-4 smaller orange lights in between the end and middle on each side. it moved soemwhat then dropped rapidly like the lights before and then just disappeared - all at once, there was no slow fading or one at a time  -it was like they were all turned off.\r\n\r\ni have lived around an airport all of my life and am very familiar with nav lights etc, these were not like anything i have ever seen before. they were a bright orange steady burning - no pulsating or flashing. and definitely not typical plane lights - there was a plane that appearded to be flying above them traveling to the north wthat was not effected or did not appear to close to them. \r\n\r\ni was freaked out a little - it reminded me right away of some of the ufo type videos i have seen. i called my

pm when this started. she was driving. i'd travelled this stretch of interstate at night twice a week for the past year while traveling to a job site so i feel i have a good sense of what i should and shouldn't see by now.  i was looking out the passenger window when some lights caught my attention.\r\nit was night and we were traveling west at about 73 miles per hour, so my estimation of distances and motion of the object might not be entirely accurate given our speed and direction. the object was to my northwest. it appeared to maybe 1/4 mile (or a little more) north of i-80. i would guess it to have been 200-300 feet in the air. however, like i said, it was night and we were moving so my estimates might be off.\r\nat first i just assumed them to be the lights of a small aircraft. one was red and one was white. nothing i hadn't seen before. there were only two and they were right on top of each other. not blinking or anything. just steady lights. a little odd light placement for an aircraft, but i still wasn't thinking anything abnormal at this point. \r\nthen the top light slowly went out. about two or three seconds later a light horizontal to the remaining light came on slowly. i thought maybe it was a cell tower or something i'd never noticed there before. however, after years of driving around illinois for my job, i feel i have a good handle on light patterns of different types of towers.\r\nwhen i say the lights slowly went out and came back on, remember how those older radio antennae tower would have those slow pulsating lights? the rate of illumination and decay of these lights was much much slower than those types of lights. the lights were also a little brighter and slightly larger than lights one would usually see on smaller aircraft.\r\nnow i'm looking at two lights that are still horizontal to each other. then the original light (the one on the left) goes out slowly. a few seconds later another light appears above the one that is still it. then the original light that was on the top-left comes on again, but this time a different color.\r\nfor the next few minutes these lights would come on and off. any combination of lights would occur. at any moment there would be 1, 2, or 3 lights on, but never all 4. all of the lights would alternate between white and red. however, they would never change color when illuminated. if one came one red or white it would remain that color until going off. there was no apparent pattern as to which lights would come on when or how long a light would stay on.\r\nif i had to guess, i would say that the lights were the part of the same structure or aircraft. although, i never could seen an outline of any type of craft. \r\nfrom my vantage point, the lights appeared about centimeter apart vertically, maybe an inch horizontally. however, in seeing that i can't give a direct distance of the object relative to myself, i don't know how far away the lights actually may have been from each other. if i had to guess, i would say maybe 10 to 15 feet.\r\nduring the entire event, which lasted about 3 to 4 minutes, the lights maintained the shape of a perfect rectangle with the long side running horizontal. this shape never seemed to falter until the object was a good distance behind us. if it were a cell tower or something, i would think the apparent position of the lights in respect to each other would have changed relative to our passing it.\r\nif i were to guess, i would put the object moving westbound very slowly as we did not pass it as fast as other things. it seemed to stay to the northwest of us and north of us longer than a stationary object would have. however, once we passed it, the distance between us and the object seemed to grow more quickly which leads me to believe it then started traveling northeast. however, i never saw it turn. by the time this occurred, with the distance between us my eyesight couldn't make out individual positions of the lights. to my eye, it was just one blurry light changing colors. but that was more because i wasn't wearing my reading glasses.\r\nwhen the object seemed to change and start traveling northeast, the interstate did veer slightly to the right, which would have given the illusion of the object veering that direction anyway. however, the position of the object seemed to over-compensate northeastward in comparison to the illusion of motion a stationary object would have given.\r\ni watched the object until (still appearing to be heading northeast even though the interstate was a now a northwesterly straight section again) it was only a few degrees over the horizon. then we began passing the town of geneseo and i lost sight of it.\r\nduring the event my wife glanced over at it as much as should could. however, we were driving with our twin babies in the back so not crashing won out over her watching it. we decided not to pull over (again out of fear of getting hit while parked and hurting the kids).\r\nthree days later as we passing geneseo heading east back to chicago, i looked diligently in the same area and saw nothing. this leads me to believe it wasn't a tower of some sort. i have also driven past that site many times before, but never have seen anything in that location since.\r\nthere is the gen-park which is a grass airstrip about a mile and a half north of where we were driving that night. however, that strip would most likely only be able to hand single engine planes. this did not appear to be a single engine plane at all. also, a plane would have had to bank a turn to make a change in direction. this object did not appear to do so.\r\ni would love to be able to look at faa records of the area from that time on that night to see if there was any registered aircraft in that location at that time. please let me know how i might be able to go about researching this or see if anyone else witnessed this object. thanks!\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

it is a very peaceful place nine miles from the closest incorporated town and in a county with only 29,000 inhabitants and farming as its major industry.  we do not have any dogs and there is no outdoor light on at night.\r\n     on the weekend of may 21-22, 2011, we watched our grandson receive his master's degree and then helped him celebrate his engagement with all the family in the sacramento, california area one hundred miles from our ranch.  we were not home the night of may 21, 2011.\r\n     monday, may 23, 2011 found me shaking out our bedspread from our upstairs deck after the weekly change of linens.  our three upstairs bedrooms have sliding glass doors that open onto the deck.As i turned my head to look south, i noticed what i thought was a layer of dust kind of floating and after affects of activity on the decking about 30 feet away so i began walking toward the \"dust\" and immediately noticed under by feet some sort of black foot or boot prints about 4 inches long and 3 inches wide with three black lines across them on the charcoal decking and then realized there were many more prints all over the entire deck but they did not go over to our bedroom doors.  the prints stayed fairly close to the deck metal railing about twenty feet off of the ground.  the prints are still there in one area where it appeared \"they\" first stepped on to the deck.  i took and have pictures of them.\r\n     i invited very few friends and relatives to look at the prints over several weeks which did not seem to be going away even though we had several inches of rain.  no one could define what they were but i always felt they were those of an alien or aliens.\r\n     i decided to call our county sheriff in july.  he was very excited when he heard my story.  he came out with his camera and took many pictures and agreed with me that the prints on our upstairs deck had to be that of aliens.  he then proceeded to tell me of many sightings in our county over the years. he said \"they\" appear to be very interested in water and electricity.  i told him about my first sighting on our ranch in 2009 at our irrigation well.  i also told him of the twenty-four solar panels we had installed in november of 2010 to make electricity for our home, shop and well.  he was very interested and thought that could be the reason for the second visit.  our sheriff is very interested in ufos but did not know who to contact about the foot or boot

night - no moon- and as i was driving down the quarter of a mile gravelled driveway on our almond ranch where we live at the above address, i noticed a light in our almond orchard.  i immediately became upset because the almonds had just been shook off the 6,000 trees and were lying on the ground.  whoever was out in our orchard was driving over the nuts and ruining them.  i stopped the car and  listened.  there was no noise.\r\n     the light was very bright and about 40 almond rows south of me heading east and toward the power line which brings electricity to our irrigation pump.  when it got near the power lines, it turned north in my direction and i saw a big light that was larger than an automobile or tractor's headlight.  it kept coming towards me and then turned west toward our irrigation pump about 24 almond rows from me and stopped.  it appeared to be hovering at our irrigation pump as i saw red and white lights making out an oval shape.  there was no sound.\r\n     i turned around in our circular drive to go back west down our driveway and with that they saw me and they were gone!  as i approached road s at the end of our driveway, i saw a tan colored sedan going north on road s very slowly.  my impulse was to overtake the car to talk to the driver to see what he saw what i saw but decided against it.\r\n     i drove back to our home and immediately asked my husband when i got in the door if he had heard any noises such as a helicopter would make and he said he had not.  i also called our nearest neighbor who is located on glenn county road 25 south of our almond orchard and he had not heard anything.\r\n     we have been living on these 80 acres which we own since 1957.  we first had a dairy and flood irrigated pastures and hay fields.  after 32 years, we planted almonds.  we flood irrigated them using the same pump and well that still exists until 2005 when we changed from flood irrigation to micro-sprinkler irrigation which changed a few things in the process of getting the water to the trees at the pump sight. were they interested in that?\r\n     i definitely feel i saw a ufo on our ranch near our pump.  the pump is approximately 300 feet from our house and driveway.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then
