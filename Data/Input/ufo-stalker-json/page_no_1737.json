driving east on i-10, i drive this route 5 nights a week hauling freight from ft. stockton, tx - san antonio, tx.  at about the 340 mile marker i noticed a bright light in the sky, like a large airplane (747) with landing light on, they were shining directly towards me.  in this part of the country there are no large airports, san antonio is 200 miles to the east.  i continued watching the lights thinking that they should be approaching faster than they were if it was a large airplane, the lights seemed to be at an estimate of 2000' above the ground.  i continued traveling at 65 mph coming up a 4-5% grade with hills and highway cut outs occasionally blocking my view from the lights.  as i watched, i thought that the object turned because the headlights faded away.  as i came to the top of the grade i could still see the object and it was closer to me and seemed to be moving 80-100 mph, maybe slower, for the size of it i knew that it was moving but it seemed to be head  hovering.  i just mentioned that i thought it turned but i'm pretty darn sure that they turned the lights off and they went off like stadium lights do, slowly, that's why i thought that it turned, i was still about 3/4 - 1 mile away when this happened.  the skies were clear and the moon was about 7/8 full.  after topping the grade i lost sight momentarily because of the hills and cut outs.  as i follow the highway it curved to the right and started down a 4-5% grade (mm345) and i could really see what it was, a triangle 250-500' to each corner, 1500-2000' above me on my left at a 40 degree angle and about 1/4-1/2 mile away. it had a fairly large light in each corner and a smaller light in the center where there seemed to be a dome on the bottom center.  all the lights were white and steady, no pulsing, and there was no beam being case.  the corner lights were large enough and bright enough that they should have been casting a beam but they didn't.  i couldn't see any of the body of the object other than the possible dome on the bottom.  i'm sure some people will suggest that these lights may be individual objects and i will strongly suggest that all the lights belonged to one object.  i didn't see any windows, hear any noise (remember i'm in a large truck), or see any exhaust.  i had a good visual of this object for about 10 seconds as i curved down the grade.  there were 7 or 8 other vehicles traveling east and west in my vicinity ani d i didn't see anyone stop.  as i continued to drive i thought, \"i've seen one now\".  i don't know if it was military or alien, but i lean towards anti-gravity alien.  i didn't have any fear or shock and i don't think that they were concerned about being seen.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

noticed a really bright light about half a mile in front of me then it went away. so i slowed to a stop on the side of the road and watched a triangle shaped aircraft with very bright pulsating lights on the three ends of the aircraft fly near my car. the lights would stay on for about 2 seconds then go off and in the middle a very bright light would flash and go off almost immediately and this sequence continued. i turned off my radio and shut my car off to listen and watch. this aircraft was completely silent and seemed to blend in with the sky. the only way i noticed it was the star displacement in the sky and the bright lights emitted from the aircraft. the craft was flying very fast towards the direction of my car but slowed when it almost reached my car. it was maybe 20 feet above the treetops and it hovered for a few seconds about 200 feet to the northwest of my car above the tree line then resumed its flight. it made a slight alteration in course to go more towards the north but did not turn completely. i drove home and looked into the sky to see if it followed or i could still see it. i looked to the east and could see its middle light shining but from this point it was considerably smaller and looked like a helicopter search light. i was very flustered and confused so i came home and researched all the possible explanations before i came to the conclusion that it was a ufo. in the morning i looked around the area but there was no evidence that it had been there the night before.   \r\n","distance":"101-500

over my car while driving west, just 15 miles east of kingman az, 11.3 miles as the crow flies, to the kingman airport. \r\ni saw a giant craft that had 6 large rectangle panels on the back end, that were glowing blue white, like plasma engines. it reminded me of  the ���millennium falcon\" from the star wars movies. what first caught my eye was a sparking or flash on the bottom of the craft, as it moved over my car. then i saw two rows of 3 large rectangles, of blue white glowing lights. \r\neach rectangle appeared to be house size. they appeared to be at the rear of the craft as it moved away from me. it was amazing how big this looked to me, i said out loud to my self, \"i hope its one of ours\".  it looked like it was about 1000 feet up above me.\r\n\r\nafter looking through my gas and food receipts i was able to pin down the actual time of my sighting, at 8pm, just one mile east of 970 s blake ranch rd, kingman, az 86401-4546 on the i40. i was driving almost due west on i40 toward kingman az. i had just passed us93 when i saw the electrical sparks through my windshield to my right. it was flying along very slow for a jet and it had a ball of light traveling below it near the ground at the same rate of speed. you can see the ball in the first few frames of the video, but it might be a reflection. \r\n\r\ni fumbled for my video camera while driving, that took me about 20 to 30 seconds. at the beginning of the taping i passed a freeway sign, \"blake ranch rd. exit 1 mile\". i recorded until just after i pass the exit, the craft was to far away, maybe 4 or 5 miles. it would have passed over or near the kingman airport. someone should check with them. there were car lights behind me about a mile or two, i don't know if they saw anything.\r\n\r\nwhen i played the tape later in needles at a gas stop, the cameras time code showed i had traveled one mile in 32 seconds!  no freaking way, i would have had to be going over 100mph. i was going tops 70-75 and my car was packed full of stuff, i was moving to ca. i tested the camera and nothing wrong there. i had a time shift or something?\r\n\r\ni posted the video on youtube, but its just shaky lights due to being hand held. \r\ni have worked on the video and tried to stabilize the lights the best i can. it was far away by the time i got my camera out so you can't see the size the way i did.\r\ni believe this craft was heading toward area 51, after researching the angle of the flight and the city lights relative to its direction. i plotted a straight line from my sighting to the base and its direction of travel. i think its one of ours!\r\n \r\ni also contacted a company that is building plasma engines for nasa and asked them if they had anything that big up and flying around yet. i got no reply. i wrote them again and gave a description and let them know that they must have some competition out there.\r\n\r\n 35���10'19.72\"n 113���46'36.53\"w elevation 4213ft google

driving from little rock, ar on i-40.  \r\n\r\ni was sitting in the passenger side front seat when, in the vicinity of flagstaff az, i noticed two \"brighter than normal\" stars on the horizon north of the road.  the clock on the car said 10:30 p.M. which would have been central daylight time, 9:30 p.M. az time. they were just so incredibly bright i asked my fiance to notice them.  after watching them for a few minuts while driving down the freeway i finally asked him to pull over.  i got out the binocs and we both looked at these things, not being able to tell much about any structure but amazed at how brilliantly bright-white they were, glowing, larger than a star...Sitting there just above the horizon in the twilight with the mountains faint outline below. \r\n\r\nas we were just looking at these things from the side of the road trying to figure out what it was we were looking at, the object on the left (west side) suddenly zoomed across the sky at an impossible speed, stopped and sat in the sky just as it had done when we initially spotted it.  it went from dead still to at least 45 miles away in one second or less.  three witnesses.  \r\n\r\nseconds after, the object that had been on the right (east) started traveling to the east, the opposite direction from the other, at a casual pace.  \r\n\r\nthe left object had absolutely no blinking lights on it.  i think the object on the right might have had what appeared to be a blinking red light.  \r\n\r\nsince we could not believe what we had just witnessed we took off down the interstate in pursuit of this thing.  there was no traffic on this stretch of highway, seemingly in the middle of no where.  so, my fiance floored it!\r\n\r\nwe had no conversation.  we were all stunned.  we topped out at speeds of which i will not admit, trying to catch this object that was right before us. \r\n\r\nwhile flying westward down the freeway yet another event.  another bright thing \"blinked on\" in the sky out of no where and started moving slowly in the direction of the one we were trying to catch.  after a few minutes of watching both of them, the \"blinker\" disappeared.  no cloud cover.  it was a very clear night. \r\n\r\nwe drove down the freeway for a good 45 minutes, \"very quickly\", trying to get on this thing and never got close. i never took my eyes off of it, save the time the \"blinker\" showed up and even then i had one eye on each of the two objects.  we finally lost sight of the object behind some buildings in a small town we had come to, and perhaps some mountains.  \r\n\r\nwe are all into the sciences and know that even physics 101 says no carbon based life form could have withstood that speed without collapsing or imploding.  if someone was driving that thing it wasn't one of us.

and lights fade out. the last time i caught it on video it was lighter and you can make out shiny spheres in the video that would light up a little bit when they accelerated or changed direction abruptly.  too dark to make that out this time but what came out definetly strobed kind of like a plane but different kind of light.  i missed four of them for sure when i turned and ran to get the

i soon could see 5 distinct lights in a v-formation.  the lights were very large, round-shaped, and warm white in color.  the lights were large and contiguous with each other.  no halo or bleeding of one light to the next - very distinct round shaped. the object was flying very low and not changing altitude.  it was traveling south (so it was flying perpendicular to, and towards me).  i turned off my ipod and opened my window and stuck my head out to determine if there was any sound (and hopefully to signal to other people to look up).  i could hear no sound over that of traffic.   as the object got closer - i estimate within 500 feet (< 150 m) total distance from me (horizontal and vertical) - i could observe that the lights were attached to a single silver-gray translucent craft with a body down the center. the craft itself may have been triangular rather than a v.  the object was almost overhead when i noticed the bus was gone.  no one had honked, so hopefully the drivers behind me were as transfixed by the object as i was.\r\n \r\ni slowly started driving - looking for a place to pull-off so i could get out and take a better look.  my husband called on the cell phone at that moment - i thought he had seen it too.   i did not answer the phone (due to distracted driving) but the time of the missed call was 7:13:13, therefore i can be very precise about the time of sighting.  by the time i pulled onto a side street to return his call, i could no longer see the object due to distance and trees obstructing my view.\r\n \r\ni watched the craft for 45-sec to 1-min.  sunset was at 6:33 pm on oct. 17, 2011 in edmonton.  the skies were clear and calm.\r\n \r\nthe ipod i had with me was 1st-generation shuffle, and my cell-phone is dumb.  neither have cameras.  i was therefore unable to take a picture/video.\r\n \r\nif others saw this object i hope that they report their sighting.  i also hope that someone got photos or video -
