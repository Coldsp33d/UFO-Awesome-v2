for satellites i observed an aircraft with 2 solid red lights at a high altitude flying from west to the northeast.  this is out of the ordinary for air traffic in our area, it is mainly north or south direction. i thought it was a military craft but the red lights were behind each other in a straight line in the same direction it was going, not horizontal as on airplane wings. at this point you could cover the 2 lights with a 1 inch pencil held at arms length. i watched it until it went out of sight behind some trees. about 15 seconds later it came out of the trees heading south and quite a bit lower. at this point you could cover the 2 lights with an 3 inch pencil and you could see a white strobe light positioned in the middle of the 2 red lights and above them. i'm assuming that it is positioned on the top of the craft as i didn't see it when it flew directly over me. i could not make out the shape of the craft because it was moonless at this time and there was some steam coming off the hot tub. the strobe light was blinking, but not consistant but in a random blinking.  the speed of the craft was faster than the regular aircraft i see. i watched the craft until i lost sight of it behind some trees. it looked to be traveling at a level altitude. there could have been sound but i had the hot tub jets turned on so i couldn't tell. it flew in a smooth constant manner. i don't know if this is military or not. it has been bugging me since i saw it.  i would like to know if anyone has seen this type of craft and if it could be military. it seemed like it turned and dropped in elevation at a rate that military craft can't but i'm no expert. the date is just approximate.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

pm and about 30 ��� 45 miles north of memphis something out of my driver side window caught my eye. the sky was clear and it was a perfect night to watch stars. i noticed three large, solid, bright lights in the shape of a v. at second glance, there was more going on than just the three lights. there was a cluster of different size and color lights. my first thought was that i must be near a memphis airport. however, none of the objects appeared to be landing or taking off. there was also no sign of an airport below them. \r\n\r\nthe three original lights kept their formation while some of the smaller ones were just moving back and forth. their movement was smooth, but the way they changed directions was odd. i didn���t feel like i was in any danger, they appeared to be busy doing whatever it was they were doing. \r\n\r\ni rolled my window down, steered with my knee, and switched my phone to camera. i checked the view finder quickly and snapped one shot. i checked to see if the camera caught any of the lights and surprisingly saw three lights were in the frame. i looked for a couple of more seconds and kept driving. as i was rolling the window up i noticed that there was a helicopter flying low to the ground and headed in the direction. \r\n\r\nthe entire thing happened in less than a minute and i really didn���t expect much from the picture. when i put it on a computer and blew it up i was in complete shock. i would love to speak with anyone else who may have witnessed something similar near the tn, mo and ar border. \r\n\r\n[email

patience until i have mufons members present to witness this fleet of ufo's that can be seen by the naked eye on any clear night. last summer i tried communicated with one alien of one ufo and the alien litely laser me on my face as i sat down on my folding chair on the beach on jamaica bay howard beach queens new york 11414 near where i live adjacent jfk intntr airport. i spoke to this alien for about an hour then i went home nothing happen. the next day in the morning while i was lying in bed the alien litely laser me on my leg i'm not and i don't anyonewho is familiar to communicate with super-intelligince so my reading so much on the internet of aliens of being either friendly or vicious i just became leary and didn't continue to communicate. so now that why i became a mufon member i like to know if their are any members that can help me to communicate with this fleet of aliens ships that have a changing of the guard on every clear night sky flying out to the east like right over the atlantic ocean. i almost can't wait to have other members witness this happening. i guess i have to put in a report from every clear night that i view these ufo's until other mufons members verify my sightings thank you all for reading this and seeing is believeing gang. julio m barriere p.S. i notice the six questions and this is my first written report on july 14, 2009 like any night i go down to jamaica bay queens ny for years i go fishing in the bay and i witness on any clear night sky all these aliens ships. their follow me up and down the atlantic coastline. the first time i spotted the ufo was in broad daylight a couple of years ago it few by my bedroom window. i called my brother and told him the experience amd he said it impossible only you saw it and no one else in howard beach saw it. it was round with lights on the outer rim flashing the lights on and off. i had another experience when i came back from atlantic city n.J. this ufo just turn its light off and was hovering quietly right over a shopping mall as i was coming out of a pizza joint after i got the bus from a.C.N.J. i just stood in the parking lot looking at the saucer with the lights turn off and no noise for about a minute then went i started to move it move very slow but it was noticable about one to two thousand feet elevation and about the same distance from me. i didn't know what to do so i retire because i know these ufo's are on to me and i'll be seeing them for life it seems. its was obvious a ufo the first time i saw it it flew very low to be identified. i explain number four i don't know how to explain question no. five we live in a dangerous world and mankind is the most vicious most intelligenr animal and these aliens find it hard to deal with us so this is a big gamble and i'm a big highroller i think if these aliens meant any harm to me their would have abducted me and either experimented or mutilated me already i think. question number six myself and these aliens ships don'r lose sight of each other i can't wait till i have members of mufon and other to witness this ufo fleet thamk you for reading this i know even linda moulton howe a journalist

out the window next to his chair and saw a bright light on the northwest horizon. not really thinking anything of it at first because there is an airport over in that direction. and we see planes all the time. then he noticed that it wasn't moving. it was just after 6:00 pm, and already dark outside. that's when he called me to come over to the window and check it out. we are in a high-rise building so we have a pretty good view for miles in the north, west, and south directions. so we sat and watched it for a little while and then i decided to get my phone and record it. we were pretty stunned and amazed. it hovered for the longest time, and every so often would get brighter, then dimmer. it wasn't very high up, and it wasn't too low, it seemed about a few hundred feet above treetop level. occasionally it seemed to disappear when a plane would go by. we were watching it and taking turns looking through the binoculars. to the naked eye, it looked like a bright light about the size of a bb, and you could easily see the light getting brighter and dimmer, and the tiny changing colors, almost like the way a star flickers. whereas on the video, you can't because my low resolution phone camera sucks, and it wouldn't let me zoom in. and i only recorded it for like a few minutes or so. anyway, when you looked through the binoculars, the view was even better. i thought it was a sphere, until i looked through the binoculars. we could see the flat disc-like shape, and the different colors of spinning lights. the object itself was spinning very fast it seemed. clearly not a helicopter. a short time later, another one seemed to just \"pop up\" to the right of it, except a tiny bit lower. that one also acted the same way the first one did, with the spinning lights getting brighter then dimmer. they both hovered there doing the same thing. then a really short time later, the second one disappeared. the first one stayed for a little while longer, then disappeared. i cant give you exact time periods because i'm not sure but i can tell you that we think it started at about 6 pm because we had checked the time when we were watching it and it was just after 6. then just tonight, 11/14/11 it happened again, at 6 pm just after it got dark. i know this because for some reason i was anticipating its return, and i had been looking out the window. except this time it only lasted like 20 or so minutes, and there was only one. i'm not sure if it happened again, because i haven't looked out the window since then. i recorded that one for only less than a minute. it was actually pretty exciting. i just wish we could've got a better view. u just have to keep watching the first video to really be able to see it. and the second one i recorded at the last minute of it, so u can really only see it best at the beginning. i apologize for the bad quality of the videos. i only wish you could see it the way we saw it, and not the poor picture that the camera picked up.   **i tried to upload the videos but for some reason it didn't work. i will keep trying.","distance":"Over One

down to grab a 50lb bag of rice i heard my wife exclaim ...\"whoa\". as it happened, as she said that i simultaneously was turning my sight toward the direction that she was naturally facing. at which point i saw what appeared to be what i thought was a shooting star over head.  the shooting star that zipped by was extremly low. unbelievably low. i put the 50lb bag of rice in the cart, grabbed my iphone out of my pocket....And began recording in the general direction of where it shot towards in front of a treeline. immediately on the iphone i noticed within the trees a blinking pulsating brake like red light turning on and off within the trees. standing near my wife, not sure what it was i brought it to her attention as i was immediately confused as i paned my eyes to the trees i saw nothing....But then back to the iphone theres the light. then several more lights appeared within the trees white, and several were like a road flare or flare gun color and illumination. i grabed two other random building residents through out the event who saw the same thing. i paned the camera around to see what other objects within a close proximity may appear at which point when i moved the camera to the sky directly above 7 blinking lights in the tree line....I saw a white star like object directly above int he sky that was blinking on and off. it was a clear night at that time...So it was blatanly obvious that it was there. it turned on and off...Almost exhibiting behavior like a light that is almost dead and it starts flickering. it did that same thing expect the flickering was slow...But with each...Slow flicker what looked like a faint spec of a white dot materialized into a fully symetrically spherical dot...But the flickering continued...And then what was one dot was somehow now two distinct sepearate dots...Then finally there were three sepearate dots at which point it started gently gliding toward the building at which point i noticed that what was only visible with my iphone...I could now see naturally with my own eyes as well as within the iphone itself. the object formed a triangel with the just the 3 spherical lights whiter than white lights no other form visbible structure wise as inbetween them was blackness. i brought my attention back to the iphone as the object was almost over the building it did something that would perhaps best be viewed on video for effect, but it suddenly had a blurry glow of red around it while simultaneously doing what looked like a vibration (more aptly a shake) then it jolted forward several ??? unknown amount of feet ahead then was back to the normal three dots. then it glided gently over the apt bldng.","distance":"20 Feet or

turn onto rte 302 and was about to go over the bridge spanning the conneticut river into nh. when i was infront of h.O. taylor's chevrolet i repositioned myself in my seat as my back was aching, and when i did so this thing appeared right over me through the windshield. it was symetrical and half an ovoid cut through the center and looked like a shoe heel. i did not see it come or go, it was sort of like in a freeze frame. it was a starry night with no moon, but the starlight was very bright. what i saw was this half ovoid shape outlined in white sparks, like those from a sparkler, and the shape was solid as it blocked out the starlight completely. it was black and i didn't see any lights or windows. i gathered from the direction that the sparks were flying that the flat end of this shape was the leading edge. when i looked at a map later it appeared to have been going in an almost perfect westerly direction. with the speed this thing was going i bet it was over vt and ny states and over the great lakes in a matter of a few seconds. though i had nothing to gauge the size of this thing to my impression was that it was huge, like very huge. there was no sound at all, no boom or anything like that. my car engine died when i saw it. though i was sort of shocked i immediately jumped out of my car and looked to the west and didn't see or hear anything. i stood there for a few seconds then realized it was about 20 below zero and jumped back into my car, the engine started with no problem. i might add that i had bought the car new about six months before this incident,and had no trouble with it. i was not afraid, didn't feel threatened, just was very perplexed and still am. i live in a military operations area and have seen and heard f15s,f16s, transports,and various types of strangely shaped conventional aircraft, etc. at day and night, as have my friends, coworkers,and neighbors. i have also seen, during my lifetime, blimps, helicopters of various types, and hot air balloons.I have also seen a comet,various meteor showers,the space station,the space shuttle, and satelites. i have never seen anything like this ufo before or since. i question whether ets have ever been to earth but i know what i saw. i once told the above to a department head of astronomy at a prestigious university. he looked at me like i had three heads, and very curtly said \"i don't know\" and turned on his heels and was gone in a flash. i might add that i am a professional in good standing in my job and community and don't drink or take drugs.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":33340,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.1524579,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11142011-0009","longitude":-72.0460343,"occurred":792752400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Vermont","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1321311604000,"summary":"Symetrical

directly over my house. it sounded almost as if an extremely heavy wind was coming down right on our home. i then got this terrible feeling and got too scared to get out of bed. i started calling out to my parents who are usually very light sleepers and whose room is only about ten feet away from mine, but they wouldn't respond. i continually yelled for them when suddenly the noise over the house got even louder before suddenly zooming off with a swoosh-like sound. as soon as it zoomed off, my parents suddenly awoke, saying that they only heard me call them once, when i actually called them about fifteen times. i then started shaking from head to toe for some reason. i kept shaking for about ten minutes, i have absolutely no idea why i was so frightened, it was almost as if my body was reacting to instinct or something. my parents then told me to sleep in their room because of the terrible condition that i was suddenly in. i eventually stopped shaking and fell asleep. then, when i awoke in the morning, my parents told me that about 45 minutes after i went to sleep, they were awoken by a strange screeching noise in the distance that seemed to sound similar to the noise that i described. i'm usually a skeptic and i look for logical explanations, but i couldn't find any explanation for the event. it definitely wasn't a helicopter or a jet. the only thing i could compare the noise with is with some type of huge hovercraft. it was especially strange that my parents didn't wake up when i first called them and the reaction that my body had to it. i felt jittery and sick to

out. it usually takes anywhere from two to five minutes for them to show up. i'v been doing this for one year now, ever since i got my first green laser. it was also in the evening around 6:00p at this time of year. by mere coincidence my son pointed to the sky where i had previously pointed the device and that is when we saw our first ufo's up close and just at tree top level. ever since that night i, along with others have witnessed odd things in the sky above my home. things like a flying triangle the size of three airliners and balls of light that come straight down to the ground or shoot perfectly parallel to the ground. great flashes of light and orbs that emerge from some type of portal after the flash. most of the time these objects keep some distance but on occasion they come too close for comfort. also on occasion - well actually quite frequently now , they communicate or react to my initial laser or flash light signal. last night was such a night. i was outside for no more than 2 to 3 minutes when i took my laser and shone a direct beam upwards. as usual, a medium intensity orb appears directly overhead traveling south to north. as usual, i froze. oddly enough they still frighten me even though i'v seen quite literally hundreds of these things since my first sighting a year ago. the orb proceeded as usual at a steady pace, although sometimes they travel at many different rates of speed including, slowing, accelerating, stopping and hovering. i let the orb pass me for a little bit so it would not be directly overhead, then i took my laser and directed a beam directly behind the craft (note: i do not and it is not advisable to train a light beam of any kind directly at a person or craft as this could lead to retinal damage of the pilot and compromise the safety of the craft). as soon as i released the button, the craft responded with an intense beam of white light right back at me. i used to think that they were either coming straight at me or they illuminated so bright that it appeared that they were coming straight at me, but now that i'v been seeing them for a while, i think their just retorting with a white beam of light back at me. immediately after this first orb was out of sight, two orbs, one in front of the other came from the north where the first orb went. again i watched these two orbs pass directly overhead but i did not train my laser until they were away from me, partially because i was afraid and because there was an airliner passing through the line of sight. after i had a clear line of sight i trained my laser to the rear of the trailing orb with the knowledge that if they were some type of human craft, this angle would not allow them to see the light source. immediately, both orbs began to either intensify in luminosity or train a beam of light right back at me. i was so excited because, although i'v been seeing orbs in pairs lately, this is the first time they simultaneously illuminated.","distance":"Over

my eye something brighter and more colorful than an airplane would be at night. i turned my head to the left, and noticed about fifteen or so blinking multicolored lights in the shape of a horizontal oval. i have a wrap around porch that mostly faces the south, and i just stood there and watched this thing for about a minute, and it wasn't moving at all, just completely still. i didn't hear anything, and there was no wind at all that night. if i wouldn't have stopped to watch it, i would have just thought it was like a military jet or something weird, but the fact that this object was completely still and unmoving really freaked me out. so i ran inside and called for my friend who was inside the house, hoping this thing wouldn't be gone when i came back, and her and i just stood on the porch watching this thing, it looked like a flat disco ball. not the silvery mirrored ones, but the ones with all the multicolored lights that sort of pulsate and make you dizzy. the lights were white, yellow, green, blue, and red in color, and they all alternated in an oval shape. there was no particular pattern in which they blinked, but it was like they got dimmer and then brighter, way brighter than airplane lights. the lights were pulsating in an area about the size of a bottle cap, and the lights themselves were only like tiny dots. and i would guess it was about a mile or so away, and around 300 ft in the air. after i went and got my friend, we stood there just saying things like \"what the hell is it? what kind of airplane is it?\". she just thought it was an airplane, she kept saying over and over again, \"it's moving, we just don't see it moving because it's so far away.\" but then it went from being stationary in the sky, to moving super slow in a straight line, and it took it about ten minutes or so to move across the sky. i felt really excited the entire time, i kept thinking that there was no way this was an airplane. my friend denied it was anything spectacular, but she stood with me and watched it the entire time it moved across the skyline. the object then got bright and shot straight up into the sky, and was gone. i felt sort of sick to my stomach, and my friend was really freaked out, because she went inside and drank two entire glasses of water. she said she felt really thirsty. i had this weird feeling of unease, and we were both very shaky.
