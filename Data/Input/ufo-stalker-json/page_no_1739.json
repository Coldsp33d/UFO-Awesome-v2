flying as if they had just taken off.  they were going from very low to higher, but not very high in the sky.\r\ni ran into the house and called for my two sons to come see it- i found this sight to be disturbing and i called 911 i thought perhaps it may be a terrorist event. i was transfered to a non-emergency number and explained what i was seeing and what was being witnessed by 4 adults. i have spent my day today trying to see if anyone else witnessed what we saw- there could be no way we were the only ones who saw that at that time. 7:30 pm is not all that late and the evening was mild. all the lights were going the same direction and there were over a dozen of the singular ones.\r\ni live in a semi-rural area. my home is situated on 2 acres and there are a few small lakes in

(it looks like my mothers old bathtub with feet.) what's even more amaazing is i started to look back at some pictures i took in jan.Of this year and saw several pictures with a lot of 'garbage' but there was a see through misty cloud(tiny) and the shape was like the 'bathtub' i'd just got. i put it on the computer and was able to 'bring it out' of the background.It became a solid craft! you can see it very sharp and what it is made of. although we don't know what the material might be ,it 'looks like' a very thick thick plastic'!!!I really have too much information to write down. on tuesday the 8th of nov. at 6:30 at night i saw a, close down, huge line of lights heading toward me...There's a big story with this but after a while it changed size and then shape and eventually shot straight up into the sky where it became a tiny red dot.It then came over us and the pictures i got were of a green,two white and a red line...First straight lines,..Then wavy lines,..Then in some there were tiny lights in between the lines.I take all these pictures from the same place in my front yard. after seeing stuff so much, i go out and look a lot.I thought they were airplanes but to have ten blinking all around you for a half hour and then taking pictures so i could tell what was a plane and wasn't(and found they 'weren't)i just take everything.They end after a half hour and are gone with 'nothing' left.We have two neighbors plus my husband and myself seeing this stuff but we now have heard of at least ten or more staring to look too.(the 'bathtub' actually looks like the

were flabergasted at the number of pinprick (small star size) objects within our viewing area. they were small but seemed to leave a brighter tail when they darted short distances and some brightened when hovering. we watched for awhile before i convinced my dad (,whom i was visting,) to go get his nikon coolpix 775 camera. this camera only takes 15sec of film at a time and i found the videos easier to see when only doubled from its original size (i even slowed it to half speed.) i took several at dawn and throughout the rising sun and into the afternoon. the sky filled with big puffy clouds and small patches of blue sky, and as the sun rose the multitude of objects not only became more noticable but were obviously manuvuering underneath these clouds and weren't as large or far away as the previous night. with the clouds as backdrop they were clearly defined orbs with definte edges and had a metalic surface almost like dull cast aluminum. when they moved they seemed to have a bluish or grey undefined tail about 3x thier length. we also noticed they would slow, hover, and then occasionly flash. we noticed that at times several orbs would then steadily move toward the first, and sometimes all would manuevering together in formations of as many as 7, or , especialy toward noon, other orbs would flash back, and still other times orbs would drift toward the flash orb who would dart (north/northeast mostly) very quickly out of view or vision with blue tails. though these objects were penciltip in size most of the time, there were so many with such erratic flight patterns, there has to be more witnesses. \r\nthe final aspect, is my father asked several times if they weren't turning off or going dark when they performed these bullet darts out of our sight. i didn't notice any and he shrugged the split second glimpses. however, in one video (the one included) toward the last 4 seconds a larger, darker cigar shape zooms from the top middle of the screen to the bottom right. frame by frame shows what appears to be an erratic flight pattern as well. also visable is 9 or more of the little orbs (one of the best is to the right of the house's roofpoint about 1/3 the screen across). sorry for the poor quality, i found running at 1/2 speed and only double size seemed to work best. loop and look for others and the variety of flight patterns.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path

right  over our property.I told my son to keep an eye on it while i ran inside and got my camera.So, i ran in and got my camera and came back out and was gonna start taking pictures, but my camera was dead. so i ran back inside and put it on charge for like two minutes.Then i came back outside to see if it was still there while my camera was chargeing.It was still there.So, i went back in the house to take my camera off charge.Then i went back outside and started snapping pictures of it.I took like 23 pictures of it.It was just moving all over the place.All of a sudden it fliped over on it side

house. looking at the moon, we both seperately noticed a dim, blue object moving steadily toward the aldebaran(,brighter red star directly below the moon.) thinking it just a satelite, we both imediately stopped and backed up to block the moon with the balcony above. it was then that we noticed another round object heading toward the first when it stopped and the first object shot perhaps a handspan across the sky southeast, fast enough to obviously appear elongated or having a small blue trail, and again hover then move slow. the second object began to quickly drift south then it too darted a short distance. at this point, we both attempted to keep an eye on both objects (which i said were a dim blue). it was then that several objects exactly like these were very obviously moving in straight, steady paths (at different speeds and in different n.S.E.W. directions), hovering, and very visably darting back and forth between the aldebaran and the several bright stars south of jupitar. it was at this time that i noticed a large white, red, and green flickering \"star\" that seemed to be dancing. i first dismissed it as a star but upon closer watch and using surrounding dimmer stars as points it was moving in distinct counterclockwise pattern aprox. half-dollar in width accelerating from drift to spurt to loop to drift to spurt,etc. my dad & i were able to verbally collaborate it's distinct direction and speed from various standpoints as it continued. we both turned our attentions back to the zooming blue orbs after ten minutes or so and noticed another identical object above venus moving west making similiar small circular patterns which disappear over the house. the first dancing object by that time had moved more to the northwest and continued slowly making its way beyond the neighboring houses, all the while continueing its orbital pattern. however it was about this time when we noticed the dusty blue orbs had seemed to dissapate as well

the drive i pointed out how bright the moon was tonight and how high it was in the sky. i pointed out how it made everything in the sky really visable and we began to look at stars. we pointed out some stars, and a few planes. the planes that we saw were all flying westward in their usual manner with normal headlights. we drove around a bend and spotted the north star which is a pretty large and bright star in general. as we came around a corner fully, just around the hill, we spotted a very large bright looking light that was just west of the north star but much larger and much brighter by about 4 times. we both immediately shouted \"whoa! what is that?\" at first we thought it was a star, but quickly ruled that out as to how large and bright it was. as we kept going i kept my eyes on the light never taking them off of it. we noticed that the light was not moving, it was completely stationary. all the other planes and helicopters were moving around the sky, blinking, and lit up in a normal fashion, but this object was hovering and brighter than anything else in the sky. i thought to myself, maybe it was one of those towers for the planes, but there was no tower under the light, i thought maybe it was a helicopter, but as we got closer the lights became more distinct, and started to become a shape, i began to think maybe it was a spot light, but the light never moved. the object was hovering, and as we got close to it it appeared to be in the shape of a rounded triangle, almost like a boomerang. the object had no tail, and no \"wings\". as we kept driving, we started to drive straight for it, and ended up driving almost directly under the object. it stood in place the entire time, hovering. i saw the outline of the object and the lights were directly under the object in a triangle shape. one light then two lights underneath the top light, very bright very white lights all on the bottom, directly in the middle of the object. there were two smaller lights, very tiny, at either end of the object that would blink on and off very slowly in an almost fading type of blink. i saw that there were two lighter grey looking stripes on each \"wing\" or end of the object. the object itself was a very flat black color, no shine or reflections of the lights to the object. i opened the moon roof so i could get a better look at it as we drove under it, we were saying to each other, \"what is that?\" \"why is it just sitting there?\" \"why isn't it moving?\" is it a helicopter?\" \"there is no tail, no wings!?\" i noticed that there was no sound, this object was about as big as a military fighter jet, almost the same looking shape, but no sound, and no movement, and about a mile to two miles above us. as we tried to keep it in view while we drove under it, the driver started to hit the bumps on the next lane, so we both looked forward as she naturally swerved, i quickly looked back and the object was gone. we looked all over the sky, in front on sides, in back, i even jumped in the back seat and saw nothing. the sighting itself was exciting, neither of us were fearful or upset in anyway, we just found ourselves very curious and excited to see more.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

white light moving horizontally, from west to north, just above the tree line. i thought it odd that it was so low and close, yet i heard no noise. my view was partially blocked by a few leafless trees, so i could not be sure if the light was steady or blinking. it moved with a steady velocity, neither slowing nor speeding up. it was moving towards dense forest, and would soon be blocked from my vision, so i walked down my driveway to observe for as long as possible. i watched it until i could no longer see it. oddly enough, i did also see a shooting star just west of the light, while i was standing in my driveway. this was an interesting comparison to me, because what i'm reporting was definitely not a meteor. i do live about 30 miles from an airport which used to be the site of an air force base and also about 10 miles from a smaller airport. i have seen every sort of aircraft imaginable, but nothing like this. i felt the need to report this because it was so odd, low, close and soundless.\r\ni reported this on another site, but it doesn't get updated as often as this one. came here looking to see if anyone else had reported anything similar around the same date.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
