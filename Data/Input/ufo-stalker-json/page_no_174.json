white, that almost hurt my eyes to look at even though the objects were miles away. i stayed and watch the objects and filmed them on my phone  and what i was specifically looking for was some kind of maneuver or behavior from the from the lights that would rule out any terrestrial craft. i am not sure if i was able to spot such a maneuver. what i did see however was that the objects would change colors and pulse, they would hover in one place for extended periods of time, minutes, and then slowly move away. the object would come into some sort of formation and then disperse, leaving one or two behind which would then brighten. they would also swap places. frequently one of the dimmer lights would pass directly next to one of the other ones before brightening again. i was distracted by my daughter who had woken up to go to the bathroom and by trying to get decent video footage of it. i have several clips of footage that i would love to submit to anyone who could do a bucket or found

the files the next day, i found that it was also in one of the milky way shots.  it looks vertical in all the shots i took, but when i saw it, it was horizontal. crescent shaped and had a very small tail(?) in the centre.  i don't know what else to call it. but it was just notable not very large.  because i had a small lens on and it was almost gone, i didn't get any really good shots, but if they are enlarged you can see it, and it is better in the milky way shot even if it is farther away. i was disappointed that i didn't get a closeup, but i was pleased to see it.  i have raw files of

through large living room windows and glass front doors, so i can see the street in front of my house. \r\n i awoke to see a being, that had a round head and round black eyes. it looked like a charlie brown character, and it was starring at me from the street looking directly at me. i turned my face away and moved to the side of my mattress that was on the floor and hid my head behind the pillow, so i could hide myself and peek over the pillow.\r\ni looked and it was still there and it started floating toward my house starring at me, its human form was dressed in white. then i saw car lights coming down the street, and i thought, \"well now its going to get run over\". the being turned into a grey rectangle and as the car drove through it, it disappeared for a moment and reappeared, still starring at me...I was scared and thought this being may hurt me because its intense stare, and i experienced the gray rectangle march 2013 abduction series of events. the only noticeable feature i could see on its face was 2 wrinkles on either side of each round, black glossy eye. a half sheer curtain on the front windows was like a vail, right below his eyes the whole time...Even when he floated from the other side of the street up to the window, so i couldn't see a mount or nose.\r\n\r\ni got up quickly and went to the kitchen to get the video camera monitor that views the street and front porch. i turned it on and saw 3 lights, like in a wide base triangle. top lite was half blue and half white. the light was light a crystal radiating, glistening, exactly cut in half blue on top and white on bottom, it was very radiant...The 2 other lights were tear drop canister's each emitting a beam of white light....One in front and one in back...\r\n\r\ni thought that's not a car, it doesn't have a red tail light. the tear drop head and tail light looked like police search lite type of shape and had a ring just behind the light. i didn't see the round headed being anymore, and the craft slowly hovered down the street to the west, out of site of the video monitor screen. i didn't see a craft, just the lights to whatever it was attached to, i don't know. i returned to bed.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

which was part of a huge federal complex in austin, tx.  we both looked up and saw a small flat black probe type of flying saucer which was flopping gently thru the air on a definite trajectory over the federal complex, less than 100 yards over us, we watched it as it flew directly over us and on towards the fed complex.  my first thought was it looked like a probe, but even more surprising was my thought of how unremarkable it was. i've always been a ufo enthusiast and to have that thought was quite strange for me, even looking back now so many years, it still feels literally unremarkable.  i asked my friend; \"should we call bergstrom?\"  bergstrom was a local afb and also had reservists there.  she remarked; \"no, it's not a big deal\".  my thoughts were; 'yeah, not a big deal - it's just a small flat black, perfectly smooth little flying saucer which isn't even big enough to house a person, let alone be dangerous, and seems to be just motoring along.'  so i silently agreed with her that it was not a big deal and getting berstrom on the phone, to explain it would have sucked - i mean literally sucked, i imagined the whole men in black scenario and my brief consideration to alert bergstrom to it, was exactly that brief and barely considered.  honestly i just didn't even consider reporting it - it was literally that unremarkable.  \r\n\r\nthe craft or probe, whatever it was, was a small flat black sombrero shaped object that flopped thru the air, but on a definite trajectory.  i actually worked at the austin automation center at the time as a computer programmer, and i usually went on walks twice a day, sometimes with my friend valerie and sometimes not. i noticed it was flopping thru the air on a trajectory over the federal complex.  as far as ufo sightings go, i'd have to say it was pretty boring and afterwards (many years actually) i thought; 'are you effing kidding me... my first and perhaps only ufo sighting and it's some boring small black saucer thing, that's hardly worth mentioning.\"  \r\n\r\ni just rejoined mufon, so i guess i'm feeling obligated to mention my one and only ultra dull experience.  at least that i consciously know about.  but i do know one thing, i saw it and so did my friend valerie.  we mentioned alerting bergstrom to it's presence and then dismissed the idea almost immediately.  \r\n","distance":"21-100
