States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was a rather cold evening in mid november 2004. my father had recently become interested in telescopes and had purchased a few over the past weeks. this particular november night we had two of the telescopes out in my parent���s front yard in alvin, texas. one was a new 5 inch refractor telescope that my father had just purchased and the other was an 8 inch dobsonian style telescope that i had preferred using for my leisure after becoming comfortable with it over a couple of weeks. alvin is south of houston and from our front yard the light pollution was enough to cause some frustrations when trying to find various objects; however, one reason i preferred the dobsonian was because i could rather easily pick up some gas formations such as the nebula in orion (m42). \r\nit was between 12 and 1 am and the telescopes had been placed outside a few hours earlier to allow for acclimation to the weather. my father had been fooling with setting up his new telescope while i had already gazed at m42 and become bored. i was looking through the viewfinder and traversing the skies when i picked up my ���ufo.��� even through the viewfinder of a fairly powerful front yard telescope the object appeared just as a distant star would; as a tiny speck of light. the object had a greenish-white color that didn���t sparkle like a starts burning gases would. it appeared just as a planet would to the naked eye; as a constantly bright light. the objects intensity was only outdone by the star sirius.\r\nmy picking up of the object must have been much by sheer luck and accident because it was moving across the night sky in an unusual pattern. as soon as i located the object at roughly due east i began following its movement in a circle around the night sky. it is this movement that made the object peculiar to me.  i will explain it like this: imagine tying a ball to a string and spinning it around in a counterclockwise fashion above your head. the ball will rotate the central point of your body on the ground in a circle whose circumference is dictated by the length of the string. this is how the object moved. imagine that the center point was where i was standing on the ground looking at this object through the telescope. the object moved in a circle across the night sky over my head as if tethered to a string. again, i caught the object in the viewfinder at roughly due east. the object moved at a consistent speed and altitude around the sky in a circle first south, then west, next north, east again���and so on. i followed the object at least six times around the same path in the sky. if a pencil had been taped to the bottom of the telescope and a paper under it i would have drawn a perfect circle on the paper with the motion of the telescope. i would estimate the telescope was at between a 70 and 80 degree angle to the ground.\r\nat first i thought i may be tracking the space station. however, i quickly discounted this because it is my assumption that an object in orbit would not create such a path. although i could possibly pick up an object in orbit i would have lost it over the horizon as it continued its path. this object was not orbiting the earth it was creating a giant perfect circle (as much as i could tell) in the sky above me. \r\nthere are two large airports in the houston area; hobby is a hub for commercial flights, and depending on wind conditions we would frequently get aircraft in pattern that would fly over nearby. in fact, on this night the 737s were coming right across our sky. these planes could be picked up in the telescope by chance, but they moved so fast (even in landing patterns) that it was impossible to keep them in view through the telescope. i had even managed to pick up cessnas and similar aircraft, but because of the power of the telescope in question these too were nearly impossible to track because they would nearly take up the entire view finder when you did lock on to one. i���ve also observed plenty of meteors through the very telescope in question, and these objects do not represent the type of movement i witnessed. \r\ni lost the object when i attempted to get my father to track it. it would move through the entire 360 degrees of its motion in about 45 seconds, so i lost it and wasn���t able to reacquire it when my father passed on taking a look. at the time i thought nothing of it. like i said, i assumed i was looking at the space station or a satellite; however, after some time passed i began to question this assumption based on my understanding of how these objects orbit the earth. i am admittedly ignorant of the details of how manmade objects such as satellite orbit the earth, but i was confident that even if these objects were capable of the flight path i observed they would be moving too fast to even begin to be able to follow around the sky for several minutes. keeping the object in view was taking some concentration and careful adjustment that was possible only by the design parameters of a dobsonian telescope. had it been any other telescope i am confident i would have lost it early on. \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

thought i would have a better look but when i got up there the object was nowhere to be seen. the thing that scared me the most was i looked up to the north and could clearly see the moon up in the

reason i did not entirely filled in the form is because i didn't understood everything, like i don't know how much inches a football or basketball is and couldn't find it on google :p plus english is not my language nor did i follow english class.\r\nand i don't know which month or day it occured but i had to fill something in, rest assured it did happen in 1996 yet i think that's pretty irrelivant \r\n\r\ncopied from my facebook, it's basically a very detailed report.\r\n\r\nwtf flying glassy orbs containing orange smoke!?\r\nhere's the story;\r\nwhen i was 8 years old i had my room shared up the attic together with my little brother ([name removed/cms/tg]). though he would probably deny what happened that very night, i can assure you anything you're about to read has truly happened.\r\nhow it happened and why i do not know yet it was so fascinating and supernatural that i still remember that day as if it were yesterday.\r\nthe reason why i did not share this with anyone else (excl. close friends) is because noone would actually believe me until recently this topic came up when i was speaking to my other (older) brothers ([name removed/cms/tg]) his girlfriend ([name removed/cms/tg] something something) who told me her mother actually saw the same thing, coinsidently she was also 8 years old when it happened and she also remembers that moment as if it were yesterday.\r\nthere was no doubt, she described it to me exactly how i remember it, in short; glassy orbs the size of a regular football containing orange smoke and making a humming sound.\r\nnow onto the real deal.\r\nthe attic is separated by a vertical wooden beam construction in the middle and on each side of the crooked walls there are a few other horizontal beams in the middle separating the walls in two, now if you got all of that, that means that i have 8 seperated wall sections which are covered in some kind of white carpet.\r\nme and my lil brother (who was 3.5 yrs old at that time, hence i don't blame him for denying it and not truly understanding what happened that night, it's a shame though) were sleeping when we both woke up around the same moment from a rather loud humming noise, i coudln't and still can't compare it to anything i've ever heard \r\nwhen i opened my eyes the first thing i noticed was that the entire room was illuminated by a bright orange glow coming from the northern part of the attic and a strange noise coming out of nowhere, our beds were positioned next to eachother in the souther part.\r\ni quickly noticed my brother was already hiding crying under his sheets screaming at me to make them go away, when i looked back at the light i saw 5 (damn or was it 6?) of those orbs floating below the ridge of the ceiling (where the two walls come together).\r\non my knees i crawled to the end of my bed and got a very clear view of the orbs as i was just 2 meters away from them, i was so scared but i had to protect my younger brother so i stood up and spread my arms as wide as i could and shouted; leave us alone, what happened next was even more extraordinary.\r\nthe orbs vanished into the walls(more like getting absorbed into the walls), half of the orbs into the eastern upper part and the rest into the western upper part, as they did they made a strange sucking sound also incomparable to anything else and when they all vanished the entire upper parts illuminated and the glow was so bright it stretched out about 2 meters on each side towards the other side, the weird part was that the light did not blinded me as it did not illuminate the rest of the room nor was it bright to look at from my point of view.\r\nthen the light slowly started to shrink until it completely vanished.\r\nand that's the whole story.\r\ni've looked all over the internet but anything i found about orbs is rubbish and a lot of people even though they never saw one say they can't be real, this really saddens me.\r\nthere's loads of discussions around it though but people tend to say they are other lights such as chinese candles and any pictures i've come across are bullshit, i wonder are they really that rare, howcome steph her mom saw them as well? i'm sure there's other people out there who witnessed such event and i really would appreciate it if anyone else that has any legit intel on this issue would share it with me even if it's not your own, thanks. i hope you enjoyed the story and goodnight (jebus it's 5am)\r\n\r\nup until this day i hate myself for making them go away so fast, why didn't i touch them? why didn't i try to communicate with them? they did almost instantly vanish when i asked (insisted) them to go away... why am i so *** damn curious, argh!\r\n:(\r\n\r\n i forgot to mention the \"glass\" which contained the smoke was a perfect round shape and around 1cm thick, and the orange smoke inside it was constantly moving. hotdamn it still makes me shiver.\r\n\r\n and any light in the room and coming from the walls had the exact same color as the smoke. thanks fb for and edit tool /sarcasm\r\n\r\n mispelled 'an' -_-","distance":"20 Feet or

front of my house at about 0400, as is usually the case, i looked up for the moon and made sure all the stars were in their places and immediately saw 3 points of light, forming a triangle, not at home. it was northeast and slightly above a 45 degree angle from the horizon, apex pointing northward, toward pleasanton/livermoore. the triangle took up about 1/10 of the northeastern quadrant. if it was a single entity it was huge. but it did appear to be simply 3 points of light. i don't look up with intent to spot a ufo. it's simply a habit of appreciating the stars and moon on clear nights. so i'm quite familiar with them. this trio was a huge red flag. i have purposely tried to spot them again, scanning the area 2-3 times a night since then and nothing even comes close to resembling them. it may not sound like much to most but this was so wrong to me that it raised an alarm. i've never seen a ship or solid object of any sort before but, besides this trio of lights, have witnessed 2 slightly unusual events in the last 1 1/2 to 2 years. in the same area of sky what appeared to be \"shooting stars\" shot at tremendous speed in a southerly direction right above, and parallel with, the mountainous horizon adjacent to milpitas/san jose. not too alarming...Except they weren't on a downward trajectory. they shot straight as an arrow south until reaching the horizon in a matter of about 2 seconds. i didn't think it noteworthy, even though i'm aware of the research facilities in the livermoore area, until now since my \"trio of lights.\" i very much appreciate this being taken

made vehicle - the reason? it appeared underside to be made of matt black panels, bolts were clearly visible and the craft made a fairly noticeable rumbling noise as it went overhead - in my mind, if the craft was extraterrestrial, then i highly doubt it would be made of nuts and bolts and i assume alien tech would of done away with such a crude sounding propulsion system.\r\n\r\nanyway i will explain the sequence of events the best i remember.\r\n\r\nit was roughly mid morning very good visibility, my mate lived next door bar one house away from mine and i was popping around to his to see what he was up to for the day - he lived with his parents and had his own room downstairs on the side of the house. i went round the side and knocked on his door, a moment passed and he answered, as im talking to him i hear this odd noise - a sort of low pitched rumble - i look up and something black and fairly large flew over - i didnt see the whole object then, but my heart was pounding - i said to my mate, come quick! there���s a f*cking ship flying over your house (sorry for language) , he said wait while i put my boots on...Lol i thought, i dont think its going to wait for you to put your boots on... i ran back around to the front of his house to see this fairly large craft appear from the front of his house - i was stunned, i remember it flew very very low indeed - i also remember thinking to myself - try to take in as much detail about the crafts structure as i could, this is why i remember the bolts, the matt black colour of the underside and the lights - there were three circular white/yellow lights - one in each corner of the craft and two small red lights in the middle. there were no markings at all, no numbers, symbols etc - just plain matt black - i also remember thinking that it was a perfect triangle - no cut away at the rear - just as if you had drawn a triangle as is - no flaps, no vents - nothing - as the craft flew away from me (must of been travelling around 20-30mph) i remembered looking at the back trying to identify some sort of engine, but there was nothing visible except a black space - no exhaust was visible either or trail. \r\n\r\nthe craft continued to head in the direction i had first seen it and looked like it was heading in the direction of liverpool airport. \r\n\r\ni also remember that at the time of the event - im not sure if it was after or before, but there had been a flurry of sightings of a similar (if not the same) craft all over merseyside - in fact there were pictures in the local paper (southport visitor) of the ship being sited over meols cop school playing field very similar to what i had seen.  i will say this, in all my research on this, i cant say ive actually seen anyone see this craft as close as i did ��� the images in the media usually show the craft very high up at night ��� this was very low and in broad daylight.\r\n\r\n\r\ni dont know what help any of this will be - if any at all, but at least ive told someone.\r\n\r\ni suspect this to be some sort of terestial craft.\r\n\r\ni can provide a drawing but other than a triangle with lights in each corner and two small red lights in the middle - there's not much to gain.\r\n\r\nlet me know if you require it.\r\n\r\nplease also note that the date of the event is a total stab in the dark - i cant really remember what month / year it was specifically (i know thats not much help - sorry) all i can say is it was at least spring - maybe summer as it was a clear warm sunny morning.","distance":"21-100

told. i have told several people about the encounter the past five years after seeing so much about ufo���s on the history channel. i figured it was a more acceptable time to tell my story.\r\n\r\nit's unique to me because i have never heard a story about seeing a ufo at the very beginning and leave the way this one did. i have never seen another ufo quite like this. i have seen a satellite, which did nothing but go across the sky at night. i think i saw a ufo last year, but it could have been a plane and it went by very fast. but this ufo was too close and too technically advanced that i knew that it came from another world and i was probably somewhat in a state of shock- unable to really think-just observe it. we also live about 30 miles from columbus air force base in mississippi and at that time there were a lot of fighter jet training going on (basic not advanced) and sonic booms were almost daily.\r\n\r\ni was about 10 years old in the summer of 1968 (i think that���s the year) in rural mississippi. my cousin (xxxx xxxxxx) was visiting and we were both sleeping in a single bed, but xxxx was taking all the covers and kicking me. at about 2:00 am i was wide-awake. it was a very clear summer night and the stars were numerous. after looking at the stars for a few minutes, it looked as if one was falling or a ���shooting star���. but, something very unusual happened; the ���star��� quit falling! then the light, which is all i could make it out to be, slowly made its way down moving to the left (south) and down until it leveled out and came straight for our house. very much like a helicopter would do, but with no sound. in an instant there was this huge object, which i will call a ���space ship��� because of all the detail i could see, was hovering in our front yard. it was ���saucer-shaped���, or like one saucer on top of another, but not as bright as it was when in flight. the upper half of the craft seemed to have rectangular port holes and a lot of light was coming out of them. it was about as long as a school bus and close enough that i could hit it with a rock. it just stayed in one spot for a moment, and then went over the house- not making one single sound. my first reaction was to go tell mama, but when i got up to go tell her i thought she might think that i was crazy. i then went to use the bathroom. i looked out the back (bathroom) window and did not see anything. when i got back to bed, i looked out the window again and in just a few minutes the ufo went back over the house slowly, but a little higher than before and still with no sound and flew west with very little elevation, about as high as a helicopter would fly and slowly made its way up to a very high altitude and then went straight up at a tremendous velocity as fast as it had come down and disappeared in just a moment.\r\n\r\ni told everyone in my family the next morning about it and i was surprised that they all believed me. my cousin wondered why i did not wake him up, i had tried, but he was the sleeping dead. i should have tried harder, looking back, of course.\r\n\r\nthis seemed to happen all in about 5 minutes, but after thinking about it over the years it seemed very odd that visitors would come from so far away and leave so fast. i use to think that maybe they went behind the house to the barn and took a cow or calf, but no cattle were missing. now i think i may have a loss of time due to some force on the ufo and that possibly they may have done something to one of my sisters, who lived upstairs ages 14, 15 and 18. my sister aged 15 at the time, has never had kids.\r\nthis is the story i submitted to the ufo chronicles on 1-5-08","distance":"21-100

these must have been air force jets scrambled from march afb to rid of the ufo. as the jets started to get closer the ufo lost it's glow and turned into off-white maybe silver color with some lights
