listed incident without expressed written approval/consent by me.  any person(s), or company(s) reproducing or re-enacting the below listed events without my permission will be held to answer in a court of law. the use of my name or any identifying information about me or my family is not allowed unless written permission is issued by me.    \r\n\r\nwe had moved into our new whittier california home in july of 2000. our residence sits close to the top of a hillside community three blocks from a fenced off mountainous area to the north of our residence.  the incident i���m sharing took place three months after we moved in approx around october 11th, 2000. also i feel i should note that somewhere to the north east of our residence inside the above mentioned wild uninhabited area is an old oil drilling facility that at the time of the incident had been dormant for many years according to local neighbors. presently there is a local political and social debate taking place regarding the reopening of the drilling facility. i was told that at this time tests and surveys are being conducted up in that previously abandon drilling area. there is activity taking place in the form of helicopters flying in and out of the area at all times of the day and night. i know the oil drilling has not been approved yet so i assume the activity is due to environmental study or site preparation in the case of a yes vote on its reopening. but in october of 2000 there was no activity in the mountain area.\r\ni arrived home late from work on the night in question at approx. 2315 hrs to find my two young children asleep in their respective bedrooms and my wife asleep in our room which is at the very rear of the house. i checked on them and without changing out of my shirt and tie. i went to the living room and began to watch tv. the living room was dark, except for the light of the television. the only lights that were on in the entire house were that of the kitchen located, based on my sitting position in the living room, directly at my one o���clock as well as the laundry room light that is next to the kitchen. the local news was towards the end of its broadcast as the weather and sports reports is what i was able to view. it was then the incident began. \r\ni heard a distinct rustling taking place in the kitchen, like the noise made when one is opening a potato chip bag that had been rolled shut and clipped for a while. the noise caught me off guard because i was the only person awake in the house. from my chair i could look down the hallway to the bedrooms and would have seen if anyone had gotten out of bed and walked to the kitchen. besides the kids at this age never woke up after falling asleep and if they had stirred awake i would have heard them get out of their beds and they surely would have called out for me or my wife. my view of said hallway was unimpeded and from my sitting position in the living room was directly at my eleven o���clock. my heart raced as i knew none of my family members were actually in the kitchen. i became more alarmed as the rustling lasted a very long five to six seconds. i was in total belief that someone was in our kitchen. the noise was clear, slow and deliberate and there was no doubt that it was coming from inside our home and specifically from our kitchen. i was frozen.\r\ni blurted out ���who���s up?��� for some reason, but there was no answer. the rustling immediately stopped i assume as a reaction to my verbalization. i was certain someone was in our home as my senses went wild. my hair on the back of my neck and arms stood up and i felt a burning sensation down my spine. in very stern and aggressive voice i blurted out again, ���who���s up?��� i was frozen in my chair, i prepared for a physical confrontation. i prepared to defend my family. i thought of securing a weapon and quietly as i sat in my chair took off my belt to use the belt buckle as a striking tool. i slowly began to stand and it was then the electricity to my home turned off. the tv and both lights in the kitchen and laundry room abruptly turned off. the house was completely dark and without power. my first thought was that the intruder(s) cut the electricity to aid there activity. i was in full red alert as i was certain i had a home invasion situation on my hands.\r\ni stood and quickly walked to the kitchen belt buckle in hand prepared for a life or death struggle. i planned on grabbing a knife the first chance i had. the soft moonlight that spilled in from the kitchen window illuminated the kitchen slightly. as i turned the corner from the living room into the kitchen i saw nothing, no one. i did not hear footsteps of someone retreating away from me or out the laundry room door or to the rear of the house. i quickly confirmed the laundry room door was shut and locked. i realized i needed to clear the house room by room. could have the intruder fled down the hallway as i rounded the corner from the living room to the kitchen? possibly, but not very likely as i would have heard such activity. i armed myself with a knife and a flashlight and went down the hall to clear the rooms. my son���s room was first. he was dead asleep. i looked under his bed and in the closet while keeping an ear out for any noise in the hallway behind me or any other areas of the house i had not yet cleared. i moved onto the next child���s room and found him dead asleep as well. i cleared the room as well with no signs of anything out of the ordinary.\r\nthe children���s bathroom is what i cleared next, nothing out of place. onto the master bathroom witch is connected of course to the master bedroom. the master bath room was clear. as i began to exit the master bathroom i was moving slowly and listening for any noises in the house. i was at the threshold of the master bathroom entering the master bedroom. at the threshold i was approximately 9-10 feet away from the foot of our king size bed that sits directly in the middle of our bedroom. once again i was 9-10 feet away from the foot of our bed. i was startled by what i saw next. my wife who had been asleep during the entire incident to this point was oddly sitting upright on her side of the bed. i did not notice if she had been sitting up as i entered the master bath seconds prior. nevertheless she was sitting erect and this caused me to stop my gait immediately. i was now one foot past the master bath threshold standing in my bedroom, once again approximately 9 feet away from the foot of the bed. she then whispered in a perturbed tone ���why were you standing over me?��� remaining still i responded, ���i just walked in the room, i wasn���t standing over you.��� she replied whispering and even more upset, ���someone was standing at the foot of our bed looking down on me, it woke me up, i know what i saw!��� my heart raced again as i placed my index finger of my right hand to my lips urging her to be quite. i cleared our bedroom as my wife sat in the bed with the blankets up to her nose. the master bedroom was now clear. the only place the intruder could be is in the last room of the house, the office! i shushed my wife again not having time to share all that had transpired and deliberately set out to clear the office.\r\ni cleared the office in a few seconds finding nothing. i came back to the master bedroom and advised my wife to get up out of bed and to follow me. she tried to turn on a lamp and i advised her that the power was out. she hurriedly followed me as we stopped in to check on each child as we made our way back to the living room. i also cleared all the rooms again as we moved forward through the house. once in the living room i asked her to describe what she saw at the foot of our bed and she could only convey that it was a tall dark figure and that she thought it was me. i reiterated that i was at no point at the foot of the bed and that i had just then walked into the master bathroom and began to exit said bathroom when i noticed her sitting upright. it was then i was able to describe to her all that had happened to me the past 10 minutes in short but concise detail. she asked several rational questions about the incident and i reconfirmed the points she had inquired about. she lit a few candles and decided to call the power company to see what was wrong with the power. \r\ni peered through our large living room window and did not notice anything out of the order. the one street lamp that sits on the opposite side of our street, three to four houses east, was on as was the power to the residents across the street as i could see a few porch lights on. i opened the front door and walked out onto our porch. i had a strange heavy feeling on my chest and felt uneasy. i found this to be odd as i had calmed down completely from the earlier night events. as soon as exited our front door i felt anxious and edgy for some reason. i noticed that the power was out on all the residences on our side of the street, the north side as it were. there were no porch lights on our side of the street and that was not the norm.\r\ni came back in the house and told my wife that i was going to take a walk up the street to see if the power to the residences north of us was out. she went ballistic. she told me under no uncertain terms that she did not want me to leave her and the kids alone in the house especially after the events i had told her that transpired minutes earlier. she grabbed my right arm and begged me to stay in the house with her. i would not be denied. it was as if i was compelled to go outside and take a look around. i felt like i was being drawn to investigate the night���s activities further. what happened next was unbelievable.\r\ni walked down my residence walk way and stood in the street for a second or two. there are no sidewalks in our neighborhood so i walked w/b on the street under the cover of the huge 50 year old fichus trees that line the street. i reached the corner which is two houses west of my home. i looked north bound and saw that several porch lights were on telling me that the power was not out in all the residences to our north. i walked north on california street about half a block and a strange eerie feeling came over me again, i felt scared for some reason. i turned around and walked south bound back to my street. i turned left and headed back east bound towards my house. the fichus trees on the block drop theses dark burgundy berry type pods and they were all over the street. if you step on the freshly dropped berries you will inevitably bring them into the home as they stick to the bottom of ones shoes. the berries will stain the carpet as we had found out on a prior occasion. i was looking down, to avoid stepping on said berries, as i walked back to the house using the faint moon beams that were shining through the fichus trees monstrous branches. my gait could be likened to a person hoping stones as they cross a shallow creek attempting not to get wet. i began to feel slightly more relaxed as i got closer and closer to my house. i glanced up and noted the moon light that was creeping and dancing through the branches and was thankful it was lighting my path on the street. i looked back down careful not to step on the previously described berries when suddenly the entire street was lit up in an extremely bright white light. \r\ninitially i stopped walking and was dumbfounded as to where this light was coming from. i looked to my left and right simply taking in the scene that had changed in a second. i then looked up into the trees and observed intense white beams of light piercing through the branches of the trees every chance they could. the light was intense and occasionally i would need to squint because of the brightness. i was frozen as my mind was unable to explain the sudden appearance of the light seemingly out of nowhere. as i continued to peer up at the tree and the light, i could tell that the light source was of course above the trees and was slowly moving in a southerly direction from the mountainside. the light was so bright i couldn���t accurately tell what the height of the light source was or what object or vessel was emitting the light. all i could tell was that it was moving slowly southbound and it was directly over my house now. if i had to estimate the light sources height i would have to say less than 250- 300 feet. less than a football field would be my most educated guess.\r\n the light continued to move slowly southbound at what appeared to be approximately 5-7 mph at best. the light was now directly over the middle of the street and the light beams continued to shine through the trees branches down onto the street. i remember looking down at the street again to marvel at the brightness of said light.  i took several steps forward keeping the light source in my vision at all times. i found myself not under the protection of the trees any longer. i was now in open space in the middle of my street almost directly in front of my house. the residence directly across the street does not have a fichus tree in the front yard and this allows an unimpaired view of the sky looking southbound. the light source was now more or less over the house directly across the street from my residence. \r\nthere was no sound emitting from the slow moving light source. no chopping of blades such as you would hear from a helicopter. there was no jet engine or propulsion noise present. there was no green or red aviation flight lights present as well. the light source was too low to the ground to be any craft i have ever seen. suddenly the light accelerated forward and parallel to a speed i can only describe 10-15 times faster than that of a meteor racing downward and across the sky heading entering our atmosphere. \r\nthe light source travelled an immense length air space in less than one second. if i had to estimate the distance it travelled i would have to say approximately 30-40 miles in the previously described one second of time. at the time of its parallel acceleration not a sound was emitted from the light source, it remained absolutely silent in its forward motion and the light became smaller in size almost instantly. the light source size was that of a grape from the position i continued to observe it from.  \r\nthen the light source took a vertical trajectory, comparable to a child sliding ���up��� not down a slide. the light source during this upward trajectory increased speed and was traveling even faster than it had during its initial parallel acceleration. the size of the light source at its last visible observation as it turned upward was now that of a small pea.  suddenly it was gone, simply disappearing out of sight and, what i believe to be, out of our atmosphere.  \r\ni was unable to move, i was frozen staring at the area of the sky where the light source once was. my heart was beating fast and loud. i felt sick to my stomach. i had no idea what i had just witnessed but i knew in my heart that there was no way that source of that light was from anything on this earth. the speed was greater than anything we as a civilization can possibly have at our disposal.\r\ni walked up to the front door of my house and my wife opened the door. she had the portable phone to her ear and was on hold with the power company. she slowly removed the phone from her ear dropping it down to her side. she was looking at me with a facial expression of concern. she said ���what���s wrong with you, you look like you seen a ghost?��� i stared at her without saying a word. she said ���your pale, get in the house, what���s wrong?��� my response was ���i just saw a ufo. i can���t explain what i just saw.��� i asked her if she had seen the light over the house and she advised that she had not and that she had been in the den on hold with the power company. it was then that the power company employee came on the line and advised my wife that there was a small pocket of outage in our area. my wife asked her if she knew why and the operator advised that she wasn���t sure why. my wife asked how long before the power would be back on and the employee stated ���we need to find something wrong before we can fix it and right now we don���t show any blown transformers or downed power lines.��� my wife hung up the phone and not 5-10 seconds later the power came back on causing us to jump. i explained to her what i had observed outside our home and reiterated that when i got to the door on my way back that i looked shaken. \r\nthe events depicted above are absolutely true and accurate. i have told a few friends and family members of the facts surrounding the events described above but have neglected to officially report said incident.  i am reporting the incident now so that the occurrence can be documented for possible future reference. \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

about 5 times smaller than each streak or line of light and they were not moving at all. the plane was probably in approach to tpa and again it flew under the lights, to give you an idea of altitude.

alabama (but more nearer to the small community of beulah). while crossing a bridge that went over lake harding on lee county rd. 279, i noticed a triangular shaped object hovering just above the treeline. the object appeared to be around a football field and a half from the bridge over a few houses. at best guess, it was some 75 feet in the air. two blue-white lights were in what i believed to be the rear of the vessel. underneath, i could make out a reddy-orange lightthat at times seemed to shine to the ground (almost like a hand held spot light). i watched this go on for around 25-30 minutes approximately. it almost seemed as if the vehicle was searching or looking for something. that is just the impression i had at the time.\r\n\r\nstill having almost 100 newspapers to deliver; i traveled on to my customers. this took about an hour and i decided to go back to the area to see if the craft was still there. remarkably it was! however, it had \"floated or hovered\" down the tree line a ways and eventually went out of my field of view back into a wooded area that was gated. i want to also point out that i witnessed no beings or aliens but, i did witness a full grown panther (gender unknown, about the size of a lab retriever dog) walk from one side of the road to the next an go behind a small country church. amazingly, in one nights time; i witnessed my first ufo and saw a panther (that according to the state, are not supposed to be in alabama).\r\n\r\ni came home later that morning and immediately got on the web to try and find a similar craft akin to what i'd witnessed. loand behold i did, and in fact found upwards of around ten puported triangular shaped ufo's. some were identical while other depictions were similar but different. if memory serves correctly, i thought upon what i had seen for about a week before contacting a mr. robert patterson of mufon alabama. we had about an hour long conversation and his information was very helpful.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

white cigar shaped aircraft moving slowly from a nw to se direction. there was no sound and no exhaust trail of any kind. i noticed that there were no wings on this craft which was the feature that made me stop and look more closely at it. i tried to determine if it was a blimp, but it was moving in a completely straight line. i did not have my phone or a camera or binoculars of any kind. it was high up in the sky but it was not above any cloud cover. the day was beautifully sunny with a blue sky and just a hint of cloud formations at random in certain point of the sky. i followed the object across the sky for approx 2 minutes, observing a reflection off of the surface of the craft which i presumed was from the sunlight reflecting off of it. the sun was straight up in the sky and behind me so i was not looking into it. i then thought to look in the trunk of my car for some binoculars. the trunk was open because i was cleaning it and i looked down, moving some stuff around to see if i have my binocs. when i looked up, the object was gone. my initial feeling on this craft was that it was a balloon or some kind of blimp. it seemed to just float across the sky. approx 5 minutes later i observed 3 aircraft, all planes (i could see their wings and exhaust trail) moving in the sky in the exact opposite direction (se to nw). these aircraft were obviously planes with wings and exhaust trails. they seemed to be at 3 different altitudes in the sky. i believe this because they all seemed to be different sizes and the exhaust trails were different depths of thickness. i know this is a generalization but i made note of it to determine how far away they were from one another. the first aircraft came across the sky followed by the other two a good distance behind. the two behind the first one were separated by a good distance as well from n to s. i followed these aircraft until they passed above my house and off in to the distance to the n. the whole thing from beginning to end was about 20 minutes or so. i have seen other strange things in the sky here before because we are in a very rural area and the sky is very open to us in most all directions. this is the first time i have seen this type of craft in the sky and also the first time i have seen something unusual during the daylight hours with the sun shining brightly and a clear sky. as a follow up, i have lived out here in the country for 15 years now and am familiar with the wildlife. this was no bird or living creature.","distance":"Over One

the blue came the object.  it flew right over my head, going fairly slow, about 2,000 feet in the air.  it caught me off guard because it flew right over the lone cloud that was floating right above me.  it was a very thin/low lying cloud, and i hadn't noticed the object beforehand so i was quite startled.  \r\n\r\nany ways, i had a very clear view of it for about 2 minutes.  for 20 seconds it was right above me, heading west to east at a fairly regular speed if not slow.  the object had orange lights on the outside, a yellowish orange.  the lights were curved, and it appeared almost exactly like this ( )  in the center of the lights was a dull, rotating red light that seemed to be blinking randomly.  by rotating, i mean it was moving around in the shape of a square in the center of the yellowish orange lights.  it was blinking at each corner if that makes sense, yet it seemed random and off center.  any ways, the craft made no noise yet it was right above me.  \r\n\r\ni searched online and began to believe that it may have been an airplane with it's landing lights turned on.  however, the next night i went outside and observed at around 2am, and a plane flew above me again at a much higher altitude with it's landing lights on.  i was still able to see this planes blinking white exterior lights and a clear view of the red blinking light.  it also made noise even though the altitude was much higher than the object i saw the night before.  \r\n\r\nthis is my 2nd ufo sighting in my life; the first being at the beginning of october this year in which i saw 2 dull white lights flying above me at 500 feet or so that made no noise and was eerily inconspicuous.  i wrote this after seeing 2 reports in the last week of almost the exact same craft i saw just a few days ago.  \r\n\r\ni attached a sketch that gives a 'sketchy' example of my microsoft paint skills.  the darkness is the sky, the white is the cloud.  i'd like to talk to someone about this, preferably the people who reported the exact same craft (the guys in minnesota who witnessed almost exactly what i saw)\r\n\r\nemail me at:   [email address removed/cms/tg]","distance":"501 Feet - 1

passing i did see one red light and possible other white light flashing.  the strobing lights did not match the pattern of commercial jets that i often see over head.  no green lights were seen from the object indicating port and starboard sides of an normal air craft. life flight helicopters fly daily over our house making trips to our local hospital about three miles away.  at night these helicopters are quite noisy and have only one very bright light that are pointed downward. i am a sky watcher and love to watch the overhead air traffic.  the most worthy things about my sighting are

it was wide, misty and hovering. i seemed very close. in a split second i realized that i was seeing; what came to my mind was \"a mothership\". it was huge!\r\n\r\nit seemed to be oval with a dome. i got an impression of textured, slightly reflective surface, barely distinguishable windows and a few widely spaced lights. most of the lights where white, with a couple of blue-green lights and a rose-colored (not red) light. i couldn't see the entire ship because it was surrounded by a mist/diffuse cloud that gave me the impression that it was trying to blend into the city skyline.\r\n\r\ni was already turning onto beth avenue, so i continued to trent street and turned left so i was once again facing the winston-salem skyline with the wachovia building directly ahead. that building should have been clearly visible, as usual from that postion/distance. however, the craft had moved closer to downtown seemed to have moved directly in front of/over the wachovia building. the mistiness had increased so that all that was visible was the lights and i couldn't see the wachovia building. it was as if the craft was trying to mimic or swallow the building.\r\n\r\ni felt extremely disoriented because i couldn't see the buildings i knew were there. it was like some sort of optical illusion was obscuring them. i felt so disturbed that i just couldn't look at it for more than a couple of minutes. i went home, went inside and just thought about what i had seen. i went back to the same spot on trent street to look at the skyline about 15 minutes later. that misty obscureness was gone and the skyline looked just as it normally does. it was dusk by then, but not completely dark. the sky/local atmosphere was perfectly clear, just like it had been all day.","distance":"501 Feet -

6:15a.M., now with daylight savings 4:00a.M. - 5:15a.M) my entire family and i have seen on average of 6 to 12 objects that each tell its own story.  but they all have one thing in common, that they look like a star that is moving in the sky.  occasionally, they stop, and restart.  another will change direction.  another will appear out of nowhere, wobble along a path until it eventually fades out, where yet another will shoot off.  i am so absolutely 100% positive that they occur every night that i am able to get a clear view.  my interest and reason why i go outside each night is because i know in my heart they are abnormal objects.  i have read that official airplanes, helicopters, will flash by faa regulation.  i invite any person from your organization to witness them here any time you would like.  i will be going out this evening, as it is relatively clear.  my greatest frustration is that i have no way of photographing this objects.  an odd detail is that whenever i think i have seen the last one of the evening and am heading inside, i take another look up, and there it goes over me...So i stay and watch it, and sit down waiting for more.  when i am about to call it quits again, yes, it is weird, but there another one goes.  this happened last evening, where at first my eyes adjusted to just one, they are usually single, but this time there were two, not far in distance (1/2 inch) is the only measurement as i cannot judge how far away they are...And they were traveling straight, one ahead of the other at the same rate of speed, and same brightness, like a dull star.  at first i thought one disappeared, so i watched the remaining one.  several moments later, i saw it approaching a faint star, or what i thought was a star.  it was not a star, as it rejoined the other object and they traveled together again.  i am so convinced that these objects are not a plane, or satellite, that i wish i had the equipment to record them.  i do have a telescope, but it is impossible to track one of these through the telescope...I know, and have given up on trying, as you cannot lock into the objects as they move too fast.  one more odd thing occurred the other night.  as inappropriate as it may seem, after a very quiet evening of stargazing, and after seeing the first \"traveling star\" for the evening, i did not want to go inside to use the bathroom, so i went outside.  i suddenly felt very uncomfortable, creeped out, when i heard a crash into my neighbors trees, maybe 150 feet away.  then i heard something run through a small wooded section of my front yard towards me, about 75 feet away. i radioed my son, who came to the door.  he suggested that i come inside, (i believe he is starting to worry about my health as i am so troubled by what they could be my sleep has been thrown off a tad). being too interested and excited about these objects, i stayed outside and decided to walk towards it.  as i did, i made noise and stomped my feet.  i heard the rustling of leaves running away from me into my neighbors yard.  i wasn't going to follow it into the dark. when i started to return to my yard, half way across my yard i stopped, and heard the rustling coming closer to me again. i am not sure if this is just a coincidence, as i do have wild turkey and deer where i live, so i cannot be sure.  i just felt that the timing was off, as while going to the bathroom outside i felt very vulnerable and uncomfortable, as if i were being watched.  i admit it could be just my imagination, and a fat turkey made a landing, and then ran through the woods, i will never know.  i do not think, however, that normal turkey or deer behavior was exhibited, as they usually stay away after you shoo them away...They do not come back towards you, then disappear without hearing noise of their departure. for, after i tried to frighten whatever was making the noise away, i heard nothing after that but some falling leaves.  i continued to observe shooting stars, and then these other objects i report to you, which are definitely not the same as the shooting stars we also see.  thank you, and please feel free to inquire as i am more than happy to share this with people who are more knowledgeable on the subject, with the hopes that you may know what we are seeing.
