smaller than an aspirin if that was to be held away from me at arms length.  the object appeared to be an elongated, soft but pure white color object that was bright but not brilliant bright about the size a commercial jet fuselage for that distant superimposed horizontally in the sky.  the object didn't appeared to be constituted of light but rather just white in color like a cool white, elongated oval but slightly bulging, florescent lamp shape which also had a rough surface texture appearances and smoothly rounded like a cone at each end.  it was very slowly traversing across the sky going southeast slower than a typical commercial jet flying.  no navigation lights were seen such as strobe lights or green/red navigation lights.  the lighting remain constant which no flickering of lighting was observed, and no contrail were observed with the eyes including via the camera lens.  while observing the object and from my perspectives, it appeared to be making a wide sweeping coarse change while maintaining a general southeast heading.  there was clouds in the sky, and the object appeared to be traversing in-and-out of the clouds while traversing in a mono-direction and maintaining a horizontal flight.  the last sighting of the object was when it was near the horizon and inside a cloud bank formation at the far distant. the color of the object at its farthest distant appeared to be orange in color. when the white color was seen when it was nearest our location, it appeared to be (in my opinion) too bright white in color for the available lighting condition.\r\n\r\nthen at 6:03 pm while both of my brothers and i were still in the back porch area conversing with each other, again my brother abruptly yells out very excitedly, \"there's a bright light that just instantly appeared in sky!\"  so i quickly turned around and observed in the same general area of the first sighting a star-like object traversing an identical coarse of the first event sighting.  this object was at the same altitude, speed, and distant of the first event sighting but different in lighting: the lighting was not the same nor white in color but an arc-welding type color bathe in brilliant light;  and it also appeared from my perceptiveness also something similar to a contained miniature sparkler. the planet jupiter was seen to the left side in the sky, but the object was not brighter nor bigger than jupiter.  another planet, possibly venus, was seen near the area where the sun had set recently.  the object was not brighter nor bigger than venus.  my younger brother while he was observing the object only with his eyes made vocally a generalized comment while observing it that the object appeared to his perception to be zigzagging while it was traversing southeast in the sky.  as the object traversed southeast, the lighting  began to diminish with distant thereby making it extremely difficult to observe the object as it traverse further in the distant.  it also appeared to my perception to be orange in color when it was in a far distant yet that color was not seen when it was first observed closer to our location.  the object eventually was no longer seen when it traversed near the distant  horizon and into a cloud. \r\n\r\nno aircraft were seen during both of the sighting event.  however shortly thereafter the second sighting event, a helicopter and smaller types of  planes were observed flying around in the distant sky, and they were flying around like in a searching pattern in the same general area where both objects were seen traversing through earlier.  a total of three people observed the unidentified flying objects.  in the first sighting, there was plenty of twilight in the sky which distant things like clouds and houses were easily seen without any difficulties. the second sighting was much darker in twilight and distant things such as clouds and houses were still easily seen yet somewhat darken in lighting features due to the deficiency of available ambient lighting.  at both sighting event when first observed,  the object was located in the sky about 40 to 45 degrees off the horizon. last angle degree that both object were observed traversing was about 20 degrees off the horizon. there was no apparent wind blowing or observed during the sightings.  temperature outside was about 75 degrees f. no sound were heard during either event sightings. \r\ni took a few pictures of jupiter and venus, and those pictures shows them putting out extreme amounts of light.  in the 2nd event sighting which looked star-like, the lighting output captured on camera was not even close to being the same in lighting intensity of those planets yet the object looked star-like while it traversed.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:03:35","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":33210,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.2963368,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11082011-0009","longitude":-112.4231264,"occurred":1320629640000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,   Sphere,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1320782739000,"summary":"Two sequential sightings of identical flight coarse characteristics: 1st elongated oval shape white;

back out it a cool night and i light a smoke and  sit down on the step.\r\ni look up and immediatley i see a v shaped line of very dim red amber lights\r\ni would think about 7 circular  lights per side.\r\ni t was about 1000 feet up and very large. to block  it from view i would have used about the basketball size object at arms length.\r\nit came from direcly over my house and went on in a strait line  due east. abosolutley silent , it covered my sky line in about 7 seconds before it blended in the night sky.\r\nmy wife caught the tail end of it.When i say lights i dont mean it as we would see lights on a car \r\nthey were very dim and could easily not be seen by anyone walking it just seemed to blend in with the night sky, yet 100% visible, i couldnt see any sides of it just the circular  amber red dim lights. it was alligned in a v shape rather than a boomer rang, it had about 7-9 lights per side wich formed a v that was more of a 60 degree angle.\r\nit is my first sighting, i was really taken back, im the kind of guy where i could spin a great tale, but i tell you this was somthing  not of this world. dead silnt as it passed  over me and covered my sky line in 7 seconds.\r\ni saw it  now im questioning what i should do,,, they are here and our goverments probably cant do a thing anyways, they have no need to contact us they can come and go as they wish,,,i am very puzzeled right now about what i should be doing,,, i seen it i believe it and i really feel like i should be trying to expose it to the rest of the world,,, where the hell was it going,,, i ask this because i drive somewhere ive got somthing to do\r\nwhere were they going they obviously have somthing to do they arent just joy riding,,,, this bothers me the most i feel i have to do somthing about this and im inept to do anything except question what they are doing , we are a rich mineral deposited area, gawd i have a tonne of probable reasons \r\nbut why  wont they make themselves known..... i always thought you peeps who report this stuff are wack jobs\r\nmabey some of you are ,,,  but if u seen what i seen  i am certain you are going through what i am going through,,,,

west, to the right of the san jacinto mountains, over highway 111. i assumed it was one of many helicopters that take the same flight path near my house. it looked like it was on fire, but traveled the same speed as any helicopter. it stopped, and it wasn't making any sound. i ran indoors to get my partner to see it. it was less than 10 seconds to get him outside, and it was gone. we both then noticed an unlit object, round, or balloon shaped passing overhead, and it crossed in front of the moon heading east in the direction of palm springs airport. it traveled in a straight line and seemed to be descending. in front of it's flight path, in the direction of the airport i saw a shooting star heading up, at a slight angle. not across the sky, or downward, almost straight up. my partner did not see the shooting star. we were both excited as we both have always wanted to see something like this in person. we discussed what to do, and i said i would make a report to mufon later, but first i called the local news kpsp. they had no other calls, and heard nothing on the police scanner.\r\n i went back outdoors and it was there again, but closer to the tram station on top of san jacinto which is to the left of it's first position. i ran inside and got my partner out again, this time he grabbed his iphone and started filming it. he told me to get the binoculars, which i did, and could see it looked now like a tiny speck of orange light, and then faded out. it was heading away toward the west. the lights at first were as bright as the light at the tram station, then slowly faded, as if moving away. it was hovering, and then moved west.\r\n 3rd sighting at 9:35 pm. \r\n this time i figured i'd go out front to the street to see if i could see it. it was back, and as bright as before, again i ran in to get my partner, and he saw it also. it seemed to be coming toward us heading east, but then stopped and went in the opposite direction. it didn't turn in a circle, it just went backwards, and faded out again. there was no noise or motor sounds at all. \r\n i want to clarify it behaved like the many helicopters we see overhead, but made no sound at all. i am used to seeing lights from helicopters, and at the distance it seemed to be from me, we should have heard the rotors.  the shaded, unlit round object that passed in front of the moon, may have, or may not have been the same object.  during all of this, there were many passenger planes flying overhead as well. we are under, and between the east bound, and west bound air routes. of course those planes were much higher in the sky than the object was. \r\n we stayed outside until 10:00pm to see if it returned, it did not.  the sky was clear, we could see all the stars, the moon is 3/4 full. the object blocked out the lower half of the moon when it passed overhead. there was no wind on the ground.","distance":"101-500 Feet,

(she had seen similar behavior on at least two other occasions in the previous week.) but other than that bright flash, nothing more was seen or has been seen since. i've gotten up most morning and looked. no luck.\r\n\r\nbtw, there were no clouds that night -- the stars were really bright. no moon in the sky either.\r\n\r\nthat's it. not the most sensational event, but the strangest i've ever seen -- especially the orange orbs. i've tried to be very factual and have not embellished. i hope this information is useful to someone. my wife and i will continue to be on the lookout.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":33196,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.72918522996597,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11072011-0014","longitude":-96.02263595044893,"occurred":1319718300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1320715405000,"summary":"The star rigel, in the orion constellation; pulsating with two orange orbs appearing next to it.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"77474","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":11,"locationName":"Sealy, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:25727"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Austin","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was simply taking pictures in the early hours around 6:00 am. i had taken a whole series of camera shots with my cell phone camera, when i saw this object. the sun was already comming an can be seen in the frame. i waited to see if this was an airplane, but it was stationary and then simply started to back out of the picture and then suddenly dissapeared in an instant. it was not an airplane, because i can see and watch airplains from my deck go to an from the airport all the time and i've never seen the sun and the moon look like this at the same time in the same skyline.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":33195,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.344319134624946,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11072011-0013","longitude":-97.8079535383659,"occurred":1320476400000,"potentialRelations":[33198],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1320714742000,"summary":"Silver or metalic in appearance and simply dissappeared, as though backing out and away in a straignt line and then it was just gone.
