southwest of frankfort,kentucky).  she noticed a bright pulsating light to the north-northeast.  i went outside and immediately noticed the object, which was about 40 to 45 degrees above the horizon and appeared to be hovering over downtown frankfort, kentucky.  object was noticeably brighter than stars in the sky. weather was clear at the time, no clouds noticed in the area.  when i first saw it, there appeared to be two smaller red pulsating objects circling below it, then these disappeared.  the main object appeared to occasionally give off a flash of white light, kind of like a photography flash bulb.  object was hovering at high altitude, much higher than the helicopter traffic we often see in this area.  it did not emit any noise.  object moved up and down very rapidly but remained fixed over the same area around 7:15pm. i am estimating it was 3-5 miles away, guessing in the area of the intersection of highways us-127 and us-421, this would be on the north side of frankfort,ky.  we observed this until 7:30pm and went back inside.  i went back out at 8:00pm, the object was still in the sky in about the same position as before.  at 8:15pm, object also appeared to fall suddenly dropping maybe 5 degrees on the horizon.  at this point, we saw 3 small but very bright red lights dropping down out of the main object one right after the other.  two of these began heading due west at slow speed.  the third red light remained hovering below the main object, then at very high speed moved towards the other two red pulsating lights.  they then moved into a triangular formation and headed off due west at slow speed.  at this point, i went inside and got a set of binoculars, through the binoculars i could see that each of the red lights was actually 3 pulsating red lights in a v or chevron type shape.  hard to tell size but definitely in a v shape and flying in formation.  the red objects did not emit any sound.  at 8:20pm we noticed a similar object to the east had appeared also with the same pulsating green, red, yellow lights. then about 8:25pm we saw the eastern object drop suddenly in altitude and stop. suddenly the eastern rotating object dropped a single red flashing light...Through the binoculars it also appeared to be 3 flashing lights in a v-shape, also headed due west at slow speed.  same type of 3 sets of pulsating red lights in a v-shape as the previously observed ones.  aropund 8:45pm, the westernmost object moved south at slow speed towards us, this would have put it over downtown frankfort,ky or us-127. the eastern object i would guess would be in the versailles road/us-460 area maybe ?? we called the franklin county, kentucky dispatch center non-emergency number, they said quote \"what do you want us to do about it ?\" the dogs in the area have been barking continuously all night since about 6:30 if that means anything at all.  at 10:30pm this evening we went back outside, we observed that both of the main objects were gone.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

october 13th, 2011 our cruise ship, the carnival glory was headed south from halifax, nova scotia towards new york city. the weather was rather unpleasant that night and my wife and i had just returned to our stateroom after eating dinner. it was cold, dark and kind of stormy outside but i wanted a cigarette so i threw on a bathrobe over my clothes to keep warm and went out and sat down and lit up a smoke. the next thing that happened was the most amazing thing that's ever happened to me in my life. \r\n\r\ni am 57 years old and am a very skeptical person. i am not religious and do not believe in bigfoot, ghost and that sort of thing. i have always believed in ufo's but have never been able to be sure about them because i never saw one myself before. that all changed when i was sitting out on the balcony having a smoke that night. the next thing i know a silent cylinder with rounded ends comes into view, flying silently from the south heading north. it couldn't have been more than 300 feet from me and about 150 feet above the water. as it reached the back of the ship it angled down and then curved around the back of the ship and was gone. \r\n\r\ni stayed outside about 20 more minutes hoping it would return with no luck. the entire incident only took about 6 seconds from start to finish but i am now convinced that ufo's are real. it was silent and it didn't appear to be emitting any light of its own. it glowed because our cruise ship was lit up like a christmas tree and the light from the ship was what illuminated the object.  i think i wouldn't have seen it at all had it been farther from the ship. \r\n\r\nlooking back i now wish i would have reported it to the authorities on the ship. if someone was on the bridge they had to see it as well so there must be some sort of record. their is a bow camera that may have filmed it as well. i have been looking for other reports from that night but the weather was so nasty it's possible i was the only passenger who happened to be out on the balcony at the time this thing passed by us.  my gut feelings tell me that it spotted us and swooped in close to check us out just as a tourist would pull off the road to see something. anyway, i know what i saw and i now have absolutely no doubt at all that we are not alone. i also understand when i hear someone say they saw something that seemed to be otherworldly because this sure didn't seem to be military.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:06","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

going through a late bed-wetting phase and remember i was determined to end that embarrassment.  i awoke for the second or third night in time to relieve myself and remember being happy and proud that i caught it in time again.  \r\n\r\nas my eyes creaked open slightly i saw movement in the room and at least what i thought were african american kids in my room moving around.  i remember thinking that the only thing they could steal of any value was my prized small black & white tv that was on my dresser next to my bed.  as you can imagine at this time my heart was pounding through my chest and just wanted them to take the tv and leave.  i creaked my eyes open ever so slightly as not to be noticed and was shocked to realize that they weren���������t afro���������s (which were common at that time) but were whole heads. \r\n\r\ni can���������t really express my thoughts of that instant realization when i saw who was really in the room at that time other than how in a nanosecond i went from (there���������s no such things as aliens-to-oh, my god there real-to-what do they want).  at that time there was no such things as ���������greys��������� or anything similar to what has been so defined into pop culture today.  \r\n\r\nbeing late october early november there was a harvest moon and i had a fairly large picture window in my room which lead to some fair amount of ambient room lighting which i shared with my 5 year old brother who slept in a adjacent bed next to mine.\r\n\r\nduring this event i was creaking my eyes open enough as not to be noticed, laying on my back when i woke up and my bed covers were at my waist.  all i wanted was to get my bed cover up to my head so i was ever so slowly and methodically creeping them up during this entire event. as not to be noticed.  there was a larger one that stood against the wall directly across from the foot of my bed that just stared at me.  there was another knelt down on the opposite side of my brothers bed and what i thought at the time was that he was doing something to his arm.  \r\n\r\ni my head at the time my mind was reeling, my parents room was directly behind me and if i screamed my father would come running in.  i remember thinking that the one next to my brother i was taller than and equated him to being in ���������my grade��������� remember i was 10.  so if he came over to me my big plan was to jump up and dive on him and scream for my dad.  the one against the wall just standing there i remember as being a grade or two older than me and he would probably do something before my dad to get in.\r\n\r\ni remember thinking i could end the whole debate that are we alone in the universe and the weight of that thought being succumbed to he���������s killing my brother and not being able to muster the internal strength to do something.  my next thought was that if he comes over to me he can���������t put a needle in me so i started to tear up and that diffused my sight to what was happening in the room.\r\n\r\nthen the one that was knelt next to my brother got up and came at me, pure horror as my eyes were teared and he rounded my brothers bed and in one motion knelt down on his right knee and in one motion opened his toolkit and kind of flipped and twisted his left wrist and reached in.  at that very moment i couldn���������t hold it anymore and thought needle! and i made a audible pre-cry whale.  the face that the creature made still haunts me today.  honesty.  it���������s the same face people make when they make a surprise mistake a ���������eek i did something embarrassing��������� facial expression.  his mouth was just a slit so when he made that expression his face rippled and wrinkled like a old man.\r\n\r\nimmediately whatever he was taking out of his box which was a really weird shape then but not now, it was (hexagonal with a diagonal opening and handle) put it back in got up and they marched out.  again another part of this is memory that has crept me out is how they moved like the military and moved or better said marched out of my room.  i was shocked and with unreal timing as i looked down the hallway when they past my parents room two more came out and filed in line which such precision and marched down the hall and all turned down the stairs out of my sight.  \r\n\r\nagain i must stress the timing was if they were one.  needless to say i didn���������t sleep the rest of the night.  my younger brother was fine in the morning, and no one in my family knew anything of the nights event.  i lived near a large metropolitan area at the time and our house was the only house surrounded by 260 acres of woods.\r\n\r\ni only told a handful of people since then and find it very difficult and seriously doubt many of these accounts i read of abductions myself.   ironic isn���������t it.  they were very, very real, and i wish i dream't it but i didn���������t.\r\n\r\nmy impression then and my life of the events of that night is that these beings are cold and indifferent to us, basically they are not our enemies but most certainly aren���������t our friends.  there might be a very good reason our government has kept this secret for so long.\r\n\r\n\r\nside note:\r\nphysical appearance is not as \"sinister\" as depicted.  more of blue/grey artic silver color than grey. bulbous joints with slightly distended stomachs, very similar to dwarfism.  seen mouth slits move slightly along with large head movement just as like they were speaking but heard nothing. \r\n\r\n

out before going to bed and i was star gazing, as i always do when i am out with the dogs at night, when i first noticed the object. at first it looked like a star, but since i am always looking at the same sky, it looked out of place. i had never noticed such a bright \"star\" before. as i continued to look at it, i realized it was flashing different color lights and started to make a pendulum like movement but very lightly. that is when i ran in the house to get my husband and binoculars. with the binoculars i could see the object more clearly. at first it was flat on the top with little red, green, blue and yellow lights flashing, but emitting a net like appearance on the bottom. it looked almost like a disco ball on the bottom with the different lights.\r\n\r\nabout an hour later, as i continued to watch i saw an airplane come by and we thought it was coming to investigate the object. as the airplane approached the object, the net like aura that appeared on the bottom part of the object was like retracted and the object shifted from its original location and that is when i could see clearly the dish shaped object with a bright light on top and the little flashing lights going around. it stayed like that for a short time (a few minutes) then it moved again. as time went by the object would move a little higher and a little higher until it was impossible to see any detail, not even with the binoculars.\r\n\r\nin addition to me, both my husband and daughter witnessed it. we were all shocked at first and just in total disbelieve of what we had witnessed. to prove to myself what i had seen the next night i went out and looked for it, but there was nothing there other than the stars that are regularly there.

heard and felt by all three people. shortly after reaching the footpath, a light was spotted in the sky above the edale area. this light was moving slowly towards manchester, resembling an aircraft. however it shot sideways, covering around five miles in less than a second and then stopping dead. it then started shooting in random directions, hovering in a stationary position, then surging. it seemed to have white light coming from it. after a while moving around the sky a white beam of light appeared to emit from the bottom of the object. shortly after this two fast jets were seen moving quickly into the area, the object then moved away from them, back towards manchester. we then lost sight of it and a helicopter with a searchlight was seen in the area, sweeping the ground. this made us all quite anxious so we decided to get back to the car. i managed to get a photo of this object, showing three stars as a reference, with the motions of the object over four seconds in the lower left corner.\r\n\r\nwhile walking back to the car, we looked behind us with a torch, and a reflective object was seen on the ground by me, bouncing the light back to us. this was approximately where we had been earlier when we heard the thudding sounds. upon pointing this out to the other two people, i shone the torch back to where i had seen the light and a dark cylinder was seen shooting up into the air from the exact location of the reflective object just seconds earlier.\r\n\r\nwe then left the area quickly and got into the car, seeing nothing else. the link below details where we were

seen before. then noticed it was moving due east. my first thought was that it was the asteroid that was making the close approach to earth. i watched it move in a very direct path and as it moved it got noticebly smaller and fainter until it dissapeared over the horizon. all of this took about 5 min. i went inside and looked up the ateroid only to find out it wasnt going to be visible to the naked eye and not even to telescopes until the 8th. this was not a plane and it was still too light out to have seen a satellite, plus satellites dont appear this big and then get noticebly smaller. as a reference when i first saw it i would say it was twice as big and bright as the brightets planet visible in the east which i believe is venus. from my vantage point, venus is about 10 degrees above the horizon by the time the sun has faded enought to see, and this object appeared at about 30 degrees and then moved due east until it went beyond the horiazon.\r\nwould be curious if anyone

well.\r\n\r\nwhile the dog was doing its business, i stood motionless, just looking up at the stars, enjoying the crisp night air.  i may have been staring at a single point in the sky, hoping to spot a satellite with my peripheral vision.\r\n\r\nwhat i saw was at first just a single tiny, white, unblinking light moving across the sky above--but then i realized it was accompanied by two other identical lights, flying in a triangular formation.  once i made that realization, i noticed that the area between the lights was devoid of any stars--it was a solid triangular craft that made no noise whatsoever, left no visible exhaust, had no colored or blinking lights of any kind.  i am unable to say with any certainty the altitude of the craft, but my guess is that it was fairly large and 5 to 10-thousand feet up.  it moved quickly across the portion of the sky visible directly over my position, in a straight line, without any unusual maneuvers.\r\n\r\ni remember thinking how ridiculous it was for me to see this thing so suddenly and unexpectedly, and for it not only to be flying over a town instead of a remote rural location, but for it to be in such close proximity to a

time that this occurred and had not used any foreign substances - alcohol included - anywhere near the time that this happened (months, not hours.) i should also state that i have no psychological disorders. i am also not a \"visiting extra-terrestrial\" believer, although who is to say what the distant future holds. this was too odd not to report.\r\n\r\nit was around 7:45 - 7:50 cst with today's nov 6th time change taken into account (i.E. it would have been 8:45 if it happened yesterday.) i was driving home when a bright light caught my eye, a quick glance to the se caught my eye then and i was back to driving. it became instantly noticeable that it didn't go away after a second, so i looked back at it thinking that it must just be a reflection from a very far away airplane as i see sometimes when the sun is coming up, then it started getting larger. i have to admit that i didn't pay attention to how fast the size change occurred, but from what i remember it seemed to happen in 3 stages which took maybe 5-10 seconds. it started small like a very far away aircraft, then slowly it flashed like a reflection and it was medium sized, and then slowly flashed again and it was larger (it's largest.) since this questionnaire uses aspirin as a size comparison, i'd have to say that, at it's largest, if i held up a pill of aspirin to compare it to that the object would probably have been approximately 3/4th the size of the pill. i kept looking at it for a couple of seconds trying to find a sign that it was in fact an airplane that was moving away from me and just had a weird reflection - but then something stumped me: it went from looking like it was flying away from me to moving down, all in a sharp curve motion over the space of say, half an inch? it continued on a downward path when i almost went off of the road so i quickly stopped my car (the road was empty, no cars.) i got out to see if i could get a better view and had been standing outside for maybe 10 seconds when i noticed that it started changing from white-orange to a white-green. this really stumped me and i didn't know what to make of it so all i could do was keep watching it. that's when i noticed that it started gradually getting smaller (no reflecton-type flashes this time.) it continued getting smaller and smaller while fading to white. when it got back to the original pinpoint size it made a semi-sharp right and i accidently looked away for a quick second because i saw something in my peripheral vision and when i looked back to keep watching it, it was gone. i'd have to say that by my best estimation, the entire event lasted about a minute, but i'm not sure because it really seemed like two or three.\r\n\r\nreally no idea what to make of it, i'm still

potential hunting land i had gained permission to hunt this year. as i was driving, a flock of canadian geese caught my attention flying just north of me. as i watched the geese gain height out of this field, i caught a glimpse of a large object disappear behind some trees on the other side of the field. i slowed down and pulled to the side of the road. after waiting several minutes, i observed the object just east of my location. at first, because of the distance i thought it may be a large military air-craft. i have seen large planes in this area before as the airport is not that far away. as it got a little closer, i could clearly see that this was no plane. i must say that i was very uncomfortable about what i was seeing. as it got closer i could see that this was something i was not suppose to be seeing. i even questioned myself at the time. i can't begin to explain why i stood there and watched the object, because the sight of it really scared me. the object was rectangle and was about maybe 2 or 300 feet in length. there were 4 amber colored pulsating lights on the rear of it. they seemed to get brighter as the object moved up the field and dim as it hovered. there was an arm-like structure connected to the right side of it. it almost looked like some type of camera arm. it was round, tube shaped and extended down toward the ground. i could see that the very end of it was black looking in color. the entire object was a dull silver color and had a rough looking surface on the bottom. it continued to hover slowly over the far end of the field. all of a sudden, it started moving up the field and slowly banked to the right. when it made this turn, i was able to see the top right side of it. again, it was a dull silver color and was rough looking. i did not hear no sound coming from it. it was about 450 to maybe 500 yards across the field from where i was standing beside my truck. i continued to watch the object as it flew up towards the upper end of the field. again, it stopped and hovered as if looking for something. after hovering it again banked right and disappeared behind the trees. upon standing there and watching it go behind the trees, i could not help but to get into my truck and try and follow it. once i was able to reach the next road to turn down, it was a dead-end. i never saw it again. i have told no one about this besides a friend of mine and he suggested reporting it here. this was not a man-made object, i stood there for about 4 or 5 minutes watching it. i have never seen anything that i could compare it to. i can't get what i saw off my mind. it has gotten so bad that i tend to talk about stuff like this to friends and family never discussing what i actually saw but instead just venting to try and calm my thoughts about it. i don't want to be labeled as crazy but, i know what i saw. i have not drawn a picture pertaining to what i saw because i am trying to forget about it, but i can submit one if needed.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,  Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Path with directional

around in between the clouds at a rather high altitude. there was two connected to each other and they didn't seem to move with the wind but they were changing position constantly. \r\n\r\n  then i saw a mass of about five more in a kind of geometric shape again not moving with the wind but always rotating the points of each sphere that made up the mass. i know most people would say that's just a bunch of balloons but the wind was 7 mph ssw and these guys just weren't moving that way.How ever someone in the area did release a bunch of reflective multicolored mylar balloons around the same time and these did in fact float directly past my stationary ufo objects.\r\n\r\n once i started observing these objects more intensely the spheres would disappear  and reappear in groups and shapes in different locations.This seamed kind of like a game, if i had doubt about what i was seeing i could pick a new place to look in the sky that was clear and they would appear there out of thin air. no movement to or from those points in the sky, they would just materialize.\r\n\r\n this lasted from about 2 in the afternoon until sun down. these objects formed triangle formations composed of three spheres spaced out at least 80 to 100 feet apart and stayed in one place for up to ten minutes.They appeared in groups of two at closer distances and orbited each other in a circle like pattern. and the they also appeared and disappeared in line pasterns composed of 3 to 4 spheres lined up in a row. one on the end of the line pattern would disappear and re appear at the front of the row of spheres continuously. \r\n\r\nevery thing i saw these objects do seemed like it was designed to get my attention and show a sign of intelligence. these little guys were so interactive it was amazing. if i thought of  two, one, or three  of them, that many would appear were i was looking up at!\r\n\r\nthe only other activity i found could be related is that when this all occurs animals tend to act funny. birds would circle the area like they were trying to get there bearings and dogs would bark for a little bit when the sighting first starts up. also i cant forget to mention that i have witnessed planes fly at these objects or directly were they had been moments ago as if they are tracking the spheres or attempting to move them along.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

cirrus clouds in the southern sky,  while playing fetch with our dog at a park on a plateau in central toronto, canada, an aircraft was noticed moving from the southeast towards the northwest  at first when it was noticed by my girlfriend, it was staying at the same altitude and thought to be a white blimp type aircraft. she noticed that it did not appear to be in a normal flight pattern as usually seen from the park with commercial aircraft that are landing at the pearson international airport and that it was moving slowly. there was some unusual banded marks around the centre that looked like rings that went around the centre of the aircraft that were elevated slightly from the surface. she thought i could identify it and brought it to my attention since i had spent several years with military aircraft. there was no noise emanating from the aircraft. the commercial aircraft that we normally see in the area are usually in the landing pattern of pearson international and you can hear the aircraft engines as they ascend and descend. \r\n\r\ni thought it was a porter airlines bombardier q 400 flying out of billy bishop ( formerly toronto island) airport heading towards a northwest ontario destination ascending from 3000 feet to 5000 feet.  the vertical stabilizers of porter aircraft are painted in a blue theme so i thought the tail was blending in with the blue sky and the aircraft was banking so that the wings and turbo prop nacelles were at a 90 degree angle and so were not visible. so i waited a few seconds for the angle of sight to change and it became apparent that there were no tail services or wings visible. all that was visible was a white fuselage with no visible means of support and the aircraft then began to ascend rapidly from 5000 feet to 20,000 feet. it's heading then changed to due north and it accelerated to what appeared to be over mach 2 with no sound and rapidly disappeared from view. \r\n\r\nwe were somewhat astonished that we
