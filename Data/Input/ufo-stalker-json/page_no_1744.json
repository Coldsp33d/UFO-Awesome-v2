the cracks in my shades i see an orange light..It registered in my mind as a light pole...About 20 or 25 seconds later it registered in my head that i dont have a light pole and i cant see any from the angle i was in my bed..So i jumped up excitedly and whipped my shades back and sure enough there went an orange light across the sky..It looked like it came from the north but i cant say 100 percent for sure..It could have just been the way i was looking at it..So i run out of my room into the hallway to try to get outside to get a better look at it..I had a dumbbell laying in my hallway and stubbed my toe on it..I hopped around for about 3 seconds and ran to my front door...Excitedly i tried to open the door but i had locked it..Time seemed precious...I got the door open and looked out and the orange light had apparently switched directions and was now traveling east..I never saw the change in direction..I was hooping around in my hallway.I watched it for maybe ten or fifteen more seconds before it disappeared over the hillside.Ive seen 5 or 6 strange things in the sky over my life but none of them were the color orange..It was almost the same color as a lit cigarette..I told some of my family about it and they said they had seen something similar a few nights before to the west over a place called beaverdam, but the said they heard noise.I did not..Im really interested in if you know what this object was or if anyone else in my area saw it.Please email me if you know..On a related subject i saw something even more interesting when i was younger..Maybe 7th or 8th grade..I dont remember but iremember what i saw like it was yesterday..I was living with my mom my dad was at lawschool at uk...It was a little 2 room house and no running water so if you had to use the bathroom in the middle of the night you had to go outside..It was around 1 to 3 in the morning..I was leaned up against the side of the house looking at a star doing my biusness..This star was stationary..When all of the sudden it blinked at me..On and off..About a minute later it happened again..A minute later again..Then all of the sudden it starts blinking really fast..I mean really fast..The it appeared to just fall out of the sky while blinking..But that was a long time ago and about six miles away from here but it seems worth mentioning because it has stuck with me all these
