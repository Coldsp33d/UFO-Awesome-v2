cigarette and was looking up at the stars as i always do. the sky was clear and the stars were out. i saw 3 lights in a triangular shape move quickly across the sky from sse to nnw. the lights were dim and there was no noise. the lights were solid and not blinking, they were white in color and just before it went out of view they switched positions. they could have been 1 craft rotating or 3 different craft switching positions. but the impression i got was that it was one craft with 3 lights. i watched the skies for a bit longer then went inside to text about it. i then went back outside about 15 minutes later and at about 2:20 am saw about 7-8 dim white lights in a line, each light slightly staggered from the previous one. this object moved as one object, it was likely a cigar shaped

west, when i noticed a lower altitude light in the sky slowly crossing left to right in front of me, very slightly gaining altitude. it was distinctive in appearance, like a 4th of july roman candle, yellow-orange-white in color. there appeared to be a smaller white light with it, as if it could be another light on a craft. it was not distinctive in size, about the size of lower elevation plane approaching the st. louis airport 6 miles away. the craft was yet slightly increasing in altitude. there were no blinking lights, and no discernible sound. i watched it for a few seconds after i'd noticed it and thought it was bright enough and moving slowly enough that i could run in my house, get my camera and take a picture of it. i've never seen a craft with lights like that before and i'm 51, but again, it was more anomalous than surreal. stepping back outside several seconds later, i got the object in the viewfinder and zoomed in the full 24x optical resolution. i clearly saw a fuzzy circular object, but not with the extending \"rays\" i was seeing with my eyes. when i pressed the auto-focus, immediately i could no longer see the object in the frame, nor did i see the object move out of the frame. i looked with my eye and noticed the object had significantly dimmed down. the object was not dimming while i could see it with my eyes. the object apparently dimmed down to the point the camera could not pick it up exactly at the time i depressed the auto-focus! i continued to look at the object with my eyes after i tried to take its picture, where i finally did actually see it dim out, quickly, though still rising in altitude - which a chinese lantern wouldn't do. july 4th of 2009 and 2010 i and others did see \"chinese lanterns\" pass by the house, but this object looked more like a steady burning roman candle with a small white light right beside it. the included \"picture\" is a \"photoshop\" hybrid image of a picture taken at night of my perspective from the event night, with software overlayed anomalous light(s). i would testify that the image is over 90 percent accurate of what i saw with my eyes before i got my camera that night.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

'99 over st. louis. some call them \"chemtrails,\" and i sometimes take pictures of the trails and/or planes making them. by the way, i've noticed that not all planes flying at these altitudes leave persistent trails when flying through the same air space close to or through the persistent trails. anyways, in the picture taken saturday 10/22 @16:54 (4:54 pm cdt) i noticed black dots in the image once i'd downloaded it to my computer, especially noticing a triangle of dots in the bottom-left quadrant of the x-trail i was photographing. i think this picture was taken at the full optical zoom of 24x. i expanded the 5.3 megapixal image and only increased the contrast to find the black objects circled in the image, which is a scaled down image of the original. i've taken many pictures of these trails over the years and have never noticed these circular dark objects. they are not camera anomalies as proven by the two pictures submitted, where the dark objects change position between the two images, evidence contrary to a camera anomaly. the second (contrast only adjusted) picture taken @16:55 (4:55 pm cdt), was zoomed back a bit to include my next door neighbor's house for perspective of the x-trail, also showing the circled black objects have moved. there are 9 circled objects in the first picture, 10 in the second. there may be a few more objects in each seen at greater detail but not really at the detail i've published. these objects are not birds which do show up in my \"skywriting\" pictures sometimes but are pretty easily discerned as such. the objects in these images don't appear to be moving at the time of image capture. these dark objects appear to be something in the sky that has moved in location in the span of 1 minute and 22 seconds. i don't submit this for investigation, but as curiosity to the public of unidentified objects in the sky not conventionally known. i testify that i only altered the original images by; increasing their contrast, overlaying the circles, and scaling them down in size. if you download the images, zoom in with your image viewer to see a bit more detail.\r\n","distance":"Over One

morning i think sept. 25th i could not sleep, and i have been having trouble sleeping a lot. i was lying there staring at my friends computer screen it had a screen saver that was hard to take my eyes off of when i have been awake the whole time my friend was sleeping beside me. then the werid notion that i was not the only one awake and that i have been hearing a faint sound of something for awhile but never really relized it was there and it has been there for awhile, and as soon as this idea came into my head i look towards my window that was on the right of me. my friend had put up blankets to keep the sun out, so i could not see anything. but the very second i mean (very) second i relized and looked towards the window i heard something shoot straight up into the sky and i \"can\" remember the sound and how fast it took off. it was like it knew when i relized it was there and it just took off. and as soon as it did my eyes also caught the computers screen and it froze the second that this thing took off. ufo was the only explanation i could think of. then i lyed there scared cause i knew that it was out there by me for awhile i never listened close enough to hear the sound. i started questioning why my window, why me? and i couldnt explan so i just lyed there confused and frightened. soon i believe i might have heard some things talking to one another outside my window, i can remember the sounds they were making. i was very freaked out at this point scared that i was going to come face to face with a thing or things. i believe i started to cry and turned and woke up my friend in tears grabbing him and telling him there was something outside and i believe that were, aliens. the minute i woke him up our power went out for about 30 secs to a min. which seemed forever since i was already terrified. he said he believed me but i really dont think he really understood the fact that those events took place and it was very real. i tried to report the sighting but did not go threw with it, the roomates kinda got me to blow it off. i did tell many people about it. i am back in ia and i have met a few people that also believe they have seen or witnessed for themselves ufo's or aliens. i just want to talk to an expert and tell them my story in real details. this really happened i need someone to actually care for once, what i say is true.

my roommates, edmond, came to my room and ask me what was the latest i would be willing to drive him to the louis armstrong airport in new orleans. he had just bought a vespa off of ebay from a guy in florida and had booked the earliest flight going out the next day. he knew i had class in the morning and wouldn't be able to take him then. his plan was just to have me drive him there late that night and camp out till his flight. \r\n\r\na little after midnight edmond, myself and my friend jimmy left baton rouge for new orleans. the drive took us a little over an hour. we dropped edmond off at the terminal and jimmy jumped in the front with me. we left the airport around 1:30 am. since it was very late and a week night there were hardly any other cars on the highway.\r\n\r\nwe had been driving for 30 or 40 minutes, and had exited the spill way bridge. we were traveling through a very desolate part of i-10 and their were no other cars in sight. there was marsh to our left and thick woods to our right. it was very dark, no street lights on this stretch of road. i noticed a bright green light near the top of my driver side window. i initially thought the light was a reflection from something in the cars cabin, like a cell phone or a check engine light on my dashboard. i looked around my cabin compartment but nothing was different. i looked back out the window and the light was still there. i now realized that the light wasn't a reflection but rather an actual orb of green light flying at about a 60 degree angle next to my car. the light was bright and was a soft green color. it was about the size of a beach ball. i was going about 75 mph and the glowing orb was keeping up with me, sometimes going a little faster, sometimes a little slower. i could see the orb navigating the top of the tree line. going behind some trees and in front of others. i couldn't believe it. i yelled to jimmy to lay in my lap and look up. he could not see the object from the passenger seat since it was almost over the car. i actually grabbed the back of his neck and tried to push his head into my lap. jimmy was like \"what the hell are you doing!\". i gave up on jimmy and i was barely even watching the road at this point, my eyes were glued on the object. all of a sudden it turned left at about 75-80 degrees and shot off over the marsh at an easy 200 mph. it left a slight green tail as it shot away through the tree tops. i told jimmy what i had seen, he didn't really say anything to me about it. i think it scared him or maybe he didn't believe me. i did not feel
