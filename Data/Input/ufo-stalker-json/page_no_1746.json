fill out a mufon form and sent me the link. i did not get around to it until now.  below, is the body of the email i wrote to mr. filer on july 8, 2011. i added some additional comments that my wife made, at the very bottom.\r\n\r\nat around 10 pm on the 4th of july my wife and i were heading south on rt47\r\nin cape may county nj between goshen and indian trail rd (rt147). i noticed\r\nand orange glowing ball in the sky off to north west of us and at first\r\nthought it to be fireworks. i watched for a short while realized it wasn't\r\nbursting or falling to the ground. i pointed it out to my wife and as i got\r\ncloser i lost site of it but my wife could still see it out of her side\r\nwindow. she opened the window and told me stop the car that i had to in her\r\nwords \"see this thing\". i pulled onto the shoulder and we both got out as\r\nthe object passed over our car going from west to east i could clearly see\r\na round object. it was bright orange. in it's center there appeared to be\r\nsomething like a brilliant reddish orange flame or burner and around the\r\nperimeter were orange dots. the whole object was bright orange. there was\r\na moderate but steady flow of traffic heading in both directions so i\r\nthought for sure other cars would stop but none did. the object made no\r\nnoise and kept traveling east until it was out of sight. as it went away\r\nform us it looked more like an orange ball again. i took a picture with my\r\nblackberry camera but it came out looking like a small dot in the sky. i\r\nbelieve it was overcast that evening as i don't recall seeing any stars.\r\ni have tried to rationalize what i saw, thinking it was some kind of 4th of\r\njuly display or possibly the bottom of a balloon gondola with a 4th of july\r\ndisplay under it but nothing made sense. i have never seen anything like it\r\nin my life and neither has my wife. \r\n\r\ni'm just surprised that i have not heard anything about anyone else seeing\r\nit. the way it traveled out of sight it was heading for wildwood on one of\r\nthe busiest nights of the year. maybe you folks have received some\r\nreports, i just can't believe we were the only ones to see this. the whole\r\nepisode lasted maybe 3 minutes. i can't say how large it was or how fast\r\nit was going. if you held bottle cap over your head and looked up at it,\r\nthat's about size it looked up in the sky but with the details i describe looking straight up under it were very clear.\r\n\r\n\r\nps my wife says the object appeared larger than a bottle cap, closer to the size of a basket ball and hovered directly overhead for about 30 seconds before moving east. i agree with her that it did seem to stop directly overhead and sit there for a short time.  i don't know what this thing was, i have never been a fan of ufo's. i have never seen anything like this in my life and neither has my wife.  we went home thinking wow, that's all i can say.  i tried rationalizing that it was some sort observation balloon launched for 4th of july celebrations but, i have seen balloons before, this was not like any ballon i ever saw.  it resembled a round platform or disc from benieth. i took a picture of it with my cell phone when it was moving away from us but it turned out looking like a small dot in the black sky. every time i drive over that stretch of road now i picture that thing in my mind and wonder if i will ever see anything like it again.  it definitely changed my view of ufo's.

me it started pausing in the sky for a few min then continue its slow rate of speed to the southwest. when the object came closer to me i noticed it was flickering, kinda like if you were to stare at

at them i noticed that they were moving due north. for a moment i thought that their movement was an optical illusion, but then i saw that they were drawing nearer to the tree line. as they neared the trees i moved into my driveway to see them better. they were positioned one on top of the other, forming an invisible diagonal line. if you close one eye and hold two fingers out in front of you roughly five inches apart, that's how far apart they were from each other. i then noticed that the two \"stars\" were traveling at exactly the same speed and distance, never breaking stride from one another. i watched them until they disappeared from view behind the trees. i was very intrigued and curious about the lights, and wished i could've watched them longer. i don't know what they were,

they had a laser and was using it to cut something and that alien picked up what appeared to look like was a heart.I wanted to go over there to investigate to find the body but they took the body with

below deneb at about 50*\r\n���traveling between deneb and gienah cygni���\r\nvery dim lights. mostly noticed a dark shadow of a chevron shape or wide triangle.���\r\nobject looked to only be a couple thousand feet up. it was larger than the cesmas that fly over at a few hundred feet as they head in to land at the small airport north-east of me.���\r\nin my years of experience of watching flight patterns around my home, i have never seen anything take the path that the object did. i have also never seen a plane or helicopter with such dim lights. there was no flashing strobe at all. even when planes pass over at very high altitude i can easily see the regular faa required lights. what i saw last night looked like a huge bird at first due to lack of lights. my best view of it was as it passed from about 50* to 40*. i could see that it was not a bird. it was barely visible due to it being so dark colored. i have watched quite a few very large bids fly over late at night and it looked similar at first in the way that the light pollution illuminated the underside. if i had not been looking at those two stars right at that moment we would never of known it flew past us, that's how well it was camouflaged.������the object was obviously a craft of unknown type to me. it reminded me somewhat of the tr3b ���but more like a boomerang. it was quite large. it was very quiet. my husband and i thought we heard a very soft white noise, but we live close to a freeway and it was hard to tell. given that it flew from the east to west, if it was any type of conventional jet we should of easily heard it as it flew overhead and away from us. ���\r\nwhen i spotted the object and asked my husband, \"what is that?!\", a he confirmed seeing it, i turned and grabbed my binoculars from a few feet behind us. my husband was fixed on the object so i handed him the lenses. he states that it had very dim lights on it. one in front, then two set back slightly and two on either end point of a different color than the first 3. when i first saw the object the shape was easier to see due to the light cast by city lights. i could not see any protrusion at the back end. my husband did not see the shape of the craft as well as i did and he was unable to determine the body shape of it. he argues that it was possibly a dark colored ���executive jet. he bases this only on the lighting positions. i will attach a drawling of the light positions. i felt that it may of been a military craft. the airbase is to our south-west and it was at least heading west. my husband has some sort of explanation for everything, but i know a lot more about the sky around us and the objects in it. my whole life i have loved and learned about stars, satellites, planes, clouds and birds and such. ���so in my experiences, i have never seen this type of object in the sky. ���one other thing, my husband has seen the stealth bomber fly very low overhead when he lived near moffit airbase and he did not recognize this object as being the same.���\r\nthe link to include pictures is not active? i can't attach them.

ten minutes. i think this sighting may just be space debris, but what has me puzzled is all other space debris i have witnessed seemed to move across the sky very fast compared to the object i was seeing. i have included a star map of the orion region and highlighted the objects position and direction of movement. please explain if i witnessed space debris,satellite,pulsar,quasar ,variable star, double star,super nova, or ufo. thank you \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (name moved to fi box) cms 11/02/11 14:31 cst

observing/remembering form when this incident occured.\r\n\r\ni was a passenger in a car with 2 other people headed north on hwy 101 near leggett, ca around 1:30am. i noticed some lights through the windshield that somehow didn't look quite like airplanes usually do- it seemed to have more red/gold to it. the area we were driving through is forested with redwoods, has very rugged hills/mtns, and the road was very winding so it was difficult to keep the lights in view. there looked to be multiple colors (red, gold, whitish, and greenish or bluish) moving back and forth (or even rotating around) an object. in this regard, it was not that different from the way nav lights on a plane can sometimes look, but at this point it had become clear that it did not seem to have moved at all since i first saw it. as stated above, the area is mountainous, so i considered that it was someone's house atop a hill. it's a very rural area and the moon (just a sliver) had gone down a couple hours earlier (or behind the mtns anyway) so it was too dark for me to actually see the boundary between hill and sky. to me, it looked a bit too high to be the top of a hill, and then there was the fact that the lights were multi-colored and rotating (or whatever they were doing). however as it had been about 3min since i first observed the lights and they still hadn't seemed to move or change position/shape at all, i decided it must be someone's house on top of a very tall hill, having some sort of halloween disco party (hence the lights). i then lost sight of the lights and figured that was the end of that, but to my surprise, about ten minutes later, they appeared again. \r\n\r\nas we had covered some distance (traveling at about 65mph), it obviously could not have been a house on a hill, so i had the driver of the car stop so we could try to get a better look. the lights appeared to be at the same elevation as before, but perhaps were just a bit smaller, as if more distant. i couldn't really make out any other details about the lights. i tried to take a picture but my camera could not focus on distant lights in the dark. the lights then disappeared for a moment (behind tree or hill), thus confirming it wasn't a house, and then reappeared. a plane passed by to the west (the other lights being towards the north) and unlike the lights i was observing, it was very obviously a plane. the driver of the car felt that the \"strange\" lights i was seeing were just lights on another plane and the other passenger did not see the \"strange\" lights (or the plane). as it was cold and late, i gave up observing and got back in the car. as we were pulling back onto the highway, i noticed the lights seemed to be slightly more distant. i do think it's possible (even probable) that it was just a plane, that what i had seen 10min before was a completely different plane, and they just both happened to look strange to me and seemed to move very slowly (or perhaps not move at all)- perhaps becuz it was a cold and very clear night? almost as soon as we started driving again, i lost sight of the lights for good. \r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

noticed a passenger jet approaching following the curvature of the earth with contrails streaming, giving it the appearance of climbing....To a point, so i figured i could now judge how high the silver object was. this silver object was travelling much faster that the jet approaching each other, it would seem due to the speed difference that the silver object was lower...But when the flight paths intersected the jet was under the object because i could still see 2/3rds of the silver object and all of the jet. so as i'm throwing out expletives of amazement i noticed that the silver object was not getting lower in the sky...It was going higher, it went up and out, not the downward following the curvature as did the jet. the time was 3:31 pm, i went to an aviation map for real-time tracking, went to replay the flights over orange county, n.Y. and it wouldn't do the replay for that time of day, and it was travelling north to south , the jet was south to north.","distance":"Over

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was standing outside on my driveway with the outside flood lights on, talking on the phone with a friend in california and suddenly saw a bright white light fly over the treeline coming from the north. i told my friend she would never believe what i was watching and described it to her as it continued to fly towards me until it got straight overhead and then somewhat gradually turned towards the east southeast and continued on that path until it flew out of sight over the horizon. it was bright like the appearance of a star, and only about 500 feet overhead. it was so bright that i could not make out any shape to it other than a basically spherical shape as a star would look. it did not make a sound, and appeared to almost be made of light as opposed to having lights on it. i know almost as much about physics as anyone on earth, and knew that what i was watching was supposed to be impossible. almost as soon as i saw it i thought to run inside and get my video camera but remembered that the battery was dead as luck would have it...There is no doubt in my mind that if the battery had not been dead the world would have definitive proof of the existence of ufo's that are not man made. although it seemed to possibly be made of light, it did not light up the area as i would think something like that would to have been flying so close to the ground. i also realized that since it changed its flight path, it had to have been controlled by some form of intelligence. took me weeks to wrap my head around what i had seen because the physics of such a craft should be impossible. i tried to identify it as anything i could possibly dismiss it as man made, but even after weeks of thinking about any type of physical laws that could make such a craft man made, i was left with the obvious conclusion that it was not. this was a very difficult realization for me because although i had always kept an open mind about ufo's, i did not believe it was possible for them to visit earth because the physics of such long distance space travel should be impossible. i even talked to retired air force pilots who could not explain it, although they told me of rumors of pilots seeing such things that i now know have been referred to as foo fighters. now this is where my testimony gets hard to believe for anyone other than those ppl who have been with me and seen these objects. since '07, i and whoever has been with me at such times have seen around 75 ufo's that cannot be explained as satellites, shooting stars, or anything but what they are. after my sighting in '07 i started watching the night sky frequently but did not see anything else until spring of '08. since then, my parents girlfriend, her son, my aunt, and i have no idea how many other ppl in this area have seen similar ufo's usually from spring until around the 4th of july, except this summer we have seen a few later than the 4th. none have been as close as the first one i saw, but i have videoed several that came close enough to video in the spring and summer of '08. i have also found that if a high powered spot light, or usually a high powered green laser are shinned at the crafts, they will sometimes light up about 75 percent brighter than before a light is shinned at them. usually they will light up somewhere suddenly, fly a distance and then dim out to nothing. we have also seen them fly at varying speeds, sometimes so fast they travel great distances vs they're altitude in a matter of seconds. we have even seen them suddenly accelerate to speeds so fast that they leave a light trail and then disappear. my mom and i watched one fly over they're house at an altitude of about 800 feet curving almost the entire path and then disappear. i have seen some that pulseate, slowly going from dim to bright and back and forth. we have also seen many in blairsville ga, and one brilliant one just last saturday night in jasper co ga where i own some timber land, and get this....I have a strange photo of something that seems to be greyish green with black eyes that seemed to be inspecting a trail camera that i use to get pictures of deer on my land in jasper co. it moved so fast when the camera took the picture though that it was just a blur, so the picture is inconclusive, but i cannot understand what else it could be but what it looks like. i have searched the net since '08 trying to find some reputable source to report all this to, but this is the first site i have found that i think might be capable of actually finding some answers to all this. i called one ufo group one time and told the guy that if someone would just spend about a week here in the spring that i could prove to them or anyone that ufo's exist and i could show anyone things that should be impossible flying over the area, but he did not believe me and said i needed to write a report and send it in. that's rather frustrating when you can show someone ufo's in the night sky but they won't take the time to come see them. why should i report something that they would not come see in person i figured? lol granted the window of opportunity is not what it was in '07-'10, because we have not seen very many this past summer which is appalling to me that i could not find one single group dedicated to proving these things instead of just making money off the speculation about them. i have a few theories about these things, but nothing i can still satisfy myself with, and things i can't understand almost drive me crazy...Lol i've never seen anything until '07 or encountered anything i could not figure out if i set my mind to it, and now i have seen things i can't explain and have no way of finding out more about them. anyway, i will be more than happy to do anything to help find answers cause i want to know what they are in the worst way now...There's a big difference in even believing something exists and knowing for sure....\r\nalso, i don't know how to upload my videos or anything else right now, but will be happy to send a copy of them by mail or something if i need to. thanks...","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
