smoke a cigar. her apartment was on the beach and as i looked across st joe bay,i saw a brilliant white light off the tip of cape san blas. i knew that it was not a planet or a star because it wasn't there the night before.I got my binoculars out and when i looked at the white light i saw the most brilliant red and green lights i have ever seen and no trace of white light . the lights did not flicker but remained constant. as i am looking at what ever it was, i saw an identical green and red light appear to separate from it and start to go downward slowly. when it had sank down to the point where i was about to loose sight of the top most object in my binocs.(i was resting them on the balcony railing to keep vibrations down), it stopped and started slowly rising back up. it then rejoined the first object. it then started moving in a westward direction very slowly. after it had moved a short distance it once again stopped , and once again a red and green light separated from it and started going down slowly. it did the exact same thing again. after it rose back up and rejoined the other object, it looked as though it took a turn southward and just faded away. i would add that i was a fire fighter in the air force and worked on the flight line. these colored lights i saw were unlike any color i have ever seen. the closest to them would be the day-glo paints from the black light days and even that was not as brilliant. i would also add that at first i thought it may have been an f-22 raptor because tyndal air force base was testing them at the time and they can hover but i don't thik they can do what i saw.\r\n by the way, my wife witnessed it as well. she had gone to the store and returned just in time to see it.I gave her the binocs and asked what do you

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Last night my wife and i were travelling east on the bluegrass parkway after trick-or-treating back home in owensboro with our 16 month old little girl and family. we've lived in lexington for years but we make this trip back to owensboro every  halloween to trick or treat with my nieces and nephews. last night at 1am i was coming up to the first bardstown exit. this exit has a small hotel and a gas station and is always unusually well lit. as i rounded the corner and the overpass came into view i noticed a plane (?) with bright lights in the direction of the hotel. i was immediately struck by the altitude and size of the plane. it was very, very low and large. 747 large. it was travelling southwest. as i passed under the overpass i looked up and it was directly overhead. i looked up was able to catch a glimpse of it because the light from the exit dimly lit the underbelly. it wasn't smooth or very aerodynamically shaped. nothing like you'd associate with a current gen stealth aircraft like the b-2, f-22 or jsf. it also wasn't like a 1st gen stealth aircraft with faceted angles. it was very \"mechanical\" looking for lack of a better term. i only saw it briefly and only the center portion but at the time the closest thing my mind could match the shape and struture to was, oddly enough, an f-14 tomcat. but much, much bigger. the other oddity was the speed. if it was a jet then it would have been dangerously close to stalling. i honestly think it might have been hard to even generate aerodynamic lift at that speed. it's hard to judge the exact speed given the size of it but using landmarks and reference points i'd have to guessimate 120 mph. \r\n \r\nat this point i was rather confused and having trouble making sense with what i'd just seen. 30 seconds to a minute later i look off to the left side of the road i see another one. this one had already passed so i was getting the view from the rear. i pulled off to the side and as i ran over the rumble strips my wife woke up (she was asleep in the back with our little girl). i rolled down the driver's window and watched it continue off into the distance. it was wide. how wide is hard to say. at this point by wife is wondering why in the world we're sitting on the side of the parkway. i started to drive off and told her that i had just seen something very unusual. as i fumbled around and tries to explain it, to my amazement i see another one directly in from of us. my wife comments that it looks like a helicopter. i take a second and agree because it looks smaller and is travelling low and slow like you'd expect to see from a helicopter,. but as we continue on and watch it fly into the distance (over the coors distributing plant of the parkway) we realize that we'd only seen the side view when it was in front of us. as it travelled further away we were perpendicular to it we were then able to see the width of the craft. again, very wide. keep mind my wife and i just saw an a380 in miami two weeks ago so we're both familiar with large aircraft. \r\n \r\na couple miles up the road as we conversed about what we just witnessed we notice a 4th craft off to the right side of the road. i immediately pulled off the parkway (in a construction zone), turned off the car and jumped out. she rolled her window down in the back and we both watched it fly by completely silent. completely silent. no thump-thump, no tail rotor, no turbines, nothing.\r\n \r\ni'm completely stumped here. i don't for one second believe these craft were something other worldly but not much about them makes sense. if they were covert military aircraft then why such a low flight pattern that allows then to be spotted from the ground? if they're covert then why bother with lights? why would a pilot risk flying so low in such a large aircraft? i'm hesitant to start to think outside the box on how these craft were able to remain airborn at such low speeds and do so silently but i'm out of possible answers.\r\n \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

(10-31-11).  we were stopped at a light on a busy street when i noticed a huge, circular object moving right toward us from the north.  it had pulsating and blinking multi-colored lights, as well as extremely bright, white lights.  it came very close and hovered over all the cars and buildings, through several light changes (everyone who saw it just sat where they were!), then slowly began to move off toward the sw in an  arcing path.  when we first saw it, it was as if it was approaching us with its bottom facing us, (as if on a vertical orientation, and as it retreated, it turned flat (or horizontal), at times moving very slowly, then accelerating very quickly.  it would completely disappear from time to time.  we followed it, both of us taking turns video-ing it with our phones.  it at times acted as if it were playing a game with us, hiding,then appearing very close so we could see details, including a dome-like appendage on the bottom-center.  then it would speed off, eventually making a complete circle over our area and winding up hovering over the neighborhood where we had originally been headed.  it disappeared again, as we got out of the car to go tell our friends, and many people in the neighborhood came running up asking if we saw it, too!  it returned from low on the northern horizon, hovered directly over us, at times turning on its end, as before, and at other times performing all sorts of movements that seemed to defy regular laws of physics!  someone said the news was saying it was a group of 7 precision-flight small plane operators, performing a fly-by over the football stadium, but we saw this very closely and it was not a group of small planes (or large ones)!  it was completely circular and everything moved as one, without fail.  it made very little noise, a pleasant, low, oscillating hum, that i have never heard before, nor had anyone else.  definitely not the sound of any plane or helicopter i have ever heard.  this sky-line ballet went on for over an hour and toward the end, the craft had turned to a horizontal position and forcefully ejected a much smaller, red, orb-like object, then shot off never to be seen by us again.  the red orb hovered for many minutes, its light just pulsating and varying in intensity of frequency, then it began moving, slowly at first, then it also shot off in the same direction as the large craft and we never saw it again, either.  it had no sound.  we all felt very affected on many levels.  we were, of course, very excited, skeptical (kept trying to google any news about it but phones were not working well), happy (no one seemed to  feel frightened or upset), and tingly.  personally, i felt like i had lost a huge chunk of time, and felt an enormous amount of high-frequency energy around me and running through me!  i felt hopeful, and could not sleep the rest of the night.  the small children were also elated, and had lots of energy as well.  today, i could find no news on tv or the net, other than mufon, about this!  i am just so sad that my phone camera could not capture the beauty and enormity of this thing!","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1

blazed accross the sky and then slowed down andstarted to blink, red/white and then grew very dim and disappeared. i didnt see itanymore.I have noticed things like this a few timse out here, we're in a very rural area with very little air traffic.. we call them blinkies, and at times have seen up to 27 of them in a 10 minute period or so.  sometimes they seem like they have a dim white glow around them,,, other times they just literally appear from nowhere and either blink, or suddenly start moving.  they can stop and hover, grow very dim, get very bright, change to a reddish color, and scoot extremely fast accross the sky.  they can change directions like a barrel racer, and can get very low to the ground at times.  i used to be very scared of them, but ive seen them so often out here

can explain. i was in altadena tonight eaton canyon, and was hiking in the mountains from about 3pm until around 745pm.  i was there after dark, i was texting for about 30 min at the and of my hike looking down at my phone facing north at the mountains, i started looking up at them after i finished, i had been hiking praying in this spot for over 3 hours a spot i go to often to meditate,  i knew from star/moon gazing earlier during the day up until night, that the moon was behind me to the left. so, at approx 7pm (i checked the time on my phone right after) as i turned around to check the moon's position, which was back down the valley (i think facing south west), \r\n\r\ni immediately noticed about 45deg up to the left of the moon, there were 3 \"stars\",  two were brighter and i know i handn't noticed or seen them before, they were strangely brighter than the star below them, but about same size, they got brighter as i watched, they seemed stationary at first so thats why i thought they were stars, and both stayed at the same angle almost floating, there was another star below them i was using to compare them figuring they were just bright stars as i watched i noticed the two bright ones started to move/pivot just slightly to the rt, at that point i felt they were really not stars  but something else, intirely, i felt this odd feeling come over me like something was observing me, they were floating and then did a pivot to rt, seemed to  fall at first then rise then fade away or just move away i thik the the upper rt, away from me at incredible speeds,or just faded, of this im not sure, it was hard to say.  i only saw two white star orbs,  but there may have been more, i now have the feeling it had been there longer than i realized it was up there before turning around and seeing them,  so my visual sigting might vary from others if anyone else saw this, and it was short, it was about 30 sec, it was not a flash or quick thing.  i observed them brighten, fade and move together, it was very strange.\r\n\r\nim pretty sure they were connected, as they moved in tandem and faded in tandem, they were at first stationary, kinda hovering in one place i was using the star below as a reference, and also to compare brightness, at first they were above a fixed star one above the other, like at this angle to my view i will use a slash  /.   vertically one above one below at slight angle, they kinda shimmered got brighter as they stayed in  place they were similar brightness to a star slightly brighter then got much brighter before fading, and they pivoted/moved,  that's why at first,thought they were stars but, then they appeared to fall to the rt. just so much movement that i was checking myself to see if they were moving.. i shouted \"their/your moving!\" almost to convince myself they werent.  \r\n\r\ni watched and watched for several seconds, then they seemed to just gently fall to the right in tandem, hover, then they either faded or rose away from me it appeared they faded up to the rt not just out..  it was very strange, these two were just above another star on the horizon to the rt, that i dont know the name of yet, (but i will) , these two were bright enough and shimmering  a very bright light so much that i gasped when i first saw them, and really said it outloud to my surprise \"what the heck is that?\" \r\n\r\nto be honest i figured at first maybe the clouds had covered the two \"stars\" so thats why they faded, but i watched  and watched to see if they reappered behind a the cloud bank, but it really was clear tonight actually, with some marine layer, which is what i figured hid them since they \"faded\",  but what was strange is the star that was below them didnt fade, so i realized there were no clouds.   \r\n\r\nsomething happened i want to know if others saw this, someone had to!\r\n\r\nsorry i dont have pictures, since it was dark and only lasted 30 sec or so!\r\n\r\nthanks!","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with

lights on, as i kept watching they werent moving they were hovering, then the one a little lower, lights got dimmer and dimmer, i was in awe never have ever seen anything like this,  then the other one did the same thing just slowly dimed its light's out. best way to discribe it would be the phoinex light's all over again with this being in  belton  missouri and only 2 of them and for a shorter time by best guess is they were there for a min or 2 i watched them for at least one min.
