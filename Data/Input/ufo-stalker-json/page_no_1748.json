orb just droped out of the sky straight down in an amazing speed. it droped all the way below the tree lines on the state park to my left. i could not see where it went next. around a minute later i saw a strange \"cigar\" shape object cross directly in front of me on 95s coming from the same direction the orb dropped. at first i though it was just a plane because bwi airport is near the location. but just when i though it was just an airplane the object suddenely either turned into or turned on some kind of light switch that lit up the whole object. it was so bright i had to turn away for a second. the crazy thing was when i looked up again i no longer saw the cigar shaped object but saw a bright orange orb in its place. as i watched in aw as the object flew out of sight like a light switch was flicked again the orange orb went out and in its place was the cigar-plane like object again. i was speechless.....","distance":"21-100

marks on my back. i got no response whatsoever. \r\n\r\nbut i'm going to report this anyway for the other people in the area that are seeing and reporting the strange goings ons. mufon may not be interested in getting to the bottom of this, but i am. my documentation will continue as long as the activity continues.\r\n\r\ni go outside almost every night and sightings have been continued to be consistent. including paranormal activity that has started happening in the house since the beginning of october, and many unexplained power outages/fluctuations. myself and three witnesses (my sister and our mutual friends, melissa and renee) were sitting in the kitchen one night when my sister and i noticed what we thought was smoke under the table. we just kind of brushed it off until a few minutes later when my friend, melissa, who was sitting next to me, and i noticed something at the same time that alarmed us to the point where we were screaming about it. across the table from us sat renee. behind renee we saw what looked like a smoke/mist and it seemed to be manifesting from nothing and then it began to swirl in a spiral... the only way i can describe it is that it looked like some sort of portal opening up. like something you'd see in a movie. it was only there for a few seconds and then it was gone. it was enough to frighten my friend into leaving as she is extremely religious and sees these type of events as evil & not to be messed with. that's when things inside the house started getting weird. not just at my house, but my sister said she'd been experiencing strange things inside her apartment as well. lights turning off and on at will. the two basement doors (which are locked at all times) were found wide open on more than one occasion. tapping on the windows when no one is outside. doorknobs jiggling and turning. objects going missing for days only to reappear in the very spot they were left. other objects being moved around in the house all by themselves. banging and thuds heard within the house... strange voices being heard. it goes on. it can only be described as a haunting, but i can't help but feel that this is connected to the ufo activity. \r\n\r\nthis report is primarily for the landing site i discovered in my yard.\r\n\r\ni am willing to let investigator's come down here and take a look at the site, but i recommend that they do it as soon as possible before the site gets too disturbed by weather and animals. i have gathered grass and soil samples and am willing to let investigator's borrow these samples and/or take some of their own.\r\n\r\ni'm incredibly alarmed by this, and had a very difficult time sleeping last night. i have created two videos, which i've uploaded to my youtube channel which pretty much explains it all. i've also taken about a dozen pictures, which are in the videos, but they can be sent separately. here are the links:\r\n\r\n[links moved to field investigator section/cms/tg]\r\n\r\ni think the second video shows it much better.\r\n\r\nfor others in the area that are seeing/experiencing the same & would like to discuss what's happening with someone who isn't a part of mufon, you can get in touch with me through my youtube channel. just drop me a message! i would love to hear and compair stories! \r\n\r\n[cms note: youtube channels are not advertised on our cms

airplanes coming and going from dfw airport(120mi away). i have seen many,many, airplanes come and go, i can pick a airplane out of the night sky in a sec.\r\n   but what i have been seeing more frequently is very different.\r\n\r\nat around (9:30) on 10/30/11 i saw ,what with a ~non-blinking~ light, was extremly high up in the sky and would have been easy to miss.However i watched this light move for a few minutes then it seemed to get further and further away untill it was gone!\r\n\r\nthrough out the night until dawn!, i saw several of these things. there were lots of planes out for me to compare distance and speed too. \r\n\r\nthe 2nd object i saw was wierd, i was focused on the sky between the bottom of orions belt and the star sirius at approx. 5:30am when a \"starlike\" light slowly appeared outta nowhere.. i would say that it was brighter than any star in the orion constalation but not quite as bright as sirius... it remained stationary and bright for at least five minutes, then it dimmed a little (to about half) and started moving at a steady rate from south to north until it was out of my sight, not because of the curvature of the earth but because it got so far away.... it was very,very high up and seemed to not be in our atmosphere at all. i could see and hear commercial airliners passing *far* beneath flashing and blinking on there way to there destinations.\r\n\r\nthe 3rd object was a little different, i was facing due east and looking straight up and slightly to the south when i saw another light slowly pulse out of a pitch black space in the sky.. it was really bright and already moving when i spotted it, the light faded to black as soon as it reached its brightest point.. then it lit up again further down its previous course but this time it stayed lit for several seconds to a few minutes and i could easily track it moving against the stars headed north. again very very high up there.. i watched it go all the way across the big dipper and finally like the other object lost sight of it because it was so far away.. \r\n\r\n   4th there was and object right around 5:45 that appeared low in my view looking due west.. saturn was approx 25degrees above the horizon and also due west of me.. it traveled from as far as i could see north. headed south until it was just north and below saturn in my view.. then it stopped!.. it was a pretty bright, steady, white light, (not blinking)flashing or changing color at all. it seemed to be really close(in our air space).. i could see planes going over it, headed(east-west),which is typically the highest planes i see because they are not going to dfw, and also i saw planes on approach to dfw passing behind it relative to my possition.{dfw is 120miles from me south by south east}. i noticed and watched a plane traveling from the ne to sw, headed to dfw, with its lights clear and flashing.. it looked like it was going to pass very close to the object.. and it did! when the plane got to close, the object went black! and after the plane passed it lit up again and started heading south once again...\r\n\r\nfinally at 6:00-6:30 i noticed a \"star\" traveling due east.. it was very high like the others and moving really fast.. not streeking, but fast, and with purpose.. it traveled from as far as i could see west to as far as i could see east in like 1 min..Again view not limited because of the curve of the earth, this thing had to be in space or at least orbit... it was of medium brightness and stayed lit the whole time.. i saw a shooting star cross in front of it and the object seemed to be way above the shooting star, so it must have been out of our atmosphere at least.  this one was the best one, simply because of its rate of speed. it stood out like a sore thumb.. again i had planes flying over head and it clearly was not a commercial flight....\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat the heck was it??? i didnt see anything besides traveling lights and the best i can figure is that it might be satellites of the space station \r\ni hope!! i felt very much like a bacteria in a petrie dish tonight, any explanation would be welcomed and weighed.. \r\n\\p.S. this is the first time i have been compelled to report this but its not the first of these i've seen these here.. it was just that there were so many last night it kinda worried me a bit...\r\n","distance":"Over One

stopped at a stop sign when i saw what appeared like a shooting star fly very fast in front of me going from the east to the southwest. i just thought it was a shooting star but it was unusually large and very bright. as i headed southwest on a small street i checked my watch as i was running late for an 8pm movie.  it was 7:21pm. i again looked up and in front of me just in the middle of the crescent moon i saw what i thought was a shooting star seemingly turn into an object with varying, pulsating colors.  it came to a sudden stop as if it was targeting that very spot. then it hovered in front of what appeared to be a small airplane headed southbound.  i thought the plane was going to crash into the object, but instead it looked like it dropped altitude quickly to avoid a collision.  all this time the bright pulsating, blue, yellow, orange and red with white lights object hovered in front of the plane or what looked like in the planes path.  i didn't see the plane again until it reappeared and seemed to be zig zagging away from the object in a southbound direction. it was a clear, cloudless evening and you could see the object with it's continuous strobe, pulsating lights just hover for at least a minute or so. then the object suddenly did a 45% degree turn and took off toward the east.  it then stopped near or just below a \"star\"; possibly venus.  it hovered there several seconds; still with the strobe and pulsating lights then took off toward the east; in the same direction it had come. i was so startled! i didn't have my camera and couldn't find my blackberry long enough to try for a picture.  it happened so fast. during this entire viewing of this object i was weaving in and out of traffic and traversing from lane to lane trying to keep an eye on it.  i briefly lost a few seconds of contact view when i had to go under a freeway  underpass.  but as soon as i made contact view again i kept an eye on it. the funny thing is my husband said i left the house at exactly 7:20pm. he said he told me to be careful with traffic as i was rushing around and i was trying to make the 8pm movie in tempe with my niece. but when i called my niece and told her about this sighting, she asked me to be careful with traffic and asked me where i was...I said i was at the freeway 101 and chaparral approximately 15 miles from where i live.  but when i looked at my watch (a new s/w); it was only 7:22!! i didn't realize that according to my watch this whole even took only 1 minute until when i returned home later that evening after the movie and my husband asked me what time this all took place and i said about 7:22pm.  he told me what time i called him and told me to look at my blackberry to see what time i called my niece and it was at 7:22pm. that was even more startling! i have not ever seen anything like this.  my immediate family understood.  then yesterday evening my husband said he saw an article about a ufo in a local phoenix newspaper so i read it and listened to the video clip and it sounds and is described by others as i had witnessed it.  the rest of the evening i was feeling very confused; couldn't recall most of the movie and kept losing things.  something normally i don't do.  i hope this helps. thank you for your time. attached is my sketch; drawn to the best of my recollection.

was just casually looking around in the sky while sitting in my lawn chair.  then to the right of me (northwest) i observed a small group of 4 balloons that somebody or something (probably accidentally) had just released in the sky.  it had an interesting formation: two bright neon orange color balloons on top floating, and two dark black color balloons appearing as dead weight which mostly stayed towards the bottom of the group of balloons.  i thought that was an interesting formation and colors, so i took some pictures of them. the two orange balloons were floating and pulling outwards like a \"v\" while the two black balloons were pretty much almost clinging to each other like dead weight balloons.  nothing really odd about them traversing towards me: it was seen in the northwest while it quickly traversed somewhat south and at a low altitude. the wind  at that time appeared to be blowing directly from the west.\r\n\r\nthen around 11:55 am in the same direction and area of the earlier balloon sighting, , i saw an enormous amount of individual white color balloons along with one big group of orange color balloons which those were tied together as a single group lagging behind the individual white balloons or bottom area of the formation.  just with the naked eye, the orange group looked like just one big orange object slowly floating in the sky while the white balloons looked like scattered white dots in the sky that were very slowly drifting upwards.  these mass group of traversing balloons which were sparsely separated from each other is the first time (since living at this address a good amount of time) that i had ever seen in that large amount traversing in the sky that surrounds my area.  because i didn't have any pictures of such a large group of flying balloons, i decided to take lots of pictures of those balloons too. the formations of balloons was unique: the orange group of balloons at the bottom of the large area of white balloons that seem to come together like a point as you followed the formation upwards in the flock of balloons.  nothing looked suspicious of them at the moment; however, it didn't dawn on me then that the wind was blowing from the west, and the objects were somewhat heading south or southwest in direction.  as i continued taking pictures of these mass of balloons and observing their flight behavior too, i noticed that the balloons seemed to slowly traverse upwards, but not in the expected way i assume balloons would be typically traversing. the group didn't really spread outwards or move about, but the balloons seem to move in unison like they were all just one big group tied together with strings.  there always seemed to be just one single balloon at the very top of the group.  the balloon formation a few times almost resembled something like the shape of a pine tree: pointy on top while enormous and wide at the bottom.  nonetheless, the balloons still appeared to be like balloons traversing.\r\n\r\nthen about 2 minutes later, i spotted an orange balloon coming from the same general area where the large group of balloons were first seen which the orange balloon was moving towards me at an angle and it was also moving at a quick pace and low altitude.  at first, i didn't know for sure exactly what type object was traversing until i took one picture of it and reviewed it via the camera. when i recognized it as an orange balloon traversing via the camera's picture reviewer, that's when it dawn on me about the group of balloon's heading.   the orange balloon which was at low altitude but steadily going upwards was quickly traversing in the air; yet, the large group of balloons which came from the same general area were not moving in the same direction as the orange balloon was traversing east.  the group of balloons were just slowly going upwards, but they were traversing somewhat southwest while the wind appeared to blowing directly from the west according to the swaying of leaves and branches on the trees nearby.  that's the part that doesn't make any sense to me.  it may be possible to have an air current going in one direction at a lower altitude while there is a change to the air flow and direction in the higher atmosphere; but the group of balloon had to pass through the lower altitude to reach the higher altitude hence the confliction of balloon travel of the large group of balloons and the orange balloon just seen.  i then realize the opportunity to include landmarks while capturing pictures together of the large group of balloons and single orange balloon traversing near me.  the elevation of the group of balloons were very high in the sky (possible 500 or less feet) while the orange balloon traversing near me is estimated to be about 100 feet or less in altitude.  after the orange balloon had pass by my area, i occasionally still took pictures of the group of balloons.  last sighting of the group of balloon was around 12:10 pm which was now in the southwest direction at an altitude of possibly 2,000 feet.  no white dots in the sky were seen; however, the orange group of balloons were barely still seen  which further below the orange group of balloon was another object  (not seen but on camera) presumably a single white balloon with something like another object hanging from it.\r\n\r\nthen at 12:13 pm while looking almost southwest in direction, i observed a small white object that seemed to just instantly appear in the sky.  the altitude it seemed to be at may had been between 100 to 200 feet.  it's size appeared to be slightly smaller than a silver dollar coin. it was quickly traversing in the air towards the southeast (possibly with the wind and same rate the wind was blowing.)  when i first saw it, i used manual focus on it.  then after maybe 3 or 4 pictures of it, i decided to try the auto-focus on it since the object appeared big enough for the camera to possibly automatically focus on it.   luckily, the auto-focus didn't get fussy by trying to lock onto the target which sometimes occurs on moving objects or even on very small objects. the camera quickly focused onto the object which made me very happy by it doing that; i then quickly set the auto-focus lever back to manual mode.  during the middle of the event, another dark round object appear close to the white object i was observing .  i didn't want to take any chances of loosing track of the white object or wasting any time trying to focus on the other object.  then near the end of the event,  i also noticed with my left eye a helicopter looking similar to the mesa police type quickly cruising through the area at close range while i had my telescopic lens pointed close to being straight up in the sky.  the white object eventually went over the roof which i quickly went to the north wall of the patio to see if i could catch a glimpse of the white object there.  the white object couldn't be seen in the sky in that area which means the white object went directly over my roof. i didn't bother to go outside the patio since there would had been too many structures in the way of continuing viewing it; not to mention i have neighbors who may find that being a little bizarre in behavior on my part which i'm trying to quit literally avoid that type of possible embarrassment.  to my recollection while viewing the object through the camera lens, the white object appeared to had been wiggling through the air almost like a squirming worm; yet, it does not look anything solid in features like a worm.  the event lasted less than 1 minutes.  now what i found really interesting wasn't until after i download the picture onto my computer.  the reddish color object i saw which just seem to appear was captured on camera.  there was also other round objects captured which together almost seem to form a triangular shape which the white object being the head-point.  during the entire time i observed the white object, not once did i see it disappear on me.  it was in my sight the entire time while observing it via the camera lens.  in one picture i took, where the white object should had been in the center of the picture was not there.  i only captured 2 pictures that show the other objects. what's makes the two pictures bizarre is the fact that the first picture with those other reddish round objects shows the white object which is what i been focusing on.  then the next picture i took thereafter still shows those other objects; yet, the white object which is what i been focusing on is nowhere to be seen in that picture except for those other objects.  in each picture of the other objects, i drew a dotted line to each other object.  both picture match almost identically as with just those other objects; yet, that second picture has no white object which leaves me puzzled as to where the white object disappeared which i had been focusing on?  the area where the white object should had been is nowhere to be seen but just a blue sky.  the only other thing i could think of that may explain the white object disappearance that it must have moved faster than the shutter speed of 1/160 second while at f/9; or it must have just simply wink out for a brief moment at the time i took the picture which i didn't notice.  all the other pictures i took shows the white object except in that one picture showing those other objects.  the camera does have a small time delay between depressing the camera button and actually capturing a picture.  but i just don't see how i couldn't captured the white object in that one picture when i had captured the white object in all the other pictures.\r\n \r\nthen later in the afternoon, i saw a semi-flashing object that was also reddish in color while looking towards the south as i was about to go inside my house.  i wasn't exactly sure what it was that i was observing; however, i suspected and presume it to be a mylar balloon traversing because i seen them flashing like that in the sky in the past.  i took some pictures of it which the sun was near the object's location.  i did a quick review which the picture i viewed just happen to be when the object was turn sideways flat.  at that moment it look like totally something else somewhat similar to a few pictures i had captured in the past, so i continued taking more pictures of the object when it started to head away from the sun.  i did another quick look in the camera reviewer, and i discovered that the object which was traversing was a red star shape (happy face) mylar balloon (with a small string) reflecting sunlight.  it looks different when the skinny part laying flat and only thing seen in that first picture which i quickly reviewed.  so my first initial thought and assumption was correct.","distance":"101-500

to add that i reported the 1st event to my family, friends and girlfriend. none of them believed me.\r\n\r\ni was travelling from los angeles to riveside (west to east) with my girlfriend in her car. i was driving and she was on the passenger side. again it was either hwy 10 or 60 and the approximate time was 1am. somewhere near the city of fontana.\r\n\r\nall of a sudden, my girlfriend exclaimed \"what is that!\" i looked to where her attention was drawn. on the south side of the freeway, there was a large empty field that was lit up like a baseball stadium. there was nothing else there except the tall grass in the field and some trees lining the freeway.\r\n\r\njust above the trees, hovering was a large blue/white object. it was stationary but it cast a very, very bright light down upon the field. the object then started to descend towards the field. i then told my girlfriend that was the object i had observed 2 week ago and that i was not lying.\r\n\r\nwe were driving in the fast lane so i started to pull the car over to get on the shoulder. my intention was to stop and see what it was. i remember thinking to myself, i had to find out what this thing was. then all of sudden my girlfriend stood up in her seat (yes stood up but she was hunched over due to the ceiling of the car) and started screaming hysterically that we were not going over there. she said it like 3-4 times and then grabbed the steering wheel. i lost control of the car for a brief moment.\r\n\r\ni then told my girlfriend we were not going over there and to let me drive home. she calmed down a bit but remained standing on her car seat for a little while longer. i drove the car back into the fast lane. while driving away from the field, i could still observe the object in the rear view mirror and the brightly lit field. i lost site of the object and the field due to the trees lining the freeway.\r\n\r\nthe next day, i reported the encounter to my family and friends but this time i had another witness with me. my girlfriend corroborated the event but she refused to discuss the event further.\r\n\r\neventually, my relationship ended with my girlfriend but we remained in contact for a few years. every now and again, i would bring this night up but she always refused to discuss it. she said it really bothered her and she did not want to talk about it.\r\n\r\nthis second encounter occured 22 years ago. to this day, i wonder what would have occurred if i was able to pull the car over to the shoulder...","distance":"101-500

grey, seemless, took up same area as house,behind the one i was working in the yard of, but also a portion of the one i was working on.  it stopped even with me where i was standing. it was like another dimension.  it opened a space just behind the pilots, i could see inside a woodlike wall with blinking red lights,switches, the 2 pilots wore grey uniforms with hat w/black bill, ensignia on arm.\r\ni was eye to eye with one closest to me, my mind flew thru my childhood and the one closest to me said {in my thoughts} \"yes,we have watched you since you were a child\". \r\ni could not move, i was not frightened, i could see the hair on his ears.  they were very dark , neat, i could feel the superiority of them. i wanted to ask questions but i only thought of one other incident of hearing and feeling something, they said they would be back.\r\ni wanted to look at the size, it took up the same space as the top half of a house behind the one i was working on, i could see like port holes with indentations only in my periphial vision of the size, how smooth and the color of the metal.  it was a soft deep grey, so smooth, rounded on sides.\r\ni could not take my eyes off the one entity closest to me, he had on dark large like sunglasses.  at one point he turned to the other pilot and they communicated, then he looked back at me. i didnt know what they said, but it was about me.They both watched me, but the one closest to me did the communication.\r\nthen all of a sudden i could move, i tried to look around, and it had disappeared, no noise, and all i could think was nothing that big could leave that fast, but did.\r\nafter a few minutes i would feel like i could not remember, then i could.  i will never forget this event for the rest of my life.  it haunts me, but i do know i will see them again.  i cant get this thought out of my mind.\r\ni do not know if the space they opened was for me to see or to go with them. i could feel others were on that craft.\r\ni have watched the program of mufon tonight, i never knew who to tell, as i dont tell very many people about my experience, but i think of it everyday, and many times a day.  it haunts me. one other feeling i had was like i was very close to them, then could see them farther away?? like a lens that was doing a close up and then back off some. \r\n\r\n\r\ni also saw the ball of fire this past month that was seen in arizona, texas, and described as maybe an astroid?  no it was not an astroid.\r\nit was very low over my house and the size of a basketball to infinity and i could see military jets very high looking or chasing it. the speed was unbelievable.\r\n\r\nif i was more computer literate, i would do a drawing, but unable to do it.","distance":"21-100
