anyone else has. i don't care if anyone thinks this is bogus or not, i finally feel it is necessary to at least tell someone else about this. i was only 9 at the time, keep that in mind. i realize time and memory affect the ability to report events, but this memory has not changed.\r\n\r\nit was early evening. i was with my parents and sibling, preparing to leave our grandparent's place. i pointed at this object, and said something about the sun being in a funny place. my mom looked and said that is not the sun it is right over there. the object approached and that is the last thing i remember before \"coming around\" in our pick-up truck, speeding away trying to get away, hearing my mom telling my dad to go keep going and get the hell out of here. the object was chasing us and i don't remember getting away, just that the next thing you know, everything is back to normal and we're driving home after having been trying to get away in the opposite direction. no one in my family will even talk about it. i think that's why i want to finally report this to someone, to get it off my chest.\r\n\r\nthe object really looked like the sun in the sky, except in the totally wrong

that even my parents exhibited. my dad drove like mad, the engine was practically howling he had the gas pedal pegged to the floor. and then bam! nothing, everything right back to normal, driving in the opposite direction we headed to try and escape from this bizarre event.\r\n\r\ni don't like remembering this, and that may also be another reason i am reporting this event. the lost time really,

north.  my wife said \"what is that it looks like it is on fire\".  she pointed over the rooftop across the street and off in the distance on the horizon. i observed an object that was similar in size to a helicopter that was hovering due north of our location about 500 feet above the ground.  the object had what appeared to be red flare droplets falling from the underside and this was what caught our eyes. my wife asked if it was on fire and might crash.  the vehicle hovered in the same spot for about 30 seconds and then drifted slowly to the northeast.  as it drifted it tilted with the top showing that it was a sphere shaped object. the vehicle remained at this location for about 1 minute and then tilted back flat and the bottom side was red like a flare color.  the vehicle drifted to the east and came lower to the ground over the roofs to the east in the horizon.  as it got due east it simply sped off and vanished to the east in a flash.  i was a mesa police officer and reported it at work that night.  i am stll a sworn investigator today.  i reported this to the ufo bureau at davis monthan aft the next day. my wife was in nursing school .  the next week my wife was in class and learned that the mother of a fellow student had seen the same incident.  i heard this was reported to chandler pd.  i later learned that one of my friends wife had also seen this object the same night.  i am not positive of the date but this was between 1 to two months prior to my oldest son being born.  i also saw a 60 minutes ufo sighting report about a roswell new mexico cop seeing the

to east decending less than 500 ft in front of me and what looked to be just over the roof tops of the homes to my left,i only held visual contact for 1 to 2 seconds i stoped on the road right where it passed over but i couldnt see it anymore, i looked for other cars to see if someone else seen it but there where no cars on the road but me.Since i had seen it what kept running through my mind was that when that big thing hit the ground there was going to be a big explosion or that it would fall into one of the apartment complexes on station ave.I waited for a few mins with my cell phone in hand to call 911 if it did crash into something.Since it was summer i had my windows down and there was no noise when it passed by ,it looked like a huge fire ball with no trailing flames,and when i got tired of waiting to hear or see something i figured that what ever it was must have crashed in the delaware river and thats why i didnt hear or see the crash.Fast forward to your show when i seen the map with all the sightings there where the shapes of the sightings on the map and one symbol was flames and in the recreation you did with the 2 ufos in the picture i got the chills when i seen

house in clarinda, ia. we were on the interstate heading home when my friend mike asked me if i saw that. i said what are you talking about and he pointed up into the sky. i spotted what he saw which is what i would describe as a bright pure white circular object or orb. it was a white with no discernable shape or markings simply looked round. i began to run through a list of explanations of what this could be. i came to the conclusion it was one of those airplanes covered in shiny aluminum/reflective paintjob until it shot up into the sun. this is when we both realized it couldn't be a shiny surface as the object was brighter white than the sun. at the time the sun was pretty orange and i know a reflection can't be brighter and more intense than it's source. the object changed direction several times and shot out of sight in the direction we were travelling (west). we were both pretty shaken and it was obvious this was no ordinary aircraft just based on the sheer brightness of the object and the way it moved. it was changing directions and moving rapidly in the sky. we were both pretty freaked out about the whole ordeal and mike looked over at me and said \"i'm not getting anal probed\". i found it funny but he was very serious. we were both a little nervous about the whole thing. i told him to keep his eyes peeled and i'd do the same. in one or two minutes it appeared back in sight again as quickly as it had disappeared. it again moved erraticly unlike any aircraft i'd ever seen. we watched it for several minutes before it shot out of sight west. we had never reported the sighting mainly because anytime we brought it up people look at us like we are crazy. mike at this point gets really uncomfortable anytime i bring it up but i feel like i should tell someone. i just saw a show on tv where your orginization were doing investigations on sightings and the part where it encourages people to come forward really rang in my head. i do want to note that in omaha where the object appeared to be around/over is the home of sac (strategic air command). we both feel it is possible this could be a secret military aircraft unlike anything we've ever seen. mike seems to feel more comfortable with this explanation but i'm still not sure what this was. i feel documenting this is important and necessary but unfortunately i'm not able to provide many of the specific details of time and place.  it was on thanksgiving day and was several years ago so as for exact date and time i couldn't say but i am sure it was on thanksgiving. i will try to get in touch with mike

immense, in fact. we could even hear the sound of the water flowing gently down stream below us, and the noise of cars on the highway in the distance, even though we were witnessing this strange ufo. at the time when the object was hovering straight over us, we were still at the end of the steel walk bridge, which hand thick railings, and i recall my friend saying \"run!\" but i said, \"no, hide!\" and i grabbed him and we hid under the steel railing while it hovered overhead. the object hovered over us, moving very slowly past us, for probably around 30 seconds or more. then, in a flash, it changed trajectories and flew into the sky at a 45 degree angle or so, at unimaginable speed. i mean, it went from ascending from the ground, performing a helix-like maneuver, going very fast in our direction, hover over us quite slowly, and then accelerating at ridiculous speeds into the sky.\r\n\r\n5. i was extremely scared and frightened. at the moment we hid under the railing and my friend wanted to run, a thought ran through my head: that whatever the thing in the sky was, it knew we were there, and that running would only give cause for suspicion. also the thought ran through my head, that even in the dark of night running would be hopeless because they must have some sort of infrared vision to detect us or something. i just wanted to hide. so we did. it all happened so fast, or at least it felt that way. i barely talk about it because people i tell think i'm crazy or making it up. sometimes, thinking back on it, i wonder if anything else may have happened that i have no memory of.\r\n\r\n6. we lost sight of the object after it changed directions after hovering over us over the steel bridge, when it shot up into the sky at around a 45 degree angle, accelerating at speeds at which no aircraft known to me can do, especially without making any noise.

walking in the woods, but then two more white balls of light came in to view, and then two more, for a total of five. they moved around randomly, up and down, side to side, sometimes fast and sometimes slow.  they just looked like balls of light that glowed all over.  the lights were unwavering and although they were white, looked like a rainbow of color at times. one of them came out of the woods into my yard, only about 25 feet from where i was standing, and about 6' off the ground, hovered there for a minute, then went back into the woods with the others.  i knew then that they were definitely not flashlights. \r\n\r\nthe dog barked at the one light and chased it back into the woods.  i called the dog back and he did come running back as if he was scared of something. he

port angeles my whole life and i am very familuer with canadian geese and ducks flyung in v formation and when they fly you can here them coming this object was so low and so close but there was no noise at all almost eeriely quiet. i have seen weird lights in this arwa vefore but i have never seen anything like this in my entire life. also we are a very small town we dont have any bright city lights our tallest building is 3 stories tall and i live on a very dark block there were not any lights in the area that could have illuminated this if they were birds. i was very excited when i saw this i would say it was as high as a 7 story building and as large as a jumbo jet maybe five lights on each sidw of the v with 3 or 4 spanning across to form the letter a formation. the white lights looked like diamond shape and they weren't really bright like lights they looked more glowing. i was only able to witness this for about ten seconds before it disappeared. please contact me if you have any questions. thank you","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

is an historical case. \r\n\r\n\"my husband and i were driving to work for the night shift at bendix.  we were driving on highway 2 headed east towards harrisonville, mo when we noticed a large disc shaped craft hovering over a field to our north. the craft had these small balls of bright white light around it - maybe 15 or so - and they would fly quickly away from the craft, go down to the ground or in the trees in different directions, then back to the large craft.  \r\n\r\nthey were dancing all around the large craft and it was very beautiful to look at. as we drove by the craft it started to move in the same direction we were headed. i knew it was a ufo and tried to get my husband to stop, but he refused and kept driving.  he sped the car up to 70 mph because he was scared.  i wasn't scared, and yelled at them out of the window - saying hello and \"come here\" to them.  suddenly, about 12 of the white balls of light came down on either side of our car and followed along with us at the same rate of speed. they were all the same size - less than 12\" in diameter.  some were 50 feet away, and some were 10 feet away from the car.  he was driving a 1978 dodge charger.  i wanted to talk to them, but my husband kept telling me to shut up, and sped the car up to 120 mph but the lights just kept up with us at the same speed! he was very afraid, but for some reason i wasn't. he wasn't talking at all except to tell me to be quiet. i felt like i knew the lights for some reason, and was happy to see them.  i think that the lights are some type of aliens.  the next thing we knew we were arriving at work and were 45 minutes late!  i could not understand it because he was driving so fast we should have been early, but we were late.  i don't remember seeing the large craft or the white lights go out of sight.\r\n\r\nseveral years later i had some dental work done and had a wisdom tooth extracted.  the dentist found something in my jaw that shouldn't have been there.  he asked me if i had ever had any dental surgery and i said no, never.  he said nothing showed up on the x-rays, but that there was this crystal tooth in my jaw, wrapped around my jaw and just under the gum next to my back wisdom tooth that was taken out that day.  he was fascinated with it and wanted to keep it so i let him have it.  the thing looked like a real tooth but was crystal.  i was a little afraid of what it might be and didn't want it.  now i wish i had kept it because i found a magazine article that mentioned implants like the one i had that could be from an alien origin and some kind of tracking device.  \r\n\r\ni have seen strange things several times in my life and believe that we are being visited by ufos from other planets. \r\n\r\nmy husband and i divorced 15 years ago, mostly because of that night and other strange things that he thought i was responsible for. i just had to tell someone what i saw because i can't talk to anyone i know about it.  but it did happen and this is real.  \r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

ground up to the craft.  then the craft started moving east in the same direction that i was driving, then it changed direction suddenly and headed south.  it moved out of my sight behind trees.  it was moving very slowly the entire time. the thing was that this object was gigantic - it was at least a mile wide if not more.  i can't believe that other people did not see this and report it.\"

435 highway from overland park to kansas city north on my way home from doing a video shoot for a commercial. i am a professional videographer and so is my wife, who was with me.  as we came around the curve at the 470 interchange i noticed a large diamond shaped craft moving very slowly along my right side (east) approximately 1000 yards from the highway and approximately 500 feet in altitude. it was 9:50 p.M. at that time.  the object had a continuous white light all over the exterior sides of the bottom of the craft, and another continuous blue light just inside that one. it was a beautiful medium blue color that i can't describe, and while the white and blue lights were very bright, they had a soft glow to them, too.  the dark craft (i think grey) reflected the lights.  it appeared that the top of the craft was kind of domed in the same diamond shape, and the bottom was flat except for the lights. at first i thought it was some kind of blimp but soon realized it wasn't.  i've never seen anything like it in 33 years!  \r\n\r\nit continued along the same path for a few minutes until as i approached the i-70 exit the object stopped and hoovered for approximately 20 seconds.  i was driving and told my wife to watch the object. she was getting very excited about it and watched it the entire time.  i had to keep watching the road and slowed down to 50 mph so we could see it better, but there was no place to turn off.  there were no clouds out and it was difficult to tell what the altitude was, but it was flying very low, too low in fact.  a commercial airliner flew over this craft headed se to nw, but was flying at high altitude. \r\n\r\nthen, just as we passed the i-70 exit, the object turned to the west and headed that direction, again very slowly, and passed over the highway just as we went underneath it.  my wife was saying oh my god, oh my god over and over again.  we saw two cars in front of us slow down and it looked like they were watching it, too, but again, there was no safe place to pull over and at this point, i did not want to stop anyway for fear of what might happen. the car radio, which was off, made a crackling noise for a few seconds, then a burst of some type. my wife said \"what the _____ was that?  she was trying frantically to get her cell phone camera to work when the phone went completely dead.  she had the phone charged up fully before we left the house earlier before the video shoot, and only used it a couple of times so that battery should not have died! my camera was in the bag in the trunk and i couldn't get it. \r\n\r\nthen, just after the craft crossed the highway, maybe 100 yards past the highway, it took off at a very high rate of speed directly west towards kansas.  i'd guess that it was traveling at 750 mph or more, at an instant without any time to accelerate like a normal airplane would.  there were no features or lights on this craft that would indicate it was a common aircraft.  it disappeared from view within five seconds! \r\n\r\nwhen we got home we called some friends to tell them what we saw, and they told us that they saw some strange white balls of light around their tree line at their house earlier in the evening and their neighbors saw them, too.  a couple of days later i heard about all of the ufo sightings in the area on the news and decided to find out where to file a report.  that is when i found the missouri mufon website and called.  \r\n\r\ni am a pilot and my father is a pilot.  he has his own cessna caravan 208b that i've flown with him in for years as a co-pilot from the time i was 14 years old.  i can tell you that this object was no plane. if it was one of ours it was flying illegally without the proper warning lights and it was below 1,000 feet.  i'd really like to know what it was!\"  due to my father's work and my work, i have to remain anonymous.
