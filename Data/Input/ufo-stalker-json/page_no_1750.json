(rte 153).  back then, ford rd. through canton township and further west was still quite rural, no traffic. we were listening to wmjc on the radio.  the dj said it was 8:01 and then static, i thought nothing of it, it was in that area that you would lose the detroit radio staions and start to pick up the ann arbor stations.  i had just reached down to adjust the radio dial then flash!!!!  everything lit up. . . green!!!!  we were so frickin' startled i don't know how i maintained control of the car.  i turned off the radio and we started looking around and listening.  nothing!  it had been almost as light as daylight, except it was green. it was so light out that we would have been able to read the license on the car ahead of us had we been close enough.  we were quite shaken, to say the least, and things seemed a bit fuzzy.  we made the obvious remarks: what was that?  did you see anything?  was there a helicopter or something?  by that time we had made the left turn onto plymouth rd. and had travelled a little more than a mile.  i asked j. the time in case there was something to report.  it was 8:30pm!  that shook us up almost as much as the flash of green.  we had lost almost one half hour.  i know i slowed down considerably from the 55-60 mph i had been driving on ford rd. and of course we made the turn.  we reached our destination a little after 9:00pm.  that trip normally takes 45 minutes to one hour.  i have driven that route, or some variation probably hundreds of times.  i even commuted to u of m for a summer semester making that same drive; so i know the route and how long it takes.\r\nin case anyone wants to know, we had not been drinking nor were we under the influence of any substance.\r\n\r\nchapter ii\r\n\r\ni used to go to a [well-known] hynotist in the detroit area.  a hypnotist with a phd, not one who does shows at the mall and makes you act like a chicken.  i went back to see her, perhaps there was more to the incident.  it took a few times to get beyond that initial shock of seeing everything light up.  despite being in a deep state of hypnosis i kept 'waking up'.  i think it was on our fourth attempt that i was able to continue, and that is when i remembered seeing it, the thing, the spacecraft, the ufo!  although under hypnosis i was moving around as if it was happening the.  i was physically going through all of the actions.  i could even feel the steering wheel as i turned my head and body, looking out the driver's window-\r\n\r\ndoctor:     \"what are you doing steven?  \r\nme          \"i'm looking at it.\"\r\ndoctor:     \"what do you see steven?\" \r\nme:         \"the spaceship!\"\r\n\r\ni guess something changed at that time in what i was doing -\r\n\r\ndoctor:    \"what is happening now?\"\r\nme:        \"it stopped.\"\r\ndoctor:    \"what stopped?\"\r\nme:        \"everything!!!!\"\r\n\r\ndespite numerous attempts, i could never get beyond that point,and to this day i get goosebumps whenever i think about it.  there were cassette tapes made of our sessions.  unfortunately they are long gone.  i mention the  tapes because i wanted some friends to listen just to verify that the doctor did not try to influence my memories.\r\n\r\nfinally after more than 30 years i have made a report of what my friend and i witnessed.  thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

not moved as it should.\r\n\r\nwell the fact that i caught this star moving against a stable foreground object was a complete accident.  in the past, i have seen stars do this before, but i always chalked it up to either an optical illusion or my imagination.  however now that i have seen a star unmistakably move, they are far easier to spot.  over the past few nights, star movement is so

white gypsum sands of the national monument near alamogordo. the body found saturday was believed to be that of kazuomi fujita, a 29-year-old textiles executive who had wanted to extend his visit so he could see white sands national monument. \"at this time there doesn't appear to be any foul play,\" said. norbert sanchez, chief of detectives for the otero county sheriff's department. fujita's, passport' was found beside the body 2 miles south-southwest of where his vehicle was found on the 145,000-acre national park. the body was sent to the state office of the medical investigator in albuquerque for an autopsy.  fujita's last night at his motel was supposed to have been sept. 7. his rental car was found sept. 9 in the park at closing time. rescue crews spent the following day searching with an army helicopter.  on wednesday, all-terrain vehicles were used in a ground search. a pair of search dogs did, however, pick up fujita's scent, investigators said. and a faint footprint was found at the\r\npark's northern end. people do sometimes get lost among the many dunes. at sunset, the sands sometimes begin to blow along the rippled surface of the dunes, covering footprints, which some visitors might have counted on to lead them back to their car.  \"most of our searches for visitors find the individuals within two hours, or they walk out on their own,\" park superintendent jim mack has said.  the previous week, fujita had visited his tokyo-based company's new york office, seen the metropolitan museum of art and attended a yankees game. \"he was a happy, well-adjusted single fellow from japan who truly loved the tranquility of the park and wanted to enjoy what it had to offer,\" mack said.  otero county sheriff's detectives examined fujita's rental

cloud cover. as i exited square lake road  approaching opdyke intersection, i noticed, across the horizon within a 1-2 miles range, 2 parallel series of equidistant separated lights (3left 2right) of increasing intensity proportionally consistent with two distinct \"approach\" path- patterns of airplanes- a familiar, common and regular occurrence in sw michigan given the neighboring airports namely dtw.  my  observation was initially triggered by the unusually low altitudes relative to 30 years worth of local, layman observation and the vicinity of local airports: there was nowhere for these things to land based on trajectory and location.  within seconds, the lights abruptly changed direction to convene across their linear parallel counter point,.  it looked as if the planes of two approach paths suddenly turned toward each other with increasing speed.  the lights varied in their increasing intensity and speed stopping abruptly just shy of a perpendicular alignment above a much brighter, constant, central lower light.  the topmost two pairs     convened to this central line while the one unmatched light merged entirely with the brighter light.  as the unmatched light merged with the still stationary light, their brightness doubled as 1, the approaching paralleled pairs retracted away from each other across random trajectories, with even greater speed, and just prior a new light appeared.  the \"new\" light was spatially and proportionally consistent with what would have paired along the initial distribution of all the lights for it to have been the match of the lower, soon to be merged light.  it appeared just prior to the others splitting off and it followed a much slower approach toward the central perpendicular line above the brightest light.   it was upon this \"new\" light's alignment with the center that the others repelled and the single merged with the larger. the two pairs follow dissimilar patterns in speeding off from each other, zigzagging, bouncing as they dispersed, meanwhile the new on hovered over the bottom bright one. i can not determine what occurred next because my horizontal view of this weirdness was soon consumed by the decreased elevation of the road- i couldn't see anything after i reached a certain point on the downward sloped road, approaching the intersection.  this took several seconds only.  there seemed nothing definitively significant about the lights themselves aside from the patterns of movement.  they were white-yellow- in color- maybe a little more yellow than airplanes but not anything wildly unusual like their movement.  \r\n\r\nthe observation was at about  233 degrees from the intersection of opdyke and the i75 sb exit ramp within a 1mile to 2 mile distance.\r\n\r\nin trying to come across the accurate geometric terms to describe the lines and distance of these things relative to their movent and spatial representation, and direction, across an xy axis, i'm pretty certain it would be accurate to plot a iconsohedron shape and say the distribution and linear movement of the lights, prior to dispersion was 100% symetrically contained and occurring within the lines of an iconsohedron shape. drawn within the points of the initally observed distribution and symetry of lights serving as perimeter points  to sebsequent movement which all occurred within the interior angles of the shape.  the lowest, closest brightest light, however, occured outside the linear object along although aligned as implied extension of  its points.\r\n\r\n i came across some patterns of drawn shapes and linear relationships that visually represent what i saw these lights pattern across the xy axis.  though i have no real understanding of any of the math, at all, i will tell you what these geometric terms were in case any one who knows what the mathematical implications of them may find them helpful somehow- some of these terms were: paralleled  non-surjective ( 2 top lights approached each other lowest went off to \"injection\" ) appearance of 3rd light is like surjective composition that triggered the scattering of the others.","distance":"Over One

when i noticed something brighter than normal to the north.  at first glance i thought it was either a heli or an airplane but i didn't hear anything. no rotor wash, no engine sound whatsoever.  i immediately stated to the others: \"what in the $@^% is that?\"  they both took notice and one took out his cell phone and took a quick photo. whatever it was, he thought it was peculiar enough to take the shot.  we are so glad he did. \r\n\r\nwhat really caught our attention was that there were two objects.  one was above the other in vertical fashion, and the distance between the two objects never changed during the entire event.  one was above a steep mountain wall, the other was below the ridge about half way down the face of the mountain.  if it weren't for this bottom light, we probably wouldn't have paid so much attention to it, but this lower light gave us depth perception as it is less than a mile away.  they seemed to slowly pulsate from an orange-ish to a red-ish and were very bright.\r\n\r\nat first they slowly descended moving slightly left then hovered in a static position for approximately 10-13 seconds.  none of us said anything, we just watched the objects intently.\r\nafter the 10-13 second hover they slowly ascended upward.  again, both in tandem.  after a few more seconds they began to accelerate very quickly straight upward.  the rate of speed was faster than any aircraft could have moved.  the closest thing we could compare them to was similar to a shooting star, only they moved straight up.  as the objects ascended, they became more and more dim.  i said to the other guys: \"they're going to disappear\" and about two seconds after i said that, they did.  \r\n\r\ni immediately asked the guys what they thought it was and one of them said \"it's just something you can't explain.  you can't explain it.\"  i think some of the words used were \"unbelievable, and holy $#@%\".  we went inside the cabin and enthusiastically told others at what we had just seen.  of course, most passed it off as some kind of joke or a high tech military aircraft.  we checked the cell phone image and it validated what we saw.  the next morning after waking it was the first thought on my mind.  i had finally witnessed a ufo event.\r\n\r\npersonally, i have always believed in other beings or life forms due to the sheer math of the vastness of space.  there is absolutely no question in my mind that what we saw was non-human.  at first i found it hard to tell anyone that was not in my immediate family for fear of rejection, and i felt very strong about what we saw.  now, after reading so many other's accounts of similar sightings i have no problem telling others.  i never felt any fear or danger but i definitely felt uneasy afterward.  i have never stopped looking upward ever since.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path

pilot for 37 years. i have an interest in astronomy and am always watching the skies. on wed. night, oct. 12 around 8 pm , i was at a beachfront house in ocean isle beach, nc facing east observing the full moon and lightning flashes far out to sea. i began a 20 minute video recording with my sony sr11 hi definition camcorder to record the distant lightning which according to a weather website was over a hundred miles out to sea. during my recording, i captured over a dozen total orange glowing stationary lights at different points in the video. these lights were similar to lights i observed on three separate nights last june while on a one week vacation at the same beach. myrtle beach, sc is just south of ocean isle and i have read multiple reports of orange lights recently from that more populated tourist area.\r\nlast june, the orange lights i observed would suddenly appear and stay on for more than 30 seconds. i first thought they were distant aircraft landing lights even though they were not the usual white color. and i quickly ruled out landing lights when i watched them rotate around each other. also, one of the lights in june silently cruised horizontally at over 100 miles per hour before disappearing. during last week's sighting, they would light up for only a few seconds before fading out. i estimate the objects that appear in my video were between 1 and 2 miles away at between 500 and 1,000 feet altitude. and the objects were totally silent as they were in june.\r\ni have uploaded to youtube a 22 second hi-definition video clip showing at least 4 of the glowing orbs. the youtube link is [link moved to field investigators section/cms/tg]. my camera was aimed east looking down the beach. among the recognizable items are a neighbor���������s white stairs to the beach, a lighted bouy which is about a mile away and a distant flashing beacon on the horizon . old baldy lighthouse on bald head island 25 miles away is visible flashing to the right. in the sky the full moon appears as a somewhat fuzzy large orb and the planet jupiter is constantly visible to the lower left of the moon.\r\nthe four orange lights appear as white on the video due to my camera���������s low light limitations.","distance":"Over One

watching the sky towards the northwest.  as i was watching the sky,  i saw a balloon size object just instantly appear in the sky from the west, and the object was traversing very swiftly in the sky like a fast and high moving jet.  at first that's what i thought it was traversing: a high flying jet that just appeared in the sky.  but suddenly i realized that it wasn't a jet, and i promptly began thinking that it may possibly be a balloon that was quickly traversing with the wind which the wind was blowing towards the east at a great gust.  i immediately started taking pictures of the object.  after taking a few pictures of it, i quickly reviewed one picture to see if the object looked like a balloon in the reviewer.  the object didn't look anything similar to a balloon in features after reviewing it via the camera's picture reviewer, so i continued taking more pictures of the object that was traversing. the object also seemed like it was slightly changing it's shape while traversing, and the object had drastically slow down in the sky to almost a crawl which to me appeared to be resisting the wind that was blowing on it.  the object appeared somewhat brownish in color with a hint of yellow in it or possibly even a slight orange color too.  it also appeared to have a furry-like surface or a fuzzy surface similar to a peach.  after thinking initially of it being a jet then a balloon, i quickly began realizing that it's movements was beginning to contradict the balloon possibility yet it was traversing somewhat similar to be a balloon. the object was about 70 feet up in the air, and it was about 100 to 150 feet away from my location.  it appeared to be traveling with the wind which was blowing from the west to east at a good gust of maybe 25 to 35 mph.  the object was traveling in the air at a steady slow rate which in the beginning appeared to had been traveling with the wind in great speed.  the object was clearly seen in the sky, and it was not always round in shape.  when trees started to obscure my viewing of the object, i quickly hurried to the front of my house in order to continue viewing the object and to continued taking more pictures of the object too.  normally, i wouldn't do this if i thought it was just a balloon traversing, and especially if it appeared to be exactly like a balloon while quickly reviewing it via the camera's picture reviewer.  while taking pictures, i included lots of landmarks such as trees, buildings, etc while i zoomed out to 70mm.  i really didn't want to zoom out; however i also still continued zooming in onto the object too in order to get as much close-up pictures as possible too.  i  realize when showing the pictures to people that it may be difficult for some people to judge the size of the object in the picture unless there was possibly some structural feature to help in judging the size of the object; therefore, that's the main reason why i included landmarks while taking pictures of the object.   while viewing the objects with just my eyes, it instantly disappeared in the sky.  i quickly started taking random shots in the sky in the general area where the object was last seen.  i managed to get one more picture of the object while not seeing it with my eyes.  the object appeared to had quickly traverse across the sky rather than it just instantly vanishing; yet the lighting part instantly disappear before my eyes.  the sky was partly cloudy and a little hazy.  the wind was blowing very hard towards the east. the temperature was about 85 degrees f. no sound from the object was heard. no reflection of sunlight was seen.  four minutes earlier, a troop-carrying type helicopter from the az national guards (united states army) number 136 had pass through the area heading west on the same pathway and at the same altitude the objects had traverse in the sky while it went east in direction.  it is possible (hypothetically and from my perspective) that the helicopter may had even pass each other while both were in flight.  it was not until i downloaded the pictures and examining each picture that i can safely say beyond any doubt that it was not a balloon traversing in the sky. the helicopter was last seen at 14:38 hours, and the object was first seen at 14:42 hours, and the object last seen at 14:45 hours for a total sighting duration  of 3 minutes.  time difference between sighting helicopter and object: 4 minutes.","distance":"101-500

observed. they were silent and the skin of the craft was sort of a soft reflective whiteish-silver with a  faint orange glow. one craft rocked back and forth slightly. both craft were less then 25 feet from me, i literally could have hit them with a stone. i of course was in some sort of shock but i felt both elation , a desire to go with them and a sense of panic, realizing that there was no mistaking what i was seeing. after about 10 seconds they took off and banked up and over a 10 story building then  i observed them directly over the golden gate bridge as two orange lights.\r\nthat

marshfield, wi and we were unloading items from the trunk. it was a very clear night. my girlfriend looked up at the stars and commented on what a beautiful night it was. she suddenly said, \"what is that?\", and pointed to the west. i looked up and saw flying over the holiday inn hotel a massive black perfect triangle with dim red lights at the points (non flashing) coming directly toward us. the craft was on a straight e by s/e flight path and traveling at a high rate of speed. it was a clear night and we could see the aircraft very well. we could distinctly see the outline and edges of the craft and it blocked out the stars as it flew in front of them.  i'm not sure what phase the moon was in, but the craft was fairly illuminated, perhaps from the lights of the city. it flew directly overhead but slightly to the north of us so we could see the right side of the ship. the ufo was flat black with a smooth bottom surface. we could definitely see structure on the right side of the ship, but couldn't make out if they were windows or parts of the ship.  the ufo was a perfect triangle in shape and looked nothing like any aircraft i have ever seen. i have seen the f-117 stealth fighter and the b-2 stealth bomber fly and it was definitely not one of these aircraft. i knew immediately that i was looking at a ufo, and i have read about and seen many pictures and videos of this black triangle ufo on tv and the internet. at the points of the triangle were dim red lights that were not flashing, but were on steadily. the ship was flat in appearance but quite thick (top to bottom). the thickness of the craft was about 10% of the length of the right side, maybe more.  i would estimate the craft to be about the size of 2 jumbo jets and was at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet, but could have been as high as 5,000 ft depending on the exact size of the craft. however, i don't think we could have seen the detail that we did if the craft was above 1,000 ft, plus it wouldn't have been illuminated by the city lights.  as i said earlier, the ufo was traveling at a high rate of speed, and based on seeing the speed of fighter jets, i would say the ufo was traveling sub-sonic. but it was definitely moving faster than a commercial airliner. as a result of the ufo's speed, we were only able to observe it for approximately 4 -5 seconds before it flew out of view (which was blocked by trees and houses), however, those few seconds seemed to last a lifetime. what astonished us the most was a total lack of sound from the craft as it flew over and disappeared from sight. the only thing we could hear was the soft sound of the air rushing over the aircraft. a few years ago, two b-1 bombers did a flyby over the city of marshfield for a funeral service. the house i lived in at the time was directly under the flight path of these 2 planes. i was standing outside at the time and the noise from these 2 jets was deafening and literally almost rattled the windows out of my house. the ufo we saw was at, or less than, the same altitude as the 2 bombers, and i would guess less. also, the ufo left absolutely no trail in the air behind the craft and we couldn't see any kind of air disturbance around the craft. after we lost sight of the ufo i immediately looked at my cell phone to check the time and it was 10:35 pm. the ufo was on an e by s/e flight path and was headed directly for steven's point, wi about 36 miles away. both of us were totally freaked out at what we saw. my girlfriend kept repeatedly saying, \"what the f*** was that?\" i was in udder shock for about 20 seconds and then started screaming, \"oh my god! that was a f***ing alien spaceship!\" the second time i screamed it even louder. my girlfriend immediately grabbed me and put her hand over my mouth to keep me from disturbing the neighbors. then she said to me, \"what do we do now? should we call 911?\" i said, \"i don't know. they'll probably just think we're drunk or crazy.\" so the two us grabbed our stuff and headed into the house. we were both in utter disbelief & excited at we saw and we kept talking about it. i then picked up my phone and told my friend what i saw. next, both of us posted on facebook what had just happened. initially, i stated on facebook that i thought the ufo was at an altitude of 500 feet, but after i thought about it for awhile, i estimated the craft was probably twice that. my girlfriend and i were so excited about what we had seen we couldn't fall asleep. at 12:45 am we were still talking about it and in the morning it was the very first thing we discussed. \r\n\r\nas a back ground note, i am very familiar with seeing all types of aircraft fly, and i have been to many military and civilian air shows. i have even been in a military flight simulator for a rc-135. i have seen every plane fly in the us military and i have seen f-18's, and f-16's fly super sonic. so i know, and am very familiar with, the silhouette of all military aircraft, including the flight characteristics, size and aircraft speed. \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),

witnesses, there were automobiles passing by on the road but i do not know if any body was paying attentionand i was in an elevated position about 12 foot or so above the road. i noticed the object because of the powerful light it was emitting, not a beam but more like a solid light with a slight aura, pure white with no other colors.  it was moving slowly from a position south east of mine, approximately 200 degrees or so, moving slightly south/southwest along treetop level. the trees in the video are about 500 to 1000 feet from were i\r\nwas shooting the video from, so this is what i used to estimate distance to the objects location, though i can not eliminate the possibility that it may have been further south than i estimated, it did appear to be illuminating the trees slightly and the effect is visible in the clip. it continued moving along its path and appeared to hover in position for a short period of time, then continued its south/south west course. until it was to far behind the trees to be seen any more. duration of sighting was about 3-4 minutes. i was excited somewhat, but since i have been researching ufo activity since i was 9 years old, i was not overwhelmed by the sighting,i have continued to see the object, though never as close as it was in this video. and have more video of the object that i have shot since that time up until a few weeks ago. i

maybe watching us to break in our home or something.  my husband told told me it was probably nothing.  but then we started seeing lights at night walking the field and we thought we were hearing 4 wheelers on our land, the next morning, i would always look to see if there were and tracks, and thing did look differant to me.  we have 8 acres of land and our land meets up with a golf course that has been closed down for about a year, and the other side of our land meets up with pasture land.  on night my husband was outside looking up at the stars, and he came in the house very excited and said he saw a light in the sky just turn off like a light bulb.  soon after that our 9 year old son told that earlier in the summer, probably august, he saw a ball of light go hover around a tree and then it took off, he said he didnt want to tell us because he didnt want us to thing he was tell a story.\r\nour family has always been star gazers, but since the lights my husband and son saw, we really started looking up at the stars.  at first we noticed how all the stars in the sky were formed like triangles small ones and very large ones, we also started watching a really bright star, we thought at first, it my have been a planet, we looked at it with our binoculars and it looked like a large jelly fish with hundreds of lights in it.  later on we find out that it was no star or planet, it some kind of jet.  this jet made a noise at first, but then when it hovered, it was completely silent. it was hard to film it, cause it would turn my flash off on my camera and when i walked back inside, my flash would come back on.\r\nthere are too many events that have happened to list my husband and i will gladly speak to someone about this.\r\nthe ships and beings are still here, and have been here for at least a month of two.  my husband and i have tons of pictures and videos we would love for someone to view.  someone is more than welcome to come to our home and view this for themselves.  we arent sure how long they will be here.  on one of the videos, you can plainly see a light being on the roof of our home and we are talking to him and he is talking to us.  its a must see.  \r\nplease contact us asap, we dont know what is going on here....\r\nin one of the pictures i am sending, its a circle with in a circle on my back cant explain where it came from, that happened twice.  we have lots more pictures to show and videos.\r\nalso note that there are jets flying all around our house, night and day all hours.. and also a neighbor has noticed the jets also.

like it was gaining altitude. however, being the passenger in the car i was able to keep my eye on it and the ground and it was not gaining altitude. this was when i thought it was possibly a crashing plane or helicopter but the object seemed to be moving at a slow rate of speed. plus, the glowing comet-like tail it had that was bright white in the center and orange all around suddenly stopped. at this point we were starting to pull over and i was reaching for my cell phone so i could film it.  the object lost its comet like tail and hovered.  i did not take my eyes off of it. it hovered for
