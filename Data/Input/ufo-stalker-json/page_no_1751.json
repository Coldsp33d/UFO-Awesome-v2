(same tree and same bird)\r\n\r\ni've sent these images to friends and family and we thought perhaps jet had been scrambled to check out or intercept this black ufo.  \r\n\r\ni should also add this.  i am very meticulous about my equipment. i clean my lens before every shoot.  also there were no reflective objects or surfaces in front of or anywhere near the camera.  only a large field.  \r\n\r\ni know we could be reaching, but these photos do show what look to be two jets and a very strange object, with one of the jets near the object and the other performing an abnormal maneuver.\r\n\r\nwhat do you guys think?

home for some time playing with a small kitten we had adopted. she tells me that there would be a meteor shower, something about haley's comet trail breakup near orions belt. we live in south florida near enough to the ft lauderdale inter-coastal and nearby beach that looking south east we are just a small distance inland. this is where she believed orion's belt should be, but i found out later we were looking toward where the constellation would appear (a few hours later). right before we had ran out behind our house i picked up the small kitten and walked out, my wife was pissed that i insisted the kitten came out (for the first time and without mommy approval). we walked to the east toward our fence line to look toward the area we thought the meteors may be. i was lacking behind and stopped scanning the sky. as i walked backwards and turned around a mistyness was apparent. until this time planes also buzzed around as we have two large airports both north and south. detail point:  when planes come in to the southern airport they will always make landings from the east from over the ocean or west from the everglades. through this mistyness i saw three slow moving orbs, which made me double take and call out to my wife. asking if she saw that she replied she saw it. to her point of view she saw a different object and form. i saw from below and as i walked nearer the object was slightly more overhead, but still my guess a block west, maybe more, and below clouds but shrouded in mist, moved without noise. there were three lights which played tricks on my eyes, tried to \"hide\" in a triangle shape, then as i moved closer i noticed a smaller formation lights/triangle just to the left/east of the larger one. now more below i look up, the lights appear to be part of a flat black triangle object which the lights are framed by. the smaller also looked that way. i couldn't for sure tell if the lights were each an object or two triangle craft, or a larger craft with multiple lights really. it moved slow but sure south, toward the airport, which would certainly interfere with aircraft landing. it was not really high enough to be a airplane and should have made noise as low as it was. once out of sight, the mist seemed to fade away after a while revealing the actual cloud cover which was a differnt color and texture than when this object passed. from then untill much later i saw no craft in the air, twenty minutes later off the coast i am sure a orange fast moving light short south. i expected to see some sort of military plane, this may have been one, but also was silent and moved south either along the beach or offshore. still for another hour at least i saw no airplane activity to the south. finally a jet plane (had the shape but not sure, flew kinda low) passed directly over me as i lay on my ground outback for well over an hour. stayed out until 2am and saw nothing else.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

large whitish light.  the light was twinkling somewhat in the lower atmosphere and appeared sometimes orange or reddish.  i thought it was a plane at first.  it was hovering around the treetops, directly in the path where commercial traffic approaches o'hare.  i thought it was a plane approaching from the north because the light was so bright, which is unusual and caught my attention because traffic typically approaches from south east and then veers west towards o'hare.  a jet was taking off at the same time, traveling east.  the jet crossed in front of the light (i could see the silhouette), and all the normal lights were on, so i couldn't help but notice how much smaller the jet seemed in comparison to the ball of light.  the light slowly ascended at that point and completely disappeared.  like someone switched off a lamp.  it did not go into the clouds - it looked completely different than that.  it just disappeared.  then it seemed liked something else was where the light used to be.  i'm not sure if transparent is the right word, but the only other accurate word i can use is \"cloaked\".  i could see it moving, but it was close to the same color as the sky, and occasionally i saw dim specks of light near it.  if you blink, you'd miss it the specks of light.  it moved out of my field of vision within seconds.  attached is an example i created in photoshop.  i tried to keep the scale similar to the objects i saw.\r\n\r\nearlier this week, on 10/24/11 at approximately 7 or 8 pm, i saw a similar cloaked object traveling from north to south in the upper atmosphere.  i thought it was a dim satellite until it made a sharp angle west - like it turned on a dime - and went faster than anything i've ever seen in my life. the speed was instantaneous.  it corkscrewed straight up and i lost sight of it.  i've seen several objects similar to this, but none as fast.  it was pretty cool.\r\n\r\ndo satellites ever make sharp turns?  i thought they only went in straight paths.  thanks for your help.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

the road side to be picked up in the morning. she went outside and walked in the direction of the trash can, towards the east.  then she saw a light above her head.  she looked up and saw a triangle shaped object with a blue light at the tip and two white lights at the other tips.  the craft was spinning in a counter clockwise motion while it was slowly moving in an east bound direction.  she observed the object for about 40 seconds.  turned around to call my mother to come look and then turned back around to look at the object again and she saw it rapidly moving away towards the east.  she rushes back into the house and ran up stairs to tell me what had just happened.  she was startled and excited.  she told me what she saw then i went outside to have her show me exactly where she saw it and describe it to me.  we were standing out by the trash can, she was describing it to me, and there was a car coming down the road and just suddenly stopped about 200 feet from our drive way.  the headlights were on, the vehicle was still running, and it was just sitting there in the road.  i decided i would walk the trash out to the road and get a better look at why this car was stopped in the middle of road like it was.  i get down to the end of the drive way and expect to see deer crossing in front of the vehicle, something like that.  there was nothing else in the road.  so i thought maybe they saw whatever my daughter just did and maybe it was still there.  i looked up into the sky and i didnt see anything.  but the vehicle still remained stopped in the middle of the road.  and i had no idea why.  i walked back up to the house and told my mother to come and look at this car that was just sitting in the road.  she did.  the vehicle remained in the middle of the road for about 90 seconds and then preceded on at a low speed.  when it drove in front of the house i could see it was a dark color suv, looked like a ford model.  and that was it.  very

over the lake. i did the best i could to pull over and get a good look at it, and when i actually stopped the vehicle and shut it off and stepped out to view it, i got a good look at it. it was a triangular looking craft, at least thats what the light pattern made it look like. the lights that were smaller on it were blinking very quickly, and it had a bigger orange-red light that was fairly bright. at first i thought it might be a helicopter, but it did not produce any sound. after i watched it for 20 seconds or so, it took off very quickly to the other side of the lake, and just barely out of my clear view, and the way it moved told me i had witnessed something abnormal...Nothing of this world could possibly move that quickly and smoothly while remaining completely quiet. i've seen several ufos after i started looking for them, but they have always been star-like or orbs very high up...I always dreamed of seeing something like this, but honestly having seen it, it really freaked

spotted the object approaching from the north, moving pretty slowly. thought it might be aircraft due to formation of lights along wings, but all lights were beautiful kelly-green and pulsating, the whole object being boomerang-shaped. it was close to the horizon (from my elevation it appeared to be at approx. 15-20 degrees above tree level) moving south apparently along the local state highway. at approx. a mile north of our exit, it appeared to hover and veer slightly toward the west (toward my location) my dauchshunds had begun to whimper and gathered beneath my chair, the male's hair up along the back. at this time, the object still had to have been at least a mile and a half away but the dogs seemed to sense it. during this same time, there was a commercial airliner flying from west to east at a typical altitude and i was able to compare the two, no comparison. the general shape was similar to conventional aircraft but the light configuration was way wrong and i could not make out an actual fusilage. there is a lot of commercial traffic moving from west to east to the south of our location but this object seemed to fly along the highway. i became pretty excited when i realized this might not be an airplane! i stood up and went to the far southeast corner of the deck to try to keep it in sight longer. i think it hovered approx. 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, then resumed it's slow path south. eventually it curved off to the southeast and slowly went out of sight. the dogs insisted on going back indoors and would not go back out that night","distance":"501 Feet - 1

stationed at fort rucker, alabama. this took place inside the barracks in our room. there were three of us in the room at the time. it was in the middle of the night, not sure what time. there were two bunk beds in the room. i was on the top bunk with my room mate on the bottom. the other bunk bed held my other room mate, he slept on the bottom. i awoke that evening, looking towards the door, seeing an entity next to the door to our room. i assumed it was \"guarding\" the area. the immediate thought that ran through my head was to make a lot of noise, trying to wake my roomy's and possibly get others to come into the room. but then i thought that if i were sleeping/dreaming i would look like a real idiot, so i passed on that idea. i then looked over to my right and saw the shadow of a second entity. apparently this one was \"working\" on my room mate on the bunk below me. i have no idea what it was doing, but it was moving at an incredible speed. i had the sense that there was a third entity in the room although i couldn't see it.\r\ni then decided the take advantage of the situation and get a good look at this thing by the door. the first thing i noticed was that the middle hinge on the door was exactly how tall this thing was. after looking this thing over for about a minute or two, it saw me awake. it didn't take long for it to notice me either. it pointed in my direction and moved its mouth (as if yelling or talking or whatever to the other entity's) telling them i was awake. at that point a thought came to me that if i closed my eyes they may think i was asleep and leave me alone. after what seemed only a few seconds i opened my eyes again and everything was gone. of course i assumed i was dreaming but when i opened my eyes, i was in the same exact position, looking the same way i was before. \r\nthe next day my other roommate (not the one \"worked on\") noticed some welts on my back. there were three of them. i laughed it off, but never took the time to look at the welts in the mirror. \r\ni would like to be contacted by a mufon investigator about this incident, please.","distance":"20 Feet or

speed. at this moment there were atleast 5-6 aircrafts flying in all directions. however, this particularly bright object caught our attention and we stood there trying to figure out about the shape and brightness of the object. the object stopped abruptly. it appeared as if it is hovering a few hundred feet above the buildings. the green and red light of the object were a lot similar to the traffic lights but much brighter as it was piercing my eyes when it came close. the blue light was rarely seen but extremely bright. \r\nfinally, the object moved and it crossed over our building. we thought we missed the object. we did not have our camera at this point. my family and i became suspicious about what we were witnessing and decided to wait there for the object to show up. to our surprise, the object appeared again from a different direction this time. it stood at an angle of 45 degree and it almost felt like the object was observing us this time. the object was in this stationary position for atleast 4-5 minutes. at this moment, we got our camera and took 6 photographs. the lights of the object were sequentially blinking. first it was green and then after sometime extremely bright red light. it was changing colors and we could see the shape of the object was not like an aero plane.  the pictures are better predictors of shape. one more observation that i had was, the object made absolutely no noise when it over our building. at around 11.15 pm the object silently glided away over our roof and disappeared.\r\nthe object was sighted apart from me by my wife and 2 adult children. we are very curious to know about what we sighted on this day.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

engineer, and am currently a senior software engineer for an automotive engineering firm outside of detroit. i'm sure that also contributes to the delay - it's not something generally discussed in technical circles, or anywhere for that matter. lately i've heard a few stories about large craft in clouds, so i feel compelled to share what i witnessed that day...\r\ni was returning home from a customer system installation on a friday en-route to detroit mi from charlotte sc at approximately 6:00pm est. my flight was somewhere around 33,000' near the southern border of ohio. the cloud cover below was 100% with the majority of the cloud tops what i'd estimate to be 5,000' (i'll call it the cloud floor). there were several towering cumulus clouds extending from the floor to our flight level and higher.\r\ni had a window seat and was enjoying watching the clouds and other air traffic go by below. i remember noticing other passenger airlines, such as a dc-9, traveling just above the cloud layer and that it's relative distance away made it appear to be about the same size as if an ant were on my window.\r\nthen, i noticed a huge dark solid object seem to inadvertently protrude from near the base of one of the large cumulus clouds below. from my viewing angle, it was 25-30 degrees to the left of our flight path at approximately 45 degrees below my observation point. i remember having a laser pointer in my hand and deciding it might not be a good idea to acknowledge it's presence. (6 miles above the surface isn't a good place to find out if they minded being spotted. this was also before lasers became a problem...)\r\nthe craft was still partially concealed within the cloud, yet the part that was visible was about 4 commercial jetliners length in diameter (400-500 feet)! it was roughly round, but had 2 large 'bumps' - so it basically resembled a 'chocolate turtle'. (it certainly wasn't a large candy covered pile of nuts, but that's just what it looked like.)\r\nit slowly drifted out of the clouds for only about 3-4 seconds, then appeared to realize it was losing it's cover, then slipped right back in to the cloud base. the movement out and back in to the cloud was at a slow pace. the entire incident lasted about 5 seconds - half the time was spent uncovering itself, then other half was moving back in. no sudden movements, just a smooth partially out, then back in.\r\nif there were any other witnesses on that or any of the other passing flights, i am unaware of them.\r\nit was by no means a scary situation, but the only thing that caused me any concern was what their reaction might have been if i had shined my little laser beam on them. if i was on the ground, i would definitely 'point' them out. if it provoked a response, anything short of death would be worth it to me because then it would be my proof. although common sense tells me it's impossible other life doesn't exist, i'd just really like to witness it up close for myself.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":32895,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.423032,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10262011-0020","longitude":-81.4518736,"occurred":888804000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1319686205000,"summary":"Huge ufo hiding in cloud bank","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":4987,"locationName":"Marietta, Ohio","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:27793"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Jacksonville","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I went out at night to take photos of our cactus plant that only blooms at night.  there were five bright, colorful balls of light flashed across the night sky.  they all left trails, as if traveling at a high rate of speed.  one ball was bright orange, one violet, one white w/cobalt hue, one was a dimmer/darker shade of orange (as if farther away, and not as bright), and another was sort of gray and dimmer as well.  seven photographs were taken in immediate, rapid succession, but only the first photo revealed these balls of light.  the other six photos just showed a dark, sky w/no stars.  these lights must have been traveling at an extremely high rate of speed because they were not visible with the naked eye, and i only saw them in my pictures once developed.\r\nphotos can be seen on facebook page at:  \r\n[link moved to field investigator section/cms/tg]","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:01","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":32894,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.3378338,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10262011-0019","longitude":-81.646531,"occurred":1318054920000,"potentialRelations":[32898],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1319681855000,"summary":"Five balls of different colored lights caught on digital camera speeding through the night sky.","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"32250","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":18,"locationName":"Jacksonville, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:27794"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"McMinnville","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"The disk like shape in the sky was at a bought 20 degrees in the sky facing west,towards the cascade range; the light grey appearance would change, to lighter to darker gray as the object moved and tilted in large circle track,, at times the object would partially appear solid and transparent as it turned in slow large sweeping turn and tilted.. tried to view with binoculars ,could not view ..Went back and forth from field glass to naked  eye..Could only see the object with naked eye.. object left or was out of sight could not tell. this object was stunning, witch left an uncomfortable feeling of unknown..It seemed as if the object had an intentional holding or hovering pattern ...

 i went back inside promising myself i would not go out again, but the thought of seeing something again was just to strong.\r\n\r\nsecond sighting:  around 8:35 pm, i walked back outside to check the sky (without binoculars).  after about 5 mins or so, as i was looking to the south of my house, over the tree line a saw a bright, blueish-white light just \"blink\" into existence.  shortly thereafter, it began to slowly move to the east, seemingly tracking the valley that runs from roanoke to bedford (rt 460).  as i watched this \"object\" another bright, blueish-white light \"blinked\" into existence about where the previous one started, and it began to follow the first one to the east down the valley.  i'm thinking \"what the heck???!!!\" when yet a third bright, blueish-white light \"blinked\" into existence, but it was offset to the northwest and it just appeared to hover and blink, and it did not follow the other two \"objects\".  i observed it for a few minutes and it began to move in a zig-zag pattern.  at this point, i had just about had more than i could handle with these \"things\" and i went inside, feeling a little on edge because i was by myself.  \r\n\r\nthird sighting:  around 9:15 pm, in spite of my better judgment, i once again wanted to check the sky.  i walked to the street in front of my house (without binoculars) and stood for a short while, observing the stars and airplanes flying at high altitude which were basically flying from northeast to the southwest.  i paid particular attention to the sound that soon followed them.  please note that i never heard any sound whatsoever coming from any of the \"objects\" that i observed the night before or on this night.  i was about to turn and go back inside when almost directly above me, a flash of electric, vivid blue-white light shot out like an arc welder, and it appeared to drop down in a spiral and \"burn out\".  it sort of reminded me of lightening.  within seconds, another shot out not far from it; then another and another in rapid succession and in different places.  some of the sparks seemed to spiral to the side, rather than drop down.  these shooting sparks seemed to come from a large, but \"confined\" area or at least seemed they were contained within a large parameter.  this \"object??\" where the sparks were emanating from began to move in zig-zag directions and throughout large swath of the sky.  either this \"object\" was very low in altitude or it was very, very large!  because of its size or nearness to me, i began to feel very ill at ease and soon felt sick to my stomach.  i said to myself, \"i've seen enough, i don't want to see anymore, i don't want to see anymore!\"  i all but ran into my house, pulled down all the shades, dropped the sheer curtains and called my sons to share what i had observed.  even as i type this report, my hair stands on end and i have cold chills!\r\n\r\non tues, oct. 25, around 7:30 pm, i noticed from my living room window (which faces in a northwest direction toward read mountain) a very bright white light hovering near and to the left of the mountain, close to where the other sightings had occurred, but somewhat lower in the sky.  i grabbed my binoculars to confirm what i thought i was seeing, and yes, it was another \"object\".  i called my eldest son who lives on the northwest side of read mountain and asked him to go outside to see if he could see it as well.  he could not see this object, so he said he would drive over to take a look from my house.  i promised my neighbor beside me that the next time i saw anything i would let her know so she and her teenage children could see as well, so i ran to her house, rang the doorbell and told her i had spotted another object hovering near the mountain.  i walked back to the street to continue my observation while waiting on them to join me.  within seconds of my seeing it again, it began moving in a northeast direction and seemed to be drop in altitude a little bit and disappeared behind the top ridge of the mountain.  i was disappointed thinking my neighbors would not get to see it...But, within seconds, it showed itself again, but this time it looked like it was tracking the high voltage power lines that are strung on the northwest side of the mountain.  the blue-white light became so bright, i could see the tree trunks as it passed behind them, and it looked as if the light illuminated the trees and ground as it passed along the ridge, under the tree line.  my neighbors joined me and i gave them my binoculars to observe this \"object\".  they got to observe the \"object's\" movement through the tree line; changing of colors (red, blue, yellowish orange and green), and the sparks of blue-white light (just like the ones i saw over the weekend).  the object finally rose above the mountain and began moving in our direct to the southeast.  it flew toward the falling creek estate area near vinton, and my neighbor said it just dropped straight down at great speed and disappeared.
