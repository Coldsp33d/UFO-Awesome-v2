(it came out blurry.) i hate my ipone! anyway, as i was trying to put my phone back into video mode when my neighbor said, \"look\" i looked up and the object turned slightly horizontally on it's side and started in an arching motion to the nw over puget sound and illuminated a cloud as it disappeared behind it. the way it started it's motion was amazing and the way it increased in speed before it went behind the cloud was like watching a magnet being pushed away by another magnet. that's the only way i can explain it's foreword motion.\r\n\r\nthe video i am attaching is in no way like what we

burned out.  their light got smaller and smaller, until it was gone.  several of my neighbors were outside at the time, and i called to them to come out in the street and look at the lights.  they did.  and we then witnessed the event together.  after the majority of the lights were gone, one more single light \"floated\" into view from the direction from which all of the previous lights had

onto my porch to smoke a cigarette. the sun had just set earlier, and the sky where the sun had set was barely still showing some twilight.  just as i was sitting down into my lawn chair and started looking around in the sky, i noticed while looking towards the northwest two objects in the far distant and at high altitude.  the two objects were moving extremely slow in the sky, and the two objects appeared to be at a good distant from each other (possibly a mile apart.)  but what really caught my attention is how the two objects were moving in tandem in speed and direction.  both objects weren't really that bright in the sky; yet, it was obviously seen in the sky without too much difficulties in the beginning.  both objects had a constant lighting, and no navigation lights were seen such as a strobe, red, or green light.  the highest object seem smaller in size and not as bright as the lower object. the lower object was much brighter than the higher object.  i had a little difficult time trying to focus on the objects seen since their lighting wasn't extremely bright; especially the higher up object.  i had my camera with me so i took some pictures; but  i forgot i had the camera set at the 100 iso setting which the objects could not be seen in the 1st picture i had taken.  i quickly change the iso setting to 1600.  the camera was also giving me some difficulties, but i finally manage to get some more picture.  while looking through the telescopic lens at the larger object, i saw what look to be a triangular shape object.  there also seem to be a dim light at each corner; however, i am not absolutely positive about that, but i am absolutely sure the object was orange in color and sometimes triangular in shape.  i also thought i had the camera shutter speed set at 1.6 second; however, in my haste to take pictures, i forgotten to set the camera to manual too.  nevertheless, the camera still took pictures near the shutter speed i would had intended to utilized which the pictures still turned out somewhat ok since i was able to capture the lighting.  there was barely a breeze, and the sky was clear.  the objects appeared to traverse towards either the east or southeast.  the object when first seen was located in the northwest direction, and when the object traverse the sky and reach the northeast direction, both objects appeared to had  slow down much more.  the larger object also seemed to be almost hovering, but it was still barely moving.  the lighting intensity at that moment was barely noticeable which also made it extremely difficult to locate the object in the sky.  at one point, it almost seemed like a star since it was barely moving or just hovering.  i eventually lost track of it in trying to determine which is a star and which is the object.  the altitude the objects appear to be located in the sky was at or near the same altitude of very high flying commercial jets.  because objects moved so slowly, they didn't seem to be commercial jets traveling.  it almost seem like the objects were just slowly gliding through the air.  no noise were heard from the objects possibly due to the vast distant.  to my best estimate, the distant the objects from me may had been possibly 5 miles; however, it is also possible that the objects may had been further away in the distant  than what i could estimate correctly. the size of the larger object seems to be much bigger than a commercial jet at the height and distant i saw the objects; definitely much taller than a commercial jet in height.  the lighting appeared to be a dull orange in color and possibly a hint of yellow in it too.  the speed of the object going across the distant sky almost seemed like the speed of drifting balloons if the balloons were very near my location, or the object's speed appeared to be similar to an extremely slow plane that is flying in the far distant at low altitude.  the objects didn't appeared to be balloons; especially at the distant i seen the objects.  if they were balloons, it would had to been an extremely large balloons nearly the size of a blimp. the angle i saw the objects in the sky was about 30 degrees or higher off the horizon.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:07:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

calm.  it was then followed by up to 20 or 25 more items of the same type, all of which appeared to travel together in a line from east to west where they seemed to vanish in the distance.  they were extremely interesting in the way they looked and the way they traveled.  they did not travel in a distinct formation, but appeared to be in a loose traveling group moving along fairly quickly.  they appeared to hover, slow down, speed up and change direction at will, all while traveling in an east to west line.  the event lasted about 5 to 10 minutes.  they are unlike anything i've ever seen in

them regularly, over the past month. we first started seeing them periodically, back in july.\r\n\r\non july 9th (approximate date), four of these orange orbs moved directly over our house at about 1,000 ft. they moved slowly and silently. three stayed in a triangle formation, while the fourth flew behind, varying its direction, just below the others. after moving above us, they slowly dimmed, and appeared as black spheres.\r\n\r\nwe have been watching for them nightly, and we are able to see them between 3-5 nights out of the week. \r\n\r\nwe only have a few good pictures, as we don���t have a camera able to take good night photos, and lately, we���ve been seeing them much farther away. \r\n\r\nmy husband has made every effort to debunk these objects as celestial phenomena, however, he cannot do so. a few nights ago, we witnessed these objects in their usual place, moving back and fourth in the southern sky, just above the horizon. when my husband went to work at 5am saturday morning, he saw them maneuvering in various formations in the distance. he watched them until they were obscured by trees.\r\n\r\nthese objects are not leaving the area. someone with the resources needs to investigate this further. i have never heard of ufos hovering over an area for such a prolonged time. so far, we have had up to 7 witnesses to this phenomena at a single time, all of whom i believe, are willing to discuss the sightings. \r\n\r\nthese objects are extremely brilliant; just as bright as jupiter appears in the sky, if not brighter. they are not stars or planets, and they are

anything that had to do with aircraft. most of our friends were involved in the airline industry, air shows all over the country, my dad's library is filled with books, tapes, dvd's, pictures, and models of aircraft.  so when i went outside to feed the cat about 10pm a large, bright, led looking light caught my eye to the north.  my first thought it was the \"head lights\" of a plane until i saw it flash.  as it moved directly over my house i saw it was a triangle shaped object.  it's shape was defined by a soft white glow but bright enough to see clearly it was not any aircraft i'd ever seen before.  in the center of this object was an extremely bright flashing light that looked just like someone flashing an led flashlight.  the light did not flash at random, it was timed perfectly.  i counted the seconds between flashes and it was 3 sec. each time.  there were no blue and red collision lights like on the wings of a plane.  i listened for a sound and there was none.  we live out in the country where it's quiet. i watched the object come from the north and move south at about the speed of a plane.\r\n  my dad had told me in the past about how commercial planes fly directly over our area, as did he when he flew, very low on approach to hartsfield/jackson in atlanta.  so when a plane is heading to the airport in atlanta, it's low and heading north.  all other planes heading east, west and south are very high in altitude, but you can always hear them.  that being said, this object was heading south, and was about the size of a golf ball at arm's length, very big and it was dead silent.  i watched it for about 30 seconds or so until i lost sight of it behind some trees.  but through the trees i could still see the light flash.\r\n  hope to see it again!  \r\n

strange.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":32860,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.30680859698854,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10252011-0008","longitude":-84.92067954871604,"occurred":1319517000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1319561926000,"summary":"Glowing

opened up from the tree line and i pointed to a light in the sky,traveling very fast then taking a sharp left turn heading east . we followed the light, which was just a single star like bright white light , traveling east until we saw what appeared to be an airplane with red and green lights appear from the approximate place where we lost sight of the first single light. i mentioned that it must be what we saw but we both agreed that it was two separate crafts, as we live near a small county rural airport. the space station was supposed to be viewable that morning , but it was rainy and cloudy, so it wasnt the space station under the cloud deck.  this is not the first experience my wife and i have had and also my son has witnessed several sightings in this area. we have even been contacted sfter shining a  laser pointer towards the night sky one evening we flashed the laser twice, and recieved two flashes back from the night sky.... amamzing..... there has been others , please feel free to contact me. thanks for listening.
