me about a strange light in the east north east sky.  i walked out side and viewed the object and advised him it was a planet.  as i was standing outside talking to him on the phone while staring up at the beautiful night sky i noticed an object at a very high altitude that to me appeared to be a satellite i have viewed many satellites and am very aware of them there speed etc. this object was moving very slowly in a north east direction it then made an abrupt turn north, this got my attention.  i may be wrong but to my knowledge satellites do not move this slow nor do they make abrupt turns. as a visual reference there was also a high altitude airliner flying over. these object were higher than the plane. in my opinion they were out of our atmosphere.  as the object turned north it approached what appeared to be a star that wasn,t moving as the object got closer the second object gave off a very bright beam of light and moved at an extremely high rate of speed and was gone in less than a second. the second object moved away in a south east direction.  as the second object gave off it's beam the first object again changed direction back more east north east at a higher rate

it seemed to move in an elliptical flight path. my son suggested getting flashlights and flashing to see if we might get it's attention. i flashed the light five times, paused, then flashed five more times. immediately the light seemed to increase in size as if it were coming closer to us. i was astonished at what seemed to be a response from the light and it started to move in a \"u\" shaped path, back and forward, dipping and going back. this type of behavior was observed for at least 90 minutes, one witness says it was 3 hours. the light was not active during the entire time. there were times when the light would hold position for a long time, then suddenly start moving again. this event was also witnessed the next night by the same people at the same location and by our grandson who was in the next county at an outdoor halloween event.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

(saturday) while standing on the front porch, wasting a few minutes, we chatted and smoked cigarettes. \r\ni was facing towards the sky, looking upwards at the stars, when i spotted a large object moving. it was just at the level of low clouds. difficult to pin point the size of the object, and the distance.If i had to guess, i'd say it was as wide as two or three 727/200 jet liners (200-300 hundred feet, maybe more depending on the altitude). the total time length of the sighting was less then 30 seconds. as it disappeared in and out of the cloud cover, it was at an altitude of less then 6,500 feet. there were no sounds or smells emitting from the object. it was dark outside, and no lights on the object. it seemed to be disk shaped, but since only the front was visible within the darkness and cloud cover, it could possibly have been in the shape of a round boomerang. hard to tell, but in my opinion it seemed like a massive, dark, saucer shaped object.\r\nwhen i alerted the person i was with, she turned around and saw it also.\r\nafter just the few seconds, it eventually disappeared (i would assume)into the cloud cover , and for several minutes we scanned the skies but saw nothing else. the object seemed solid,slow, and moved steadily. it didn't resemble any earth craft, nor flying geese, because geese they usually fly in a pointed v shape, and this was rounded. and there was no sound! which flying geese tend to be very noisy as they trumpet. i felt stunned and intrigued by what i saw, never having scene such a large unknown craft that blatantly close to me.\r\nthe next day my friend called,and informed me she knew someone in the same neighborhood, and had spoke with them previously that day. apparently he was out by the garage working on his car, and saw the same mysterious object, as well as his wife who was also with him.\r\n\r\ni checked the papers/internet for the next few days, but didn't find any reporting of it. i thought the next best step to do would be to post my findings on mufon.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:00:25","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":32817,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.6724074,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10242011-0001","longitude":-81.5118235,"occurred":1317526200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1319445854000,"summary":"Florida ufo sighting.Observed a large black disk shape slowly move through sky just under the clouds.","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":22,"locationName":"Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:28705"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Taylor","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"About a year ago, i noticed an object in the sky while driving home. i got home and stayed outside to watch the object for about 15 minutes until if finally just faded out. i've been seeing this off and on frequently since then, and it is always appears in the same area, around the same time - 8pm. i have viewed it up to 30 minutes at times. it appears to come in from the northwest, and stops due west and hovers. it sometimes appears to gradually head south until it fades out of sight or it just fades out slowly. most of the time i see one object, but a couple of times i have seen several smaller objects around the one object moving erratically. the objects seem to project from the bigger object and surround it. there also appears to be some sort of communication with blinking of lights and synchronizing switching of positions in the sky, but i cannot determine a pattern. tonight was one of the coolest sightings because there were three big objects that were obviously communicating.  one came in and stayed hovering while another approached it and took off due south.  then another one came in and hovered beside the original, they traded position,and then the original object headed due south.  they all remained blinking different colors, and before trading positions, the colors seemed to coordinate.  at one point, the original object started to brighten before it swapped positions with the second. eventually, the last remaining object slowly dimmed until it just faded away. i've witnessed this fading away before, many times, which makes me feel like it is still there.  sometimes, i have waited and watched it reappear, and then slowly fade out again.  still, there is no pattern to how often or, if it, will reappear. i have captured some of these sightings on recording, but the camera that i have is old.  i have a new one now, but the auto settings seem to throw off the resolution from that distance, so it's frustrating.  this is a new experience to me, so i've been looking online to see if there are similar sightings, but nothing so far.\r\n\r\ni don't know what this is. but i do know it is not an airplane, helicopter, satellite, flying star, planet, or any other flying object that i know of. i live in the country with a clear view of the texas night sky.  i can see the city lights of the closest city, and all the smaller towns in between.
