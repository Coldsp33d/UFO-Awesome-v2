saw what looked to be 3 points of light forming a perfect triangle in the sky about 50 degrees up from the horizon. the object was moving very fast, i yelled to the other two people by me to look and they also locked into it right away. as i first saw the object i stayed locked onto it and never took my eyes off it. out of my peripheral vision i noticed a 2nd object dip down in the sky and then back up, it then followed the triangle formation on the exact line of flight in the sky. the 2nd object was only one light and about the same brightness as the triangle formation. it trailed the triangle by about 2 hand widths if you held your had out at arms length.\r\n\r\nthe triangle consisted of a point of light in the front and flanked on each side by one light. the brightness of these objects was pretty much equal to your average star in the sky. i have witnessed and track satellites with computer software and have also seen the navys noss satellites pass over before and this was not that. size of the triangle was equal in width to a penny held out at arms length. i know how fast satellites travel when the pass over and this was these objects were traveling 3 to 4 times that fast if not even faster. they covered about 35 percent of the sky in roughly 5 seconds or less. the sky was clear except for a one small cloud. the objects passed above this cloud and then faded out and we lost visual on them. also as the triangle formation went across the sky in between the 3 points of light there was kind of a shimmer of very dull light for a brief second. no shape could be observed and as the object traveled through the sky it didn't pass in front of bright stars so i can't say if it would visually blocked out the star or if it would seemed transparent. that remains unknown. there was absolutely no sound from either objects even after they had passed from sight. we live in a small town out in the desert and its dead silent out here if was a jet of some sort we would have heard it. we also live in close proximity to the barry goldwater bombing range so we see our share of military jets pass over but they do not fly as fast as these objects where traveling. i have no idea if this something traveling in our atmosphere or if it was in space. normal orbit speed in space is roughly 17,500mph and as i said this was 3 to 4 times as fast as that. if it was something in the atmosphere i would have to estimate the speed in excess of 2000mph, there was no sonic boom either.\r\n\r\ni consider myself a amateur astronomer and i am also heavy into civilian and military  aviation photography. this was nothing like i have seen before. if i had to guess i would say it was some sort of military object that isn't known about yet? all 3 of us where at a loss for words as to what this could have been. i would really like to know if anyone else beside us saw this that night? all 3 of us were glued to the sky for another 1/2hr as we were amazed by this. nothing more was seen that night.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

in the sky.  it was hovering in the sky, it didn't fly by me. i think i had about a 2-3 minute view as i was driving before the trees blocked my view.  it was at around a 67 degree angle on the horizon.\r\n\r\nas i was driving i kept watching the thing and i thought it must be a dad out with his kid flying a big saucer-shaped inflatable somewhere in the park around the lake. but, the shiny thing did not move or waver or flutter in the wind, and it was pretty big. i'm not a good judge of size or distance.  since it didn't move i then thought it must be a blimp. it was extremely reflective silver-colored and as i drove closer i could see the outline more clearly.  it was definitely saucer shaped, light and reflective on top and dark on the bottom, like two saucers stuck together. the reflection off of the thing seemed to have a pattern, as if it was constructed in panels\r\ni wanted to pull over, but the road didn't have a good place to pull off, and i figured that once i got around the trees i'd get to a place to pull over and get a better look.  \r\n\r\nall of this was processing through my brain as i was driving and watching the thing in the sky.    it was becoming clear to me that i wasn't looking at a blimp.  i am very familiar with the road, so it wasn't hard to look up and watch the road at the same time.  i watched the on coming traffic and people walking the path around the lake to see if anyone else was looking up and nobody was. the trees at the other end of the lake were coming up so i knew that they would block my view for a few seconds until i could find a place to pull over.  but, when i got around the trees, it was gone. \r\n\r\ni don't think the object was right above the lake, or the trees, i think it was off in the distance and it must have been pretty big.  i am not a good judge of distance or size when something is far away, but it appeared to be smaller than a \"goodyear blimp\" but much bigger than a car or truck.  the day was very bright and hardly any clouds around, the object was below the clouds.  it didn't seem to be a reflection or visual trick, the shape was too distinct and clear.  there were some large power lines around, but there weren't any tall towers or buildings nearby that could have reflected light.\r\n\r\nthe area that i was driving was south on creve coeur mill rd going past the lake.  anyone at the lake that afternoon would have seen it if they looked to the southern horizon of the lake above the tree line.  the object appeared to hover above a wooded residential area near the lake, on the north side of olive/clarkson, near where the 141 construction is going on. from the air, the object would have had a view of the missouri river bottom on one side and hwy 40-141 on the other side. the area is near a lot of large power lines and not far from the chesterfield airport.\r\n\r\ni would love to know if anyone else in the area reported seeing what i

visible.  as i got into the car, i saw a large white strobe light brightly blink on the horizon behind some trees, although i found it curious and watched the sky for several minutes, i passed it off as perhaps a small plane flying over the mountains.\r\n\r\nabout five minutes later, as i was driving east on the riddle by-pass road towards the 103 exit of interstate 5, we saw the same type of white light randomly blinking over another mountain top.  these mountains are to the northwest of the i-5 103 exit.  i estimated the lights were just over the mountain tops and about four or five miles away from where we were.  you could intermittently see the reflection of some of the brighter flashes across the back of the mountain.\r\n\r\nwe could see the lights start flashing in various random patterns at this point.  there appeared to be one main light (about aspirin size) that would flash intermittently.  it would disappear and then there would be a series of eight to ten small lights that would flash into a vertical pattern, and then into a horizontal pattern.  the length of these patterns seems to vary.  \r\n\r\ni eventually pulled over into an empty parking lot where me and my family got out to watch.  the light patterns continued on this pattern for several more minutes.  it was then i noticed the lights were also flashing into a triangular shape.\r\n\r\neach transformation into these shapes lasted only for a few seconds.  at one point, when the lights extended into a vertical line, there appeared to be several small satellite lights that fell from the top of the vertical line.  these lights appears as if they must have hit the mountain top or they just seemed to vanish.  it was too dark to see any sort of hard structure or shape, other than what shape the lights made.  the lights also extended into a curved vertical line (like a half moon shape).  the horizontal and vertical patterns seemed to stretch over the greatest distance over the mountain; using about eight to twelve individual lights.\r\n\r\nwe watched these lights for about twenty to thirty minutes.  we continued north on the freeway and could still see the lights from mile post #108.  i pulled over again to view the lights from a different angle.  the lights (although slightly dimmer due to the distance and haze now beginning to form in the air) were still blinking in the same manner.  the lights were all white in color, although a few of the smaller falling lights almost appeared to have an orange and blue hue sometimes.\r\n\r\nthe last i saw of the lights had been when a solid light (not blinking as all the others had been) dropped from the top of the vertical line to the ground.  the lights seemed to disappear from view at that point.\r\n\r\nthere are some large radio towers several miles to the north along this same mountain top.  all the radio towers have solid red and a few blinking red lights on them.  \r\n\r\nhaving grown up in the area, i have no explanation for what we saw at this point.  my son and i were able to take several videos on our iphone 3gs.  due to the distance, darkness and video quality, they didn't turn out great.  however, the footage may be able to be lightened.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

each weekly night. my normal route takes me into cottage country which is very remote in places. on early saturday morning oct 15th 2011 at approx 03.00hrs i was driving east north east along hwy 7/12 between the villages of manilla and oakwood heading for the town of lindsay. the sky was clear with a full moon a few clouds to the west of my position. i observed to my front left (north east) white lights moving towards me (south west).\r\n\r\ni assumed it was an aircraft heading for pearson int airport due to it's low altitude 3-5 thousand feet, however it struck me there were no red and green navigation lights showing and it appeared it's landing lights were on. i wanted to observe the aircraft properly so i pulled my truck over onto the soft shoulder and climbed out of my cab onto the fuel tank step. from my position i watched the aircraft approach me and noticed red flashing light from below the landing lights.\r\n\r\nthe aircraft came closer and changed direction from south west to west south west, at this moment i observed what i thought to be landing lights were actually lights from under the aircraft. the aircraft passed me at approx 70 degree angle just north of me. this allowed me to observe there were four white lights under the aircraft, one at the front and rear and one at each wing tip ( i assumed these were where they were located) two flashing red lights were located under the aircraft together in it's center. as it passed i remarked to myself it's a perfect diamond. even though it was a full moon and the sky was clear with stars i was unable to observe the aircraft's shape or hear any engine sounds. no other lights were seen. no strobes or cabin lights which i see from other aircraft. \r\n\r\nthe aircraft remained on it's west south west course until it entered the cloud formation to my west. as it did so the clouds lit up dull white and dimmed as it passed through them. i climbed back into my cab and carried on with my route.\r\n\r\nthe only reason i send this email is because what i observed was unusual. no marker navigation lights, strobes or normal recognition lights. i assumed it was a military aircraft or commercial aircraft that had lost lighting control. living near person int airport i'm in constant sight of commercial aircraft operating at night. this aircraft was vastly different from those i normally observe.\r\nthanks.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

south on ferndale avenue, i noticed in the sky to my left, about 60 degrees up from the horizon, and about 70 degrees to the left of directly in front of me, two lights that looked like car headlights off in the distant sky. i was amused that it looked like the headlights of the flying car in the movie \"flubber\" by walt disney. it held my attention for a second or two as i drove down the straight street and didn't need to watch the road closely.\r\n\r\nas i approached church road, the light on the left came swooping downward in front of me. it went from the size of a bb to about the size of a green pea and made a downward arc passing about 40 to 50 feet in front of my car and with the lowest point of the arc being about 25 to 30 degrees above horizontal to me. it moved in a symmetrical arc back up into the sky and was gone in an instant.\r\n\r\ni looked back to see what the other light might have done. it was now about the size of a nickel and was about 45 degrees above the horizon and about 45 degrees to the left of directly in front of me, approaching about as slowly as a private airplane. in seconds, the one brighter light became more discernible as four separate lights.\r\n\r\nthe object seemed to have no outline as it moved overhead, and i could see that the lights were two circular white lights and two diamond-shaped white lights. they were arranged with the two diamond-shaped ones on the right and left and the two circular ones in the front and rear.\r\n\r\nas the object got closer, it was so large i wanted to get a better look at it, so i pulled my car across church road and got out to see better. i don't know why i got out. i was not the least bit afraid. i just wanted to see it. it was now directly overhead. i couldn't see an outline at all but was sure it was one object and if round, would have been about the size of a softball held at arm's length.\r\n\r\nit moved slowly and silently across the sky above me and off to my right. although it was moving approximately the direction that church road went, i did not jump in my car and attempt to follow it, and have no idea why i didn't. it slowly floated toward the horizon and i just got in my car and headed home, feeling so lucky that i had finally seen an object that was flying and unidentified.\r\n\r\ndue to the facts that i was not afraid, that i got out of my car, and that i didn't try to follow it, i have often wondered if it made me feel those feelings. i would really like to undergo regressive hypnosis to find out if i was taken and returned, or was entranced, and i would like to be made to recall more details and the date of this experience.\r\n\r\nif this is possible, please contact me.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

2011 about 1h00 passing 06/25/2011 during 10s i made an ufo observation about a dark and silent boomerang above paris buildings. \r\n\r\nlaing down in the grass and about watching the sky, i was observing stars and constellations hence satellite objects because the sky like the atmosphere were very good and clear that day. i started around 11pm and spend about 1hour in what way. then approaching midnight i decided to leave cause i'm leaving far from that place when once again i turned my head to look again the sky. \r\nthen i was astonish to see something like starlight moving together in the same direction. i knew that this couldn't be possible so immediately i realized that those lights were surrounded by an other light what gave to the object a boomerang shape. \r\nthe object had 4 no blinking lights in one side and 2 no blink lights in other second side/\r\nit was move from north east side to the south west side when we refer to the map of france.\r\nall inner light of the object was dark and looked transparent because the color was the same as the sky. \r\nthere was no sound, no noise from the object and it was look close and much more bigger than a simple aircraft.\r\ncompare to the planes i could observe meanwhile those one who use to be very hight in the sky were in the same size to the light i could see in the sides of the wings boomerang. i was like i could observe 6 airplanes waving same time and in the same direction in the middle of the night or this happened in the center of paris city, with city lights.\r\nafter 10s of observation when trying to take my cellphone to shoot the scene the object disappear completely. \r\neven a lot of people where around to me i was so chocked that i could yell or talk. \r\nthen i called the police to leave a testimony when talking to theme, they advice me to pass and make a deposit i said yes but never gone before.
