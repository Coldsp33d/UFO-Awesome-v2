a cigarette and get some things from my car approximately around 9pm. it was an exceptionally clear night, and i had not trouble seeing many stars as well as aircraft. as soon as i walked out the front door i looked directly ahead approximately nw at an elevation of approximately 24 degrees towards the top of read mountain which was visible between the trees and the neighbor's house across the street.\r\n\r\nmy attention was immediately directed to a light or cluster of lights that appeared to be just over the top of read mountain by a couple hundred feet at best. the best guess at the distance (with my brothers help as well as google maps) was about 2000 ft from where i was standing. from my vantage point you could hold a tablet of aspirin flat at arms length and it would just fit in between the mountain and the lights. the lights were unusually bright for a plane or any other aircraft that i've witnessed, and seemed larger than they should be for the distance. they were flashing and brighter than any star in the same area of the sky, as well as any plane, of which there were many, but certainly not at that low of an elevation. additionally, there were no planes in that particular part of the sky. they all were off to the east and west flying overhead from e to w, and at no less an elevation of 85 degrees compared to the 20-24 of the lights. it was very clear to me that it was some sort of motionless craft, not a star, street light (it was in the air over a mountain with no lights) or any other common occurence. i am currently 29 years old, mentally sound, and spend a great deal of time looking at the sky. \r\n\r\nthe most notable color was a bright vivid red, which was the first thing that struck me as odd. as i watched for a moment the colors flashed between red, orange, yellow, and white... possibly pale blue, but from the distance it was hard to tell subtle differences in color variation.\r\n\r\ni decided to walk up the driveway to the street to my car, thinking it nothing more than unusual. i lit a cigarette and walked down the street till the lights were in view again. from there i had a more clear vantage point than before. the lights were still present and did not appear to move at all, i attempted to hold up my thumb for a reference for size and to gauge the motion, if any, of the lights. i took notice of no discernible movement of the object. i watched the lights attempting to pick out any sort of pattern to the flashing and changing of color, but could not. \r\n\r\ni currently live in brooklyn, ny. i spend a lot of time on my roof at night watching the planes and stars as well as through my windows. directly over my apartment is a main air traffic pathway and am accustomed to seeing many different types of aircraft and watch their light patterns intensely. to my knowledge there is always a very simple pattern to them, and this set of lights that i saw were flashing fairly quickly and at random, save of course if it just happened to be a very long sequence. \r\n\r\ni stood and watched the object intently for another 2 minutes or so, when my attention was drawn by another plane passing overhead, quite audibly. i looked away for no more than 10 seconds, and when i looked back to the lights, they were simply gone. after 5 minutes of being essentially motionless, they were just gone. like someone had unplugged a christmas tree. i said out loud \"oh, you've got to be f****** kidding me...\" \r\n\r\ni stood in the same place attempting to locate them for another 5 minutes, looking all around in the sky... nothing. \r\n\r\nat the time, i wasn't at all sure what i had seen. i went back in the house and told everyone about it. it made enough of an impression that i mentioned it, which is in itself unusual. we talked about it for a couple of minutes and then it faded out of conversation. \r\n\r\njust last night i received a call from my eldest brother and mother. one week from the night i saw the lights, and around the same time, they had returned. both my mother and brother saw them, her from her house and my brother from his. my mother had the longer and more detailed account. the three of us spoke on the phone about it for about half an hour and cross referenced each others sightings. as best as we could tell it was the same or at least similar object in roughly the same location. her report is on file currently on this very same website, and i urge you to read it. \"long description of sighting report\" is the title. it is listed under roanoke, va on october 21st. though it wasn't her first sighting, this is both of our first times reporting the matter. this is my first sighting.

brother in law, 15 year old son, nine year old daughter and a couple of nephews.\r\n\r\nmy son and nephews were busy cleaning the yard from a bbq the previous day.  my wife and i were sitting o the patio chatting with her brother in law.  my nine year old daughter interrupted and said, look at the thing in the sky, it looks like a boomerang.  we ignored her and kept talking.  what ever she was looking at was not in our view due to the angle of the roof.\r\n\r\nmy daughter said it a couple more times.  i told her to wait a minute and said i was sure it was just an airplane.\r\n\r\nmy daughter walked to the front yard, leaving us to talk.  a couple more minutes passed and she yelled for us to come look, saying it was still there.  we got up and walked to the front yard, my brother in law was leaving anyway, along with my son and nephews.\r\n\r\nmy daughter pointed to the sky at an object above the tree line across the street.  it appeared to be extremely high and felt it was most likely an airplane.  it did not appear to be moving but i felt that was probably due to its extreme hight.  my wife went to house and got a pair of binoculars.  \r\n\r\nwhen i looked at the object through the binoculars, i was surprised to see a large boomerang shaped object that was glowing orange.\r\n\r\nthe object appeared to be stationary.  the orange illumination was bright and appeared to be coming from five circular areas all merging together.  i could se a faint outline behind the lit area.\r\n\r\ni thought the orange color might be a reflection from the sun but a high flying air plane passed by and there were no colors reflecting from it.\r\n\r\neveryone took turns looking through the binoculars.  everyone thought it was strange.\r\n\r\ni watched the object for another 10 minutes.  during that time i watched as it did the following: the center point of the boomerang rotated from facing left to the right.  it then began to move to the right for approximately three seconds.  it then stopped, rotated again, until it was pointing up.  it began to move up for a couple seconds and stopped again.  it rotated until it was pointing down but did not move.  a couple seconds later it rotated to the left again and began to move to the left for approximately five seconds.  it stopped again and remained stationary for a couple minutes.\r\n\r\nafter approximately 10 minutes of watching it began to slowly move away until i could not see it anymore.  i thought of going for my camera but i did not have a lens nearly as strong as the binoculars and i did not think i would capture anything other than the usual blurry ufo photo.\r\n\r\ni have never seen anything like this and i am usually a skeptic when it comes to things like this.  i am a deputy sheriff and former long time u.S. marine, so im use to dealing with facts.  this has left me stumped.

work along us hwy 40 in a populated area independence/lee's summit missouri at dusk. i saw flashing lights in the corner of my eye (coming from the southwest going northeast) and i looked up through my windshield to see a triangular shaped ufo with what looked to be a transparent center with white, non-simultaneous or patterned flashing lights on all sides with at least one or two blue lights on at least one or two corners. the ufo had a steady, straight path without spinning, tilting, turning, raising or lowering and then stopped and steadily hovered over a populated area without spinning, tilting, turning, raising or lowering. i lost sight of the ufo as i continued to drive down us hwy 40 and hills and trees go in my light of sight. at first i thought it was a flight of aircraft, being an ex-air traffic controller, i knew it wasn't since there were no slight adjustments between the lights, it seemed to be a solid structure with no green or red lights and looked as though it was larger than a stealth bomber flying in an area i've never seen aircraft fly around here before. i did not hear any sound, but i also had the radio turned up fairly loud. my feelings were just shock and surprise and i remembered hearing about mufon in an interview on 96.5 the buzz (krbz) in kansas city approximately a month or two before, talking about 7 reports of a similar description in a town connecting to lee's summit over a water tower (raytown, mo) up until i lost sight and i could not observe any more similarities. no interferences besides the observation physically or psychologically of any kind were noticed in this event.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path then

continued to slowly ascend for the next half hour until a cloud blocked my view.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

73 (niantic/flanders) all cars on i-95 south came to a complete halt. as usual, this automobile back up was a few miles long and no cars or trucks could move. it was a complete standstill. \r\n\r\nmy wife and i had just completed a wonderful dinner in the quaint town of mystic and began our trip home to hartford. i recall telling my wife, this evening had been one of the most beautiful crystal clear blue skies i had ever seen. there were no clouds present. it seemed the sky had two or three beautiful hues of blue. it was very breath taking indeed. because the weather was so warm and pleasant, i opened the moon roof on the car to feel the night air as we drove home.\r\n\r\na sighting of one object in the distance on i-95\r\n\r\nas we were heading south on i-95 and passing exit 74 or 75, i noticed to my right off in a distance, a stationary object. this object was a couple of hundred feet in the air and had blinking lights (approximately 4 or 5 lights). as we were traveling at 55 to 65 mph and the road began to turn away from the direction of the object, i let go the image to maintain focus on the road ahead. i thought to myself, what was that object? was it a large flat rounded helicopter with four / five lights blinking? was it a large flat round floating balloon with four / five flashing lights? was it a large water tower with five blinking lights? if a water tower, where were the tower legs? i had to put it out of my mind to watch the road and focus on the fast moving traffic.\r\n\r\na sighting of two objects near ��� i-95\r\n\r\na mile or two down the road, we came to a complete stop on i-95. we were now near exit 73. all i could see in front of me was a long line of red backup lights. in my rear view mirror all i saw see were white headlights. \r\n\r\ni could not believe it, here it is one of the most beautiful evenings i have had and yet here i sit in a parking lot on i-95. as we sat there in standstill traffic, i decided to look up through the moon roof over my right hand shoulder to view the sky. what i saw next, gave me first a double take, then a shock. \r\n\r\nthe object, i had just seen a few miles back was here - ���hovering���. what i saw was a large flat, rounded disk (see object 1 below) with 5 lights, blinking on and off. these lights seemed to blink in a reticulating fashion.\r\n\r\nthis object was approximately 400 to 500 feet above the ground and about 200 feet from the road. \r\n\r\njust then, i had another shock; there was more than one object! this second object (see object 2 below) was moving slightly next to this first object (object 1).\r\n\r\nobject 2 was at a slightly lower altitude (possibly 50 feet below object 1). these two objects also appeared to be within 100 feet of each other.  \r\n\r\nboth objects were exactly the same shape, had the same number of lights, same color and all 5 of the lights visible were blinking. it seems one craft lights blinked in the reticulating fashion and the other objects lights just came on and off.\r\n\r\nas i focused on this second object, i realized, it was moving very slowly towards ���i-95 (us and the two / three cars behind us). i remember stating out-loud, ���oh jesus���. (comment: my wife, being a strong christian, i assume was insulted and ignored my comment. i am sure she was concerned i said this. she also does not believe in this phenomenon and i did not bring this to her attention.)\r\n\r\ni was in shock, as i have never seen a disk in person before let alone two objects at one time. i also knew we were in a position of vulnerability. we were unable to move until the traffic could move. i felt a little panic knowing this.\r\n\r\ni also wondered, were we being watched by these two floating objects? were these objects observing the cars and trucks in this backup? \r\n\r\ni then thought for a split second, there could possibly be a third object? but could not verify that assumption. i had a strong feeling, that there was a third object but could not get a good look at it. i just ���sensed it��� another presence.\r\n\r\nas the cars began to move, i was glad we could leave the area. i forced myself to brush off what i just witnessed as a not so happy observation. as i traveled down the road, i had the inclination to look one more time in my rear view mirror. sure enough, there it was in the rear view mirror where we left it. i could still see one stationary object with its lights blinking on and off near the highway.\r\n\r\nin retrospect, i now realize, two things: 1) when i saw the first object from a distance (a few miles away before the back up), the second object ���object 2��� must have been behind the other, or just showed up after we all came to a complete stop. 2) if i had not had my moon roof open and looked up when i chose to do so, i would have never seen these two objects. the angle of these objects was above and to the right of my roof. meaning, it would have been impossible for me to see these objects. the only way i would have seen these in the back up is if i was 20 or 30 cars back and was looking up to the sky in the direction of the right hand side of the highway.\r\n\r\ni know people saw this. i am sure they wish, they had not.\r\n\r\ndescription of two objects\r\n\r\nthese objects were disk shaped. both had 5 lights along the rim. this tells me, the craft had more than five lights perhaps 15 to twenty around the entire circumference of the craft. the objects where two half���s of an inverted bowl.\r\n\r\n\r\neach craft had to be 2 to 3 inches in length from at arms length.  according to my calculations this would make them approximately 80 feet long.  the height of the craft would be ��� to 1/5th of its length. this calculation assumes the objects were 200 feet from the road (us) and 500 feet in the air. estimated distance to objects from my location would be approximately 538 feet.\r\n\r\nthe lights blinked on and off each second or less. one object lights seemed to reticulate in a sequence.\r\n\r\nthough the sky was now dark, the lights from these objects and headlights from the backup traffic seemed to show the exterior color of these objects were ���silver���. in other words, i knew they were not black or some other color. more silver / light gray like coloring.\r\n\r\nreport to the police\r\n\r\ngiven this was a major accident that occurred on i-95, and not knowing how the accident occurred. i thought the police might like to know what i saw. i first contemplated their reaction. would they think me a nut doing so? however, i rationalized after a day or two, if i saw this while driving and focused on these objects, i may have had an accident. the cars had been moving fast, the road bends and any amount of time eyes being off the road to view an unusual sight could cause a car accident. \r\n\r\ni first contacted the dispatch officer at east lyme a few days after this sighting. the dispatch officer heard my story and referred me to the investigating officer of the i-95 crash at montville. i shared the story again this time via phone voice mail to this officer. a week later, not hearing back from the officer, i decided to follow up by email to the head officer of the police station. i inquired, if they knew anything and to please share what they had heard so i could report this event to mufon. \r\n\r\nto-date, i have not been contacted. does the police know something? did others report this same event? i may never know. perhaps they think, i am a nut!\r\n\r\nconclusion\r\n\r\ni am still in shock, the memory of what i saw that evening i cannot change. what i saw that evening was both awe inspiring and scary at the same time. this was real. it was frightening and interesting all wrapped up in one event.\r\n\r\nsomeday i hope the government will come clean and share what they know. i was not looking for this - it was present.\r\n\r\ni will add, the following day - another witness reported a similar craft to nuforc near exit 85 (10-10-2011) a week later two witnesses submitted a similar craft near hartford to mufon.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet -
