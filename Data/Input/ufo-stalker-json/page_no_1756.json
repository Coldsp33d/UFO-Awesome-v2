flashing red, green and amber lights. i live in a neighborhood where all the street names end in dale. we are in the neighborhood across from boulder station casino. i have consistently seen up to three of these objects which flash the same kind of lights. i have actually seen one move horizontally and stop and then followed it up the street as it moved horizontally south like toward utah. then i spoke to neighbors who i don't know and they said they see them all the time and pointed more of these objects out to me. i live in the southeast part of las vegas, nevada. i have no sense of direction but i can drive straight up nellis and will come to nellis afb. i have contacted channel 3, was told it is a blimp, have emailed george knapp who never responeded , spoken to a lvmpd motorcycle officer who spent ten minutes telling me he is sure it is a helicopter. i ahve many other witnesses who i have made come out to see these lights. we all see them. i now see them every night always they are in place as soon as it is dark. they are not stars. i have tried to photograph them. i have tried to see them through binoculars. i don't have the right equipment. here's the thing. i drove to a shopping center parking lot near my house and i could barely see one behind a tree. these are to low to be seen by all of vegas i guess. i even contacted a channel 3 cameraman who is acquainted with my mom and he really showed no interest. anything you can come up with that it might be does not fit. it (they) are not lights on a mountain, weather balloons or whatever. here's what i have decided they are but of course how can i possibly prove it. i think they are some kind of survelliance drones sent out by nellis afb. i do see one often in the same location as if it is watching maccarron airport which i'm sure you know is the big airport for las vegas. the one closet to me which i see in the same place nearly every night seems to be over the las vegas strip. i am an intelligent person and by now know when something in the sky is not a normal flying machine. maybe you know what it is. maybe alot of people know what it ( they) are. but i do not.","distance":"Over

talking about a story her father, my great great grandpa made her promise to never talk about, but since she was over 90 years old she didn't think it mattered anymore. she was very flustered still just talking about it. the best we can tell, this event took place in the logansport, indiana area in approximately the 1890's or so, maybe earlier, maybe later.  \r\n\r\nmy great aunt was taking food to her father and grandfather working the fields all day as she did every day. she would take a horse and cart out to where they were working, have lunch, then come back home. on this particular day, she could not find her father, or grandfather. she then heard them yelling at her to get inside the woods nearby and hide. she complied and that's where they began telling her that they have been watching some sort of flying machine that didn't make any sort of noise flying around the field. they supposedly watched little people get out of the craft and take pieces of corn and soil, then they flew away. the uncle and father had been hiding in the woods for some time afraid to leave. \r\n\r\nall the people in the video have now passed on, but my grandma who is now in her mid 80's, the daughter in the story's niece, gave me this tape because she was curious if i could find any other reports from that time frame of anybody reporting the same sort of thing. i have the tape of the

very clear and it was cold, maybe 29 or 30. i saw a flash that looked like lightening. i was headed east on highway 80 at mile marker 335. i looked out to the left to see if there was a storm coming and a giant flaming multiple colored ball of light with a long bright colorful bluish green white in the center tail was following what appeared to be a large object on fire.  i followed it with my eyes as did my husband and after it was out of sight the gaseous cloud seemed to hang in the air like a low jet stream almost at my eye level like fog. then as we looked back it looked like a contained explosion with a blue dome keeping it in had hit the ground out in the darkness. i was hoping nobody was hurt and what exactly i saw. i've seen shooting stars, visited planetariums, watched meteor showers and done recreational research mainly to teach my son about space and the solar system and i have never seen anything like this. i chalked it up to a possible comet collision but it seems different for some reason. i was in awe asking myself what the hell was that and repeating wow for hours. that's why i looked and found this.  this was way to close to be a shooting star. in addition we did see four normal shooting stars along the same stretch before and after this other object. it looked like the lunar module entering the atmosphere in the movie apollo 13. it came from

by the pool in my apartment complex when the security guard on duty came running by shouting to follow him quickly. when we arrived at a clearing, we saw orange lights hovering in the sky, moving in very slow formation. by the time i was able to get my cell phone to record the event, we counted 7 objects in the sky. they seemed round and bright orange and seemed to dim out and disappear. duration was about 2 minutes. two minutes later, at 00:00 10-9-11, we saw a single ufo moving toward us slowly. it was closer this time. the best description i can give is that it looked like a rectangular orange lantern floating in the sky even though we knew definitely that it wasn't a lantern. it was longer vertically and at the center was a brighter spherical light, perhaps the craft itself. the rectangular shape was more like a light surrounding the craft and not the craft itself. it soon dimmed out and with the naked eye we could still see, faintly, the spherical center moving across the sky. almost like it turned the light off that gave it a rectangular aura. then it disappeared. at 00:05 10-9-11, another single ufo appeared and seemed to float across the sky before dimming out again. again orange and like a rectangular lantern with a brighter spherical core. there was never any sound. there was no wind, the night was relatively clear with low cloud in certain parts. when the singular craft moved toward us at 00:00, we could also make out a kind of reflection of white light behind it on the bottom of the cloud. almost like if one would shine a headlight up toward the cloud. i have posted the videos i took from my droid3 phone onto youtube. the cell phone videos don't do justice to what we saw with our own eyes. but at least it was recorded! here are the links for

mechanic. i have been exposed to just about every type of military aircraft and their general capabilities. i am also a cessna private pilot. with that being said what i observed tonight while sitting on my back patio went against every type of known aircraft i have been exposed to including any on tv. \r\n\r\nat 2037 hours (8:37pm) i was smoking a cigarette on my back patio sitting in my chair facing directly west. out of the corner of my right eye i caught a movement and turned my head to the right and saw what initially appeared to me to be a flock of birds glowing pure white flying due south. about 2 seconds after my initial observation i thought to myself wait a minute, its nighttime and birds don't glow in the dark. \r\n\r\ni then realized what i was observing was some sort of aircraft that was in the shape of a boomerang that had on the front leading edges of the aircraft approximatley 15-20 white lights from wing tip to wing tip including the center. at that time it was now directly in front of me traveling in a due south course following highway 347 almost to the center of my town. i live in a small town. i estimate based on my military and private pilot experience it was traveling around 500 knots. it passed to my left and i was not able to observe any red or green anti-collision lights or the required white tail light.   \r\n\r\nin my experience i knew a military type aircraft flying at this speed would have some tailtale sign of emmission from the tailpipes and none was observed. i was approximately 1/4 to no more then 1/2 mile from this object that appeared to be the size of a standard size house i estimate its altitude to have been around 1,000-1,500 feet. it made zero sound. when it was in my center field of vision i could see clearly it was a boomerang shaped aircraft that had a very dark skin color that caused it to contrast with the night sky and allow its shape to be easily seen as it flew by. \r\n\r\nthis aircraft traveled for another 4-5 seconds and then made a very abrubt course change to a westerly course from its southern course. this course change caused me at that time to lose any sight of the aircraft. it appeared to follow the union pacific railroad line going west. \r\n\r\ni called my sister inlaw who lives about 3 blocks to my west as it appeared to have changed course right over her house and asked her if she was outside smoking and did she see any object fly by. she stated she was outside at that time but did not see or hear any aircraft. she was under her patio cover so if it went over her house she would not have been able to see it. \r\n\r\ni immediately called luke airforce base 556th fighter squadron and inquired as to whether they were currently conducting any night time operations in this area or the barry goldwater range about 40 miles southwest of me and the duty officer stated no, they were not currently conducting any operations in our area. note: we sometimes see lukes f-16 fly over us on there way to the range but it is always in the day time and not at night. i gave the duty officer a brief of what i observed and he entered it into his duty log. \r\n\r\ni then called my local police dispatch and inquired if anybody including any of the on duty patrol officers had reported any unidentified aircraft flying over town at a low altitude in the last 15 minutes and she respinded that they have not received any other reports at that time. i gave her a quick brief of my observation. \r\n\r\nclosing comments: i have never seen an unidentified flying object before and this is the first time i have ever made a report on one to anybody. i was not drinking and i am of sound mind. i have usually laughed about other people alleged sightings including one my brother and mother reported to me awhile back. what i saw tonight was not anything i have ever seen before and the flight capabilities were not of anything i have seen in my f-14 experience or in other military jet aircraft i have been exposed to. its ability to make such an abrubt course change defies newton law of an object in motion stays in motion. we currently don't have any known advance technology to effect that sort of abrupt course change. if this was infact a secret military test aircraft then i would say we have advanced significantly in our technology and have somehow been able to develope structual technology that is able to resist high g-force levels both positive and negative.  \r\n\r\nwhat disproves this theory to me is it takes a lot of energy to make such a turn and it requires extremely strong flight controls to force such an abrupt course change and that would have caused the aircraft to emit some level of noise and this aircraft was extremely quite. it would have caused a significant amount of stress on the airframe and on the flightcrew.

head-light heading directly towards me from the south-west.  as the object came closer to my location, the light was getting brighter and it was beginning to take on an appearance like a bright huge star with intense lighting.  i had been getting into the habit of taking pictures of all jets or planes that head towards me at night, and i also continue taking pictures of the light until i either see a strobe lights, green or red lights, or flashing lights to indicate if it is a jet, plane, or helicopter.  this ufo's light had a constant lighting with no flickering in lighting intensity.   i continued to take pictures of this object as it was coming closer towards me.  as it was almost overhead, i  noticed that the object appeared to be changing its coarse very slightly in a wide curve like it was now going to start heading north.  however, when the object was almost directly  overhead, it then started to head directly east.  not once did i hear any noise coming from it nor did i seen any strobe lights, green or red lights, or any kind of flashing lights coming from this object.  the object  was high in the sky where high flying commercial jets are normally seen.  the object traversed at a speed similar to a slow flying plane.  the bright light remained constant bright as it came towards me, above me, and while it traveled away from. when the object was about 2 miles away as it traveled away from me, the object's lighting instantly disappeared like a light switch was turned off.  no lights were seen after that. \r\n\r\nin the beginning, i took many pictures at 1600 iso with the shutter speed set at  1/60 sec.  when object started going away from me less than a mile, i then set the shutter speed to 1 second which i was able to include a building's 2 story roof with the object in the same picture. i also tried to include some stars in with the ufo for reference size of the object. to me, the object size seemed to be about the same size of these jet or plane lights we normally see at night.  if i had to guess to the actually size of the object, possibly as big as a plane or jet for the height i seen the object at. the lighting also looked similar to arc-welding type of light with the same intensity.  the object definitely appeared to look like it was traversing inside our atmosphere.  during the beginning of the sighting, i noticed 1 jet or plane in the air at the same time.  shortly after the sighting of the object, there seems to be a lot of air traffic which i seen at least 5 jet or plane heading in the same direction the object was last seen.  then very briefly, (maybe 1 or 2 seconds) i saw another bright object very bright like the first object about 1/2 mile away, but it quickly disappeared before i could get a picture of it when the object was lit.  i took two pictures quickly where i thought i last seen the object at 1 second exposure. \r\n  then about 43 minutes later, i saw a white light that was bright for 1 second, then dim down but not completely off, then brighten back up.  it didn't strobe or flash, just bright white light then dim down then dim up to bright light which it did continuously. no other types of navigation lights were seen.  i manage to get some pictures of that sighting.  it possible that sight may be a jet, but the lighting was not typical for a jet that i normally see flying that usually strobe, flash, and have green, red, or white lights.\r\nthe sky was clear, no clouds were seen.  stars seem especially crisp. no wind. temperature about 85 degrees  fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n  i manage to get several pictures of the objects with no lighting wiggles at 1/60 sec.  the 1 second exposure shows the constant bright lighting output even when the camera was not held steady enough in the hands. just to note: if i had it the camera on a tripod for 1 second, it would had just shown a white light line. the object was so bright that you  can see purplish colors on the outer parts of the object which usually indicates intense lighting.  not only that, because the object was so bright and at 1 second exposure, i had artifacts (ghost images) of the object in the same picture of some of the pictures i took; that usually occurs only with an extremely bright lighting.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

at about 7:00 pm i was driving south down larkin ave after doing some grocery shopping. i noticed something in the sky that at first looked like the moon trying to come through the clouds. kind of a domed shape shining behind the clounds. as i kept driving i noticed this thing was actually moving. i got out my phone and started recording this thing. at this point and from my view it looked almost like a large domed shaped object but not defined like i said it looked like it was a very bright glowing object behind the clouds but then agian it wasn't, it's just hard to explain what i was seeing. it was moving too fast to be a blimp but too slow to be a plane or a helicopter so i decided to try and follow it and as i drove down larkin to route 6 i just couldn't keep up with it but with that said it was no longer behind the clouds and appeared that it could be a blimp but then i thought, in this weather, at this time....No, and it was glowing, the whole thing was lit up, a blimp doesn't do that. by the time i turned the corner onto route 6 and heading west it seemed to be flying south west and over exxon mobile refinery off of 55 possibly and then it seemed to head south and then a little east. i soon lost interest and headed home, during the drive home i phoned my husband and told him what i saw and that i recorded the sighting. when i got home and reviewed what i recorded on my phone all you could see was the reflection of my window and the glaring street lights. today after finding this article i went to get my phone and look at the recording again but unfortunately it was nowhere to be found on my phone and i know i did not erase it, soooooo i don't know what that's about. all i know is i saw something and i don't think it was of this world.

noted the time, then closed my eyes for a moment.  i looked again and saw that the light was still there so i got out of bed and moved the sheer curtains aside to take a better look.  i saw an orb that was yellow-orange - it was stationary in my backyard (below the tree line).  it seemed a little fuzzy (or because my eyes were tired), so i closed one eye and tried to focus on it.  i realized that it was not my neighbors back porch light, nor a flashlight, nor an interior light from someones house, nor a street light.  it was a yellow-orange circular light in my backyard close to the ground.  i was really tired, and didn't think about what else it could be, so i got back in bed and fell asleep for another 20 minutes.  i then awoke at 5:30 and looked again, the orb was gone, but

windy, fall evening. the sky was dark blue with few visible stars but bits of clouds in which had a dark burnt orange hew to them.  \r\n\r\nmy boyfriend was driving.  he noticed a glowing object in the sky and pointed it out to me. it was about the size of a blimp.  it was bright. it radiated a whitish, somewhat blue color and it was a ovalish, fat-disk shape.  it almost seemed like it illuminated the immediate area around it as well. it reminded me of a glow stick. there were no \"lights\" shining down or onto it or anything else... the entire surface of the object was emitting a soft, but strong, glowing light.\r\n\r\ni thought it maybe just a blimp lit up like a lantern, but it wasn't.  there were no letters or signs... the light was too bright for them to be visible anyway. plus it wasn't a fat blimp shape.  it was a bit more elongated and skinnier, like a disk, but not so flat.  there was no soil outline of the object.  the light was too bright to see that. it moved smooth and straight like a blimp would but faster. \r\n\r\nwe raced threw town, following it, attempting to catch up. he rolled threw stop signs and sped a bit.  he was so excited, very loud, freaking out cause we might be actually seeing something crazy. he wanted to stop and buy a camera, i insisted that we did not because we will loose it! he kept repeating \"how can nobody else see this?!?\" i had to remind him to keep some of his attention to the road. we kept loosing sight of it because of the trees along the road blocking our view.\r\n\r\nit was moving south, or away from the lake at a steady speed.  it was traveling maybe 30-40 miles an hour.  we got really close to it when it was above the wooded area behind a jewel osco. i'm sure someone in the area could have look straight up at it from their back yard!    \r\n\r\nwe hopped onto us-20 and it seemed to be following i-94, now traveling west. now it was traveling about 60-70 miles an hour.  it was farther away from us.  it was also higher in the sky. but now we were able to get a good long look at the entire object.  the color was more white now and then we defiantly seen a red light on top of the object and then another red light on bottom.    \r\n\r\nwe got off of us-20 and passed over i-94. we found a field an pulled over and watched the object continuing to head west.   it moved out of veiw into the porter/chesterton area.\r\n\r\nwhen we got home, my boyfriend regretted not chasing it.  we told a friend.  he agreed what we described did sound odd.  we did not report it to anyone else.  my boyfriend did make the comment \"if's funny how we see something so strange but act like nothing happen.\"\r\n\r\ni researched blimps and light and did not pull up anything other than ufo sightings.  but no photographs similar to what i saw.  i thought it was kinnda odd tho, there were simular stories around the same time last year?\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

there was some kinda blue disc-type object moving around the tops of the trees. around 5 to 10 seconds of looking i saw a bright, neon-blue object streak an arch above the tree tops, about 30 degrees above my level to the southeast, maybe 125 yards away. it was moving in a northeasterly direction when i witnessed it, but according to my friend who had witnessed it before my being involved, it had been hanging around that area for the last couple of minutes. he described to me a bright blue orb or disc shaped object making arcs just visible on the tops of the trees, and he wasnt sure if there were two of them or just the one. he also said that on one pass, it seemed to stop at the height of its arc for a second, then continued to finish its arc-ward motion. i saw that the object was so bright, that as it made its vertical semi-circular arcing motion, it left a wall of tracer. after it dipped back toward the tops of the trees, it left my visibility, but some were saying that they could still see it through the trees making its way around the top of the immediate area of the woods. not sure what it was exactly, but it certainly wasnt any kids toy or remote controlled airplane, because it was big enough that if there were any conventional means of flight being applied, we would have heard it at that distance. but it was totally silent. and i doubt any one is flying super-bright, orb shaped, neon lit kites on a non-windy day in the woods of all places.

all meteorite showers so we know what a meteorite looks like in most cases. we even know the content colors from the burning. we have had several hit close by over the years. this was a bit different.\r\n\r\nhe was three miles sw of columbus on hyway 30 going west when there was a laarge flash and his vehicle began stuttering and blinking on and off. then it straightened out.\r\n   upon reaching his home he saw the ground getting lighter almost like daylight, through the window he saw the meteorite fly past overhead directly over my farmhouse completely lighting up the farm a half mile north of his location with hundresd of smaller meteorites. then as it went behind the farm he heard/felt a thump and saw a brighter flash silloweting the farm. all the while the smaller bits were comming down as well in an area spreading out over a quarter mile or so either side of the trail left by the big one. the smokey trail that it left was oddly zigzagged and floated off with the wind.\r\n he said that it was rainbow colored and that was the odd part. the little pieces stopped shortly after. all together the event at his house lasted between 15 to thirty seconds.\r\n   at the same time i woke up at the farm and thought my 12 year old had fallen out of bed. i was up for a while but did not see the lights or know really what woke me.\r\n\r\n\r\nthats it. we have meteorite in the field north of us, b ut i think finding it would be rough. in case you get other reports of odd lights in the area check to seee the direction and the time. i may have the answer to them.\r\n\r\nalso the flash that effected the truck was an odd occuance if it too was a chunk of meteorite don't you think?\r\n\r\n ","distance":"101-500

the road.  it was a dull black sphere about the size of a basketball or a little larger. it had no lights or windows or any features on it at all.  the object was floating just a few inches above the road and moving in a straight line right along the middle of the street. it's shadow was cast on the road from the streetlights. the object passed in front of my car at a slow rate, and kept going along the road heading south and to my right, then just disappeared. the object did not fade out, it literally disappeared and was no longer visible. i watched it for approximately one minute, which was long enough to get a good look at it.  my 18-year-old son was with me riding in the passenger side of the vehicle and he saw it, too, and said, \"uh, mom, what the heck is that?\" \r\ni've never
