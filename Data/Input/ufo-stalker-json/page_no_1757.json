southeast of chicago.  i was driving and turned north on a road in munster, indiana (white oak ave.) and saw a large object in the sky to the north approx. 35 degrees from the horizon.  object was moving east to west at a moderate pace.  for the apparent size of the object it seemed to be moving too fast for a blimp, but too slow for a plane or helicopter.  also, at this size, if it was a helicopter i would think it was close enough to hear and there was absolutely no sound in the sky whatsoever - no helicopter sounds, no airplane sounds.  also, with midway airport and o'hare airport in chicago, i don't know why there would be a blimp flying at night moving east to west when the prevailing jet stream is west to east. there was also severe weather on the way and the weather at that time was also not very conducive to blimp flying. i've seen blimps, and this was moving to steady and fast for a blimp.  i would say that the object covered about 20 miles east to west in approximately 2 or 3 minutes, judging from the ground where i first saw it to when i couldn't see it anymore as it went west into the south chicago suburbs.\r\n\r\nobject:  large, dark silver to gun metal gray appearance.  either a cylider, blimp, or disc shape as viewed from the side. i would say viewing distance was 6-8 miles away.  had one large flashing red light on top, and one large flashing red light on bottom, which would alternately flash once each approximately 2 seconds apart from each other.  body of object seemed to be lit in a way that made the top half seem brighter than the bottom half.  the red lights were very large and could be seen very clearly.  these lights were not positioned horizontally as on a plane or helicopter, but rather on top and bottom of the object.  \r\n\r\nwith the airports and hospitals in this area we are all very familiar with what planes, helicopters, hot air balloons, etc., of all shapes, sizes, and speeds look and sound like.  my first reaction to the look and size of this object was \"what the **** is that?!?\"  it looked very large and ominous in the sky and did not have the flight speed of a plane or helicopter, nor did it have any sound that one would make if it was flying that slow. there was absolutely no aircraft sound whatsoever. once again, i've seen blimps and it was moving too fast for a blimp, nor would i think it would be flying at that time considering the weather and time of night.  \r\n\r\ni was by myself in the vehicle when i saw this, but when i was able to describe this to my girlfriend a couple of hours later, she posted to her facebook asking if anyone saw anything in the sky that night.  very generic, no description or anything.  she quickly recieved a reply from a friend who saw it when he was in the showplace 16 movie complex parking lot in schererville, indiana at the same time i saw it.  without any prompting he described it in the exact same way i did.\r\n\r\nwith the very high population of nortwest indiana/south chicagoland area, i can't imagine we were the only two who saw this.  even if it wasn't a \"ufo\" per se, i just want to know what the heck it was.","distance":"Over One

from work at about 430 in the morning. as i was driving i noticed what looked like a very bright star in the sky above and ahead of me. it only caught my attention because while i was driving on a straight road i say the object go horizontal across the sky and then when i pulled into my house i noticed that it had stopped high in the sky right in front of the house but high. i mean i thought it was a star but there were other stars in the sky and this object was much lower and much brighter than those. so to make sure that i was not imagining things, instead of me pulling in to my driveway where i was, i decided to change direction and head toward another location far from me. and i notioced when i did the object was definetly with no doubt following me. and i am for sure this is no normal star that you see in the night sky often. as i moved it followed me, and you could also see it when it changed direction and cut across the sky. to make matters even stranger its been following me for about the last five months, and it mostly happens from about 1100pm to about 700am in the morning.And you can actually see this thing when the sun is starting to rise for the morning, and there is absolutely no stars in the sky when this can be seen. i also notice that during the approaching morning time before it leaves whenever i am driving i see the object but as soon as i stop and face the object it slowly descends into the sky where it can barely be seen, unlike night time when i see it most of the time. i have shown this object that has been followning me to another person and asked them what they thought i should do. the person saw it and believed me, but recommended that i not tell the police about it or they would think that i was crazy. i reported the event to the

gps told us to go down several gravel roads in the middle of nowhere through carbon, indiana. it instructed us to turn down a gravel road called 100 e where i stopped the car as we turned onto it so my sister's dog could go to the restroom. it was already very dark out and my sister felt very uneasy letting him out of the car. she never got out of the car but put him right outside the vehicle and was hurrying him to go really quickly. when she got him back in the car she told me she was feeling very uneasy and i was too since the road was gravel and in the middle of nowhere. we had seen a sign as we turned onto the road that said \"low clearance\" and this made us uneasy as well since we weren't exactly sure what it was referring to. we were driving slowly down this gravel road with the brights on so were could see because it was so dark. we were commenting on how creepy the location was i noticed in the distance there was a series of lights that lit up in a sequencial manner which i thought initially was some sort of reflecters on a structure ahead that we couldn't see yet. this drew my attention to the sky where i was seeing faint flashing that was constant. it looked like faint lightening but it was continuous. i asked my sister if she was seeing the flashing lights in the sky and had almost come to a complete stop with the car. she started looking in the sky but couldn't see what i was seeing. we had a map light on in the car that's on the rearview mirror which was inhibiting her from seeing the lights. as she turned off the light she was still not seeing the flashing. i asked her to look where i was pointing to the clearing in the trees and she said, \"i don't see the flashing but i do see those lights ahead of us!\" that's when i looked forward and saw the lights that i originally thought had been reflecters of some sort. they were extremely bright and appeared to be moving in a pattern that appeared to be going in a circle around an object. in the first few seconds the lights were going in a sequential manner as though they were revolving around the object then they began to blink on and off in random patterns. i had stopped the the car at this point and we sat there staring at the \"light show\" wondering what in the world they could be. the whole thing looked just like the typical lights on an alien craft thing that you see in the movies or on those videos where people are trying to hoax the public. it was so sterotypical that we were wondering if someone was projecting the lights onto something in the distance that we couldn't see at that time. we kept asking each other what we thought it could be but neither of us said anything about a ufo at first. as we watched the lights i finally asked my sister if she thought we were actually witnessing a ufo to which she responded, \"i'm not sure but i was thinking the same thing.\" we both then started to worry quietly to ourselves about how we really hoped we wouldn't get abducted because we have dogs at home that need us. we never said it outloud but that was what we were both thinking simultaneously. the lights were in a horizontal line and remained that way all the time we were watching them except when they briefly tilted up on one side only for a couple of seconds before going horizontal again. it titled up on the left side as we were looking at it. as we were wondering out loud what we should do because we were both now completely freaked out yet acting calm which i believe was more shock than calm. this was something that we always said we never wanted to see. we both always believed that we weren't alone in the universe but really didn't need to see any ufo's or aliens to confirm it for us. this was in fact one of our biggest fears and it was right there in front of us only several yards in front of us. right after the lights had tilted i reached for my iphone to try to see if i could get a picture of it. my sister had her camera with her and started to get it ready as well. i held up the phone and realized that i couldn't see anything to photograph and as we watched it and wondered what we should do the lights simply blinked out. my sister never had to time to get her camera ready to get any pictures. the whole \"show\" lasted no more than a few minutes and ended in the blink of an eye. as we debated as to whether or not to drive ahead where the lights had been or turn around, i decided to drive forward. as we neared where the lights had been we were in shock to realize that ahead of us was a tunnel that had a rail road track running across it. it wasn't a large tunnel and only one car could drive through it at a time. we drove very slowly where we saw the lights and realized that no one was around in the woods that surrounded the area and there would have been no way to project a light onto the tunnel and have it look the way it did due to the opening in the tunnel. we didn't stop because we were too scared and stunned by what just happened. as we drove on following the gps's orders we continued to talk about what just happened but we really we both were in shock. we finally got to a road where we saw a cop car drive by and i wondered out loud if we should flag him down to tell him what we saw. my sister was worried the cop would think we were crazy. i finally decided that we had to drive back there to make sure it wasn't something explainable. we were so scared but we knew we had to do it and i think we were really hoping there was a logical explanation for what we just explerienced. when we drove back through the tunnel we stopped and looked around. there was nothing there and no one was around. we just couldn't find any explanation for what we witnessed. i decided to call the local police and tell them what we saw hoping they would give us that logical explanation we were so desperately seeking. the police didn't act like i was a crazy person nor did they act shocked. she told me that the town of carbon had fireworks that night and that could've explained the flashing in the sky but she had no explanation for the lights. i was willing to accept that even though i knew what i saw wasn't from fireworks. she said she would send a policeman out to check it out. as we drove home we were in shock and kept talking about it trying to explain it away unsucessfully. this event has affected us so much and caused bad dreams and big fears daily and nightly. we really feel like we will never be the same again. we have a fear that really affects our lives now. we went back to the site a week later in the daytime to investigate it more thoroughly. my sister climbed up the steep hill to the train track to make sure there wasn't something up there that could have caused it. the lights were hoving in front of the bridge just a few feet off the ground from what we could tell in the darkness. we actually experienced two trains going by there in the daytime and got a chance to hear what they sounded like. there was no sound that night from a train or anything else. there was no sign that it had ever been there. i actually went to the two closest houses to the location and asked them if they had seen or ever seen these kinds of lights. one person was very nice and said that kids party around there but she's never seen any lights and didn't see any that day. the other person acted very stoic and made me feel really stupid asking him those kinds of questions. he said he had never seen anything like that. we left that place way before it got dark and still with no definitive answers to what we experienced. i struggled with whether or not to report this sighting but felt that it might be almost theraputic to go through the whole experience again. this sighting has changed us forever. we are actually afraid to be out in the dark now and my sister is still having bad dreams about the whole thing. we will never be the same again. my sister said it felt as though our innocence had been stolen from us that night and even though i laughed when she said it i think it really is true in a way. i'm hoping that by reporting this that someone else speaks up saying they saw something that night too or maybe gives a logical explanation for what we saw.","distance":"101-500
