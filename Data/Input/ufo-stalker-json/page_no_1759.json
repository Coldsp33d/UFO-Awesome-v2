have often witnessed all kinds of planes, satellites, comets and chinese lanterns etc. \r\n\r\ni have been tested several times for my vision which always results in a 100%. i got tested last time in 2005 before i immigrated to the state and i'm certain that it's just as good now as it was back then. \r\n\r\nwhat i saw today was something new to me. the object appeared to be sphere like and seamed to be randomly wobbling. much like in this footage [link moved to field investgator section/cms/tg] but, it was too far away for me to be sure that it was more than one object.\r\n\r\nwhen i first noticed it, i thought at first it was just another plane because there where already several other airplanes in the air. so the chances of a pilot having noticed it as well are good. after a few seconds i realized it wasn't moving.\r\n\r\nafter a few seconds of observation i noticed that it was moving but very slowly. it moved south slower than a satellite, in fact it moved so slow that it was hard to observe that it was moving at all. than after a while when it was right above the beach it turned west. \r\n\r\nsince it was so slow it wasn't an abrupt 90 degree turn, but it seam very determined in its direction before and after the turn. further more it seamed to be changing its altitude because it became smaller in size.\r\n\r\nthe fog came in from the see side and it was hard to see it at all thereafter. i also had to leave at that point and unfortunately stopped observing it.\r\n\r\nthe whole time i was wishing for someone with a camera to walk by because i haven't had mine with me and a zoom would have come very handy. unfortunately i couldn't spot one. \r\n\r\nstill i have no idea what it was that i saw and i tried to see if maybe somebody had uploaded footage at youtube but found non so far.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

i was turning my head when i saw what i thought it was the same star i was looking but on the opposite direction so i  thought that is weird so as i was looking at it i notice it was moving,\r\nmy firs impression was is and airplane but i was waiting for it to see the flashing light it did not had any and was to slow and way too bright and i kept just looking at it for abut i say 3 to 5 minutes (that is how slow it was) then all of the sudden the intensity of the light just the blue just banish and left a red no so bright light and i could not believed that something really bright turn on in

around 6:45am on the morning of monday, october 17, 2011. i walked around my apartment building to the north and turned the corner into a small, open field. that is when i saw a stationary, flashing light hovering above the distant horizon to the northeast. it pulsated -- changing from a small pin-point of light to a bright light and back again within about a 2 second time-frame. it did this on a regular interval the entire time i was out there. it did not look like a helicopter or airplane, as there were no other flashing lights that you might find on most man-made aircraft. and it appeared to be completely still and stationary. i've also never seen a helicopter or airplane pulsate with light in such a way. after about 10 seconds of watching this light, i ran back inside and grabbed my camera. i came back out and began video-taping the light. from my perspective, and my familiarity with the surrounding kansas city area, i would guess that the light was somewhere above the overland park, ks area, north of i-435. i live just to the southeast of the i-35 & i-435 interchange. the light could have been as close as a mile or two away from me, or as far as several miles. it was difficult to estimate how far it was, as i didn't see a solid object associated with the flashing light. it was so still that it looked like a flashing light mounted atop a tall radio tower, but there is no such tower in that spot. after video-taping the light for a little over a minute, i turned the camera off and went back inside. i didn't feel like there was much point in sticking around, as the light's behavior never changed. i went inside for about 5-10 minutes. when i came back outside to see if the light was still there, it was gone.","distance":"Over One

looking at the sky because there were 4 spotlights making figure 8 patterns from the roof some night club or something to the east.  that's when i noticed what looked like a star moving.  it was mostly white but it had different green and blue colors kind of flashing but maintaining a constant luminosity.  i thought it was a satellite.  then i saw 2 more of the same making a large triangle and they were all moving with uniform speed and and keeping the same relative distance to one another.  i thought it was some sort of plane formation because i'm right near an airport.  then i saw two more to make it an even bigger triangle.  still moving with uniform speed and same distance from one another. the speed and distance were too uniform and the too far apart for them not to be somehow connected i thought.  but the space between them just looked like dark starless sky.  i thought maybe it was some kind of stealth bomber type of craft but it would have to be giant.  then it stopped for about 5 min.  then i thought i was just seeing things so i waved to it and laughed to myself. but, a couple minutes later, it started moved in a slightly different direction and i stopped doubting myself.  it seemed to move relatively slow but much faster than any of the stars.  a plane did fly by under it on the way to the airport and that seemed to be much faster but it was also much much closer.  the original direction was from east to west directly over my head but after it stopped it took a more northwest direction.  i went inside to grab a camera with a video option because my crappy phone doesn't take video and a still picture would have just looked like stars (if it took a visible picture at all) but when i returned it was gone.  i went back out every hour or so after

a better look.\r\n \r\nthere was a nearly full moon behind me as i watched the light move across the sky. i hold a private pilot's license, and although at this time i am not \"current\", i've been around aircraft all my life, and i've never seen anything like this. there was a thin/broken layer of clouds i estimated to be about 4,000 to 5,000 feet above ground level. the light was below the clouds.\r\n \r\ni applied 'critical thinking' in my attempt to identify the light. i asked myself \"why couldn't this be _____?\"\r\n \r\nno aircraft i know of produces a reddish-orange light. plus there were no position, navigation, or anti-collision lights visible. also, this was not a landing light, as it was omni-directional, not shining ahead as a landing light would.\r\n \r\nthen i considered it may have been the rosat satellite, which is due to re-enter the atmosphere and burn up. the light had no firey trail in it's wake, and it appeared to be traveling in straight and level flight.\r\n \r\nalso the light appeared to be moving fast, so this was no \"oriental lantern\". i would guess the light was about 3,000 feet, and traveled from horizon to horizon in less than 90

appeared to be very large and were very high in the sky as they were passing behind the trees. they traveled from west to east and south to north. there were four. two, could have been the same object passing in front of the camera at different times. this one was brilliant red. one was white with colored lights in the middle and the other was multicolored. i brought them in to photoshop to have a closer look and there is some kind of structure there. i have no idea what these are. i put the time lapse footage together and had a look at that and the objects move so fast they look like shooting

while sitting with my girlfriend and chatting with friends i noticed 4 lights (satelite sized) that made a triangle flying in a straight path over the property we were on. i noticed it at first because i always enjoy watching the sky and thought it was a satelite but never seen them so close together so i knew it was something other-worldly.  i had a feeling it was a ufo but you just never really expect to get such proof. all 4 lights stayed uniform as it flew south to north overhead of myself as well as several other witnesses. i yelled \"look! what's that?\" astonished. as everyone just watched for maybe 15 seconds as it kept going out of sight. about a minute later, in the same flight path and direction, a swarm of at least 30 single lights all bunched together came overhead. all i could do was watch in awe as this swarm of starlike lights buzzed silently flying south to north. i distinctively remember keeping my eye on two lights that were on the outer rim of the swarm, i watched one bounce over blocking my view of the other and then back again in less then a second. all the lights just kept going at a steady speed (about that of a satelite) and disappeared out of view. i felt like i had just seen something that i will probably never get to see again. i was upset that no one had any video proof, but was super estatic to have my own proof after observing the night sky and wondering what if for so long.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

looking at stars or trying to find more ufo's, and we ended up looking at what we believed to be the north star, but as we looked around we found out it wasn't the north star that we was looking at, and was actually a bright star, it was flickering and was going smaller and bigger, we then saw a strobe of green light go from it, this lasted for around a second and didn't actually go very far, there were other eye witnesses and we all freaked out at the same time when we saw it, so it wasn't something that i thought i was seeing. there is also a video on youtube of the 'north star' growing
