the bed to pat hishead and the top of his head was soaking wet.  still thinking that he must have to go out, i reached for my shoes and they were also soaking wet. nevertheless i took my dog to the front door (actually had to coerce him) and was about to open it when he began to cower behind me, but i opened the door anyway and began to nudge him out the door, but he would have none of it and was trembling all over, and still whining. i implored him to go out, but he wouldn't go.. then i saw something that caused me much concern. there was about an inch to an inch and a half of new snow on the sidewalk and lawn. and there were footprints leading from the front door to the edge of the road. the road was also covered in snow.  the foot prints were mine and the dog's footprints right beside mine.  how could that be as we hadn't been out after the snowfall.The footprints led out but did not return and yet my dog and i were still inside the house. and there was just the one set of foot and paw prints going out . . . . but none coming back!! there was no other way back into the house. we would have thad to come back the exact same way.  as i stood there puzzled and my dog still cowering behind me,i looked across the road where there was a very large empty field. against the sky but touching the earth was a \"green\" haze-like something or other, ever  since then (and i am now 80, i have tried to reproduce that color by mixing craft paints, and by looking for objects with that same color, and i've never been able to reproduce it.  i took my stil-whining dog back inside and went back to bed but pulled up the window shade so i could see outside\r\nthe green was still there and cast an eerie light in the room. my husband was asleep beside me and i so wanted to wake him out but didn't. as i lay there watching the green it drifted off and maybe i would have forgotten about after awhile, but i never could because of the one-way footprints in the snow.  since i felt compelled not to tell anyone, my solution was to \r\nsee what i could find out on my own which eventually led me to the subject of ufo's, and not too long after that other incidents in our town. i worked at a residential school that had about seven cottages for the various age groups.  and one early morning around daylight we had a call from one of the other cottages regarding their ongoing sighting of a ufo\r\nat the back of their building they and all the other students were observing it. that's another long story, the end of which brought them some kind of official visit (government i think) in which they all had to sign a paper vowing never to talk about what they had seen. i've never told anyone any of this and have left out other details. i didn't feel safe and i did feel compelled not to talk about it. i felt always in danger about what would happen to me if i did. what i've said here so far is in many ways just the tip of the iceberg. nevertheless, i feel a little more unburdened from having kept this in for such a very long time. \r\n \r\n\r\n  ","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

if out of nowhere i noticed a fiercely glowing object from my glass-walled home office windows. living on the 15th floor of a high-rise in downtown san diego affords my family spectacular city views and on an intermittently clear early morning like last saturday this object was unequivocally visible. heading outside onto our south-facing balcony, i was able to capture some remarkable pictures and video although i was only using my iphone 6 as i don’t own any proper photography equipment. \r\n\r\nof particular significance, i was able to simultaneously record both the object and a commercial airliner on its westbound arrival path into lindbergh field from 4:53am-4:59am pst. although the plane did not seem to respond to any advised deviation from air-traffic control during its normal course, it's runway approach was not very far to the south of the object and it eventually passed underneath the object's stationary elevation prior to landing. for any downtown san diego resident with regular visibility of arriving flights, it's nearly always customary to see multiple planes landing in staggered groups of two to three or more, yet after the initial red-eye arrival there were no subsequent incoming aircraft. \r\n\r\ni'd be eager to learn from faa records if any post-5:00 am pst arriving flights were diverted or delayed as a result of the object's presence considering the extremely high probability that the pilots viewed the object for many miles before and during their descent. prior to the object's astonishingly rapid ascent out of view, i took several 1-3 minute video clips and also a couple dozen pictures from 4:41am-5:31am pst that i’m confident are worthy of taking the time to view and scrutinize.\r\n\r\nas for the morning of 7/30/17, this is where i got much more than i bargained for. as a casual follower of dr. steven greer's contributions to the ufo community, i recall reading once how he used coherent thought to manifest the presence of eti's and so i half-jokingly decided i'd give it a shot the next morning, not thinking with any genuine expectation whatsoever that something would come of it. throughout the entire next evening while burning the midnight oil working on corporate contracts (yes, i'm a white collar stiff unfortunately), i attempted to allocate conscious thought towards that same object appearing in the same location at the

physiological response, but unique to me, it was coupled with a strong dulling of my motor skills. moving past my fear, i started to sense some kind of palpable connection with the object and reciprocal communication directly with it via mental energy and nonverbal messaging. on 7/30/17 at 5:14am pst after several minutes of singular focus on my request that the object \"show me something special\", the object tilted vertically and projected an unmistakable \"face\" encompassing its halo which, thankfully for my own sanity's sake, i was to photograph. the \"face\" appears to perhaps be wearing a crown with 4 or 5 points atop a very wide face with large, round cheeks, a broad nose, dark but non-threatening eyes and of all things, a broad slit-smile. as the sun began to rise over the

skies. \r\n\r\na weird storm front has been peppering the phila area with near stationary storms since the end of july. today, aug 2nd around noon i was driving with my girlfriend to pick up some photo prints and i passed through one of the storms. very strange clouds and lightning. we arrived at a red light near the edge of the storm and looked i up at the sky. there was a break in the clouds up above and i looked up towards the top of the storm clouds around it in time to see a small weird black sphere like object moving steadily from my left to right at what looked to be a high speed. i watched it for a moment and for a moment i thought it was a balloon caught in the wind until i realized that it was moving too steadily and a bird or balloon would be getting thrown around in that wind. the object did not appear to have any natural qualities to its appearance or movement - too straight and the conditions were too windy for it to fly steadily as a bird. no sound, no wing movement, no lights or glow.\r\n\r\ni was willing to pass it off as a balloon or bird in my head as i was watching it happen until i noticed the other, identical looking object speeding up to it from behind as if it were chasing the first object. the leading object then slowed down, they got next to each other, and both continued at a new steady pace in unison until they went over the trees to my right. at that point, the light turned green and i couldn't see them anymore anyway so i drove on my way.\r\n\r\nno missing time, and no strange malfunctions at that time although her phone has since been acting strange. no idea where they went. i do know in all of my photographic experience i have never seen birds move or behave like that, even in fair weather. my girlfriend said they moved like

was on my balcony smoking. i often look at the sky not to find ufos but just to admire really, so as i was looking, i noticed something seemed a bit weird, noticed a bright light in the horizon, just hovering, stationary. it felt weird, that's why it caught my attention, like nothing i had ever really seen, something that seemed out of place. it disappeared,, as though the object disappeared rather than lights going off i mean, or so i thought. i kicked myself for not having my phone with me to take pics or film so i can see better what that's about, so disappointed but moved on within a minute. i glanced at other bits of the sky and that one to make sure nothing appeared again though. and then it was again, at the exact same spot i saw it first, so i ran to get my phone this time and took a few pics and videos. i could have taken more i suppose, but because it just stayed there hovering i thought maybe it's some kind of a drone, but it just doesn't seem like it when i look at the pics and videos. \r\nas for the object's actions, with the naked eye it looked as though it wasn't really moving or anything, but looking through my videos it clearly looks like it's turning around and/or filling itself up with light, that's what it looks like to me anyway. after a while the light started going very dim, again with the naked eye i thought it just turned the lights off but they go really smoothly and progressively it seems. another thing i noticed after looking at what i took, is that small light below the main object, it looks like it goes dim along with the big object

believe that this is the same object witnessed in casefile# 85573 from steinbach, mb. that occurred later in the same evening. hazy oval shape with slight light diffusing from centre. consistent speed/heading. slower than a satellite and faster than a cloud.\r\n\r\nso,this occurred at approximately 10:25 pm last night (august 1, 2017), from within the city of winnipeg, manitoba. let me first say that i am not one who is inclined to speculate upon these types of things commonly. i am a scientist of sorts within a discipline that is strongly geography based and thus i am used to making similar contextual observations within the natural world.\r\n\r\nthe neighbourhood that i live in is constructed in a proper grid pattern whereby the streets and back lanes run n/s and obviously, the intersecting streets run perpendicular along the e/w axis (this helped me have a good understanding of the objects' course and heading).\r\n\r\nlast night had a very clear sky, no clouds, the stars and planets could be seen with clarity (even within the city and its light pollution), and the moon was very bright as well.  of course there was the odd plane in the air (landing or taking off from winnipeg intl airport), as well as the city police singular, low flying helicopter). the odd satellite could be seen as well ( i use the satellite tracking app - so i am always looking at the sky).\r\n\r\nanyways, a friend and i were in the back lane behind my garage chatting when i noticed what i thought was an odd looking cloud within my peripheral vision. i was facing south and listening to my friends story when i noticed that this hazy, oval-shaped \"cloud\" thing was moving across the sky to the east (from what i could assume was a west to east heading as i didn't start to notice it until it was almost directly in my line of sight [again, i was facing south]).  there were no other clouds in the sky at the time and it was moving at a rate of speed that would be faster than that of a low cloud but slower than that of a satellite; besides which, the altitude, bearing and azimuth of the object meant that it could not be a satellite as it wouldn't have entered into the portion of the sky that produces satellite glint from my point of observation. i figured that whatever it was, it had to be at least several dozen kilometers away to the south of the city, and that therefore the object (or at least its aura/halo?) was quite large.  as my friend was speaking and looking at me, he eventually noticed that i kept glancing past him at the sky behind him, (and likely annoyed that i wasn't paying attention to his story) and enquired as to what i was noticing.  so i pointed it out to him and we both watched it for several minutes.  by this time it was somewhat east of where i first noticed its south position in the sky (away from the bright moon) and its shape and dimensions were beginning to get harder to discern.  but he could see it; and we both recognized that there was a very faint and diffused light or glow about it with a slightly brighter center point.  as we both work in the same field, we agreed that it was not likely a cloud, nor could it be a plane or a satellite as we are both highly observant of such things and their produced effects upon the sky.\r\nit moved, as i stated above, from west to east at a consistent rate of speed on a course with no observable deviation.  its visibility however did change.  it was much more pronounced when it was within the portion of the horizon closer to the bright moon and as it moved eastward grew more faint.  pretty much like you would expect from a cloud. but again, i really do not believe that it was a cloud (nor did my friend) based on its context, observable traits and behaviours. the shape was definitely oval, (and i know that the object seen in casefile#: 85573 - which i believe to be the same event/phenomenon -  was thought to have a round shape)or perhaps double convex lenticular. i wondered if it could have been like a spotlight or something similar, but then dismissed the idea as its range of illumination would override that of even a very powerful spotlight.  a few years ago i observed and recorded a unique weather/atmospheric phenomenon known as light \"pillaring\" and was therefore wondering if it could be something similar, but then realized that light pillaring is an optical effect produced by surface lights reflecting upon suspended ice crystals in the low atmosphere. as it is super hot summer here right now (with humidex ratings of 39 degrees celsius) and that there is likely no ice crystals in the air right now.  as we watched it kind of fade out, my friend and i concluded our conversation, and he got into his car and drove home while i stayed in my back lane for awhile scanning the se sky and horizon for any further signs of this thing. alas, i did not see it again.\r\n\r\nagain, i am not one for particular flights of fancy.  i rely upon my senses and the principles of science to provide me with the empirical data i use to interpret the world around me (this can also be said of my friend).  what we observed was unique enough to not only catch and hold our attention, but also warrant our thorough critical assessment.  it could possibly be something fairly common to someone like a meteorologist or other type of environmental scientist, but it is something that i noted and believed should be recorded.  later on last night, i was google searching if anyone else had noticed something in the sky in manitoba around that time of the night and lo and behold, came across the reported steinbach event (casefile#: 85573).  i thought that i should also report on what i saw; if not for scientific reasons, then at least that person would know that somebody else saw something that couldn't be immediately explained.\r\n\r\nto be straight about it, i am not saying that i thought i saw a spacecraft or some such, just that i observed phenomenon that was unfamiliar to me.\r\n\r\nthanks for regarding my report.\r\n\r\ncheers,

around 10 pm pacific time, noticing it in the eastern direction just above the treetops. i first saw it when my friend pointed it out to me, noting the bright light emitting from it. at first i thought the object was some sort of strange cloud formation or possibly an aircraft of some sort reflecting light somewhere; however it remained there for a very long period of time. when i went to bed, it was still there outside my window, albeit at a higher elevation than before. i was most shocked, however, when i awoke the next morning around 6 am before work to find the orb still there. i noted that the orb had moved significantly across the sky and had returned closer to the ground. i was quite surprised, but decided not to think about it too much. it finally disappeared beneath the treetops in the western direction around 10 am. i assume there was a landing site somewhere, but i didn't pursue it. the circle itself was almost perfectly round, emitted white light, but looked as though it had smaller circular shapes inside it. it was one of the strangest experiences i've had in my entire life, and i will never forget it.

stars. i noticed a flickering light that at first i thought was a star or an airplane. it was not either or. i watched what appeared to be a disc shaped object that pulsated but at the same time seemed like the lights on it sequenced from left to right. it hovered in an acute area making no sound but made very swift short movements (vertical, horizontal, diagonal, and even half circular). at one point, shortly below the craft closer to the horizon but still high up in the sky it omitted a white light that started from nothing and in the shape of a circle got a little bit bigger than the craft and disappeared. somewhat similar to a sonic boom. it also made no sound. i felt as if the craft could tell that i was watching it. i stayed outside watching this incident until almost 4am when i proceed to go inside due to the mosquitos. i was so intrigued by the event that i shifted my bed so that i could watch it out of my bedroom window, it was still there when i fell asleep. the following night i went outside to see if this object was there and it was not. i witnessed some ufo activity in roughly the same area, in gibraltar fall of 2010 which i still have on a camera in my house. i attempted to record this recent event on the video recorder on my phone but due to the distance of the object and the quality of my phone camera the videos i recorded do not do this any justice. very strange. if i had to say this craft was very large and very far away, just my opinion.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":85575,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.0828891746279,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08022017-0005","longitude":-83.19431112932482,"occurred":1501468200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1501643452000,"summary":"Pulsating
