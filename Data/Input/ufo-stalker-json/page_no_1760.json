the north star caught my eye, as it not anywhere near where it would typically be. i rather frequently gaze the night sky as we now live on the outskirt of the city and have a great viewing sky. as i stopped to observe this bright star i realized it was moving across the eastern sky south in a straight flight path and i could here a faint jet-like engine sound in the distance.  although we are about 40 miles south of rdu airport, this did not in any way appear as a passenger jet in the sky even flying a path and speed of a jet.   the white light emitted was extraordinarily bright, with no blinking light that one would typically observe on a plane and the engine noise was barely noticeable.  the object moved in a similar path to a jet but it was very difficult to tell the distance from myself to the object.  when driving past the airport i have seen planes at very low altitude that were not nearly this bright. planes that do cross airspace over our house are distinctly heard and visible. the object was entirely to quiet to be that close and that bright, and the hair on my arms immediately stood up (and actually teared up) as i told my wife through the screen door that i seriously think that there is ufo outhere. within seconds the object made a rapid ascent; the light growing smaller and dimmer towards the stars then completely disappeared from sight.  the object had flown a straight flight path for probably about 10 seconds that i observed and within 3 seconds was out of sight. the ascent was more rapid than any object i have ever witnessed in my life and this

i was approaching the woodman exit, i saw four very bright lights in the air ahead of me.  they looked like car headlights, except they were very bright, and were illuminating the foggy cloud cover above and below them.  i thought it was a jet taking off from burbank airport for a few seconds, but then i realized that the light coming down from this thing were illuminating a patch of the highway in front of me, so it was quite low.  when i first saw it the angle was about 20degrees above the horizon.  there was other traffic on the highway with me, and when i passed under the object, i leaned forward and looked up through my windshield.  i saw silver-colored, triangular object with a red light at the point, and two green lights midway down each side (they were constant, unblinking lights).  i think there were also lights at the rear corners.  also on the shape was a silver line just \"inboard\" from the outer edge, in a v-shape mirroring the triangle itself (see my really not very good drawing).\r\nas i passed under it my car was illuminated by the light coming off of it.  i saw the underside of it very clearly (though could no longer see the four bright white lights), and i don���t think it could���ve been more than 100��� off the ground.  given the way the angle increased so rapidly (i was going about 60 and it was going the other direction at about ���-���  my speed), i think it must���ve been pretty low.   i would���ve done anything to be on anything but a freeway, as i watched it disappear down the road behind me.  i exited at laurel canyon, turned around and headed back down the freeway but i never saw it again.  i went all the way to van nuys blvd. before realizing i would've caught it and that it must not be following the original flight path/pattern.\r\nwhile at the stoplight at laurel canyon i noted the time on my car���s clock (it said 11:24 and it had been about 1 minute since i saw the object).  i was hoping someone else exiting would pull next to me so i could ask if they���d seen it too, but the only other car which exited turned right (and i was turning left so i could get back on the freeway in the other direction).\r\ni���d do anything to be able to relive this experience.  it was either someone trying very hard to be a convincing ufo over the freeway (say, by dressing up a helicopter), or��� ���or i don���t know.  i was surprised at how clearly i saw it when i looked up through my windshield (though i probably only saw the actual ���upview��� of the shape for a second or two); i was only expecting to see the four lights ��� not the triangular thingy i actually saw.  \r\nwhen i first saw the row of four lights (which i drew next to the triangle shape), they were giving of a lot of light radiating upwards from them as well as downwards ��� represented by the triangles in the drawing but not to the side - and not nearly in the sharply-defined conical shape i represent in the drawing - it was just massive amounts of light spilling upwards and downwards).  the light was ���yellower/whiter��� than a police spotlight (which has kind of a blue hue), and the pool of light it made on the freeway was less defined as well.  the pool of light on the freeway was also not ���jittering��� the way a police helicopter light does.  when the object was still in front of me (and all i could see were the four lights), i could tell that it was moving a bit from side to side (very smoothly) as it came toward me.\r\ni have never seen a ufo before, nor have i ever reported anything like this ever before.  honestly ��� it was a pretty incredible sight, the more i think about it.  i know this is likely one of the lamer reports you receive, but i can hardly believe that not one other person on the freeway saw/reported it.   someone travelling in the other direction would���ve had a side view at about a 45-degree angle.\r\nwhile i would like remain anonymous (regarding this reports appearance in public), i would be more than happy to be contacted if anyone has any questions.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line

close to the ground, but at tree top level, which was odd because living in the country and being a sky watcher i know all the towers in the area i had drove past my best friends house the night before 10/14/2011 about 8:00 pm (she lives 5 houses down from me in a rural area, she was out of town for the night and asked me to watch her house and i didn't notice anything unusual then. but when i was backing out of my driveway at 6:20am on my way to work, i seen 3 strobing lights in a triangle shape, just about the tree line. wasn't sure what i was seeing so i decided to investigate. i drove to the end of our road, and the closer i got the strobing lights stopped, the weather was very windy so i thought i might have seen something flapping in the wind. but the farther i got from my house i seen nothing. i eventually turned back around and headed back toward my house. as i was driving i noticed that i could see the strobing lights again in my rear view mirror, i stopped and turned my head and looked behind me but there wasn't nothing, i started driving again, looked in the mirror and there it was, i repeated the stopping and looking behind me several times, and each time nothing was there. but when i looked in my mirror the triangle was there strobing. i finally started to get a little freaked out and made a beeline to work which is only 2 miles from where i live. i told my boss what i experienced. when i got home i told my husband what happened and asked him to go with me so i could get a better idea of what i might have seen in the day light, the first thing i notice was that we have alot of treeline and where i see this thing was in a u shape between the trees so that means it was higher up then i first thought. and it was in only one area of visibility, so that explains when i was driving back that it would be out of sight. when we drove farther down the road to where i stopped and turned around, it's open space, just fields and sky, so not sure what happened to it. but all i know is it was there, bright, strobing red in a triangle and it was huge, i know that because when my husband and i went to investigate the area i seen it in there is no doubt in my mind that this thing was huge. i had been up since 4:45 took a shower, ate breakfast and was wide awake when i left for work. i know our area really well i've lived here for over 9 yrs and know all the towers etc. i just want to know if someone else reported anything strange. my friend that i mentioned earlier has seen very strange things over the corn field behind her house, one night she was outside smoking a cig and seen very strange lights over the corn field behind her house, she went to investigate by walking to the fence separating her yard from the field and got so freaked out she ran back in the house, drew the cutains closed and cowered in the other room waiting for something to happen. she has said she has had a lot of experiences since moving into this house, which was this last spring. please let me know if anyone has reported anything thank you. call my cell phone(number moved to fi box) cms 10/15/11 23:47 flg if i don't answer please leave a message i'll call

towards maricopa from chandler. through the top right corner of my windshield i noticed a string of several lights that would flash one time in a sequence and then disappear, only to flash again in sequence further to the right of where i initially noticed them. the bright lights would light up one after the other in a line of 3 and then disappear in reverse the same way they came on. like i said, i saw it go through its sequence once, and then again almost as if it was moving in a straight line or as if it vanished and reappeared along a horizontal path, like it was blinking. after seeing it do this 2 times, i called my father on my cell phone to tell him what i was seeing and while talking to him it had moved from the top right of my windshield to the front passneger window, also possibly because i was still driving south. there were other motorists on the freeway going both directions but im unsure whether anyone else saw this. also of note, the maricopa police department had 1 patrol car stationed every few miles or so on the far shoulders of the highway way off the actual road with their lights on for a total of 3 to 4 patrol cars between the mountain with the giant \"m\" on it and just before highway 10. the reason i am contacting mufon is because this is the second instance of me seeing this exact craft or lights.  the first time was sometime in late august when i was travelling south on porter near walmart in maricopa around 945 pm. i was at the stop light at porter and casa grande highway and the moon was big and beautiful through my windshield, so i was gazing at it in all its lunar glory when i noticed the same lights i described above underneath it about 3 inches by finger measurements. on this time that i saw it there was a string or arc of 5 to 6 lights that followed the same sequence of appearing and disappearing. on this occasion it only \"blinked\" one time and i was unsure if i had saw anything at all because it happened so fast. after seing it again last night, oct 14th, that prompted me to contact you to see if anybody else witnessed this because i have tried digging around on the internet and can find no such record and

there would be a meteor shower that saturday night. it was around 7:45 that we decided we'd see nothing, despite the fact that there was not a cloud in the sky, when i saw a bright orange globe moving across the sky, south to north in a straight line followed just a few hundred feet behind by an identical orange globe. we both stood up and watched as the two moved steadily to the north.  when they disappeared a 3rd light appeared, also moving at a fast rate of speed (about the same speed as a small airplane) toward the north. we then went to our front yard (driveway) and watched as several other objects appeared, all following the first object and all traveling at the same speed and on exactly the same path. this lasted long enough for me to go get my camera and get pictures of 4 of the objects. one of them appeared bright white but all the others were a yellow-orange color. we thought perhaps they were chinese lanterns, but there was absolutely no wind that night and they were moving very fast to the north. i watched them as they moved north and eventually got so far away that they disappeared. they did not go out, as  you would expect a chinese lantern, they just got too far away to see any longer, despite the clear night. we have seen chinese lanterns before in our area and these were distinctly different. for one, the lanterns always appeared as bright white balls and stayed mainly stationary, climing higher into the sky, but not moving north, south, east or west.  these lights were moving as a fast clip and in the same direction, almost on the same exact line, one behind the other. i have quite a few pics and have attached three examples (that's all i could attach) that feature the original picture (on the left) and a blow up of the picture you see.  if you want i can send all of the pictures to you.\r\n  i am the director of news and information for 6 clear channel radio stations in milwaukee and a veteran of 35 years in the news business and would not file this report as a joke. this really took place and i am extremely puzzled by what we saw as there was no obvious explanation. i talked about this on two of our stations (wisn and woky) and have since received reports from three listeners who observed similar events, but on different nights.

very visible now, it's an orb although some anomalous feature at the bottom like a tiny orb underneath it. starts to ascend, i fumble my phone-camera (i haven't used it before) got a couple of seconds good footage of my hand. pointing my camera at it but it's not recording, watching it rising straight up, higher than helicopters go, still flashing, noticed another one higher up to the north-west and then another one, even higher, to the south-east. still rising and getting fainter, straining my eyes and i'm wondering whether i'm seeing things by that point - possibly several more all pin-pricks. whole sighting maybe 10 minutes. highly visible, other people must have seen this.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":32584,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.498609,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-10142011-0005","longitude":-0.133906,"occurred":1318625400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"England","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Blimp,   Circle,   Disc,   Sphere,   Teardrop","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1318623090000,"summary":"Silver-white reflective orbs (3) hovering over westminster","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"SW1","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"London, England","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:29871"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Midway","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Witness reports that he was taking pictures of the sunrise pn august 7, 2011 at 5:50 a.M. he reports that he took a fe pictures and did not see anything unusual in the sky. he reports that when he was downloading the pictures into his computer's \"my pictures computer library\" he found picutes of the object on his pictures on the computer. he reports that he did not see the objects when he took the pictures. \r\n\r\nthis report is being made for the witness by fred saluga, chief investigator  for the state of west virginia as witness does not want to be identified.","distance":"N/A","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":32583,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.561817,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10142011-0004","longitude":-81.965775,"occurred":1312721400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"West Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1318619418000,"summary":"Ufo found on pictures taken at 5:50 a.M. that was not visible to the naked eye.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":68,"locationName":"Midway, West Virginia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:29872"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82758,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1760}
