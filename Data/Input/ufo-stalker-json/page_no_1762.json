show them how amazing it was to shine the device towards the heavens. after pointing it towards the moon which was 3/4 full and then towards a bright star, two low flying, extremely bright white objects traversed the exact intersection of where i had just shone the laser beams. it thoroughly frightened me and the kids and we ran to the house for cover. the objects, bright as the sun met just beyond the tree line and were gone. ever since that day, i have been seeing them every night i go outside to look for them (except on overcast nights of course).  i don't know how but i think they can hear my thoughts, however i'm not sure how to prove this. i only know that as soon as i go outside and sit in my fold-back chair, they begin to appear within 60 seconds. they traverse the sky from all directions, sometimes one-in-front-of-the-other and sometimes side-by-side forming a barbell shape. my mother lives next door. after telling her what i'v been seeing, she comes out every night and witnesses these things also. for what its worth, my mom is retired from louisiana state department of transportation and i come from an avionics background with boeing aircraft including work with both civilian and military aircraft. i am familiar with most aircraft flying and not flying today, yet what i am seeing, along with known aircraft, are not classified as \"identified\". i have seen several times a strobe flash inconsistently in the same location, as if hovering for several minutes. i have seen several times a bright flash with a streak coming from the flash and then a bright orb materialize similar to star treks enterprise emerging from hyperspace. i have seen these orbs slow down and hover, then disappear as if it just turned down a dimmer switch. most recently i have seen a very large triangle (about the size of three boeing 747's) glide perfectly aligned over my house, just above the trees, extremely slow (almost a hover) heading exactly nne in a perfectly straight line. i estimate it took nearly 10 minutes for the thing to disappear beyond the tree line. the triangle had three extremely bright orb lights on all three points and one deep red, pulsating, ripple strobe in the very center. one week ago, october 6th and 7th with green laser in hand, i managed to communicate with the orbs. as i saw one pass directly overhead, i activated my laser with a solid beam in front of the craft and waited to see if the craft would run through my beam. as the orb approached my beam, i turned my laser off before he passed through. (i don't think he would appreciate it if i shined directly at him). as my laser turned off, he turned his light off. seconds passed and then two orbs side by side flew over me. the following night i see a bright orb. i flash my laser once near him. he flashes back. amazed, i flash my laser once again. he flashes one again. this continues five consecutive times, then i flash my laser far away from him and so he disappears immediately. this was communication without a doubt. there is so much more. often times i \"feel\" or sense when i'm about to see one. they do not obey my thoughts, however they seem to know them. if a request is genuine, they may choose to act upon that request. several times now i have seen a very large and bright streak of light come vertically straight down just beyond the tree line. those really frighten me for some reason. once, an orb acted as if it was shooting straight towards me, but it shrank back to it's original luminosity as i was indeed frightened. oddly enough, what did not frighten me was the triangle, mostly because it was moving so slow and seemingly non-imposing. i am at a loss as to who i'm seeing in the louisiana skies at night among the stars and passing planes. i suppose time will tell us who they are and what their mission is. i only hope they're the good guys.

sitting there watching the stars and the night airline traffic go by. as i sat there i noticed a bright light to the right of me. as i looked over i saw what looked like two airplanes going to crash into each other. then i saw what was an airplane go past and continue on in the flight path of the night. i then saw a very purple/red bight led light coming slowly towards my direction by the tree. it was very low and did not have any navigation lights on it. i thought it was strange also because there was no noise and it was getting very close and the color of light was  a dark violet and an odd color to see. it was moving slowly and it went behind the tree and started to ascent into the tree. then as it came up to the top of the tree i see what looks like 2 attached squares outlined. the top had a yellow orange inside lined in red and the bottom square was just red. it was pulsating and making no noise. there were no other lights. the tree is at the edge of the yard and just a couple yards away,  i got scared but continued to watch. as this object ascended and got to the top it just stayed there for a couple seconds. then  it seemed to change to to solid orange/red orb of light that was glowing very bright and it looked solid like a bar of hot glowing metal.\r\n\r\nwhen this object was up to the top of the tree area it started to descend down a little lower and in a straight line path it continued to move slowly across the yard without wavering.It was up just above the utility lines that are very low over the yards.  as it moved it got smaller like the light was cut off by a quarter of an inch each time it moved and it just canceled itself out. as the light got to the end of the garage it looked like a silver line and it just blinked out and disappeared.\r\n\r\nafter a couple of minutes later this same type of object/orb appeared again and out of no where as from the same area as the object before. this second object did a copycat flight path and exit as the first object/orb. the only difference i could make out was that this second object was a little dimmer in coloring/lighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

rd.\r\ni then remembered about a giant indian that is on the roof of this tobacco\r\nstore (that's what it was when i was a kid it's something else now)on the northwest corner of 63rd and pulaski rd in chicago. one time when i was a kid i was on the cta bus going east on 63rd st. when the bus came to a stop\r\nat pulaski. i was looking out the window and notice three teenage girls standing on the sidewalk right next to the bus. two of the girls were pointing up at this indian trying to show the third girl something and they all giggling. so i was wondering what they pointing and laughing at.\r\nso some time went by and then one day i went to the currency exchange right over there. on the way out i decided to walk over by the indian to the same spot where i seen these girls laughing and pointing to see what it was they thought was funny. well it turns out that if you look at the indian from this exact spot his left thumb is sticking out and it looks like his thing is sticking out his pants. so when my wife and me were going by this indian on august 22nd 2011 at about 2:00pm i decided to get a picture of this. i just got new smartphone and i wanted to check out how good the camera would work. so i got out of the car and went to the spot and took about four pictures of this indian. so we left and went home and later on that night i went to look at the pictures i took. when i was checking these photos out, in one of the pictures i notice the object that was on the backside of indian. at first i didn't think nothing of it, i figured it was plane or something. but just for the heck of it i enlarged it. it looked something similar to a bird or a bat, but then again it doesn't. so i have no idea what it could be. i was reluctant to send it in because i figured there was some explanation for what it is. but then i thought it still qualifies as ufo, because i never seen anything like it before and don't know what it could be. \r\n","distance":"101-500

the white light quickly moved farther ahead of the flashing red lights moving independently from each other showing they were two separate craft. the red flashing lights were obviously an airplane, but the white light consisted of a single white orb-like light with no other flashing lights, and no flashing lights. the airplane appeared to be chasing the white light. they moved in a straight line in a direction which would take it across the narrows and approximately south of tacoma. i kept an eye on them as much as possible. as they moved closer toward the horizon they moved behind trees on the side of the freeway. i kept seeing them through several openings in the trees. finally i came to a large open area and when i looked i saw the airplane but the white light was gone.\r\n\r\nthe

the helicopter i expected to see was not there.  the object was dark gray without reflection.  since it was not what expected, i stared for a moment trying to decide if it was a group of dark  bags or material but that wasn't right either.  the shape was closest to a hat with high brim and low top. it did not move.  it hovered stationary.  morning light was just beginning to make dark objects stand out.  i did not see it move in any direction.  due to the heavy traffic at this time of the morning, i was unable to observe it for any extended time.  when i had driven past the point of seeing it directly out the side window, i followed it in my side mirror until i rounded the curve in the road.  seeing an object in the sky that i could not explain has never happened before.  there wasn't a

to one trail above stolle meadows i was standing outside my camp at approximately 10:00pm at night when i observed a strange triangular shaped craft that made no sound and displayed a single lighted window in the center on the bottom of the craft.  the window was not like a light as it was a pitch dark night with no clouds and yet you couldn't see a beam of light projecting from the source.  the window just displayed a large white surface as if it were internally lighted.  there were no other markings, lights or windows that could be seen on the craft.  the craft moved from west to east approximately 1000 ft. or so above the ridgeline and even though it was approximately 2-3 miles away it was looking to be about the size of a 737 jetliner.  i have seen jets passing by at that distance and even though they are much higher at approximately 30,000 feet you can see them clearly and even see the flame in their engines because the night is so clear.  this had no visible source of propulsion and even though it was closer there was absolutely no sound emitted by it.  i watched for approximately a minute as it moved from my right to my left and eventually passed out of sight behind the mountain.  i was viewing it through the gap between the mountains as i looked toward boiling springs down the sixteen to one trail from my vantage point about 2-3 miles away towards stolle meadows.  the craft would have to have been flying at a pretty low altitude as the monumental peak that it disappeared behind is only a little bit short of 8000ft.  i have searched all pictures of any

eastern sky.\r\nmy wife and i were in our apartment due to a passing shower outside. was watching tv when i noticed the incredible brilliant rainbow in the eastern sky through the window.  it was completely amazing, so i called my wife to come out on our balcony.  it was like nothing we have ever seen before in 58 years.  there were three rainbows that were tight to each other when i noticed a 4th rainbow that was some distance from the other three but following the same path. i have never seen three of them before but when the forth appeared we were ecstatic.  we started taking pictures of the rainbow with our phone cameras when my wife ran inside to get our digital camera.  the rainbows were the brightest and most brilliant that we have ever seen.  my wife started taking some pictures before it faded away. when we came in we never looked at the camera's photo's and put it away. i pulled the camera out a few days ago and looked at the photo's.  i was shocked at what i believe she captured. i am nearly 90% sure she captured not only the rainbows but also 2 orbs that came into the photo and in less that 30 to 45 seconds they were gone.\r\ni spent 10 years as a navy crash rescue captain in the fire department and i knew most of all my military aircraft visually and audibly that frequented my air station. both naval air stations were closed by re alignment of facilities and moved. no military or civilian aircraft that i'm aware of looked like this and there wasn't a sound from that location.  i know we are just north of philadelphia airport and in a pattern for aircraft but air traffic is minimal at least. the second photo and the cell phone photo's were all taken seconds of each other. no orbs, then two orbs, then gone and looking at photo #1 under a zoom it looks like a white trail under the orb and the orb appeared to be headed straight up. i don't know what it was that we have pictures of but they weren't stars nor were they any aircraft that i'm aware of that can come into a photo and the next photo its gone.  the part that is intriguing is the fact that i was looking up at that location the whole time admiring the rainbow and never noticed them.  it wasn't until a few days ago when we were looking at the camera photo's that we observed the orbs in the picture. we were just looking at the rainbow photo's when we noticed what we caught. a four banded rainbow and two orb's.....Dumb luck i guess...Would rather have won the lottery! \r\nthe two attached photo's were from the digital camera and the others are in my cell phone and i don't know how to get them.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

the full moon with my 1st generation iphone while in the country 15 miles due west of fort worth.  i took six photos in 46 seconds from a stationary position through the moon roof of an suv.  there was some clouds around the moon and the moon glare was such that i did not think any photos would turn out viewable.  i did not see anything other than a blue light in the corner of the iphone viewer; but when i looked without the iphone, i could not see a blue light and chalked it up to some camera artifact i was seeing.  \r\n\r\nwhen i downloaded the photos, i was surprised to see not only a blue sphere in the bottom right hand corner of the photos, but a white sphere within the clouds surrounding the moon.  as i checked each photo, the white sphere seemed to move around in the clouds while the blue sphere remained stationary.\r\n\r\ni decided to take measure of the distance, angles and diameters of the spheres in photoshop.  i was surprised to see that the diameter of both the blue & white spheres where identical & remained virtually the same, approximately 27 pixels within the six photos.\r\n\r\nthe full moon was scheduled to arrive at 9:06 pm, twenty-six minutes later than the photos i took.  i went back outside to just look at the full moon when a helicopter flew overhead towards the moon's direction.   a helicopter flying overhead would not be unusual as they fly from weatherford to fort worth almost nightly, an east-west flightpath.  however, this one was flying southeast.\r\n\r\ni don't know what to make of these photos, but i have never had something like this appear in any before.  it was just very odd to have two different colored spheres appear in photos, one moving and one stationary over a 46 second interval - and both of them being identical in size.  further, the white sphere's position would be nearly over the joint reserve base - formerly carswell air force base.","distance":"Over One

i decided to take a walk down to riverbank state park on 145th manhattan, ny. we've been there a few times before since he lived and worked at columbia presbyterian hospital a few blocks north from there. it was our favorite place to hang out and just enjoy the scenery. from that park you could see over to new jersey, the george washington bridge, and downtown and basically up the hudson river valley as well on a clear day. my friend and i got to the park and walked all the way down to the south corner of the park next to the basketball courts act... we sat down on the benches right next to the rail facing the hudson river. we spoke about work, family, daily normal everyday things, act....\r\nat one point during our conversation i stood up and walked next to the rail and leaned against the rail with my back towards the hudson river. my friend lay down on the bench and we kept talking until i for some strange reason looked up and noticed 3 or 4 \"star-liked\" objects just hovering motionless to the east of where i was standing. i asked my friend to stand up and see something strange up in the sky and so he did. he told me something around \"oh what those stars there\" but then he told me \"it's weird we're not supposed to see stars that bright during the day\". then i told him that they���re probably satellites or even balloons and we just basically brush it off and kept talking about other stuff. we stood there for a few more hours. then around 5:00pm or so we decided to go get something to eat at a nearby mcdonalds and basically started walking back north to exit the park. as we were walking north right beside the river i noticed again for some strange reason what looked like a \"black\" dot in the sky. it stood out to me because the sky was completely blue no clouds, haze nothing. this object was hovering motionless near the manhattan side of the g.W.Bridge precisely on top or near 3 tall buildings used by columbia presbyterian hospital as dorms for medical students or something my friend told me. he knew since like i said he worked at the hospital in the administration dept. i found it very odd so i ask my friend to walk fast to nearby sight-seeing binoculars that they have in that park to see over to new jersey, g. w. bridge act... at the same time that i was walking i was looking in my jeans pocket for 50 cents to paid in order to use the binoculars and happens to be that i had precisely that 2 quarters so i got to the machine put the money and first located the g.W. bridge since it was the biggest thing, then located the 3 buildings nearby and then moved the binoculars a little up from the buildings and lord behold there was the ���black dot��� which wasn���t really a ���black dot��� but a black tetrahedron pyramid object sitting motionless on an angle right on top of one of the buildings.\r\nthis object was completely black. it had not markings what so ever, no symbols, letters, windows, and doors i mean nothing. it was just black sort of ���gun metal black���. the only thing that had in each bottom corners was plasma-like circular lights. these lights emanated some sort of heat. sort of like the sun, yes they reminded me of the sun. it was like it had 3 suns in each corner. the object also didn���t rotate or nothing it was just there motionless.  at that point i was just ecstatic in a euphoric state debating whether i was seeing this or if it was all in my mind. i quickly turn to my friend which was standing right next to me asking me what was what i was seeing. why i was reacting the way i was reacting. i told him you have to see this come so i let him used the binoculars and told him where to look so he did but he couldn���t see find it. i looked with my eyes to see if i saw the black dot but it just vanish as quickly as it appeared. the rest of the day we just spoke about what had happened.\r\ni almost forgot to mention that prior to seen the triangle i had seen a black helicopter pass us by when we were walking towards the binoculars to see what the black dot was. this army type helicopter was really low to the river. i found that very odd.  this particular sighting is just one of many sightings i have had since childhood. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

while traveling northbound towards home i at first thought a firework had gone off because there were numerous reddish-orange ember like dots in the sky in a jagged pattern. as we got within a mile i noticed the lights stayed fixed in the sky. because there was an apartment complex in the area i thought maybe it was various apartment lights on until i noticed the lights were over the apartment building. we slowed down to look and all the lights but, after 1-3 minutes they disappeared. however, one remaining light descended and was following our vehicle on a parallel path about 1/2 mile west of us. we pulled into a parking lot and lost sight of the object. we did however, notice a circular object in the sky many miles from us that constantly blinked every 2-3 seconds. initially, we wondered if it was a satellite but it stayed in a fixed location for at least 3-5 minutes before it disappeared from view. during the time we witnessed the objects, numerous planes went by, noticeable by their noise, and red and green lights. what we witnessed was not an airplane, group of airplanes or helicopter. i, nor my family, have ever witnessed anything like this before. i hope there are other reports of the incident because i know it had to have been seen by more people than ourselves.

this was not what he was talking about apparently. he pointed a bit in front of the plane, it was hard to say how far in front it was though. they looked to be about the same height in the air but, from the ground this would be hard to ascertain. it had to be closer to me though than the plane because i could see the outline almost perfectly. i mean, the plain with the contrail was so high up, it was hard to identify the wings but, i recognized the shape so, i knew it was a plane. that is a pretty normal thing. \r\n\r\ntwo things struck me about this thing. one, that it was bright. i mean really bright and it was daylight. so, my first thought was that the sun must be reflecting off of it. but, the sun was in front of it and i was looking at the back and side of this thing and it was just really white, almost silvery or something but, the brightness of the object is probably one of the main things that made the shape so clear, i think. i've never seen a plane this bright and i used to live next to the airbase for years, so i know what planes look like! the second thing that struck me was the shape of it. i swear i've never seen anything like this and though i am hesitant to report a \"ufo\" as it were, nothing i've been able to think of has come close to matching it. it was dumbbell shaped! i had a circle in front and one in back as if the one end was the nose and the other circle was the tail. it was going fast, again from the ground i realize it is impossible to tell how fast it was going but, it was moving as fast as an airplane. though truthfully, when i saw it, i thought it was going faster than an airplane and even now, when i try to reconcile what it was i saw, i still would swear it was going faster than a plane. \r\n\r\nit was so bright and so odd shaped that it even kept my son's attention until it flew into the clouds to the west. he continued to ask me what it was and true to fashion, i told him it was an airplane but, at the time watching, he knew enough to know it wasn't like an airplane he'd ever seen and it was most certainly not anything i've ever seen either.\r\n\r\ni tried to snap a picture but, by the time i got over my shock and turned on my camera, it was already half in the clouds.
