appear above him for 30-60 minutes nightly. i am reporting this because his fellow officers kibits him about it and i feel mufon should follow up with this and video tape it for the public being it is nightly. the area is above boyton beach which is fairly dark at night to see the sky much better if videoed.\r\ni myself have seen 9 different objests at various dates in the last 3 months that i can't explain the origin. one in particular i have seen 3 times which is like a opaqe diode that lights up and then goes out. after it travels a certain distance it does it again. i don't know of any satellites that light up and yet nightly i can spot satellites so i know the difference. i hope some of you substantiate these nightly sitings in florida.","distance":"Over One

my neighborhood, i glanced down the street where our clubhouse is.  above it there was a big mass of lights just sitting there.  i had just watched a show about aliens the night before so i immediately thought, 'no, it can't be.'  i thought it was too much of a coincidence and too crazy. \r\ni backed up and turned down that street and drove toward it.  it just sat there!  this gigantic mass of lights!  as i got closer, i could see that it was a triangle shaped craft of some kind.  it was only about 500 feet above the building, just hovering.  it was black, but it looked like it was made out of mercury.  i could see the whole underside of the craft as i drove slowly toward it.  it had yellow-orange lights at each corner that pulsated and blue and white lights just inside the perimiter.  they were very bright and they cast a bright light on everything below, but they didn't glare like our normal lights do.  the light seemed to be a part of the surface.  just as i got in front of the clubhouse, it rotated and took off.  it flew across the street and up over the trees toward my house in a straight line.  i drove on down the street toward home and as i turned the first corner, there was a group of people running the same direction.  i caught up with them just as i got to the last turn onto my street and one of the guys yelled, \"did you see it?\"  \r\ni said, \"yes!\"\r\nhe said, \"it was a freakin' space ship!\"\r\ni knew exactly what it was but it didn't really hit me until i heard him say the words.  anyway, i wasn't scared at all, but i had misplaced my cell phone somewhere in my daughter's car, or so i thought.  i remember unplugging it that morning and putting it in my purse but couldn't find it later.  i thought it fell out in her car.  i didn't have any way of taking a picture without it.  after i turned the corner, i could see it up ahead.  it had stopped again just past my house.  i drove down the street and pulled in the driveway honking my horn as loud as i could.  i wanted my daughter to come outside and see it so my family wouldn't think i was crazy or something.  she said she didn't even hear the horn and i was really laying on it.  anyway, i jumped out of the car, forgot to turn the engine off and left the door hanging open because i wanted to go get her and my camera.  as soon as i got to the gate, it spun around and took off again.  this time it went almost straight up and it was gone in a fraction of a second.  i have never seen anything move that fast in my life!  those other people had been running down the street right behind me, but after it disappeared, they were gone too.  i don't know who they were or where they went but it was really weird.  they were right behind me one second and gone the next!  i looked up and then back toward them and they were just gone.  my heart was beating so fast by the time i got inside i could actually hear it.  i think my daughter did too.  she knew i wasn't kidding when i told her about it.  i have never seen anything so strange in all my life.  it was as big as three huge houses and it was just sitting there until i got close.  then, it went to my house and waited for me!  that's how it seemed anyway.  \r\nlater i looked all through my daughter's car for my phone and still couldn't find it.  i went back in and then to my bedroom and there was my phone, plugged into the charger laying on my bed.  i know i remember taking it off the charger that morning and putting it in my purse!  i thought maybe it fell out and malory put it back on the charger but she swears she didn't.  \r\ni don't know how any of it happened, but it did.  looking back, it really scares me.  did that thing know where i lived?  and what was up with those people and my phone?  i feel like i'm loosing my mind but i am as sure about all of it as i could possibly be.  i wish i could find those people but i'm not about to go door to door asking if the people who saw the ufo live there.  i filled out a report on the national ufo report site but i didn't bother to call the police.  what could they do?  probably just laugh.  \r\n \r\nthe next day my other daughter told some friends at work about it and two of them said they had seen something that sounded like the same thing within the past week.  i wonder how many other people have seen them around here?  \r\n\r\nanyway, i spent several hours on the computer looking at new aviation technology and i can't find anything that's anything close to being like what i saw.  then a friend said something that made perfect sense.  if it was an experimental government or military aircraft, why would they be flying it over a neighborhood full of people?  why would they hover for so long allowing us to see it?  i know, without a doubt, it was not from this earth.  i knew it the moment i got close enough to see it.  i never denied the possibility of aliens visiting earth, but that just took all doubt away.  it was unbelievably amazing!  now i'm reading that other's in this area saw something similar around the same time.  wow!  \r\n \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

well and lost sight for a second but my husband said it should show up when we pass the trees and sure enough there it was traveling very fast with flashing, blinking, very fast lights almost to the point of looking like a sparkler that kids have on the 4th of july {best i can describe it} the orange ball of light that it came from seem to be gone. the blinking light would blink and the whole craft would shift left and then right,forward and then back,sometimes the lights would completely go out, there was absolutely no sound. \r\nfriday night is the first time we seen the orange light.

moved slowly off in an easterly direction - as if they didn't care if anyone saw them or not.  i did not see wings, or a tail or any lights.  the next day i spoke to some neighbors about it and one

asked me to come out and look at something. she pointed at the sky and asked me if her eyes were playing tricks on her or does that star look like it is blinking.  i look at were she was pointing and it looked to me like it was blinking then we noticed that a red light seemed to eminate from it and move from side to side and then a light blue light did the same thing. almost as if it was spinning but it was so far away we couldn't tell it was spinning or not. we could definately see that is was blinking with red and blue lights.  as we kept watching the sky we noticed more of the same type of objects in the sky all with the same caractoristics of the first object. from 10:00pm to 11:07pm we were able to see 7 objects with the exact same caractoristics as the first one.  all 7 objects also seemed to move from side to side and up and down at different time.  also within the same time period we saw what looked like a shooting star which shot toward the nw of where we were looking.  then at about 10:45pm we notice a larger formation (cluster)of dim but white lights off to the right where we were standing and it seemed to have a triangle space and move up and down then side to side but never straying from its original position once it finished moving. this larger object also seemed to have a ridge going down the middle of from the tip of the triangle to the middle of the bottom of it and then a ridge on each side going out to the other 2 points of the triangle.  it was grey in color and very hard to see against the night sky.  it was definately not a plane as we saw 2 planes go

the sound was like a jet engine with a humming sound at the end.  it was unlike any jet engine i have ever heard and i have lived near airports most of my life.  the only rational explaination i can come up with is that they are unidentified flying objects.  i would like to know if anyone else near my area saw these last night.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Hovering then

did not waver or alter it's course and moved very slowly and deliberately. it appeared to be like a large \"pinball\" as it was all chrome and very mirror-like in it's reflective appearance. i watched it until it went out of sight. it lasted maybe 2 minutes total. the very next day i was again at the same store (lunchtime) and upon exiting i saw the exact same scenario developing again. this time a small family was also coming out of the store and i made them aware of the object to get someone else's corroboration and opinion. the couple had one child with them which upon seeing the \"ball\" began to cry and asked his father if \"they\" were going to take them away. again the sphere never wavered or deviated from it's course at all. i did not have a phone with a camera and was probably too much in awe to use one if i did. it is however indelibly etched into my memory. i have tried to see it again at the same time and place but i have not seen it since. i am a pilot and a skilled

my son in july.  i smoke outside on my balcony, sometime in august i noticed these strange orange lights in the sky for the first time.  the lights are usually orange and hover in the sky for random periods of time. they move up, down, left and right.  there is usually 4 lights, one is far away and stays in the same general area, the other 3 are closer and will move in unpredictable directions at random speeds in between moments of hovering.  some times the orange lights will seem to pulsate or flash.  when they leave they seem to move very fast out towards outer space, giving the appearance that they are disintegrating or closing in on themselves, if that makes any sense.  tonight, october 9th, i saw just one of the lights.  at first it looked the normal orange color and then started flashing red and white, i can best describe it as the lights on a police can with out the blue.  after a few minutes it left in the normal way and one more briefly came into sight before disappearing.  i have tried on several occasions to take pictures but am always too late or it won���t show up. tonight i was able to get a very poor quality video of the light.  i know that the lights are not air planes because i can see real airplanes flying in the sky at the same time i see the orange lights.  the lights are much bigger than the light an airplane gives off as well.  i normally do not hear any unusual sounds while they are in the sky but a couple of times i���ve thought i had heard a faint hum, but i could just be freaking myself out.  many of my neighbors have scene the lights and no one can explain them.  i just want to know what they are. the video i took doesn't do the light justace and was only able to get my camera in time to catch a few moments of it before it left.  i will keep trying to get a better picture/video of them, and report when i see them next now that i've found this sight.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

could have maybe been a blimp because of the color, density, and low altitude of this craft. i was stunned and opened my car window with my mouth hanging open in awe while i witnessed this bronze/dark copper colored oval craft with large square windows (with bright colorful lights flashing sequentially from the windows) slowly move from south to north. i was still on my phone with my friend at this moment while i was witnessing this, and described this to my friend. i immediately ended the phone call while i tried to take a picture with my blackberry of what i saw. this craft was so low in the sky that i saw how detailed the windows, lights, color, shape, and material of this ship was. i could not unfortunately take the photo with my phone as i could not find the point in the sky with the small camera lens of my phone and did not want to take my eyes off this craft. i continued to watch in amazement while this craft floated almost right over me and watched it slowly ascend away towards the north. with this, an airplane was flying by from north to south (opposite direction) right past this craft, so close to each other-- i thought they were going to collide. i could not believe my eyes. in broad daylight, this silver plane was maybe 50-100 feet away from this dark bronze oval craft with brilliant flashing lights floating in the opposite direction. i continued to watch this craft ascend higher and higher into the sky, farther and farther away. with no visible clouds in the sky, i was able to maintain a good visual on where this craft was going. i watched until this craft seemed to disappear from thin air. i assumed it may have flew into a cloud or fog, but there was none in the sky. i was amazed and am certain i will never remember what i saw. it was a

round glowing object travelling towards us (but overhead) very quickly. we noticed it because it was bright and moving quickly in our direction. we both stopped and asked eachother what we thought it was, it was like nothing we had seen. much too big to be a star, definitiely not a comet, too fast to be a chinese lantern. feeling a little panicked we just stood and stared and i reached into my bag for my camera. i took some photographs but had to zoom. as it became closer overhead it slowed down and descended before acsending very rapidly and vanishing into the clouds. we were both quite scared by it and shaking a little, even though we did not see it close up we both thought because of the direction and speed it was going it may land on top of us! we're not joking when we say that, it was quite frightening. as soon as it dissappeared we rushed on home (only a few feet away) and felt glad to be inside. we called everyone we knew and told them to check the skies, but they laughed it off. we also kept our eye on the news over the next couple of days but there was nothing. we uploaded the photographs that were taken to our computer and they turned out pretty blurry, mainly because the zoom on the camera was not so good and possibly because of the speed of the object. it was not a windy evening, quite still and the object made no noise, and had no wings or anything like

cliff overlooking the sea of cortez and a beautiful little cove beach.  there were two sightings in september - - one on september 2 and then again on september 18.  these sightings were viewed by people in the housing community next to where i live  i will tell you about those later.  \r\n\r\nlast night my husband and i both saw what we  feel were ufo's.  we were walking along the walkway returning from dinner at a friend's house to our condo.  my husband suddenly said he left his cell phone in the car and returned to the car to get his phone.  at this point, i was walking alone and looked in the sky and saw an amber colored light traveling along the sea of cortez (east to west).  it was very bright and looked like a burning light (orange/red). it traveled up and to the west and then just seemed to disappear.  (i don't know if it disappeared behind a cloud or just vanished.)  \r\nthere aren't many clouds here. i entered my condo and minutes later my husband came in.  i said to him \"did you see the ufo?\"  he said \"no\" and then proceeded to make fun of me saying \"yeah, right - - you saw a ufo. you seem pretty calm for having just seen a ufo.\"  i said \"well, i've been expecting to see one.\"  he then went out on the deck and screamed \"oh my god - - get the camera!!!\"   there was another bright light - - traveling the same way .  it seemed like every minute another one would go by until four went by our deck.  my husband is a pilot and he said the lights looked nothing like anything he has ever seen.(that's five in all - - counting the one i saw while walking to our condo.  they traveled faster than an airplane.  my husband stayed out on the deck and fifteen minutes later - - another one came by - - only this one seemed to go straight out over the sea of cortez (south)and in a different direction from all the others.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas for the other sightings - - there is a man who teaches tai chi on our little beach here.  he is a very honest, spiritual man.  he was up one morning at about 4:00 a.M. or 4:30 a.M on or about september 2 - - when he saw a strange looking, amber colored light in the sky.  it hovered over the housing community where he was staying.  he said he could hear a buzzing sound from it.  he drew a picture in the sand of what he saw.  it was a ufo with amber colored lights around the bottom.  he said that the lights changed color - - multi colored - - and then went over the hill to the beach.  when it went down to the beach he said it morphed in size and color.  originally it was about the size of a volkswagon and then changed to the size of a trailer and the color was bluish white.  he said he saw it leaving just before sunrise and then \"poof\" - - it just disappeared.  he said he felt a lot of love coming from the craft.\r\n\r\nthen on or about september 18 at about 4:30 a.M. - - two night time security guards at the housing community next to us saw a craft hovering over their community.  they described it as a ufo with amber colored lights.  they watched as it went down towards the beach and changed color and they say that it disappeared into the sea.  they tried to take a photograph but the photo only showed something that looked like intereference on a television screen.  they were freigtened by the experience.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

south directly over me. i mean right above me which seemed like 500 feet or so. its kinda hard to tell at night but this ufo was bigger than a nfl football field easily.  it was going at an incredible slow pace and very low. it was so low i could hear a very slight hum coming from it as its usually very quite outside at that time. i know many say they are quite but i could hear something. i could see many blue & white lights blinking at times but at times they were solid. i could also see what seemed to be 6 dark circles underneath (3 on each side) of the v-shape what i believed to be the engines or turbines. again very quite with a very slight hum. as it flew south it stopped and just hovered for a couple of minutes the turned to the left and went east for i say 5 miles then it turned again very abruptly in a very sharp l shaped turn. i knew no plan or helicopter can do that so it was a ufo---for sure!. then it slowly moved north at about 40-50 miles an hour until it it seemed like it was about 15 miles away then all of a sudden dropped down out of site. i will watch the skies every night around that time as i am not the only one who saw this. on a side note: this is the second time i have seen a ufo. the other time was in the late 60's early 70's in mission kansas. are ufo's real? you bet they are! there are billions of stars and planets out there. do you really think we are the only one with life on it? anyone who thinks other wise are blind.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then
