what were those low flying, unblinking, silent and seemingly cloaked or dissapearing crafts in our neighborhood? we deserve to know.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":32480,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.7621195,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10092011-0009","longitude":-105.0440106,"occurred":1317011400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1318185134000,"summary":"2 unidentifiable and silent crafts witnessed over north denver which soon dissapeared completely out of thin air.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"80212","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":13,"locationName":"Denver, Colorado","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:30702"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My husband and i were enjoying a gorgeous evening on our front porch. it was approx. 7:30pm and just approaching dusk.  i had gotten up to go into the house (walking towards the back door up the driveway) when my husband said ���what is that? come look at this��� i turn back around, looked south (our home faces south) and saw a very large and bright orange/red glowing object. it looked to be heading in a strong north/west direction on a steady path.  i have lived on this same block for 40 years and i am in the path of arriving and departing planes from metro airport.  i can tell you that there have been only a couple of times when i���ve seen a plane that low flying in an east or west direction. we continued to stand in awe and must have asked each other five times ���what is that?���  i want to say it looked like something large was on fire(but there were no \"flames\"). its diameter was approx. two to three times the size of our brightest stars. it seemed so very low and i was fully expecting to see what it was. it was not an airplane i know that for sure. the sky was clear and beautiful and there was no wind.\r\n\r\ni ran inside to get my binoculars and when i came back out it was still in sight.  there are a lot of trees so my field of view was becoming limited.  i have a powerful pair of binoculars and it is often hard to find objects right away because of this (plus i was nervous).  i had to keep taking them down to estimate the position because it was still traveling on its steady path.   at one of these times, my husband gasped and said ���it stopped glowing; now it���s black.���   i had only maybe 30 seconds left of viewing and i still couldn���t bring it into view with the binoculars so i just stood there staring at the black object until it left our view.  after the fire faded, the object appeared to be a lot higher than i had originally thought. it was so far up there that i could not discern the size or shape of it. did it ascend that fast?? i can't say for sure. the glow was so big and bright it orginally looked really low. it didn't make sense. after the glow went away, the black object did look flat but it was so far up there that it was hard to tell with the naked eye.\r\n\r\nit was still dusk so it was light enough to know what it was not.  it was not a lantern, hot air balloon, or airplane. while glowing, there was nothing attached to the top or bottom, it looked just like a glowing object.   aircraft lights are not huge, orange, or glowing.  even at this time of day aircraft lights are not even visible yet.   wind does not usually carry things westerly as far as i know.   i am more than curious as to what this was. \r\n \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":32479,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.3224443,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10092011-0008","longitude":-85.5942343,"occurred":1317868200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,   Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1318185123000,"summary":"Orange-red glowing","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":3,"locationName":"Michigan","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:30703"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover), Unknown","city":"Dallas, GA","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We were driving home 7:38 pm september 28, 2011 on ga hwy 278 just crossing ga hwy 120 when i finally took the pictuce with my cell phone. i originally noticed the strange cloud formation after we crossed ga hwy 92 on 278. a few miles later i noticed two glowing objects. one was rectangular with not as sharp geometry more in the cloud and the other was smaller but a its horizontal and vertical lines were perfect. i began to watch the objects because of their shapes in the odd color cloud. they seemed stationary and had no blinking lights. i lost the object after about 10 minutes after crossing ga hwy 61 due to lighting and line of sight.  \r\n\r\nmy wife was driving and 16 year old daughter sitting in the back saw it also but they were not as courious myself.\r\n\r\nafter looking closer at the image on my computer there is also a sphere in the cloud formation.\r\n\r\ndid anyone else notice something strange in the western geogria sky that night.

sept 2011. night of 10/6/11 while on my deck with the dogs, i saw in the east the brightest star i had ever seen. called husband out on deck to look. he said was the same one he had seen earlier. i tried that night in googling bright stars with no luck. night of 10/7/11, between 7;30 and 8pm, dark outside, while out on deck, no sight of the star. husband thought too many clouds. about 8;30pm was out again with dogs on deck and there was the same light in sky, east of my home, seeming to be over odessa, mo. very very bright. was below the cloud cover. called husband to the deck to look. about 30 min later i went out again to look at it. while watching it, i started noticing it made jerky movements. up/down side to side. then hover. called husband out to watch that too. at this point i also could see what appeared to be 3 other clusters of lights only further away. two sets more to the west of my home and one more to the north east, north of i-70. the one north would also make jerk movements. i came in and called the highway patrol. the lady that answered, apparently the dispatcher, listened to what i had to say and then informed me that there had been over 80 reports the past couple weeks. when i told her how it was stationary then with jerky movements she said oh her husband had seen the exact same thing a couple nights earlier and described it the exact same way i had to her. i called a friend in grain valley mo and had her go outside. she also witnessed it with her daughter.No noise ever came from the one closest to me. it hovered then moved as if scanning. it appeared as the night progressed to move higher in the sky than in the first 2 hours of watching it. from it's original points due east of me at first sight, by 2 am was more overhead my home moving towards the west. i had also asked the lady from the highway patrol to send out a car to chapel hill on z highway to get a good view but don't know if that happened. this was not a plane that could sit stationary in the sky like this object did. i did happen to notice a jet, flying from the west to the east about 9:30 or so fly above the main object and the jet was above the clouds. i know this because i could barely make out the lights and contrail through the cloud cover. this object i viewed was not close to clouds. at 2am. i finally quit watching and tried to sleep. while watching it hover then move, gave me excited but nervous feeling. not knowing what i was watching. feeling like it was scanning made me feel invaded. i tried to take pictures with my camera and my phone camera but i don't know if i was successful. i also asked my friend in grain valley to try and get pictures but have not heard if she could. i am not to good with electronics. i could sketch roughly what i saw. this object was so bright it looked either like it had extensions, or very bright beams coming off the perimeter of object like a vivid starburst but seemed to me more like extensions.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then

seen a \"plane\" like that if it was a plane. it was quite large and the shape is what made me feel that it was not a plane. planes move much faster than this was moving, especially if they are directly above.  the lights blinking underneath were huge, the main three being in a triangle.

not sure of the distance at which they travelled in front but they maintained the same distance all along as if they were following my car although i sensed no foreboding or weird vibrations. they then seemed to disappear from view but just faded out /went out of phase in a shimmering kind of way. two cars next to me were also watching it and pointing and looking and actually looked at me because i opened my sunroof and slowed down so i could watch them.\r\n\r\nsomeone should check if anyone else makes a report also where the helicopters were from i saw no markings and i could clearly tell the difference between the ships and the helicopters because the ships hovered/remained fixed in a \"geosynchronous\" position whereas the helicopters were moving across the sky as well as making noise.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":32449,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.9328762,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10082011-0007","longitude":-74.6593281,"occurred":1317970800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Jersey","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1318078662000,"summary":"Formation around lake hopatcong seven ships","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Hopatcong, New Jersey","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:30728"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Blue springs/lees summit","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I and 7 other employees that work with me were in our company van. we were driving back to lenexa kansas from lees summit /blue springs missouri area.\r\nall of a sudden by the royals statium we see lights hovering above the high way i 70 we caught it on video on one of the employees phones.\r\nit looked like it was about 5oo ft from the ground and in the shape of a circle but as we got closer it seemed to be a triangular shape .\r\nthere was no noise comming from the ufo . it had blue and white lights flashing all over . the lights were so bright it almost blinded me driving . it really shook us all up we could not belive what we had seen.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":32448,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.0141139,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10082011-0006","longitude":-94.3304854,"occurred":1317826800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1318073352000,"summary":"6 lights or so in sky hovering above the high way then got a closer look and it was a trangular shape","tags":["lights","hovering"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2,"locationName":"Blue springs/lees summit, Missouri","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:30729"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover), Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover), Unknown","city":"Midland","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was smokeing on the back deck petting the family cat just looking around at other peoples back yards and the sky enjoying the quiet and from behind me.From over the roof a light coming from the north e like on a rail to the south w and vanished.Like neon gold either in disc or cresent shape could not tell!\r\n","distance":"501 Feet -
