(see similar report in case #32436.)  \r\n\r\nthe orb then began to morph and suddenly elongated in a northwesterly direction.  then, it returned to its original approximate shape at it's northwesterly limit.  i would say that it streaked from one spot to another but it didn't leave a trail; it was more of a distinct projection.  \r\n\r\ni told my dubious wife to go outside and see if she could see it.  she later told me that she walked around our house (west of downtown covington) but did not see it.  \r\n\r\ni ended our call at 7:02 pm, made a right turn onto asbury dr, immediately turned into the shopping plaza, and pulled alongside another vehicle stopped beside voodoo bbq.  during this time i had watched the object disappear and then reappear further to the east-northeast and lower on the horizon.  the owner of the car next to me was standing in front of his vehicle also witnessing the event.  i exited my car and asked him, \"what is that thing?\" to which he replied, \"that's a ufo!\"  his two young sons were in the church parking lot ahead of us also watching the orb.  the older son captured some pictures and video on his phone.  we exchanged e-mail addresses but i have not yet received any pictures or video.  \r\n\r\ni heard one of the boys describe the object as turning sideways.  i did not witness any maneuver that i would describe that way but perhaps that is how he perceived the elongation that i witnessed, or he might have been describing something that i did not see.  i don't know how long the object was in the sky before i saw it and i had to take my eyes off it periodically while driving.  i asked one of the boys how long they had been watching the ufo and he said it had been a couple of minutes.\r\n\r\nthe older boy showed me part of the video he recorded on his phone, so i know he has footage of the object but i didn't see the whole thing and don't know how much of the event he captured.","distance":"Over One

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On tuesday, october 4, 2011, at about 8:00 p.M., i was driving in the parking lot of woodson village shopping center at 63rd street and woodson rd. in raytown, missouri, going west toward apple market, when i observed an unidentified flying object rapidly descending at a 90% angle from the western sky behind apple market.  it appeared to move from the 90% angle into a horizontal position as if it were about to land on the roof of apple market.  at this time it appeared to be about 100 feet above the roof of apple market and about 100 feet in diameter.  \r\n\r\nthe object itself was not actually visible to me, only the lights.  there appeared to be a ring of approximately twenty regularly spaced bluish lights with a second smaller ring of what seemed like four flashing or rotating yellow-greenish lights as if they were perched some ten feet higher than the larger ring of lights.  i think there were also three or four other yellow-greenish lights spaced between the two rings of lights, but it may have been the same three or four yellow-greenish lights appearing at different perspectives as the object moved at various angles and changed direction.  i almost discerned some black or dark structural aspects that gave the impression of a large disc weight as is used with barbells with a smaller disc weight centered on top of it.\r\n\r\nas the lights first came into my view moving down out of the sky directly toward me, i thought it must be fireworks, but it did not disintegrate and leave ash trails.  instead it got clearer.  i was really shocked and paralyzed with awe as it came toward me and did not seem as if it would stop.  then i thought it must be some kind of an aircraft about to crash, or perhaps a meteor, and you can imagine the thoughts that raced through my mind.  i was quite calm and thinking logically through all this.  i thought to grab my phone to call and say a final goodbye to family, but did not feel i would have time to make such a call.  that���s how fast it was moving and how close it came. i was not afraid, but nonetheless relieved when it leveled off and hovered over apple market instead of continuing on towards me.  \r\n\r\ni reached for my camera, which i usually keep in my car, and turned it on, but the object suddenly turned due north of apple market and flew over the subdivision immediately north of 63rd street.  it appeared to fly just barely above the treetops and disappeared.  in a second or two it reappeared partially obscured from view by the trees.  \r\n\r\nthe entire sighting lasted about four minutes, long enough for me to get a really good look at it.  i just sat in the car in the parking lot for a few moments trying to figure out what had just happened.  the lights were so beautiful, like a colorful constellation, a carnival ride, fireworks, or christmas tree lights.  once they did not crash into me, i really hoped i could see them again.  as i mentioned before, i did not feel frightened, only exhilarated. \r\n\r\nthe object had not made any noise as far as i could tell.  i have seen airplanes and stealth bombers and helicopters and it did not seem to be any of those, unless one were painted black or very dark and had a ring of lights attached to the bottom of it.  i thought for a moment it might have been a police helicopter searching for a suspect in the dark, but it was way too big and did not have search lights, only the lights described earlier.  plus, those tend to be very noisy, and this object was not.  i considered the possibility that it might have been some kind of projected holographic image or special effects for a sci-fi movie being filmed.  if it had been a pre-halloween prank, it was a good one!\r\n\r\ni looked around to see if anyone else had seen the event.  there were only a few cars in the parking lot.  i only saw two people and they were outside of apple market, one was just coming out of the store apparently oblivious to what had just occurred.  the people inside the store i saw through the window seemed equally oblivious.  there was a man walking from his car toward the entrance of apple market with his head bent downward and he had been parked so close to the building that he likely would not have seen the event.  the blinds at the window of fantastic sam���s were drawn and i did not see anything unusual through the glass door.  the other stores were all closed.  only the bar was open, and i was not about to go in there and announce what i had just 8seen. \r\n\r\ni sat in the parking lot until 8:08 p.M., and then i began to drive in north on woodson in an attempt to get a glimpse of the object again.  i drove throughout the subdivision north of apple market but did not view the object again.  \r\n\r\ni called only a few close family and friends.  i was really concerned that if i told anyone else they might think i had become mentally unstable or was hallucinating due to some physical illness or fatigue.  \r\n\r\ni am convinced that what i saw was very real and not some hallucination or figment of my imagination.  i had considered that it might be some kind of spiritual phenomena, and as appealing as that thought may be, i don���t think it was. i am highly doubtful that the object was made by aliens from outer space, but i would not rule out that possibility.  my best guess is that what i saw was some secret military project of the u.S. or some other country, say, china.\r\n\r\ni heard on the radio today that numerous independent reports of sightings of unidentified flying objects in the kansas city, lee���s summit, and raytown areas had been made.  that feels like a validation, although i don���t need one to satisfy myself.  \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

calm as could be. not a cloud in the sky and you could see for miles. i was only a mile away if that from her house when i noticed two closely places yellow balls of light in the sky. i stopped and i turned my radio off. sorry if i miss spell stuff cause it makes me kinda tear up still. so i watched it as it slowly turned directions. it was going i think east and changed going ne. as i watched it for about a minute it had gotten closer to me. all of a sudden the inside of my car took on a blue glow. yet it didnt come from what i had been watching. with in 5 to 10 sec. i heard(this freaked me the hell out)foot steps running towards my car. not like one person but like the sound of 5 to 10 people running on this gravel road. i through my car in drive and took off. i didnt look back cause i didnt want to know what it was. i will say i hate to be on that road at night. i have seen roughly what i can honestly ufo's over 25 times. i would get them on film but i dont make the money right now to by a video recorded. but i would be willing to take someone out there. now i have seen things right down my road. i live right outside of cabot. yet oddly it mainly takes place at my buddies house. i have seen it but him and family dont want nothing to do with research. but back to my spot. now several years ago i was taking an ex and her mother home. oddly the live on the same road. they told me about seeing craft sitting in fields off that road. well one night as we top a little hill i saw the biggest craft i'd ever seen. to tell the truth it looked to be 2 to 3 hundred yards big. it was a line of 6 yellow lights in the sky thy looked to be 15 ft in diameter. it was stationary but as i got near it was no more that 100 to 150 ft off the ground. as i got close i started flashing my lights at. after a few times the lights lit up and it shifted to what i say would be a 20 degree angle and started coming towards us. as we neared the clearing it was a tree top level when it made a 90 degree turn to the right and shot off. i have other stories. feel free to contact me at anytime. i have had prolly 50 or more experience dealing with ghost and ufo.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

inter-coastal waterway. roughly the same distance to the northeast, lies the southern tip of st. augustine airport's runway, so i'm well familiar with all the aircraft in the area, and i also carry an interest in aviation in general. i'm used to seeing the private jets taking off to the east-southeast, the tourist helicopters flying in overhead to land an refuel, the high flying passenger liners heading north/south (or vice versa) on their way to and from jacksonville, and i've even witnessed more than a handful of satellites circling the earth, just before daylight in the morning and after dusk at night. but then this morning, approximately 5:00 am, i finally saw something i can't explain away as normal. \r\n\r\ni initially spotted the object and wrote it off for a moment as a bright morning star. it sat stationary, due east, at about 20 degrees above the horizon. i know that just to the east-southeast lies the vilano bridge, so i'm not sure if it was over land or water, but i would estimate that the craft was again due east, at roughly a mile to a mile and a half's distance, possibly two.\r\n\r\nthe reason that i recognized the vessel was indeed much closer than a low hanging star, is because my eye was again drawn to it by a brief pulse or flash of light, (almost like a tomahawk cruise missile had been fired - only silently) as it began immediately ascending near vertically, leaving a trail nearly identical to that of a falling star, only on the incline, rather than the decline. it's ascent, again near vertically, was toward the west-northwest, and it flew just behind the fingertip of a cloud (as a rain front was preparing to move through) then i finally lost sight of it behind a tree, a big cloud, and the corner of the roof of my porch. while it's entire ascent was quick (taking 2-3 seconds) its rate if climb wasn't instantaneous, and the object seemed to accelerate throughout its journey.\r\n\r\nso the blueish-purple tail was the most prominent feature, but just above this remained the whitish light that i had originally mistaken as a star, and atop this, (mind you the craft seemed a bit blurred together by the bright white light) looked to be what i could best describe as half a bubble. the outside edges of the bubble were white like the light, but the middle was the same dull midnight blue as the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

wish i had gone to get the camera i keep in my desk.  after break... that is just what i did.  i went outside thinking i might see something and take a pic of it.  i was about tired and i was just about to come in the warehouse, when towards the memphis airport i saw 2 black dots.  i automatically thought maybe they are having a show this weekend.  hardly... what i saw next... i can't explain.  they 2 dots were flying zig zagging in and out with each other... going around each other.  i told myself they arn't planes because they are too close and planes don't do that.  i don't blame you for what i am about to say... but these to things became as 1 and shot off.  i was able to take pics of them after becoming one.  after, downloading the photos, i had noticed that i caught 2 ufo's.  at

our home near raytown.  as we headed west on 40 highway we saw off in the distance a rather large object with many lights.  it was moving very slowly and we wondered what it was but didn't think much about it at the time since we only saw it for a short time.  then, the next evening, we were going out for an evening walk since the weather was so beautiful on october 4th around 8:00 p.M and saw the same object again.  as we exited the house (we live up high on a bluff between raytown and lee's summit, mo) we noticed unusually bright lights in the sky and i said that i wondered what that was since it was moving extremely slow and looked very large.  then all of a sudden, it appeared to separate so then i thought it was three separate planes but just as fast as it separated it went back together as one and headed northeast.  i wonder now if it looked like it separate but in fact had just turned vertically.  we continued to wonder what it was but went on with our walk as it continued across the horizon.  when we got about 3 blocks from the house, we again observed the large brightly lit object in the sky and as we walked it moved very slowly and seemed to hover at times.  the lights would change sometimes being horizontal and other times being vertical, sometimes solid and other times blinking.  when we got to a cul-de-sac which sits on a bluff, we stood in someone's driveway and watched the object in amazement.  it was off on the horizon and appeared to be over the raytown area.  at one point it appeard to make a 180 degree turn and go the other way.  the lights appeared to triangular in shape when it would turn a certain way.  when it was the nearest to us we commented that it was making no sound.  my friend commented that maybe it was some kind of blimp since there was no sound.  as we were standing there, the person whose driveway we were standing in came home and we pointed the object out to them.  the guy jokingly said it was a ufo and we laughed and agreed.  as we started to walk we heard some noise and then saw a helicopter but the object had disappeared.  we ran into some other neighors who said they had seen it while they were walking in the parking lot of the teetering rocks golf course.  we all agreed it was like nothing we had ever seen but had no idea what we had seen.  after reading all these other sightings, i decided i would report what we saw.  it was never as close to us as others have reported but our description would be very similar to the others that have been reported.

home. she was walking with us to my car. she looked up and said \"what's that?\" and pointed out three glowing red-orange objects in a roughly triangular formation to the south of us at about 60 degrees above the horizon. the three of us watched the objects for 2-3 minutes as they maneuvered around each other, occasionally crossing one another. they appeared to be moving, as a group, slowly closer to us and from east to west. there was no sound. when first observed, they appeared to me to be perhaps 10-15 miles away. my girlfriend estimated 20 miles away. as the objects progressed roughly westward, they began to move behind the treeline, blocking our view. i then ran to the other side of the building to get a better view. when i got there, i saw that the objects had dimmed and faded from a red-orange to a yellow-orange. shortly thereafter, another object ascended from on or near the ground in the southeast and stopped in about the same part of the sky as the original three. it then moved around in a seemingly random pattern. the original three objects had, by then, dimmed and ultimately disappeared. about a minute later, a fifth object ascended and behaved in much the same way as the fourth. the ascents were roughtly straight and, in my estimation, too slow to be flares or fireworks and too fast to be conventional aircraft. the fourth and fifth maneuvered around each other for a minute or two and then faded just like the first three. the event, from beginning to end was about 10 minutes in duration. my girlfriend, an air force master sergeant with 14 years in the service, said she'd never seen anything like this, even on deployment in combat areas in iraq and afghanistan.","distance":"Over One
