what a 'flying saucer' was because i watched 'lost in space' on tv so i was fascinated and excited when i saw it. i remember being kind of shocked when it just 'disappeared', feeling a little embarrassed that my dad gave me a weird look for pointing at an empty sky. he was far enough away from me that i couldn't immediately explain what i'd seen and he walked back into the barn after not seeing what i had seen. i felt disappointed that i didn't see it again. i'd hoped it would come out from behind a cloud, but i couldn't see how it would've gotten that far away in such a short time.\r\n\r\ni have no idea how close it was, how big it was or how high off the ground, but i could see it clearly. there was no doubt in my mind that it was a flying 'saucer'.\r\n\r\ni went back to

behind me. my 4 year old son was in the car with me. i looked to my left (south) approximately as we were approaching 291 hwy. and independence mall. i noticed a horizontal line of very bright lights off in the distance. it appeared that some sort of aircraft was hovering in the distance, but it caught my attention because the lights were brighter and in higher quantity than a typical a airplane. i continued to drive, but kept looking out the window to keep an eye on the aircraft. as i approached chiefs & royals stadiums, i had somewhat lost track of it, when suddenly my 4-year old son spotted the aircraft and got my attention. at that point it was close enough that i could see the underside of the craft and i could tell the it was triangular in shape and had 15-20 lights on the bottom side. i then merged onto 435 south headed towards raytown (right next to the stadiums), when all of a sudden the aircraft slowly flew directly over chiefs stadium and directly over my head. it was only a few hundred feet above my head at most. the chiefs stadium lights happened to be on although there was no event at the stadium that night from what i could tell. when the aircraft flew over my head i got a very good look at the enormous size of this aircraft and the bright multi-colored lights were unlike anything i had ever seen on an aircraft. the stadium lights also allowed me to see 3-4 streams of smoke coming from the back of the aircraft. however, the aircraft was completely silent when it flew over head. at this point, i was getting a bit nervous and/or excited because i had no idea what i was looking at. i have never been a believer in aliens or ufo's. i thought maybe it was a planned stadium fly over, but there was no event at chiefs stadium, so that didn't make sense. my only other guess is that it was some sort of top-secret military aircraft considering that we have a couple of nearby air bases. i then exited onto 350 highway and entered raytown, mo when my son again spotted the aircraft, which had done a 180 degree turn and circled back around. it was now flying east and then turned north and flew away from us back towards the stadiums. i was finally able to get my wife's attention and pointed it out to her as it was flying away. i went home for a brief moment, but then decided to chase it. i drove up to chiefs stadium, but there was no sight of the aircraft. within 30 seconds of arriving, they shut the lights off at chiefs stadium. i have tried to pass this off as some military experiment, but i have bee on edge ever since the sighting. it's good to know others saw the same thing, but i just want to know what it was.","distance":"101-500

something was covering them from view. i focused on the area and noticed a traingular craft with a red light in the center of it, flying at a very low altitude (maybe 400ft above me) spinning slowly. it moved in a somewhat straight line, cruising by silently. i told my friend dave to look at this thing because i wanted to know that i wasn't halucinating or imagiming this thing. thinking back i

grocery store with food for dinner that night.  i was fifteen years old, not driving at that point, and the store was not too far from the home i lived in.  this sighting occurred in the gardenville area of baltimore md, as i was walking along belair rd., which runs north and south from baltimore up to pa.  i was walking north from arizona ave. to hamilton ave., which then leads to kavon ave. which was the street i lived on.  kavon ave. ran parallel with belair rd., arizona ave. and hamilton ave. run perpendicular to belair rd.  at the corner of belair rd. and arizona ave., you can see well to the horizon as it is at the top of a hill, which then goes down into a valley at hamilton ave, then back up the hill to white ave.  the object i first saw, was coming through the atmosphere from southeast to northwest running diagonally across belair rd.  the object was a huge football shaped oval, with different colors in each quadrant, and a long fiery tail, with a burning corona around the entire object.  it reminded me of a toy called simon says, which has different colors in each quadrant.  i was stunned at what i saw, as i had never seen anything like that, and at that moment in time thought it was just a huge meteor coming through our atmosphere, although that thought changed as the next part of the story evolved.  after digesting what i had just seen, i was anxious to get home and tell my parents.  i then came down hamilton ave. to the base of my street (kavon ave.), and stopped to talk with two of my friends standing in front of their houses at the corner of hamilton ave. and kavon ave.  we were engaged in conversation about things in general, and me telling them what i had just experienced, when at treetop level a group, (8-9) discs flew over our heads.  they were yellowish/white in appearance, much like if you dimmed down a light bulb, or the headlight of trains of that time.  my two friends did not get a good look at them as their backs were to the discs.  by the time i directed them to look, the discs were gone, and my friends chalked it up to racing pigeons.  one of our neighbors had racing pigeons, but what i saw was not pigeons, and he never flew his birds at twilight, or at night, so i knew it was not his pigeons.  i then went to my house and told my parent what i had experienced. at that point i then noticed a neighbor from across the street watching the sky.  i joined him, and what we saw at that point was amazing.  groups of lights, (five to fifteen in number) in formation, not in v formation, or box formation, but in a group as if you were to throw a handful of pebbles and the formation they would stay in until gravity brought them down.  when they were higher they were moving quite quickly, and when lower, they moved slower as if looking for something.  these groups came in approximately twenty minute intervals, moving in the same direction as the very first object i had seen initially. this sighting occurred from just at twilight until after midnight.  the entire neighborhood had come out to watch at various times through this period.  we called the newspapers, and the police, only to be laughed at, so no one came out nor ever followed up to my knowledge.  then one loan light came from the north, stopped dead, made a right angle turn and with a great deal of speed left in the same direction as all the rest.  the way i would describe the entire experience would be as if one of our aircraft carriers was lost while all aircraft were deployed, and then they returned only to find the ship missing, then going on a search to find it.  i have never reported this until now.  it's just been a story i have carried with me my entire life.  i have a strong interest in the possibility of ufo's, and have never seen any reportage of this sighting from any source.  i thought it was time for this to be put on the record.  it has also been bugging me wondering if this is connected to the incident in kecksburg pa, which occurred around the same time, and in the same direction from baltimore.  i've never been able to connect the dots of the two sightings, but have always wondered if they were connected.","distance":"21-100 Feet, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

initial position; about 30 seconds later, it slowly began to descend. as soon as my husband came to the window to look, it disappeared below the horizon-- the exact second he would have been able to see it! a few minutes later, it reappeared, shot straight toward me, and when it got relatively close (though, i could not discern its shape, approximate speed, or elevation), it flashed. i really feel like the flash was the object acknowledging me, or even saying hi. as mu husband was standing up to look,  it shot away. he did see it though before it disappeared again below the horizon. \r\ni

as the object shot down and to the side and landed on the salt marshes that are next to our house maybe less than a mile away but with no obstructions in the way i had a clear view of the craft below us, by now a helicopter (large noise) came up the estuary towards the landed object, i say helicopter but could only see a red  and white light and hear the noise of a helicopter, this shone a light or beam at the ground all the way towards the landed object and went straight towards it, but when it did reach it the light went off and the helicopter or what ever it was went back in the same direction it had come from, this happened quite a few times.  \r\n\r\nall the time this was happening the landed object kept sending huge pulsating lights towards my house, a different colour every 5 seconds (blindly bright), another object was in the sky directly opposite the landed object and kept getting brighter then dimmer and seemed to approach the helicopter each time it went towards the landed object as if to warn it off. after the 1st 20mins of watching and finally decided it was not a plane crash, i went and got my camera and binoculars (very powerful)  i took around 35 pictures

thing and reported it. i just want to know what it was. \r\ni was sitting on my balcony, talking on the phone, i looked up as this enormous, slow moving, very bright object began to move over the tree line. i said i had to go, wanted to get a picture of this & my phone was dying, so i needed to get my charger plugged in. then i stood frozen and stared. \r\nit was not a stealth. it was moving se, and another smaller craft (small plane, helicopter?) was moving nw. at first i thought they were going to collide, then (it seemed almost awkward) maneuvered and i remember thinking ���the little one seems panicked.��� it was not the normal amount of space between two aircraft. the little one disappeared, then count-i, 2, it flew over the top of the big one. this is when i remembered my desire for pictures and my dying phone. by the time i was back outside it had moved to the e side of downtown l.S. then my phone rang, i answered it, plugged it in, and it was gone when i got back outside. that fast!\r\nthe craft- it was at least the size of a football field. i really could not tell what the overall shape was.  it had two rows of lights that spanned the width and then under those lights were two more rows, centered, but shorter in width. there was a consistent pattern in the lights, that changed in number, becoming less at the center, but symmetrical, for example- left to right- 9, 8, 8,, 5,, 3, 4, 3,, 5,, 8, 8, 9. each number represents the uninterrupted chain of ���bulbs��� each comma represents a space.  the top two rows were identical. sizeable space, then rows three and four were solid, no interruptions. i would say they were the width of 5-5. the lights seemed brighter, whiter than the little craft���s light, but i don���t remember them changing colors or pulsing.\r\ni didn���t see the craft flip on it���s side or disappear. what i noticed the most, frightened me most. there was no noise. not from either one. i could hear my cats playing inside, my microwave beep (my tea was done) and my neighbors talking.\r\nmy daughter was on hwy 291 with a friend. they both saw it. they had to lean over in the car to see the whole thing, it was right over them. the same daughter has chosen a caree in avaition, so we constantly watch the aircraft in the skies. this was different.\r\noctober 5th, 1:30 pm. i called ls airport, to inquire. the man who answered said he had heard nothing about this occurance, that it must be some local pilots practicing their formation routine for an upcoming event (off the record, of course.) he said that i must be mistaken, that people mistake common things (weather balloons, stray kites, etc.) all the time. i responded with ���doesn���t our local airport have a responsibility to know who is where in our skies?��� he informed me that clearly i was mistaken, thanked me for calling and hung up.\r\ni know what i saw. i made my next call to kci. i was transferred four times to ���someone who could better answer those questions.��� number five was an air traffic control person. he listened me but said he had heard nothing of this either. i asked him to google ufo/lees summit10/04/2011. i asked how so many could see this and kci not know? i said ���if it was confidential, then say it���s confidential, and i would shut up and hang up. if it���s a really big airplane, then tell me the model, but don���t say you didn���t even know it was there!��� he reviewed radar starting at 6:00 pm. after about a minute he says��� well i see here there was something flying in our airspace, but we weren���t talking to them��� i said ���huh?��� he got quiet, then said ���oh it must be a 747 that landed at about 7:28 pm. he had nothing else to say. i thanked him and hung up.\r\ni am not an mit hopeful. i will never be a brain surgeon. i am also not stupid. \r\nif it was confidential then why was it flying so slowly and so close to the ground? we all know what the stealth looks like���a weather balloon? a little more tact when insulting someone���s intelligence is in order. \r\nyep-it���s unexplained. yep-it looks fishy. what are they doing at our airports? answers would be awesome! i have low expectations.

address where i saw my ufo and was paced by it was pekin road, which is just one block north of the church.  my report has been filed on mufon before.  there have been four other sightings along that road since 1983 that i have verified.  probably many others.  thought this would be significant since the other observation was so close to the one i had in 83', to wit, i was exiting a driveway onto pekin road, heading east, when a row of six red, white and green lights rose above the tree line to the east about 200 feet from me any hovered.  no sound as the light sequentially traveled left to right, as along a blimp ad.  used my index finger for size comparison, row of lights was the length of it.  when i turned toward them, they moved towards the road ahead and passed over me.  then there is a blank spot where i'm trying to figure out why the blimp was out here at 2am, when, after driving another mile down the road, it comes back from my left and hovers over the next intersection.  this is where i become very frightened, turn right and speed down sperry road, saying over and over, \"not tonight\".  as i drove, the lights paced my car about 150 feet to my right at about 40 feet off the ground over a field.  i drove as fast as possible and lost them after a mile or so.  when i traveled another two miles to the main road, mayfield, i got out and looked back, where i could still see it hovering and blinking at tree top level, about a mile or so back.  i don't' know if i was abducted, as that blank spot where i saw it over the car to where i was questioning what i had seen has never been resolved.
