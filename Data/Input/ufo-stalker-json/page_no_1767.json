States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving home sunday night down i-85 and stopped at a gas station to use the restroom and get a drink.  after my purchase, i walked out of the store and just happened to look up in the sky. i'm not entirely sure what compelled me to look up at that moment, however i must admit i tend to look up and enjoy the stars frequently.  as i looked up i noticed a rather large ball of orange light. at first glance it looked similar to a night time rocket launch, but upon looking further i realized the object was far too large to be a rocket, and looked nearly perfectly spherical.  as i looked at this object, i noted it had no beacon lights whatsoever and no visible fuselage. it was as bright, if not brighter than the moon and i felt like with the luminosity it carried it should have reflected any material that would make up an aircraft or bodywork.  the orb itself was an amber color, lighter in color and brighter at the center and more orange around the edges; although i should point out there were no visible 'edges' to be seen, it was diffuse around the circumference. this object was going very slowly across the sky at what my best estimate is east to west in what i could tell was a straight path.  it's difficult to gauge, but i would say this object had an altitude of approximately 1000ft, and was certainly within our atmosphere.  when i had first noticed it, the orb was slightly to my left maybe 30 degrees, and i had anticipated some sort of sound as it drew closer, however throughout the whole observation there was absolutely no noise emitted at all.  the object continued on it's path (still slowly) until it got about 40-45 degrees to my right, where it seemed to arc to it's left (away from me) and a few seconds after that it dissipated and disappeared.  i had anticipated watching it until it went over the horizon or behind trees, however the dissipation made a strange event even stranger. it contracted a bit from the outside edges inward, and then dissolved until it was just the black sky left.  the duration of the dissipation was about 2-3 seconds, and the entire duration of the observation was nearly 5 minutes long.  at one point a guy leaving the gas station had seen me staring up into the sky mesmerized, and looked up too.  after a second he turned to me and asked \"what is that? ...Some sort of airplane or something?\" to which i replied \"it certainly doesn't look like any aircraft i have ever seen.\"  he grew visibly uncomfortable, got into his car and quickly left.  a few additional notes to consider which may be helpful are the visual effects i experienced while observing this object.  while it was as bright as the moon, fairly bright for the night sky, it wasn't blinding.  however when i closed my eyes i could still see the glow, as if i had been looking into something very bright.  also while looking directly at it, it seemed to be a solid ball of light, however when viewed through my peripheral sight it was pulsing similar to an old tube computer monitor.  i would estimate around 60hz or so.  at one point i attempted to phone my girlfriend to explain to her what i was witnessing, but my cell had no reception or bars, which could be incidental but i generally get good reception in charlotte and i did find it odd my phone wouldn't even dial out.  \r\n\r\ni don't claim to be an expert, but i do have quite a bit of knowledge in regards to aircraft and helicopters both military and civilian, and this object did not fit the paradigm of anything i am aware of.  in fact, the whole reason i have submitted this report is because of how strange of an incident this entire situation was.  i never felt upset, frightened or perturbed in any way, however i must say i am very, very intrigued as to what this could have been.  i hope this helps and would love to know if anyone else witnessed this event.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

tampa airport. as i followed the jet to the horizon , i caught a flash of light from the corner of my eye. and i noted it was in the orion constellation just below the his shield arm (upper right star from belt stars). my first thought was that it was an incoming jet to tampa. then it blinked again and i was sure then,that it was a jet with its bright running lights on incoming to me.I then walked my dog back up into our cul-de-sac towards our back yard. i then stopped so she could pee. i saw the light blink again .And i thought it was odd because it had not moved at all from its relative spot from within the orion costellation. it also appeared to be somewhat dimmer x2.But still very visable. so i stopped and started to observe the light.I then noticed the light blink and it was again brighter than the last time it blinked. i then looked at it, as a banking aircraft. my military training started to kick in (7212 stinger missle gunner 71/2 yr usmc)as i thought maybe this was a light plane or helicopter in some sort of distress or running drugs into the bay area (yeah this is a slow mover). then i started to count in between blinks. i would get a 5 or 7 count (football count) and then the light would blink again at the same position within orion. i then took up a spot next to a tree in my yard so i could get a movement read from the trees outline, relative to orion. the light didnt really move. and this observation lasted about 5 minutes (and that was odd to me). then the light juked from left to right almost to orions belt (i was stunned).At this time i was checking myself !! the light then juked back right to left to almost the same spot under the shield star (what the hell). the light stayed in the same spot for about 2 more minutes. it then juked again right to left, but not as far . but when it blinked out this time i could make out an aura impression upon the black sky. it was like someone had had printed a grey line on a black chalk board.And it was then i noticed a residue imprint upon my left field of veiw. i then raised my right hand to get a finger distance (2).It then struck  me that i may be watching an incoming missle change its course in low to mid atomosphere. i got a hold of myself and waited for the light to blink 3 more times . i picked up my dog and went back inside at 0208 and woke up my daughter and her fiancee. i told them to come outside and look at something . i didnt tell them anything else except to look at the orion constellation, that was the only instruction/warning i gave them. for the next 4 minutes we observed the light change distance , direction and light  magnatude at least 5 times ,going between orions belt to more or less into the center of the constellation. and we asked each other during our observation are we all seeing the same thing. yes !! the final blink was in the middle of orion. we spent another 5 minutes waiting to spot a airplane or anything that would explain what we had just seen. we then moved from the cul-de-sac area to our side yard. trying to get a different observation angle on the same area of the sky. still we could not detect anything flying except about 7 to 9 herons flew over low in formation heading towards our local park.Another 5 minutes of observation and we went inside. i have lived in this same house since 2005 and i have a fair understanding of the flight pathes that local and tia traffic travels. the only odd ball lights ive seen so far is the occasional police or ems copter fly over , and maybe less than a handful of light aircraft have i observed at these hours flying about. -but- this light and flight pattern did not fit any that i have ever observed either in the military or as a civilian. please contact me via email if you have any questions. thank you

ruled that out because of how close they would have to be flying to one another, and the fact that i could not hear any noise whatsoever. furthermore, at this point it was close enough that it seemed to be one solid object (although i freely admit my mind could have been playing tricks on me). the object was coming in from the north, flying south...Again, extremely slow, and blatantly obvious, i don't see how it could have been missed by anyone that happened to be outside or driving at that time. the object then turned west and appeared (to me anyways) to break up into three separate pieces for a few moments, then join back together.\r\n\r\ni am typically a very skeptical person by nature. from a rational standpoint my assumption is not that this was any kind of extraterrestrial craft coming to visit the kansas city area, but rather one of two things:\r\n\r\n1. either this was a group of (somehow silent) helicopters, with absolutely the most insane pilots on the face of the earth for deciding to fly and maneuver as close as possible to one another. or...\r\n\r\n2. this was some kind of experimental aircraft, convincing me that the u.S. military has developed what i would consider the coolest and most awe inspiring aircraft in their fleet yet (blows the stealth out of the water).\r\n\r\nregardless, whatever it was, i could not identify, and felt intrigued enough to think about it all night long, and find a place on the web where i could report it this afternoon(and read other individuals descriptions as well).","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":32373,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.9740329,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10052011-0019","longitude":-91.8239434,"occurred":1317783000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang,   Triangle,   Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1317852364000,"summary":"Very intriguing unidentified flying object (perhaps objects)","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Missouri","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:31310"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed","city":"Kendall","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"A  lot  of  light  with  different  shapes  but  the  most  common  was  rob  cilindrical    the    sound  was  like  microwave  oven  and  the  rob  absorved  electrostatic  charges  in  the  air, no  more  than  30-40 centimeters, like  1-2  feet\r\naround  the  12  at midnight  on  october  3  2011, after  the  cloud  was  open  the  staragate  a  lot  light  started  to  exist  through  my  neiborhood  and  the  went  to  the  everglades  of  south florida \r\ni  don���t  see  any  helicopter  o  airplain  in  the  area  but  in  the  north  you  can  see  the  comercial airplain way  thru  the  miami airport     \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nsorry  by  my  english, i  am  speak  spanish\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   ","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":32372,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":25.6520884,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10052011-0018","longitude":-80.3320947,"occurred":1317625200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cone,   Cylinder,   Flash,   Oval,   Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1317851155000,"summary":"Rob cilindrical  light  shapes  ","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/32372_submitter_file1__Imagen326.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/32372_submitter_file2__Imagen311.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/32372_submitter_file3__Imagen315.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"33175","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2,"locationName":"Kendall, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:31311"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Lee's Summit","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I also observed the \"carnival ride\" sighting in lees summit.  the actual cause was a group of small planes flying in tight formation.  each plane had about 6 lights and made quite a sight.  i live right next to the lees summit regional airport and the planes were landing and taking off from there.

tops just off towards the river. my car radio went fuzzy but i hardly noticed as i pulled over to see what was flying above the trees. i thought it was a stealth bomber at first but then remembered that they do not hover or make strange whistling sounds.\r\n  the object was a boomerang shape around 150-200 ft. from wing tip to tip and around 75 ft. from nose to rear.It flew a short slow path of about a quarter mile over the river and slowly turned south and slowly cruised away, just making that odd whistling sound. i did not feel any effects or anything from the expeience just confusion from what not really knowing what i just saw,but i will say this, it did fly off to the south and dobbins air force base is located about 100 miles south of our town.

like that. this was the craziest thing i have ever seen, i was soo close to it, i can't believe it. i was driving down interstate i-70 westbound came up to the 291hwy intersection that was backed up due to an accident on 291hwy south. i look up and saw this huge giant object beaming with white bright white lights all over it hovering in midair right above the i-70 and 291hwy intersection. it was hovering about 500ft. above the highway, i pulled the car over and watched it just hovering. i rolled the windows down to hear it but no noise whatsoever came from it. total silence just the cars passing by. i was freaking out and yelling i could not believe my eyes what i was seeing. my family was with me and we were all freaking out. within about 2-3min of hovering it turned south and started at a straight path going south, i tried to take pics but my camera on my phone couldn't pick it up enough. i saw the rear of the craft and it was huge. the back had 3 separate box shaped glowing lights that looked as though they were spreading apart. it headed along 291hwy south but was more flying over the cliffs homes area direction. 291hwy south was closed off by police due to the wreck so i couldn't follow it but i did head down 40hwy west off of 291hwy and then went south on lees summit rd but did not see it due to soo much traffic backup and trees. \r\n\r\nthe shape was like a small pyramid, dome ontop but covered in bright white lights, lots of them, then as it turned i saw the bottom of it and the side. the bottom view was a v shape with a few lights also had blinking blue lights near the bottom of the craft. but the bottom view was total v shape no doubt about it. then as i saw it from the rear, i could only see 3 bright white square shapes in a row but not straight in a row, all 3 rear square lights were in different angles.\r\n\r\nthis has changed my life going forward. i have never seen anything like this nor have been as close to one. i mean this thing was hovering right outside the car window above me at a 45degree angle in front of me. \r\n\r\njust pure crazy.... amazing! i never thought i would see one again in my life.\r\n\r\nthe pic i have attached was taken with my cell phone but for some reason i dont know why does not look like what i saw. but i figured i might was well attach it. better than nothing.","distance":"101-500

half moon in the south, 30 degrees off horizon. i happened to look up, and spotted a fireball with a prominent tail come streaking in from space at 60 degrees above the horizon, traveling from east south east to west north west. the fireball was quite large and pronounced, with a large tail indicating falling debris melting off from re-entry, and was a bright white color like phosphorous.\r\nthe size was about dime sized as held at arms length, or 50% of the size of the half moon.\r\ni must emphasize that i am familiar with judging mass and size of objects dropping to the ground from space. this object had to be massive, and it remained illuminted all the way to the ground as well, while most meteors or meteorites extinguish after passing half way through our atmosphere. it is extremely rare for an object to survive reentry unless it has a lot of mass to burn off of it.\r\n\r\nthis object may have been the german roentgen satellite (rosat) falling to earth after reentry. it was estimated it would fall back to earth in late october or early november of 2011, but, that was just an estimate, and its reentry orbital path was supposed to take it to 53 degrees north and south latitude when its orbit decayed and it fell into the gravity well, well within the bounds of southern michigan.\r\n\r\nthe duration of the siting was only two to two and one half seconds, but boy, what a view! this event reminded me of space shuttle debris reentry as shown on video.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

noticed the sky was compleatly cloud free from the horizon for as far as i could see in 3 directions.  we were traveling e. on i40 just n. of jackson, mississippi & i kept looking at the moon on the n. side of our rig & watching how it went from one side of the picture window to the other.  thinking how the road really wasn't straight & trying to find it again when it was hidden by trees occasionally.  all of a sudden i thought i saw 2 white balloons come down from behind the moon, one following the other.  they went halfway back up, then to the left & i thought the wind was blowing the balloons around.  since the change in direction was kinda jerky & abrupt, i sat up to take a better look.  that's when i noticed they weren't balloons but ufo's that seemed to be playing a game of \"catch me if you can.\"  they would go in a direction one following the other till the back one caught up, then they would turn around & the front one would kinda chase the other.  they did this going both clockwise & counterclockwise over & under the moon.  i thought these things were not as far away as the moon but then they proceeded to go around the moon in the same direction the equater goes around the earth.  they would disappear behind the moon & then come back in front from the other side.  after awhile they just went in every direction darting around & going behind clouds & coming out again.  this was very odd to me because there were no clouds visible in the sky, on taking a better look the \"clouds\" they were going behind were more brown than cloud color.  they went away completely & then came back, came towards the rv (still far up) & had something hanging from the bottom of both.  reminded me of the shape of hot air balloons now & while trying to get a better look they went back to their origonal shape, darted around a couple times & disappeared.  i'm very curious as to if anyone else saw them, i kept telling my husband to look but he was driving & couldn't even see the moon!  he takess his driving very seriously, pulls off the road for cell phone calls so i know he wouldn't try hard to see a

in the sky in front of me towards town, and there was a bright red pulsating light.  i called my children outside because two nights prior we saw something similar in the sky while driving and it flew at low altitude over the highway.  it was so strange that we turned around to look again to find out what it was but it had quickly disappeared over the tree line.  my son came out first he is 15, and i asked him if that was what we saw the other night.  he said yes, then my daughter came out and began to make fun of us because she did not believe in  ufo's she is 16.  the object hovered there for about three or four minutes, then moved toward our home.  as the object moved closer over the house we began to see that there were lights at each corner of the aircraft and a red pulsating light in the middle.  we continued to watch as it slowly flew silently over the house toward the mountains.  we watched it until it was over the mountains and it hovered there for about five minutes as we were watching this aircraft we noticed that there were three more similar objects that were flying in the same direction as that one.  then one came back and flew over our house again.  we watched as it flew back toward town.  then we looked to the right and over the tree was a very large bright looking star thing.  i had never seen something so large in the sky that looked like this.  it definitely was not a star.  i told the children to get my keys because i wanted to get a closer look at the star thing because it was so strange and it did not look like a solid object.  as we drove right the star thing was to our left.  we pulled out about a quarter mile away and the star thing moved above the field across the road.  i turned left and it seemed as though it followed our car.  i got scared and decided to turn around and go down the highway to get away from there but it continued to follow us several miles down the road.  i got scared and called my husband on the phone.  my children were freaking out, so i turned around again and drove back to town where it was populated.  as i drove into the shopping center parking lot it was still there along side us above the grocery store.  then we saw a helicopter go back and fly over our house at a low altitude.  i decided to go back home.  as i pulled in the driveway and turned back around it was in the same spot as before we left only a little higher and dimmer.  i called the neighbor over because i just could not believe what just happened.  i told him to get into the car and drive with me to see what we just saw.  the star thing followed us again.  as we drove down the highway we saw ambulances, fire engines, and police cars sitting in the back of a cemetary with lights flashing.  we did not know what was going on.  we could not explain what was happening and the neighbor got freaked out.  we went back to the house and my husband had come home. so i told the neighbor to stay at the house while we drove the same path to see if he could see it follow my husband and me.  it sure did follow us except when we called the neighbor on the cell he said it had not moved.  this was impossible because it followed along side of us several miles down the road in the opposite direction.  when we came back another triangle aircraft was hovering off in the distance.  we decided to come inside because we were frightened.  i got on here and decided to report this activity.  this is something that we have never experienced before. i am afraid to look outside to see if anything else is going on, and our children are going to sleep on our floor tonight.
