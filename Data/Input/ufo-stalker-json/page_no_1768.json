out of my bedroom window when i get up... a habit. i saw, in the distance, above the tree line,a very bright and  for lack of a better description, twinkling light.\r\n\r\nit was a moon-bright night, and stars were out. i noticed this \"star\" because of its extreme brightness and i didn't remember seeing a star in that sky position before.\r\ni first did think it was just a star but it was too different..\r\ni got my small binoculars and looked at it.I steadied my hand on the window pane. this thing was a good distance from me and it didn't seem to move. \r\nwhen i steadied my hand, looked through the binoculars and i could get the best look at it. it had lights that were rapidly moving and i did notice that there were reddish lights and also what looked like fainter greenish lights. the object didn't move from location the whole time i watched it.\r\ni looked at it for at least 10 minutes. \r\ni know it wasn't a plane, i see many planes day and night here, and it was not a plane.\r\nthe movement of the lights are hard to describe. they were so fast and constantly moving on or around the object. i could not get a photo has i have a small digital camera and the object was too far from me, it would have looked like a white blur.\r\nit was fascinating. it wasn't high in the sky or far far away but enough that i couldn't see the colored lights except through the binoculars.\r\nso after watchig it not move away i went back to bed at about 4:30 am.\r\n\r\ni am up again very early, and i thought i would check to see if my \"star\" was still in positon. there is nothing there, where i saw it. the other stars are all viewable tonight and the moon is bright again. it is a true mystery to me what it was. i would like to say it was a ufo, but i don't know. i have never seen anything like it before. i would appreciate your take on this event and your feedback.. still looking skyward... thanks for listening.","distance":"Over One

observe the night skies with both binoculars and night vision cameras. i was looking at jupitor tonight as its moons were clearly visible through the bino's.  i turn and noticed a very bright star that was completely out of place for its position in the sky.  i noticed it also twinkling very brightly.  i have a pair of canon 18x56 gyro binos, so i found the star in the lens and locked onto it.  after focusing i was completely blown away by what i saw.  very very clear flashing lights, blue green, red, yellow, white in a bar like pattern.  i pulled away the binos and looked at it thinking it had to be moving, but it didn't it just stay'd in its position in the sky.  the structure of the craft is best described as a cone with a pointed top.  the lights display complete randomness to spining like they were racing around the craft.   \r\n\r\nthis was a fist of this kind for me.  i went to my nieghbors house and show'd him the object and he was dumbfounded also.  the craft was in the western sky from morris.  there was lots of aircraft up tonight but none seemed attracted to this craft.  my nieghbor and i watched it for at least a half hour.  i could not get my camera to peer through the 18x scope.  just with the naked eye takes time to find a object with that kind of power. \r\n\r\ni went back to my house and watched it for a while longer.  i went into the house and came back out a while later and the object was gone.\r\n\r\ni dont know how high it was or the size but looking through the binos you could absolutely make out that it had a cone structure with a pointed

notice what at first seemed to be a new light installed by the new song baptist church at the end of ashwood dr., but soon came to realize it was a craft! this craft has 3 bight lights on the bottom portion, it was triangular in shape, was moving slowly and also maintaining a low flight path. the lights on the craft were so bright, not only did they illuminate the ground below the craft (i'd say the craft was about 25-35 ft. above the ground)but they also blinded me temporarily as if i had stared directly at the sun for a few seconds. this caused me to swerve across the road and almost into the ditch, at this time i stopped my car fumbling for my phone to take a picture, but the craft rotated, much like how a helicopter lowers its nose so that the piolt could look towards the ground ahead of the craft. i felt cold and light headed, mostly from nervousness because this craft obviously was searching for something, after \"looking at me\" for a few seconds the craft moved above my vechile, in fear i sped off towards my house which was about 300ft away, when i got there (in a matter of seconds) i looked back in the sky towards where the craft should have been, it was gone. i do have an airport south west of my house in mt. pleasant, but this craft was headed north west, and flying very low, there is no way it could have escaped my sight in the few seconds it took for me to get home. i have no clue what the craft wanted, or what or who it was looking for, but i've never seen activity like this in my area. i always see the ufo stories that make the tv and all of them are out west, i always wanted to see a ufo and now that i have it almost puts me in fear to really know for sure that something more intelligent than any human does exist, what possibly could they be wanting with columbia, and mt. pleasant? is it because the end is near, and they are returning to attempt to find the civilizations they left long ago? what sort of intentions do they have, and why haven't they landed and made direct face to face contact with us yet, why do they just fly searching the ground?","distance":"21-100

responded with clearer memory. \r\ni was in hwy 26 in hillsboro oregon just north of the intel site.\r\ni first noticed it before the jackson school rd over pass as a bright light ahead of me.\r\ni first thought it was a plane with its headlights on coming straight at me.\r\nits started as a point of bright light about 5 miles ahead of me. i woke my daughter who was sleeping in the back seat to come sit in passenger side seat and view what i was seeing. i slowed the van as i drove along with at least 4 other cars that were on the hwy and was looking at it. it then zipped off to the right and was over my town of north plains, then its zipped  to my right on the north side of hwy 26 and started to slowly cruise over the freeway in front of us about 50 yards in front of us heading to the southeast. it only had a unbelievable white light coming out the bottom. once across the freeway it stopped and hovered over the open field to the left of the freeway it then turned on red lights that glided side to side on the far-side of it and green lights gliding side to side on the near side of it. they were gliding separately in opposite directions of each other with the white glow still present. it was at times easy to see the shape of a long rectangle with a triangle front and at times it was hard to see the shape at all. it was dark grey and not shinny at all and made no noise! \r\n i was so focused on trying figure out what i was seeing, looking for wings, looking for lights, looking for windows, anything that would have told my brain it was just a weird airplane. but, when i didn't see anything i knew was normal i started stressing and trying to explain to myself what my daughter & i were seeing. \r\nthen we passed the tree line and i knew i had to turn around and try to see it better. so we turned back around on glencoe rd and headed back and that only took less then 2 min if that and it was completely gone! something that big should have still been in the skyline

flying quite low and must have been less than a mile or at max two miles away.   it was flying in an easterly direction.   it was a very dull gray and almost transparent craft.   it was in the shape of a large v, with what seemed to look like 5 very dull gray rather large lights on it. i witnessed it flying and called out to my husband and he didn't take me seriously until he came over and saw it flying soundlessly, rather cruising along slowly before it disappeared, our view now being blocked by my house.   after he acknowledged seeing it he thought that maybe it was some kind of new stealth fighter being tested. but we found it weird that they would fly so low in a well populated area and not make a sound as well.   we looked all over the internet and could not find any pictures, ufo or

the only ones seeing these unidentified craft in our metro area.  however, there were two other boomerang objects reported for nebraska in september and another seen in iowa last night as well.  so after my girlfriend observed this one, i felt it was important to document for ���the record���.\r\n\r\nat approx 11pm, she had stepped out on the small deck of an apartment on the 2nd floor of a 3-floor building in the area of 74th and maple streets.  while glancing up to her left (east) she observed a boomerang or triangle shaped craft gliding in an open area of the sky between some tree branches and the roof of the apartment building.  total viewing time was 2-3 seconds, but she was dumbfounded by how low it was without any sound or other normal nav lights or strobes.  she states that it had seven white lights with one at the point and then three on each side equally spaced.  she lost sight of it when it passed over the roof of the apartment building.\r\n\r\nthere is nothing scientific to study here.  no photos/video or any other physical evidence.  i guess you can have someone contact us, but there really isn���t much to follow up on.  we simply want it known that we are

quite unscientific from ���channeled��� entities.  having researched this subject myself with a great deal of interest since december 2008, i have to say this channeled info seems quite far-fetched,

see one of us off for the night. as we were outside, i happened to look up and saw a bright red/orange object silently drift overhead from an apparent nw to se direction. my first thought was that the object cannot be a plane, and it did not look like any satellite i had ever seen; it was larger and brighter than a satellite (and also not white like all satellites i have seen to date). we were standing in my friend's driveway between the house and external garage and had to run into the backyard to maintain sight of the object. all 4 of us out there observed the object moving in a relative southeasterly direction (from the northwest), almost directly overhead of us in a straight path. as it continued on its path, one of my friends said \"try to communicate with it\" so i put my intention on that. at this point, the object seemed almost to slow down a bit (this was just before it was about to go out of sight), but did not ever stop moving as best we could tell. my heart eventually started racing as we did not know what we were looking at, and since the speed appeared to be diminishing we were hoping that it would remain in view for a little bit longer. we also thought that it might have been comet elenin since that is supposed to make its closest path to the earth on this date, but we didn't think it was supposed to be so bright or appear in the area of the sky that it did. eventually after slowing down and almost coming to a stop, after about 40-50 seconds, the object disappeared behind the tree line at about 30-40��� above the horizon (south or southeast direction) and we lost sight of it. we have no real way to determine the relative altitude of the object. after the sighting we were discussing what it could possibly be, and we seemed to agree that it didn't really look like a plane or a satellite or comet.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:45","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

just gotten up to independence to pick up a cool bunk bed for our son and was driving back to lee's summit via 291 hwy south.  my wife was driving the u-haul 14ft truck and i was on the passenger side.  somewhere on 291 hwy just passed woods chapel (around 8pm-ish), i saw thru the front left corner of the windshield what i thought were lights on top of a building.  as i realized there were no buildings there i then thought it was a billboard with a series of lights on it as the lights were just hovering there motionless (it was a pretty dark and on-coming traffic headlights made it hard to see eye level detail).  these lights i would say were around 100 ft off the ground and they looked like a christmas tree lighted up [with white/amber lights] lying on its side with the \"tip\" of the tree pointing in the south direction.  \r\n\r\nas soon as i realized something was odd about the lights i quickly pointed them out to my wife.  as we got closer to the lights another object caught my attention, it was hovering at the same level as the first set of lights and about 100 ft south of it. this second object, i thought was a helicopter and got the impression that it was checking out the first object (either police or news crew helicopter. it too was odd looking as it had red and blue (and green?) blinking lights in an angular pattern outlining it and i don���t think it was a helicopter as it was a dark object hovering motionless with no tilt or wobble you see on a helicopter trying to hover in one spot. at the same time i was trying to start up the camera on my phone.  although i managed to video a little just as we passed it, the movement and low lighting made it impossible to distinguish anything.  regretting not having my regular digital camera with me, my senses were at a heightened state after seeing such odd objects in an odd setting (odd objects hovering in plain sight next to a highway with heavy traffic). \r\n\r\n\r\nwe continued on south on 291 hwy. after a couple of minutes, the first object, being brightly lit against a dark sky, again caught my attention.  this time it was out my passenger side window, the rapid motion and lights from it got my attention as it flew fluidly (at about the same altitude) from a north to south direction. i watched it for a second or two and it separated into 3 separate objects; one set of lights continued to fly forward while two other sets of lights immediately turned on a dime and went the opposite direction (north). the one set of lights closest to me tilted slightly to the west as it made the turn allowing me to see the underside. it had 3 lights forming a triangle. none of these 3 objects had blinking lights at anytime, only the constant white amber lights. in retrospect we should have stopped to observe more but we had people waiting at the house to help us with our move so we continued on home. unexpectedly, we saw the same object[s]/lights again the next day on the 4th of october! i will

over the moors),it was a very clear night, i could see some lights in the distance, i thought at first it was a plane coming in to bristol airport, as we`re close to the flight path that they sometimes use. but these lights were slightly off the usual path & as i was looking, the light seemed to split in to two (one above the other),so i watched it coming towards us(my wife was there, she observed also). the light was really bright, it seemed there was a lot of glare coming from the window, so i opened them wide, but the glare was still there...From about a mile out, it looked like it could possibly two large aircraft with their headlights on, at this time i could make out flashing lights(like landing lights) so i was still sure it was a plane or possibly helicopters from the nearby naval air base, but, i still had to watch to be sure. it moved very slowly, but it`s path was bringing almost directly over our house, as it came closer i could see it was not 2 sets of headlights, it`s a bit hard to explain, the main light was, a straight line(like a strip light), with 2 more shorter ones going off at roughly 45 degree angles from the bottom. there were about 6-8 flashing landing lights around the main light, as it flew over the house, i put my head right out the window & looked up, all the lights were on the front of it, as it passed it looked flat, i could see the lights pass & make out, like,the start of a cube, but did not see anything after the lights had passed my field of vision. after it had passed then i heard sound, it was a quiet noise, a bit like the sound of an commercial airplane, of which i`ve heard a hundred times before, in the night. after it was gone i asked my wife at least twice \"did you see that?\", \"yes\".We didn`t speak for about 5 minutes, it was like wow!!, did that really just happen?","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

what sounded like large trees being toppled at a slow, constant speed. the sound was coming from our neighbors woods which is 800 feet down from our property and was heading our way as it was getting louder and louder, we live in a heavily wooded area in southern brown county and have enourmous trees just for the record. \r\ni woke my husband from a sound sleep and made him come over to the window and explained to him i had been listening to the noise for a while now. he was groggy and said he didn't know what it was and told me he was going back to sleep. the noise continued across our property and continued until i could no longer hear it. the next afternoon a conservation officer stopped by and asked if we had experienced anything strange the night before and before i could say anything my husband said, \"i've been a woodsman my entire life and last night i heard something i have no explaination for\", then proceeded to describe what he had heard. the officer said that there were several hundred sightings of a cigar shaped craft hovering over a church camp and a good friend later told us he was at a party in nashville, indiana, which is about 10 miles east of us also in brown county, and saw it hovering while out on the deck. after hearing what others had seen i then realized that what had happened in our woods was actually the tops of trees being sheared off, and i'm talking large limbs! i could not see the craft as i was inside my house looking into pitch darkness and there was no light coming from the craft.That same night a teenage girl driving home from a church meeting almost wrecked her car when a large creature on two legs leaped across the road only touching pavement once. this happened not 7 miles from our house. my husband worked with her father. this is a second hand account which i cannot confirm as i didn't personally witness it but according to my husband the man was certainly not one to make up a story like that. i was told about this site by dan aykroyd and promised to record my account.
