were traveling west on bancroft rd across bourland rd onto norma headed to the intersection of norma and johnson rd.  \r\n\r\nexiting the subdivion of harmonson farms, we were directly in front of a singular horse/farm property located between harmonson farms and keller harvell schooll.   i notice a a blue light directly ahead of us in the sky, towards main st. keller and then noticed several more large blue lights around the initial light.  the light/orb seemed zig zag in random pattern.  it seemed to brighten and then disappear then appear in another place.  this cobalt blue looking sphere would seem to change into a lighter violet color and back again, and it seemed to be in relation to the size of a commercial jet in the sky, about 2x the size of the jets lights.  not small by any means.  \r\n\r\nthese were also with smaller bright white, orange, and red more starlike orbs that seemed to be swimming or flocking like fish or birds.   at one point one white orb seemed to abruptly stop right over us as i mentioned it seemed to see us.  i videotaped most of the event on my iphone, which caught some pretty incredible footage. \r\n\r\nthe groups of  lights moved appx. 10 miles across keller, crossing hwy 377 and moving nw towards roanoke.  we lost sight of them as they moved beyond the tree line and house we were looking at.  my mother lives on the w side of 377 so i called her and told her to go look outside and she came back to the phone reporting much of the same as we had witnessed appx. 4 - 5 miles away.  she said she thought the lights were acting like magnets, pushing and pulling at each other.  \r\n\r\nviewing the footage on our computer - we left original copy on iphone,  it seems as if the objects morph in and out of each other or interact with each other. they rate of speed is quite alarming and at incredible angles.  \r\n\r\nonce home, we were sitting on couch talking about the event, very stressed over saw and heard a very loud squeaking sound out of our open back window.  the sound was like a chirp of a fire alarm needing its batteries replaced.  \r\n\r\nthe next morning talking with my mother she told me she was awakened at appx. 3:00 am. by a squeaking sound outside of her house.  she said it seemed to travel around her house.  i had not told her we had heard that sound yet.

repeatedly in a frantic state.\r\n\r\ni was traveling northbound on i-17 coming into black canyon city. there is an area where the valley is in full view as the interstate seems to be at a slightly higher altitude. being slightly familiar with the area, i was aware that there are mountains and hills in the area surrounding black canyon city, and that the interstate travels through them. coming into the area i noticed a series of red blinking lights that seemed to be ���hanging��� in the distance. my first thoughts were radio tower lights. the way they were ���scattered��� made me think that they were radio towers each positioned atop mountains. as i approached the first blinking red light i became a little suspicious as it was noticeably low, about 50 ft. i then noticed that the first light was not a tower, and not on top of a mountain, but above the interstate itself. i looked to the left and right of it to see if there were any wires that could be hanging this light blinking object, but concluded that there wasn���t. as i approached the object i could tell that it would blink red, and then green, and that it was literally hovering and not a moving object with absolutely nothing underneath, above, or around it. it was simply a blinking red/green light. i kept my eyes fixated on the object as i drove under it, and noticed that the blinking light wasn���t visible from underneath, and that there was an area of ���black��� around it blocking my view from the sky. i���m unsure as to how large the object was considering i was traveling at approx 75 mph. possibly more considering it scared the heck out of me. i approached about 4 more blinking lights and each were hanging off the road, and not directly above me.  they were all within a 5 mile radius, and along the interstate, and had about a mile distance between each other, and each hovering at about a 50 feet, maybe 75 feet high (or low). \r\n\r\noct 2nd 2011,\r\n\r\ncall logs indicate this sighting occurred at 10:03 pm.\r\n\r\ni was traveling southbound from flagstaff to tucson on i-17 through the same area that i had witnessed the initial sightings, and found zero lights in the general area of black canyon city. as i was approaching tucson, in the town of marana, i noticed in the distance a radio tower. being so aware of the red blinking lights, i became fixated on this tower. i noticed it blinking, and to the left, another red blinking light, this one off rhythm of the tower lights, and occasionally blinking a green blip. i couldn���t believe it. i approached the tower and other blinking light and confirmed that it was the same light i was seeing the wednesday before. this time the light was hovering above the interstate but slightly to the west, therefore i wasn���t able to drive directly under it. i was able to indicate that the shape of the light was a square, but it seemed to be wrapped around an object, making the object seem tube like, but vertical. again, this object was low, about 75 feet off the ground, and about 50 feet from me. it  seems as though this particular object was more of an observant object as it simply didn���t move. just blinked.

(almost like its path was planned) by the time i started filming, the object was just a black spec on a bad phone camera video with lots of pixilation. (i do still have the video but it does not show much due to bad pixilation, go figure). i rushed from the excitement and just didn���t play my actions correctly, i would have ran after it to try and film it better but i would have been stranding my 7 year old son alone at a playground with strangers and i had to let it go. it���s  not everyday you see something like this and from now on i���m going to keep a good camera by my side. \r\n     i have added a illustration of the park and the object, i also placed a picture of a person (which is myself) so that you would know the scale of this object and the height it was at from the ground up. i wasn���t actually holding my camera up until the object began to exit through the tree opening. the funniest thing is that after all was said and done (which was about 3 minutes or so) everyone at the park no longer said a word about it and acted as if  nothing had just happened (including myself). but as the evening had went on that day it began to bug me and my memories the more i thought about it the more i lost visual on it but thanks to my son that just wouldn't let me forget about it i held on to the event. i think my brain was trying to play it off like it was a dream. i'm not sure who else saw it but the young girl i spoke to definately did and i will be asking the others if i see them. it boggles me that i didn't ask anyone else anything right after the incident.\r\n     i have seen one other incident years prior but i just decided to pawn it off as a satelite due to it being so far away but now i'm reconsidering that decision. i'm done rationalizing everything, i have always been a religious person at heart and this incident has really freaked me out(although it did not scare me when i witnessed it, i was more in disbalief and excitment then anything), but my son was not freaked noir was he scared at the least then or now, i told him it was just a balloon so that he wouldn���t worry and even at the age of 7 he knows better, he just told me ���daddy i have seen balloons and i have never seen one like that,it had a antenna!.��� ","distance":"21-100

were doing a divination concerning which constellation to ponder and meditate on. this ended up being pisces. so we walked out onto our pool deck after being in a pretty meditative mindset and directly above our neighbors house (from there you would be able to see the couch where we were sitting) we saw two star-like lights in a parallel formation which was slightly diagonal from the horizon. it was completely silent outside, and a perfectly clear night. this formation moved into the pisces constellation which was 60 degrees above the horizon. it moved at a medium pace, and at a steady velocity. the space between the two lights looked fuzzy and seemed interconnected. we immediately went to the backyard to try and see more of this somewhat eerie presence and a meteorite came flying by and then after a few minutes directly above the tip of pisces a blinking blue light appeared and stayed exactly in its position for nearly 45 minutes. the blinking was not consistent with its intervals; they ranged from split seconds to 30 seconds apart. again, it did not move.\r\n\r\nvery interesting.\r\n\r\nthis morning we read the other reports in the area about a boomerang-shaped ufo that were seen lats night, and they sounded very familiar.

birthday falls on a weekday) and we were in our hotel room lounging on the bed with the patio door open observing the night sky and listening to the ocean when we both saw the same thing happen. we saw two star like objects ascend through the sky side by side going along the same path. it was almost like falling star except that they both went in the complete opposite direction, as if you were seeing stars fall in reverse only slower. it happened not slowly, and not fast and we didn't see any specific shape of the objects or notice anything odd about them except that they were definitely taking off and going upwards side by side from ground to sky in the eastern direction.\r\n\r\nif we weren't laying there taking in the view, we never would have noticed it happen or have heard anything, so it was an extreme coincidence that we were able to see this.\r\n\r\nboth of us were pretty shocked and have been for the past few weeks. we've talked about it a few times and have finally decided to simply believe that we did in fact see two ufo's ascending into space, nothing else made sense at that distance, time, speed, or direction. so now that we've both accepted it we decided to report it to your company, in case there were others that saw it the same night as well.\r\n\r\nwe lost sight of the objects taking off together when they flew out of our range of sight from the doorway. i think both of us just kinda sat there dumbfounded for a few seconds before saying \"did you see that?\" and getting up to look out the patio doorway, only finding at that point there was nothing else in the sky except the stars. we sat there for about another hour staring at the sky until we just gave up and went to sleep.","distance":"Over One

walking from my parked car to the back entrance of kohl's department store in havertown, when i noticed a very bright aerial light in my furthest right peripheral vision.  looking up, i saw what i thought at first to be many helicopters flying in three groups consisting of 1-to-four objects.  \r\n\r\nthe sky was overcast but it was not raining.  what startled me was that there was no sound at all.  there was very little sound from the parking lot and by-passing traffic.  i was by myself.\r\n\r\nwe live in a flight path, and are used to seeing and hearing various planes and helicopters at all times of day.  \r\n\r\ni walked about 30-35 feet as i watched the objects, flying from wnw to the southwest...In the direction of the philadelphia int. airport.  during the time they were in sight, one of the lights in the middle grouping suddenly zipped from the group, joined the first group just slightly ahead of what had been its original front light.  the instant speed of the thing took me completely by surprise, at which point i looked to see if there was anyone else in the lot who might also be seeing this.  one woman was coming out of the store, but by that time, the objects were obscured by the facade of the store roofline.\r\n\r\ni was shocked at the sight, but kept walking into the store to continue my errand, simply because i didn't know what else to do.  i reported this to a neighbor who has an interest in these things, and we did a sketch of the sighting.\"  \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1
