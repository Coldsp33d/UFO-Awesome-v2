walking our driveway in the dark, trying to detour any predators from stalking around our home. we live high upon a hill w/some wide open views of the sky on 36 acres, that's when he seen it first. he rushed in the house, approx. 200 yards away from our front door, to get me. he said i had to come see this, his voice concerned. i rushed out the door w/him in the lead, telling me what he had seen, as we made our way to the clearing where he had seen it. there was nothing there at first, meanwhile he's trying to describe what he seen. stood there long enough that i started asking questions. then it started again. not sure how high it was up but high enough it was above nearby clouds. it looked like a tiny, tiny star, moving and not blinking, moving in a horizontal direction. it was emitting these puffs of fire behind it (reminded me of the exhaust of rockets or space shuttles but they weren't shooting down towards the ground, outward behind it)(they reminded me of the top of a nuclear bomb explosion, the rolling, flat cloud you see at the top) and they were short puffs not constant exhaust like w/a rocket, they seemed timed, puff then nothing then poof, every second or so between poofs, done in a sequence. it did this several times. the poofs were way bigger than the object emitting them, the star object looked not much bigger than a pin head in the sky, the poofs were the size of kidney beans in comparison. the tiny object shouldn't have put off poofs that big. i was frightened, my eyes teared up and i knew whatever i was seeing was not supposed to be there or happening. i felt threatened, wanted to tell everyone i love that i loved them, i wasn't too sure the end of the world wasn't happening. it went behind some clouds and cast light behind and around the clouds, like a sunset. that's when we noticed 2 military jets flying in the vicinity. the ufo didn't emit anymore puffs after lighting up the cloud and we seen the planes. the planes continued flying in the area of the object for approx. 5 mins. after the object disappeared. you could tell they were looking for

girlfriend and i were driving northbound on indianapolis boulevard (u.S. 41) to fill up our propane tank for our 6 year old daughters birthday party. \r\n\r\nwhile driving into a city called schererville in, i noticed a round very bright light hovering high in the bright sky on the west side of the street. the light was so bright, i would describe it as a spotlight glaring right into my eyes, that it caught my attention in the bright blue sky. i told my girlfriend to look in the direction of the object and to take video of it with her phone. after having difficulties with her phone i told her to use my phones camera. \r\n\r\nshe brought up my camera on my phone and proceeded to video the object. at first she could not see the object because the object would dissappear and reappear. but when it appeared she saw the object and took video of it until it would dissappear again. the object would ascend and descend appear and dissappear moving from the west to the east and back again. \r\n\r\nwe tracked the round object for some time until we made it to our destination. while filling our propane tank we told the attendant about the object and all of us were scanning the skies to see it, but we could not find the object in the sky. after filling the propane tank we jumped back in our truck and proceeded northbound on indianapolis boulevard once more to our next destination to buy party favors and balloons for the party. \r\n\r\nwhile driving northbound and scanning the skies we saw several airplanes, i then told my girlfriend to try to video some airplanes for comparison to the object we saw. \r\n\r\nafter driving a short distance and scanning the skies for the object, we once again saw the object on the east side of the street. again it was appearing and disappearing, moving from east to west, it did not have a linear pattern. she again took video of the object until it dissappeared. \r\n\r\nwe then made it to our destination and went into the store to buy our supplies.  by the time we came out of the store it was getting dark and we could not find the object in the sky. \r\n\r\nafter arriving at home i took a really good look at the videos. in the videos the object was round and bright white. after zooming in on the object i noticed that the object had a black spot in its center. while looking at the video of the airplane, the aircraft was further away but you can clearly see the fuselage, the wings, and tail of the plane.\r\n\r\nafter reviewing the videos with my girlfriend who is a flight attendant, we both are in agreement that the round bright white object we saw was clearly not an airplane. \r\n\r\nfyi. i am attaching 2 still shots from the video that we took. the first still is just a \"frame shot\", the

towards the local high school, no plan for anything in mind. then, just out of no where, i saw three bright lights in the sky. i started telling my friend to speed up, and she did, trying to catch up to it. that's when we got right next to it, and i yelled at her to slow down, seeing as it wasn't moving and we were going to pass it. so, we pulled into the church parking lot, which it was hovering right over. it and ourselves sat there for about a minute or two, and then it just floated away, so we started following it again. then, all the sudden, it was just gone. we were pretty excited about it, and not scared in the slightest. we knew/thought it was a ufo as soon as we saw it, because it had the three white lights and the triangular shaped body.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

objects appeared to be criss crossing each other, hovering, then gliding horizontally heading in a westerly direction. these objects appeared to be frolicking in and out of the cloud coverage in somewhat playful manner  undoubtedly the afternoon was beautiful with the sun shining and as these objects turned they had a reflective surface. they appeared not very large in size and no noise what so ever. these objects flew over my workplace (a military base at holsworthy) and it is also common for commercial aircraft to fly over the base. i also had a work colleague who witnessed this event too date: 1st aug 2017 at approx 14:27 hours. my iphone video somehow did not work, although i managed to take some grainy photos which i will attach. in order to see some of these objects via my somewhat grainy photos, you will need to expand. i photo has two objects and the rest disappeared into the cloud. the other photo has the triangle object surface of the cloud coverage (top of the cloud photo).\r\nthe first photo after expanding on it you can see 6 objects in the distance -top right of the picture.","distance":"Over One

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Monday july 31st at around 4:30am i was taking my dog outside. i was in the road at the time and i saw out of the corner of my eye a weird light in the woods across the street from my house and some pretty strange sounds. i live in the middle of no where. there's nothing at all in the woods across from my house. there's nothing in the woods across from my house for a few miles to the left, and nothing for about a mile or so to the right. i looked at the light and it was a sort of  ball form. it was not a normal looking light like a flash light. it kind of reminded me of a flame in a way. but a round flame. i thought it was flickering. but i'm not sure because i got a really weird feeling and snatched up my dog and went inside, because there's not supposed to be anything over there. i went inside and woke up my boyfriend and drug him outside to see it. so i could have another set of eyes to see it, so i wouldn't sound crazy the next morning when i tried to tell him about it. he came outside and i showed him what i was telling him about. the ball of light looked like it was slowly walking in a way, or just going back and forth,  but it didn't move too far back and forth. and it kept getting really bright and then really dim, then really bright again etc. while it looked like it was slowly moving. there were trees in the way so we kept having to move around to see it since it was moving. and there looked like there was between 1-3 of them. it was so dark outside and the distance that it was at, my decade old iphone unfortunately couldn't pick it up on its camera. \r\n\r\nthe next morning there were about 5-6 brand new all white suvs with blacked out windows, including the windshield, where you couldn't see inside. they were swarming the area around where it happened, going up and down the road in front of my house, and one was parked at a gate that's never used anymore that is kind of by where it happened. as well as 2 (from what i could see) all white helicopters flying very very close to the ground over the area where it happened. they blended in with the sky like camouflage in a way.  can't be a coincidence that i see this thing the night before and then all of those what looked to be government vehicles and helicopters around the area that i saw it the next morning. my boyfriend and i are both kicking ourselves for not getting all of this commotion on camera as well. with everything that was going on and trying to be nosey and catch a glimpse of what they were up to, it completely slipped our minds. which is the worst thing ever because with no proof, no one believes a word of what we are saying. but it doesn't matter. i know something went down over there. \r\n\r\nlater that evening, monday july 31st, i walked into the woods to check out the area that i saw the light. i came across this 7-8ft tall wall of extremely thick brush that i couldn't see over or through. it is in the shape of a rectangle. one side of the brush wall, one of the long sides, i walked along side of it for about 10 minutes. i couldn't find anywhere at all to go through it. as i said it is extremely thick brush, thorns and small trees. i walked back and walked along the small side of the rectangular wall that's closest to the road. there was no where at all to get through there either. i didn't walk along the other long side or the back. from what i could see the long side that i did walk along, it kept going for a good ways still. i'm not sure about the other side parallel to that one though. there may be somewhere to get through. if not the only option may be chainsaw or something similar to get through. i'm going to get in there to check it out. my gut, and eyes from what i saw, tells me something definitely happened in there though. because like i said, it can't be just a coincidence that i saw what i did and then government looking vehicles and helicopters were there the next morning. something happened. and i'm not crazy. i know what i saw and heard. \r\n\r\nand i'm not going to report something like this to the police. because everyone who reports these types of things are just told nothing happened even if it did and they are just written off and made out to look like a crazy person. the majority of people who see things like this are not crazy and actually did see something. but they are made out to be psychos when in reality they aren't. (don't get me wrong though, of course some people who report seeing things like this are definitely indeed crazy and some probably didn't see a thing).. but i assure you, i'm not crazy. far from it. i may be crazy at times, sure, but that's a whole different ball game. with this, i'm definitely not crazy. i know what i saw.
