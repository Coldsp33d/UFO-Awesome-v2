at tremendous speed approximately 70 degrees above the horizon flying in a straight line heading south east for an estimated 30-40 seconds, it then made a sharp angle change of direction heading north east for an estimated 1-1m20 seconds. \r\n\r\nthe light blinked out for 1-2 seconds then came back with equal intensity twice during the sighting. it did this once while heading east, and then again while heading north east. the total sighting length was approximately 2 minutes +/- 10 seconds as estimated.\r\n\r\nduring it's flight east it left a light streak behind it for approximately 1 second. the object appeared to go extremely fast and then slow down, yet still it was traveling with a high rate of speed. i estimated the total distance traveled before losing sight of it to be 4 feet to the east and 3 feet to the north east. the altitude of the object was high enough to be equal in size and color to a bright white star.\r\n\r\njust before it changed direction i stepped inside my house and reached for a mini monocular to try to get a better look at it. the monocular was 4 feet from the door and within quick reach. the directional change took place right as i got back outside. total time to get the monocular is approximately 10 seconds on the high side. the object was traveling so fast i decided against trying to use the monocular because of the time it would take to focus and continued to watch the object until it disappeared from sight by quickly blinking out. after it blinked out i asked my friend if it had performed any other direction changes or movements while i reached for the monocular. he said it continued as i described it here, traveling fast in a straight line and slowing just a bit, then traveling fast again in the same direction until it's abrupt change of direction. one thing to note is when it changed direction it did so instantly, it did not make a turn, it was heading south east and then north east, that fast.\r\n\r\n1. where were you and what were you doing at the time? \r\nstanding on the darkened porch talking to my friend. i had just looked up to stretch my neck when i noticed a bright star and then saw it move, i told my friend \"hey check it out, it's a satellite.\" but when it changed its speed i began to question that and finally when it changed its direction i ruled it out completely.\r\n\r\n2. what made you first notice the object?\r\nit appeared to be a star traveling extremely fast across the sky.\r\n\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\r\npossibly a satellite until it changed its

after sighting the object.\r\ninitially curiosity followed by amazement,when i first noticed it. then wonder and intrigue.\r\n \r\n6. how did you lose sight of the object? it blinked out of sight. it was there and then just gone.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

was quiet on both sides and it was a very dark night.  we were traveling up to washington state for thanksgiving with family.  i was driving and he was asleep in the passenger seat reclined. \r\nthere is a wide parkway between the n and s lanes of i-5 as you go through the region.  there are many miles of increasingly rolling hills and curves in the road to the top of the pass.   \r\nwhen i first noticed the objects, they appeared very low on the horizon and must have been quite far away because the first thing i thought was that they were very bright orange reflector lights showing that the road will curve to the right.  i was going about 75 mph and in the few seconds, i registered three things, 1.  i started to drive to the right since the \"reflector lights were indicating that road was going to be going to the right soon\"  2. i noticed as i did so, that the white lines on the road were not turning gently to the right they were turning gently to the left and that a truck's headlights were just starting to show through the parkway coming from the north and from the left of us.  3. i slowed down due to the confusion, then saw the orange lights cross the road about a 1/2 mile away and then get much larger and much brighter.  at that moment i slowed to a complete stop on i-5, right in the middle of two lanes.  the lights traveled at an incredible speed, swooped up to the left about 40-50ft in the air like a steep arch, at this point directly up and to my left, they were so bright their light lit up the entire parkway, trees were outlined and the road was completely lit up. then they swooped down directly in front of the windshield, if i was standing outside the car i could have touched them they were so close.  the combination of my slowing down to stop and the light woke up my boyfriend, just in time to see 9 orbs, about 4 ft in diameter, with multi colors, (but emitting a clean clear white light the entirely lit up the inside of the car but didn't hurt our eyes.)  careen in formation, one behind the other, but not exactly spaced apart time wise, they flew past the car, across the road, swooped up directly to our right perhaps 60-70ft, and then, they started navigating through the tops of the trees, avoiding tree trunks (a motion similar to a curving snake) lighting up the entire tree tops until within seconds we couldn't see any light anymore.  my boyfriend swore after picking his chin up off his chest because he was so shocked.\r\n\r\nthe orbs emitted a light that looked alive inside the perfect circles. \r\nthey also emitted a tail, streaks of light behind each one that flew past the windshield.  again we were only about 5 feet away from them and could see them fully in the few seconds that they were in view.  i still can't successfully described the colors i saw inside the light, it was multi colored looked like pure energy. the intense white light didn't bother my eyes enough to be able to look right at them.  the remaining sensation was that they were actually alive. in the end i would guess the total experience took about 45 seconds to a minute, and that changed my life in terms of belief in things no one has been able to explain.  the only comfort i get in terms of the lasting mystery,  is that there have been multiple and credible video and witness reports that can verify what we saw was real, was not  ball lightning or any naturally explained phenomena. i wish i knew what it was that we saw.  i can only guess that it was \"alive\" because it had the ability to navigate and negotiate through the tree line and not hit the trunks and because of it's pulsating energy.  most amazing thing i've ever seen.  my boyfriend was \r\nquite literally shocked and did not want to talk about at all, his response was to basically not talk about it out of fear i guess.  my response has been to keep watching and learning. this happened many years ago and i'm glad to see more information and witness stories than ever provided by sites like this.

like the surface of a pond.  there were no lights.  i watched it move across the sky for about 10-15 seconds until it sort of blended in with the color of the sky.  the other stars in the sky appeared smeary when the object passed over them, then they would re-appear perfectly clear, that's how i could tell the shape.  i couldnt judge how large it was, because i couldnt get a feel of it's altitude,

a cigarette, (i had not been drinking, and i do not use or abuse any legal or illegal drugs or prescriptions), looking up at the stars as i usually do on a cool autumn evening.  i saw, traveling directly north to south, either 7 or 9 lights, each one somewhat cross shaped, flying in a perfect \"v\" formation.  this light group appeared from the north and were traveling perfectly south, then just before becoming obscured by trees, the light group/\"v\" formation changed direction by approximately 25 to 30 degrees towards the west. they were traveling at least 150 mph.  they made absolutely no noise whatsoever.  i live on the flight path of kc135's that have had their landing gears replaced and or rebuilt on hill air force base, utah.  these lights were flying as fast as any boing jet that i have seen in the area.  these lights were flying much faster than any crop duster airplane that has ever flown over my home.  i have lived in my home for 10 years, and i am retired navy.  these lights glowed, unlike any bird or anything that i have ever seen before.  these lights maintained a perfect \"v\" formation, even when performing a directional adjustment.  these lights were silent, and the lights never wavered, meaning that since they were somewhat crossed shaped, the \"wings\", if they had been birds, never moved.  i have never seen a flock of birds that could travel at 150 mph+, not flap its wings, have a flock that never broke perfect formation, and then turn, staying in perfect formation, 75 feet from tip of the \"v\" to tip of the \"v\". this was not birds, and i have never, or ever heard of a silent aircraft before, especially being as close as close to the ground as it was. i cannot believe that even the u.S. govt, even if they have developed a silent aircraft, could be seen from the ground, at 400-500 feet, silent, moving that fast, and i saw no outline of a craft between the lights. \r\nwhat more can i say. \r\n","distance":"101-500

happenned on friday night at around 11:17 p.M... i was visiting my friend that night at his house, i decided to go outside to get some fresh air, when i just happenned to notice a very strange light in the night sky within a couple of miles from where i was at in longmont, colorado. longmont colorado has a population of around 75-thousand residents. this sighting happenned on the very end of this city, on the far south end of town. my friend wasn't outside at the same time that i was for him to witness this u.F.O. sighting. anyway that night on friday september 30th 2011, i just happenned to notice a very bright white lights that were in the shape of a v-shape triangle slowley heading south east of longmont, colorado at a steady crusing speed. this object wasn't going real fast like most u.F.O.'s that are reported to travel. it was going a steady speed of what a normal twin engine airplane woul'd travel it seemed. this v-shaped object that i seen that night was a real solid object that wasn't an airplane, or a sattelite, or any known type of a natural man-made objects that we have here on our planet! the bright lights on this u.F.O. object were very bright white lights, the lights were lighted up in a v-shape pattern. the lights seemed to be pulsating in a strange pattern. i only had a short time to view this object before it dissapeared behind the trees at my friend's place before i lost full view of it. when i spotted this u.F.O. object i was tottally stunned at what i was seeing with my own two eyes. i rushed in my friends house where he was at to explain to him what i had just seen, and wittnessed! my friend was on the phone talking to his girlfriend, and by the time i finnally got him to see what i had just wittnessed this object was moving over the trees in his back yard to where he couldn't get a full view of this u.F.O. before it dissappeared out of full view behind the trees in his back yard. i didn't have my cell phone on me at the time of this sighting, otherwise i woul'd have taken a picture recording of it. there has been alot of these type of u.F.O. reports all over the areas of not only the longmonr area, but also in laffaette, colorado back in march of this year 2011, there was a major u.F.O. sighting that hundreds of residents of this town located within fifteen miles of the city of longmont, colorado where i live at and have seen this u.F.O. that i have mentioned above. the laffaette, colorado u.F.O. sighting was on the major news on channel 9-news, and other news stations through out colorado. hundreds of people wittnessed back in march, 2011, a v-shapped traingle shapped object hovering still over laffeatte, colorado the night of their major sighting here in colorado. this u.F.O. sighting is filmed on u-tube, and this u.F.O. hovered still above the town of laffeatte, colorado for at least close to a half an hour. there has been many other u.F.O. reports that other people have video taped with their cam-corders this year in 2011 here in colorado. \"these are \"real\" u.F.O. sighting's folks!!! including what i witnessed to on september 30th 2011... it seems very strange that the closer that we are getting to the suppossed mayan end times date of december 21st 2011, which is on a friday by the way, the more every day average people are wittnessing u.F.O. objects in the skys, either in the daytime, and night time both! there are on average hundreds of these sightings every month all around the world! we all need to take these u.F.O. sightings \"very seriousley!!! i don't know why these objects are showing up every where lateley. do these extra-terrestrials have a plan to invade our planet earth, or are they just simpley watching, and observing all of our cities around the world??? why all of a sudden are these reported u.F.O. objects showing up almost in every major city all around the world recentley. i was born in the earley 60's and through out all of my life i have never wittnessed or seen anything like i had seen recentley in the sky! anyway thank's for reading my true story of what i just wittnessed in the night sky, of what i believe is an honest to god's \"real u.F.O. sighting\" that i had just seen and wittnessed!!! go on the internet on \"yahoo\" and type in denver, colorado u.F.O. sightings in 2011\" and check out not only the reported major u.F.O. sighting that i had mentioned above in laffeatte, colorado and you will see the actuall cam-corder video taped earlier this year in 2011... but also on yahoo, type in the words u.F.O. sighting's in denver colorado on august 23rd 2011, and september 2011... there is a man who has many live camera videos that he has taken here in the denver, colorado area of major u.F.O.'s that he has on his video-camera taken in the daytime, with his high power spotting scope with a digital camera-video recorder attached to it, plus at night time too! in august, and september 2011, also all year long, from march of 2011 this man with the nickname on u-tube he goes by the name of \"magnet flipper\" look this name up also on u-tube and see all of his \"fantastic-u.F.O.Videos there! with his spotting scope he has many fantastic video camera shots of these u.F.O.'s... as i close my full true story of my personal u.F.O. sighting on september 30th 2011, i wan't to mention to all of the non-believers out there that if you don't think that u.F.O.'s exist, or another higher intelligence higher than ours here on earth exists, sooner or later you can very possibbley have an encounter with a strange object in the skys too if you woul'd just look up in the sky when you are out in your back yard, or anywhere either in the day time, or night time, i can almost guarentee it that sooner, or later you will spot something up in the sky that doesn't look like an airplane, or something normal on our earth that we have man-made today! don't forget to alway's have your cell phone camera ready or cam-corder by your side just in case you do happen to be in the right place at the right time to wittness an exciting event such as my u.F.O. sighting and hundreds of others of average every day people that see these objects in the skys! don't forget to look up these u.F.O. sightings on \"yahoo\" that i listed above, then you be the judge of if you believe that u.F.O.'s are real and if they trueley do exist!!! ken, of

who had a heart transplant in 2001 and a stroke which left my right side partially limited. i was living in san jose and had a fantastic position with an international hi-tech firm doing project management in palo alto. it was a great future in store for me, and i was very excited to be a part of it. i am living north now in mckinleyville, ca.\r\n\r\nfrom what i can remember in the past:\r\n\r\n5 years old: i was climbing on the outer railing when i fell off the second floor and right before i landed on my back on the tiles, i felt my body being set down very slowly. being five i thought that was really neat and ran into the kitchen to tell my grandmother who got angry and scolded me telling my \"you're full of \"cazzata\" which translates to \"bull s****\" and scolded me to my room. i never forgot that moment even for a second. \r\n\r\nat the age of 24: i was away at collage and living in an old c.1894 house with four other students. for about two months at least 2 mornings per week i had a series of waking up and being completely unable to move anything except for my eyes for approx 30 minutes. another thing was the \"weight\" that heavily pressed my body into the mattress, it felt like someone was on top of me. that was a disturbing times but it ceased at two months. not ever was i into 'ghosts' but that made me serious about wondering if they really exist. i searched the old house at humboldt state university's library and found that the 1894 house was built right over the ashes of a previous building.  the wondering about a ghost faded as i was in an intensive program that needed my focus.\r\n\r\n2 years ago: i woke up in my bed and looked at my watch seeing that three days had passed with no recollection of anything. i was extremely upset about it and went to my doctor who took a blood test and everything was normal.  i did not tell him about why i was so frazzled. in addition i had multiple dreams where i was unable to move except for turning my head. it was a very strange room with two other tables with people laying on them and again there was a being 8-9 feet tall wearing an outfit with a hood and shielding for the face working on the body to my right. i can recall turning my head to the left where small rectangle windows looking down at clam beach from i guess around 7000 feet, just a guess. during the two years i had multiple dreams like that.\r\n\r\nthe last week: the last night for the third time in the past week i dreamt of being in an underground 'lab?' or some kind of very large underground facility 'people' of two types. one type was 8-9 feet tall and the other was 'human-like' who can communicate using their minds. (i feel like i'm going crazy.) they were very calm and 'loving.' there are dozens of windows in the rock where the 'humans' would live, they would open into the rock. i would wake up and fall right back into the same dream. i have noticed new skin-marks and two new tiny scars. \r\n\r\ni live alone, my family is in so. california.\r\n\r\nthat's my story and you may do what you like with it, but again, please do not use my name.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"07:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":32262,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.784971,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10012011-0023","longitude":-119.4140624,"occurred":1317452400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1317526972000,"summary":"Abduction","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO

i looked at the clear sky and i saw an object flying; it had a boomerang shape, it was dark color and silent. i saw it for about 10 seconds and try to show her what i was seeing but she couldn't see it, then it disappeared, but about 10 seconds later, we both saw like a very bright shooting star and then few second later a second bright shooting star.\r\n\r\ni was very surprised of what i saw, i didn't want to get inside the house and i kept looking at the sky while i was telling her my experience.\r\ni told her to stay outside so we might see it again. she took the dog inside the house and came back to join me; we were there looking for 30 minutes, so we decided to laid down on the bed of my truck. we kept looking and looking..\r\n\r\naround 1:35 am i saw it again and i could not believe it, i told her \"there is!\" and i pointed at it and we both start following the object.\r\nit was like a boomerang shape but a little more rounded, it was dark color but a bit lighter than the sky, like it camouflages with the sky. the object had no sound at all, it was flying at the speed of an airplane or a bit slower, like it was scanning the area or checking around. it had no lights but seems to have like a line pattern that was lighter than the body.\r\nit was flying from north to south and we saw it for about 30 seconds until it was very hard to spot it because of the lights of the street.\r\n my friend said, that before it disappeared, the object did a round/circle move. about 10 seconds later we saw like another very bright shooting star.\r\nwe were in shock and stayed there for another 30 minutes, but we never see it again. we went inside the house and try to draw the object, we ended up with similar drawings and similar details, the only difference according to her, the object had a soft glow at the backside.\r\n\r\ni think this is one of the most amazing experience we ever had.\r\n\r\ni try to called you yesterday morning, but the only way to contact you is thru here.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nhector\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:40","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

i went out on our back deck to smoke a cigarette at exactly 10:00 p.M. i was facing east. i noticed a bright orange light through the trees and at first thought it was the moon. i then noticed that it was moving. i then thought that it could be the landing lights of an airliner. we are located on a flight path for the kansas city international airport and we often see the aircraft approaching the airport. after seeing this object for a short period of time i realized that their were no beams of light that are often seen on the aircarft and also i could tell that the whole object was a very bright orange. it was moving from south to north and it was rock steady in it's movement. i kept waiting to hear a sound from engines but it was absolutely quiet. after a few seconds it cleared the tree and came into full view. i kept trying to make it into an airplane of some sort but i knew without a doubt that it wasn't anything like i had ever seen. after a few seconds i noticed that there were a row of bright white ligts (small) starting to appear on a lateral line running from the front of the object (stating maybe a quarter of the way back from the front and extended about halfway back along the object). these white lights were small, bright and sharp. at first i thought thay maybe they were the lights on the end of an aircrafts wing as i was still trying to turn this object into an aircraft. the white lights started to appear one after another in rapid sequence starting from the front. the object kept moving at a relatively slow speed and completely quiet. it dissapeared behind trees as it moved north. it sent chills down my back and the hair on the back of my head stand up. i have never had anything do that to me. i couldn't explain what it was and it just wasn't normal in shape, color or anything else. i have set the time at 10:00 p.M. exactly but again it could have been 11:00 p.M.. whatever this thing was it was very strange. i have always had a hard time beleiving in ufo's or flying saucers but i have no explanation for this sighting. being at night i can not give any real estimate as of distance from my location or it's size. all i can say is that it appeared to be large and not that high in elevation from the ground. i would guess a few thousand feet but that is only a guess. i keep going out on the deck at nigt with my cell phone camera hoping to catch this or something like it but i have never seen it since. i will send photo's if i ever catch it
