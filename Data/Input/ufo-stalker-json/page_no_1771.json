is was a formation of birds, but then i realized that whatever i was looking at, was in space! i was looking at a triangular formation of dim lights in space as it traveled from north to south right over my backyard. the shape was like the outline of an ice cream cone. i stood there with my mouth wide open, trying not to lose sight of it. in the mean time, i was trying to count the lights. one was in the front and i counted at least five on one side. i really couldn't concentrate on counting the lights because my mind was racing and my heart rate was increasing! on top of that, i was being distracted by the falling meteors that would flash and disappear. the lights i was observing were way above the meteors that were falling. that's way i know these lights were in space. though, i couldn't tell if it was one solid object or multiple individual objects. after, i lost sight of the lights, i brought the dog in and i ran up to my son's room and told him what i just saw. we both came down and went out back and pulled a couple of chairs and sat there for 45 minutes hoping we would see something else. all we saw were a couple more meteors falling and one airplane in the 45

and star gaze. i noticed a very peculiar looking star, very low to the ground, blinking, flashing, and pulsating different colors. so i start flashing my flashlight on my key chain at it, s.O.S. thinking i'm being foolish, even when it starts to drift away, i'm still thinking it's a star. then right before it becomes out of view it starts to wobble and pulsate red, blue, and white. i knew this couldn't be a star, even called my girl friend over to make sure my eyes weren't playing tricks on me. and she confirmed it was moving. seeing as she is deathly afraid of aliens, she goes back inside. shortly after the \"star\" is no longer visible, a big flash of light out of nowhere comes from the trees around the area where i first noticed the \"star\". this light is still at first for a couple seconds and i'm thinking it's someone's porch light, (in the middle of the woods). the light starts moving, and its moving slightly off from my direction, goes through the trees slowly and towards the backyard, so i run off the porch and run to the back fence as far as i can go, and now i can make out the shape of this object, it was your average bumper sticker ufo, and it had 2 or 3 large lights in the center of it, slowly rotating. i was going to jump the fence and continue to chase it, until i remembered the neighbors own a dog. so i didn't want to risk it. not to mention i was very afraid and excited at the same time but i kept telling myself to be brave. there was a time where i thought to myself, \"this may not be such a good idea...\" (chasing it down). and from there, it flew til i no longer had sight of the object. it was traveling eastbound at a constant slow, eerie pace. and that was my very first ufo sighting in my life. \r\nfor those who are interested, syracuse and it's neighboring cities have strange objects in the skies almost every night. since my first sighting i've observed ufo's and orange spheres in fayetteville, nedrow, and the indian reservation by nedrow. as soon as it gets dark, the party starts. it may take patience. worse part is, no one cares. even those who genuinely believe me, don't seem to care too much. those who doubt me aren't lifting a finger to debunk me. don't take my word for it, go see for yourself. they are out there almost every night. question is why are they here? (assuming the objects are of e.T. origin). could be government crafts flying around, or both... am i sounding crazy yet? like i said, don't take my word for it, go and find one, or one will find you. they're out there almost every night.

it took me five minutes to get there.  after i got to the hill, i called my brother and told him about it.  he was shocked by what i had seen.  i disconnected; on my bike roughly ten minutes later, he claimed to have stepped outside to smoke a cigarette, and saw three orbs flying above lavista in formation, led by a blinking strobe orb, and followed by two brightly lit ones.  the strobe-orb flew away from the other two orbs, and then the remaining two orbs flew off in the opposite direction.  \r\ni can only verify what i have seen with my own eyes (the original orb seen at 12312 port grace blvd,) the encounter lasted roughly 2-3 seconds for the falling meteorite, 5 seconds for the meteorite to expand and \"grow\" into a large size, and then 3 seconds heading westward before disappearing.  i have seen this with my own eyes and testify it is true.

seemend low to me and was brighter than the other stars that were out that night but did not think much about it and continued walking. where i lived there were no street lights as it was a country road with very few houses along the way.\r\n     i walked about a mile before i met up with my friend . he said to me look up that light has been moving slowly from the direction you were walking as if it was following you or just following the course of the the road!We both starred at it for a few seconds at it then it flew over a field where it met another star like light which was stationary then they both zig/zagged across the night sky then flew side by side to the north west dirction slow at first then vanished out of sight. there was no sound from the lights at any time that we could hear.\r\n    the best way i can discribe the movement and speed of these lights , would be just as you would shine a laser pointer on a wall then zig / zagged the light as fast as you could from right to left, this is how fast they moved!My friend look at me and said i am certain our military has nothing that can move like this. you see my friends dad was in the airforce and my friend was a airplane nerd, he had models of fighter jets hanging from his bedroom ceiling and all kinds of posters of differant jets and such all over his room. this was his love in life studying air craft.\r\n    when those lights moved from side to side as they were playing with one another our mouths just drop , i mean my god man what can move like this? where did they come from? we were amazed and very confused . we decided not to tell our other friends back at his house or any one else, this was his idea and said they all will think were crazy. i have kept this to my self all these years only to tell my wife. i have many questions now, i have witnessed a life changing advent that i can not share with out being labeld. i know what i seen and now the only witness has passed away leaving me with

boss \"what is it?\" he said ii don't know. \r\nthan a couple police cars pull up and they told me they have been watching it for over a hour about 5 miles away at a k-mart parking lot. the cop said

slowly faded away.\r\n best part is now, 15 plus years later my friend bill is explaining to the date and time what i saw. we were in shock that someone else seen this, he was getting a drink of water

positions.  it came from behind us and my wife and i were both surprised by it.  clearly was not a plane, it was moving too fast, not a comet as it had no tail or trail behind it, too big/bright to be a shooting star.  \r\n\r\nwe then made it up to seymour entrance to i69 north and got on our way.  just a couple minutes after we were on the interstate 3-5 lights appeared out of nowhere to the east of the interstate.   they were there for about 10 seconds, converged and disappeared.  there was no noise, no flash- nothing, they were just gone.   now we are a bit weirded out.  it was the same

window (toward the north) from about 10th floor i observed an object traveling from west to east at an elevation that did not enable me to fix a distance or size as it did not traverse any building or other physical object. the interesting thing here is that the hotel is directly east of lax and under the arrival flight paths to lax.\r\n\r\nthe object appeared to be kind of an elongated octahedron oriented vertically vice horizontally with distinct corners and slowly rotating clockwise as viewed from the ground. it appeared to be a kinda burnt orange color, so at first i thought that it was an errant target from the pacific missile test range out of pt. mugu. but no, the targets that they use are bright international orange, and besides, from many years experience on the range, i have never seen a target that was that shape or color.\r\n\r\nthe object moved slowly and horizontally and was in my sight less than a minute. this is one of the times one wishes for a camera or binoculars. \r\ni thought that it must be some sort of balloon, but i soon eliminated that as it flew horizontally and did not appear to be influenced by the relatively strong winds coming over the city. this one fact might indicate that it was quite a bit higher than the buildings.\r\n\r\nso, i have no idea what it was. i saw nothing in the papers. also, since it happened in \"controlled airspace\" with all sorts of commercial traffic arriving it is hard to believe that nobody reported it.\r\n\r\nthat is it in a nutshell.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

bed looking at one of the \"others\" (entity)in the room at the foot of the bed between the bed and the window/wall, which, along with the computer desk, was all i could see behind him. he began conversing in a language which i did not and do not understand as it was comprised of mostly metal-scraping sound and chirping. i saw the \"other\", he had big oval obsidian eyes and stood about 5'6\". i could not understand the language yet i knew what he way saying, as if he were communicating telepathically in a manner i could understand. i distinctly remember him tell me his name in a way i could speak it as \"raucyac\", and told me that he was there to talk to me. he also \"told\" me that he was a youth in his culture, and with the soft features and gentle bearing it felt to be accurate. i also felt safe and mentally intimate and a strong bond to him. we talked for a long period of time, but i am not sure how long as i was entranced on him. i remember that he was conversing with me for a long time as friends would, but i do not recall everything that we spoke about. at one point in the conversation, he pointed at my sleeping fiance and made what i am equating to be a smile. he had very long, slender, wiry arms and fingers. his skin was a graphite to deep steel color. he was quite thin as i could see his ribcage. he then made his goodbye and i blacked out and the next thing i remember i blacked out and woke up the next morning extremely refreshed and energetic and happy.","distance":"20 Feet or

approximately 9 pm. my oldest son (18) was sitting in the back seat and said whats that? my daughter (16) in the front me driving and my nephew (14) in the back seat with my son. the kids pointed it out to me. i pulled over so i could observe. the object was a red orb approximately golfball or baseball size from our point of view, pulsating slowly then vanished. didnt move anywhere just dissappeared. about a minute later the orb reappeared in the same place and started emmitting what looked like shooting stars but they were falling to the ground. after about 6 of these slow falling stars the orb dissappeared again, only to return after approx. 1 minute and started the star deployment again, this time with 10 stars falling. the orb did this same thing 2 more times, so a total of 4 vanashings and reappearances. the last appearance it dropped 5 more of these stars and the red orm got really bright and dissappeared for good this time. as a former army paratrooper ive seen flairs and helocopters at night and this isnt one of them. its taken me this long to go through my head to figure out what it was. i have no explination as to what it was. now im not very familiar with rte 138 as im new to this area. as for exact location i could probably find it again but it was nighttime and again im unfamiliar with the area. if there is any other info please do not hesitate to

like it was hovering. my first thought is that it could be a drone. but this didnt have wings and it had to be very large. it was very high up in the sky. higer then most planes i have seen fly by.
