we would do on the weekend. that night we where the only ones there because a big storm was approaching from the west. it was a beautiful night no wind very calm and no waves.  we were looking at the stars, you could see millions of them when my wife said to me look at that boat out there.  when i looked i saw a light about 10miles down the lake to the southwest towards the storm and said \"he better get in or he'll be in trouble\" and went back to looking at the stars.  about 10-15 sec. passed and she said \" were is that boat\", i looked and it was not there, so i looked around. the light was past us about 5 miles to the north, that is impossible, no boat is that fast, when all of a sudden it shot up about a hundred feet and hovered for five min.  dropped back to the water then came toward us,as it got closer i saw a huge black mass but could not make out any shape.My wife got scared and wanted to go, i told her to go find someone to see this.She left \"fast\"telling me to come but i was to drawn to it.When it got within a hundred feet it shot away so fast it was unbelievable. i couldn't  hear anything but some thunder from the storm.It was now about ten miles away from me. it would hover off the water and sometimes look as if it would enter the water.After watching it go up and down for awhile it soon entered the storm and that was the last i saw it.We drove to town and told people but no one would believe us.The next day on the radio more people say they saw ufo over lake michigan that night.","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1 Mile,

the deck and saw the craft hovering just above houses about 100 yards away. it had two solid huge, bright blue led style lights on the left side, with two rows of 4 red lights of the same style and sizeabout 1/2 inch vertically separated from my view that went off like a wave on the right side of the craft from the left to the right (right and left are relative to my view; the left was the rear of the craft, where the open part of the \"v\" was, the right was the front, the vertex of the \"v\")\r\nwhen i saw it my fiance was walking out right behind me and i began hitting her to gain her attention and just kept saying \"hunny hunny hunny\" and pointing with my other (right) hand. \r\n3) i immediately knew what it was because of a previous encounter with the same craft. i could make out the shape as a chevron-esque shape. \r\n4,6) i then watched it semi hover, possibly moving extremely slowly, then it took off straight north, covering the remaining field of my vision (about 45-50 degrees to the north from the original spot of the craft) in about 4 seconds.\r\n\r\n right as it went too far north for me to see any longer, i saw a plane which was heading south as i was watching the craft, turn abruptly and head north. i knew that was a plane because of the relatively dim red-white flashing, which i see on a nightly basis. \r\nmy reaction is the same as it is any time i see the \"others\". it is a feeling of general fear of the unknown, but more pure elation as to what they know and what i can learn. as i have mentioned, i have had multiple sightings and a few encounters

were 15000-25000 feet up,silent,black and fast...Real fast,like nothing i've ever seen before.They were out of site almost as soon as we spotted them,we only could focus on them long enough to make out the shape and color and to notice that they didn't have any lights.The only way that we could see them is because they were so black and the fact that the sky's backdrop was lit up so bright from all the stars.\r\n as the event happened i was trying to rationalize what i saw,was it a jet,milatary...? as i collected the information in my mind i could come to only one unbeleivable

dark when we headed up the stairs to go home. we went up the first flight of stairs and stopped to rest, as we looked out at the ocean. i noticed a strange bright white light hovering over the water.

right side of us! we acknowledged the light and it darted away. then i said,\"dont be shy!\" (of course i was kidding)then it reappeared and got brighter, it seemed to blink when we talked to it. then it blinked from white to blue to red. we started to get scared so we decided to leave. my intuition and sixth sense became overwhelmingly strong. i felt a premonition...I knew something was going to happen. i knew something was waiting for us at the top of the trail. i was reluctant to leave but my gf encouraged me. she reminded me how late it was and we had a 2hr drive ahead of us back to monterey bay. she lead us up the staircase to the trail, all we had was our cell phones used as flashlights. once the staircase ended we continued up to the dirt trail. im really scared and holding onto her by the back of her shirt with one eye open. then we see a light, it looked like a flashlight shining threw  the trees and bushes. it looked like someone jogging down the trail towards us with a flashlight/spotlight shining randomly. i had a sign of relief for a minute thinking it was a person, but as it got closer it then looked like a miners hat with a bright white spotlight. we both then realized it wasn't human and it wanted to communicate. i spoke to it and said, \"i don't understand what you are trying to say to us because your not human and dont speak our language!\" then it got closer, the miners spotlight hat turned into a boomerang/triangle with the bright white spotlight. it started to touch down, but with white tenticles/strings hanging from it that started to take human form. thats when the 3 points of the triangle materialized into 3 beings & 3 lights!! white light turned into an animal, blue light turned into a  lady with long black hair overweight wearing a blue dress, and the red light turned into a man in a red outfit. we asked them if they were friendly? right when they completely took form and hit the ground,they immediately rushed us and ran full-force towards us!! \r\nthat is not friendly!!!! we did not like that at all!!!! \r\nwe started praying! my gf kept repeating the lords prayer. i called upon god to cover us with jesus's precious blood and protect us from all evil!!! i called upon my guardian angels to wrap their beautiful wings around us and keep us safe!! \r\nwithin an instant they disappeared!!! i still remember the look of fear on the lady's face...Very creepy!!! \r\nnot sure if they are aliens or spirits!? maybe their cousins, lol!!\r\nwe continued to see them above the ocean on our left side on our drive home. i have some

am doing. i found that there is a place in the foot hill in ojai that there area number of them that they are there when i get close to a ship on the ground there are several reasons i cant get close enought to touch then,one is my feet are glue to the ground ten feet away, another is they fill my mind with terrer as if i am going to be eating by something other than they earth a garding that is pertecting them. i under stand that if i get beon there gard and get close enough to tough one of there ships that maybe i might be able to connect to them a may be one with them and to under stand why i am so atracted to them. all i can do right now is to keep a eye on them and wate for the opertunaty for them to have me for there guest but untill then i going to have that barrier.One day they will come for me i will disapeir people will look for me for a wile then they will give up and forget me.I use to worry about it but now i am ready for them to take me i know now that i am ready to give up my life if that is what it takes to be able to be with them to travel to space but i hope that i wantto be in my body alive and well but now i am ready for what ever they want of me. thanks

clear, and i spent much of the evening looking up at the stars. i am a ufo enthusiast, but also a skeptic, and was hoping to see aircraft of any kind (human-made or not) because of the great visibility. my companion isn't a ufo enthusiast and is more skeptical than me, but he acknowledged he saw something odd last night.\r\n\r\nwe didn't have a clock on us, but i believe it was around 9 p.M. when i glanced up and saw a series of lights moving above and slightly to the north of us. the object was about the size of a golf ball at arm's length when it was flying over us, slightly to the northwest out toward the pacific ocean.\r\n\r\nthe craft's lights were in the approximate shape of an arrow, with three steady, white-yellow lights forming a chevron at the front of the craft. at least one or two of the same type of lights formed the shape of a narrower, fuselage-type \"arrow shaft\" in the middle. at the back of the craft, a pair of the same lights extended out again like another chevron pointing in the same direction as the front of the craft. on the rear of the craft was a single red light, the same size as the white-yellow lights, only this one was blinking at a rate of about every other second.\r\n\r\nthe two of us walked further out on the beach to get a better look at the craft, as we both realized it didn't look like a conventional aircraft. we looked but did not see any flashing green or white faa-regulation navigation or anti-collision lights.\r\n\r\nthe craft continued over us toward the northwest but eventually made what appeared to be a wide arc and began flying south down the coast, several miles out to sea (i am not good at estimating distance so cannot say how far out it was). the craft, when viewed at a distance from the side, looked like a stereotypical \"flying saucer\" with a series of white lights flying in a row.\r\n\r\nthe craft appeared to continue flying to the southwest, further out to the ocean. as it flew further away and out of sight, i was able to keep my eyes on the single blinking red light as it moved further out to sea. eventually it faded away out to the southwest, and we didn't see any other aircraft that night.\r\n\r\ni'm not sure if the craft made any noise because we were right next to the ocean and waves, which were very loud.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

drive at about 12:30 am out in the country.  we turned onto a outer city road and were only driving for about 10 minutes when we saw a blimp-like object about 200 yards to our left and about 500 yards in altitude. there was a single row of lights that went all around the object that stayed illuminated and were bright white. there was a flashing blue and white light atop of the object. we followed that object for about a mile. i was not driving at this point, so i continued to search the sky for other objects. the first object made no noise at all. the second object, i spotted first. it was a few miles away and was covered by a cloud. it appeared to have a bright white light that was pulsating. i could only see the lights behind the cloud which looked to be heat lightning. then the object came from behind the clouds and realized that what i thought was heat lightning was really the light on top of the object. we then turned right onto another country road and after following the two original objects for about 5 or 6 miles several of us spotted about 5 more aircraft surrounding us. we pulled over and got out of the car when the original ufo was coming directly towards us. when it was about 100 ft away from us and 100 ft in altitude it made the strongest winds i have ever felt in my life. strong enough to almost knock me on my feet. the noise emenating from the object was loud enough for me to cover my ears. it then went to directly overhead and we tried to videotape the object but nothing showed up on the film. it sped off at speeds unimaginable. we then got back in the car and drove towards the other 6 or 7 objects that were still in the sky. i was driving at this point because the original driver wanted to try to film this on her phone. i felt compelled to follow the objects. once we had been driving for about 15 more minutes, we pulled over again in an open area. when we got out of the car this time, we counted about 15 objects in about a mile radius around us. we again tried to document the objects but the audio was the only legible thing in the video. at this point we looked in the fields around us and spotted several(5 or 6)objects on the ground about a mile away. they were about 100 ft tall. they had rows of lights on them. the rows were vertical. the first row had red lights. the second had white. the third had a bluish light. they all flashed in sequence and were all perfectly similiar with one another. the flashing also was in sequence with the white flash of the objects in the air. after standing outside for about 30 minutes we got back into the vehicle to see if we could find a roadway that got us closer to the landed objects. when we began to drive again, every one of our phones died. not at the same time, but in succession. then it began to rain, but the rain was only falling on the drivers side of the car. we followed the objects for another 30 minutes and saw several of them coming very close to our vehicle. we stopped in the middle of the road at some sort of country road intersection with a run down convenience store. this time when we were out of the vehicle, one of the ufos flew about 50 ft above our heads. this object was triangular in shape and about 100 feet in length. the object was solid with what looked like weird carvings that looked like some sort of circuitry. it reminded me of a computer chip. there was a bright white light on each corner of the triangle. it got directly above our head, but this made a buzzing sound. when it was there, it hovered and ascended slightly at an angle and then its two back lights went out. it then elevated rapidly and then a red light appeared and the lights were flashing. at this point it looked like an ordinary airplane. there was a second one that came close to us at this point that was disc-like in shape. it came within a hundred yards of us and looked to be about 50 feet in diameter. it had a greyish-black color for the base of the aircraft. it seem to spin as it moved away from us. this one also had a white pulsating light at the base and the top. the third object that we saw at this point was about 100 yards above us. it was trapezoid-like shaped and on the side of it, it had the same patterned row of lights as the aircraft we saw landed earlier. it, too, pulsated in sequence with the other objects that we could see in the distance in the sky. this object was about 150 feet in length. while this one was hovering about 100 yards above us and about 100 yards away, another one seemed to appear and disappear behind it. the one that appeared, appeared as a orb of some sort that looked to me as if it was caught on fire. i believed at this point, that it had malfunctioned and blown itself up because before it disappeared, it appeared to be descending rapidly. when the object that looked to be on fire disappeared, so did all of the others. that is how we lost sight of the objects. this time that we were out of our vehicles felt like it lasted 10 minutes, but i think it was really about 45 minutes. at this point, we were about 45 minutes to an hour away from lawrenceburg, ky. on the drive back , we all felt very anxious, and for the first time since we saw the first object, frightened. it was about 4 in the morning at this time. on the drive back, we didn't spot another object in the sky. at every time that we exited the vehicle to get a better look, there were no visible stars in the area directly above us. it was completely dark. the whole sighting was about three and half hours long as i remember it now.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,  Appendage(s),  Wings","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering
