wife and i were sitting outside of our home in los angeles near the la river. i noticed a very bright yellow-orange light approaching rapidly from the se. i am a space and aircraft enthusiast and it seemed strange that this object was flying so quickly in a direction never used by any of the aircraft that fly over our area. it also did not look like the helicopters that are a ubiquitous part of living in l.A.\r\n i listened for the sound of an engine as it approached and heard nothing at all. there was nothing else in the sky at that time. there were minimal hazy patches of clouds but the few stars visible in los angeles were easy to see. the object then slowed as it came nearly overhead. at that time i asked my wife to have a look and she didn't have an explanation for it either. we watched as it came to a stop, slowly moved to the right (our left) and very slowly turned in a parabola towards the sw. it then completely disappeared. the color was yellow-orange and was constant. no flashing lights and certainly no sound. i have no idea what it's altitude was. we are neither of us given to this type of speculation. nor are we ufo enthusiasts in any way. i know from my experience with various aircraft that the only things that move like this did are helicopters but the speed at which it approached and the silence from it makes me think it was not a helicopter. neither of us drink or use drugs, neither of us are prone to hallucinations. there was nothing in the news today at all about it and i have not found any statements online from either witnesses or authorities. what

times and i could see it with binoculars most of the time expect when the cloud cover was too thick.  but it never changed position.  with binoculars it appeared to glow very bright white and had some sort of dark spot in the center.  it also appeared to have some sort of line or tether.  not sure what weather balloons look like or if they are capable of staying stationary in the atmosphere, but this definitely had something attached to it but it seemed under control, not just flapping about the object.  after 40 minutes, the object suddenly began to disintegrate and fall apart, with the larger pieces remaining very bright white and moving off slowly; there was a small area of very small particles, almost dust like, in the spot where the light had been and the larger pieces slowly fell away.  but within a few minutes all of the pieces and the dust like particles suddenly vanished, no trace whatsoever.  if this is some kind of remote meteorlogical experiment, it surely is a very strange one.  and it still doesn't explain the similar sighting from 9/26/2011 when another craft or object of multiple colors was headed for the white light and then ejected two smaller objects before disappearing into the clouds.  what on earth is going on?  is there a logical explanation for this?  there is a very good chance this thing will be out there again tomorrow evening around early

52 years and have studied the sky intensely as an amateur astronomer. i have located about 5 to 6 false stars - these eject orbs, the orbs go on a mission, then return to the larger craft. the larger craft move around quickly to gather the orbs upon returning. these larger objects are most likely motherships - ejecting orbs in the west, south, & east of my location 25 miles outside phila. they do stop moving when an aircraft nears, although these craft must be much higher in the atmosphere. i can see them with the naked eye due to practice. their quick movements to assist in the capture of orbs is easily noticeable with a little practice. i refer to them as false stars since they mimic stars to avoid detection. hope this helps.","distance":"Over One

sun prairie, wi (northern edge of town). we often did this to go star gazing and get away from some of the light pollution from madison. the time was around 9 pm and it was a clear night, with not a cloud in sight. it was fall, like i said, so it was cooler and we needed to wear jackets. we stopped on the shoulder of a road that ran north and south along the edge of a corn field (i think n or bird street). it was a great night because we could see so much - galaxy, satellites, planes, etc. we were looking at the sky and i turned to look south south/east and noticed something weird in the sky, about 60 degrees above the horizon. it was a bright white orb, that appeared star-like, but was much too large to be a star (roughly between a star and aspirin in size). since we live close to the truax madison airport and that area is the approach path for many planes, i first thought it was a plane or jet exhaust. what was odd about it, was that number one, it made no sound! it also had no blinking lights of any type, and seemed to give off a bright-white to almost blue-white unwavering glow that was just on the brink of twinkling like a star. it was circular in shape to my eyes, but so are most stars, so i couldn't get any definite shape of it. it is hard to guess the distance away and size of it since i could only see it as a larger than normal star like glow. however, that said, this had to be between 1-5 miles away and roughly 500 ft in the sky, based on how planes on approach look (size in the sky). when i spotted it, it appeared motionless for an instant, and then i noticed it was moving in a very slow, deliberate, straight path from right to left (maybe a distance of 1 to 2 actual miles?). it was moving for maybe a minute and eventually faded out of sight. again, no sound was heard during this whole event. during i didn't take my eyes off of it and didn't blink because i didn't want to lose it. i asked my wife, \"what the hell is that?\". when she looked she didn't know and watched it with me. she disregarded it as most likely a plane, but i didn't think so since i have seen many types of aircraft come in for landings and this was not typical. i thought for sure that i had seen something unidentified, but couldn't be positive, so i didn't bother reporting it. i decided to now just for integrity. felt intrigued afterward, and now that i think of that night, i don't remember any other aircraft in the sky during the event. the whole sighting was strange. also wanted to post because i have seen several other reports of near identical description from other parts of the country.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

it was around a 30 min drive so i was drving a little after 6 am i just passed southmoore high school on sante fe at the intersection of sante fe and sw 34th street i could see in the distnace to the south a bright light, i assumed was a plane landing because it was so bright and so low but as i got to w indian hills road i realized,i was still pretty sleepy, that there is no airport near by, the closest is will rogers i think in the opposite direction, and it hadnt moved in the 10 minutes i was watching it but it kinda look like it was like glowing or pulsing but not moving, i started driving toward it on indian hills road and i soon realized how low it was, but i couldnt really tell where it was i crossed a bridge over i-35 and since it still hadent moved i thought it was a helicopter so i was hoping i could see it better since it kept getting bigger as i got closer i got to the intersection of 24th street and realized its right along the road, i turned off my music and listend for helicopter sounds, all i heard was the engine of my truck, i got closer and soon realized this wasnt normal the one object now appered as 3 lights i think they were conected cuz the outside lights appered to have a curve to them like as if curving to the surface of th eobject i really dont know all i could see was three lights forming a line that i kept getting closer to i was so close i still didnt know what i was looking at but i was still calm for somereason, in hindsight i dont know i didnt freak out but i went down a hill then as soon as the hill curved back up i was directly underneath it i stoped pretty close to right underneath it i looked up my windshield and it was sort of the shape of a diamond but there were 4 outer lights and on each extior side of light the light like curved or had a boomerrang light attached to the light kind of like a bell but where the bell widen was just a thin curve attached to a ball of light, there was a light in the middle that was just round, i stared up at it for what felt like forever, it was right above the powerlines it really looked as if it was hoovering on them almost touching them, i heard no soundeds i just stared aimlessly up at this light not scared but just captivated and curious it felt like i had been there an hour but i looked at the clock and it had only been 10 mins so i decided that i should contniue on my way to school i drove past it it was still there but i turned onto 12th street and look behind me and it was no longer there it was completly gone i got extremely cold, it was very cold outside and my truck heater leaves alot to be desired and i realized the entire time i was underneath i wasnt cold at all , when i got to school i touched the roof of my truck and it was alot warmer then the hood of my truck. none of this bothered me unitl the next morning when i was extremly nervous to go down that road again but i did have done almost everyday and havent seen it again

noticed that when planes are in the area, it stops moving, but after they planes are gone it moves again.  this particular object seems to be returning nightly.  however, there are others.  some
