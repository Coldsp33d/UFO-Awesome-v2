maneuvering a half-mile or so from a black 'copter that seemed to have a turret-mount camera. these two aircraft had been executing an orbit of about 4 miles in diameter, with the chopper staying put while the plane flies around it. it seemed they were filming the plane, possibly for a movie or commercial. watching with my 15x70 binocs, the plane (heading north), appears to be a cessna with a wide body to accommodate skydivers, ascending about 3,500 feet from my position, and about 45 deg above the horizon. it banks 70 deg to port as it ascends. the plane may have been at about 3,000 feet, assuming that as a minimum vfr altitude. i'm certain the distance to myself was less than 5,000 feet. in the middle of this turn an object approx 300 ft ahead of the cessna aircraft, hovers then starts to pump up & down, so fast as to almost be a blur. through my optics it looks like a great flying soup can, silver and white, in an upright attitude. it appeared to be about 20 feet tall and maybe 10 feet across, assuming my distance estimates are accurate. the sight confuses me so much, that i take the binocs and put them on a similarly distant object (i believe it was a lamp pole down the street) which behaves as i would expect and does not pump up & down like a flying piston. when i look back to the \"soup can\" it is gone. the aircraft and helicopter leave the scene in seconds.\r\n\r\nthe weather conditions were \"severe clear\" with completely unobstructed visibility. it was mid day on the desert near edwards air force base. the nearest mountains were about ten miles away, the tehachapi's and the south end of the sierras and the panamint range. my location was 9-10 miles due south of jawbone canyon, 3 miles east of california city airport, where cessna's

make circle, zip off at acute angles and reconverge in the same area of the sky.  this occured every night until cloud cover began covering the sky labor day weekend.  the last night, we noticed at

support of operation desert shield/storm.\r\n\r\nit was dusk and i was walking back to the field site after dinner.  i was alone; everyone else was watching the super bowl game.  i noticed three orange-hued lights moving almost directly overhead; in the exact configuration as those depicted in the illinois photo.  there was absolutely no noise associated with the sighting.  as with the illinois photo, the area encompassed by the 3 lights was without any discernable features.  it appeared as though there was nothing at all between the 3 lights, but they all moved in concert - as if they were connected to a single source. \r\n\r\nthe size of the object was approximately the size of a fifty cent piece held at arms length.  again, as with the illinois sighting, it didn't appear to be a high altitude object.  the object was moving relatively slowly, covering the length of the object in approximately 1 second.\r\nit was moving in an easterly direction through the very clear sky, towards a single small cloud.\r\n\r\nthe sky, with the exception of the small cloud which was not much larger than the object, was perfectly clear, which made observation very easy.\r\n\r\nthe 3

my friend tired of watching it too but when he did look back about an hour later it was gone.\r\n\r\nthis second craft stopped at a point in the sky which created 2 triangle shaped constellations. in the first the craft was the left point, nearly parallel with the right point (a star), the third point (a star) at the bottom.\r\nin the second triangle the craft created the top point of a triangle.  it was positioned to the right and higher then ursa major, left of and lower then of camelopardalls, \r\n\r\nmy friend had a night vision scope (sorry i do not know the model but can get it).  the magnification isn���t great but it did slightly magnify the craft and it was not an exact circle.  at first there appeared to be a tail, like a tear drop but less pronounced, to the west of it.  a few minutes later it appeared more as a kidney shape but most of that shape was caused by the light that appeared to be emitted. the object was a slightly different color then the stars around it but being a night vision scope everything appears green tinted so exact color was hard to observe.  at one point it did appear slightly orange to the naked eye.\r\nagain, there was a glow around it like it was emitting light differently than the nearby stars. \r\n\r\na few weeks ago my daughter and i were watching the sky and it looked like a star just disappeared in the same area of sky, very possibly the exact location because i recall seeing the triangle.  we see so much strangeness that i didn���t pay much attention to it.  \r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":32125,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.7192928,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09272011-0002","longitude":-73.9960831,"occurred":1317015000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New York","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Teardrop,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1317118915000,"summary":"Non-flashing, light emmiting, star-like object hovered a long time forming triangles in the sky","tags":["triangle","flash","light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"New York, New York","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:33526"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"San Bernardino","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"In a plane coming into los angeles and it was the same height of the plane which was 1-2,000 feet.  it was just hovering stationary.  not big enough to have any travelers, i believe.  but just there.

size and brightness.  it did move from the southeast in a straight line to the northeast and then just stopped.  a few moments later, a smaller object also moving up from the southwest was heading directly for the larger white object.  this smaller one had all the colors and was flashing and seemed like it was changing shape.  then it ejected two small objects that moved slowly away from its parent object. those two small objects also had colored lights but not as bright.  clouds moved in and i could no longer see the colored lights but the whole time this was going on, the larger bright light was in the same position in the sky and did not move, nor change in its brightness.  then more clouds moved overhead and i could no longer see the white light.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

across the sky. the only way to describe the light is that it was similar to the burning embers remaining after detonating large firworks. not terribly bright, almost glowing. there was no noise -- no rotors, no engines, nothing.  orbs were moving somewhat slowly in formation toward the west, stretched across the sky.  again, it was strange because there was no noise as they passed overhead. sped home to show my son, but they were obscured by trees.  drove back to the original location, and while it couldn't have been more than 10 minutes, there were only two remaining in the sky.  they were high in the air, but the lights did not look like airplane lights.  watched as the last two passed overhead to the west.  i have tried to find out more about this fleet of orbs, but there was nothing reported in the local paper.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
