noticed a strange set of lights in a delta formation moving east to west very slowly strait ahead at about a 40 degree angle from the road. i knew right away that these objects were not conventional aircraft. the way that they moved and the light given off by these objects is almost unexplainable. i raced to a boat ramp a few hundred yards ahead of where i had first noticed the objects, i parked my car, and i ran to the best viewing position that i could acquire. the objects kept moving very slowly, almost hovering at times, without any sound whatsoever. i tried to take pictures and videos of the objects, but it seemed that although the lights seemed bright to my eyes, they were not registering at all on my i-pod touch camera. after a couple of tries to document the event with my i-pod, i realized that it was useless. i kept observing the formation of lights move across the sky with my naked eyes. after a couple of minutes, the object that lead the formation slowly disappeared. about 30 seconds to a minute after that, the light following the lead object slowly disappeared also. the rest of the objects kept their trajectory as a new object came from behind the formation slightly faster than the rest of them. it caught up with the original delta formation as it moved through the sky, then stopped (as the delta formation kept moving slowly,) hovered for a few seconds, it came back at a higher rate of speed and it seemed to lower its altitude by a few degrees until it settled straight ahead of my point of view. as the object hovered straight in my line of sight, i ran to the edge of the river to get the best view i could. thinking back on that action, now it feels like a futile attempt to get closer to an object that was very far away from me in the first place. nevertheless, i did it. the object hovered for about 30 seconds to a minute, then it followed its original path at a slightly higher rate of speed and joined it's fellow \"objects.\" after about another minute, they all disappeared almost at the same time..... that's the whole incident..... the whole experience, from the very first second that i noticed the formation of lights until they all disappeared only took about 10 minutes.......... this is strange to say.... but when the last bright \"object\" that came from behind the formation to catch up with \"them\" and then stopped and came back to hover in front of my line of sight for a few seconds..... i don't know?..... i felt like \"it\" knew that i was watching........... strange........ i hope that this helps even though it's only my experience.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown, N/A","duration":"00:09:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

park, we had been walking for aprox a half an hour, when i noticed a plane. i was watching the plane, and it's collision lights blinking, and was waiting to hear the sound of the jet engine, as i was following the plane across the sky, i noticed a huge flash. from my position it looked like it was just above the plane, who ever was in that plane must have seen it! as the plane kept on moving, i noticed the flash again in the very same spot, but this time it looked kind of orange and not as bright as the first flash. aprox 10-15 seconds i saw it flash again, still in the same spot in the sky. my wife and i could not see the object until it would flash,each flash was a different color and a different intensity it would flash aprox every 10-15 seconds and each time the color would change from white which was the brightest intensity, to a brownish , and a yellow orange. the brownish flash kind of looked flat. the yellow-orange was kind of blurry, and more round. the white flashes were at times the size of a golf ball.And extremely bright. my wife and i often go out and watch the sky and just about every night we see what look like stars moving across the sky,but this was a first to not see the object just the flashes of light and extremely bright we watched this object for a good 45 min until we  got back home and went in the house.This object stayed in the same spot the whole

bright yellow light just past, and over\r\nst. lukes hospitol to the east. it had flashing lights that resembled\r\ntrack lights on a plane, but were more speratic and appeared to be\r\nrunning side to side, as if down the side of a vessel. after making\r\nits furthest approach towards st. lukes, it climbs in altitude\r\nslightly and then starts traveling in the opposite directions. shortly\r\nafter this, i witnessed another  yellow light slowly scanning the\r\nneighborhoods just to the west and making sudden stops and jerking\r\nmotions. after this disappears behind some houses, i see an even\r\nbrighter white light coming from the downtown area heading west\r\ntowards what now seems to be another yellow light in the west where\r\nthe last one had originated. as the white light passes in front of me,\r\nand only about 10 city blocks away, and about 200 - 300m in the sky,\r\nit turns slightly towards my direction while still flying towards the\r\nother object in the sky. i can now see that it is very clearly two\r\nobjects flying side by side at a very fast pace. as they get within a\r\nmile of the other object, it flashes and the two objects make an \"s\"\r\nshaped retreat vertically and away from the object, and then head back\r\neast before disappearing. as a \"ufo enthusiast\", i decided it was time\r\nto take a walk.\r\n i made it to about where i saw the light scanning to the west and\r\ndidn't see anything. as i turned back to walk home, i saw another\r\nlight downtown that looked similar to the one i saw next to st. lukes,\r\nand then disappeared behind some buildings. i walked downtown and went\r\nto the top of a eight floor parking garage to get a higher vantage\r\npoint. from there i saw another set of lights that were so close to\r\neach other, they looked like they could have been one object. this was\r\njust south of the parking.. thinking back on it, they seemed to have\r\njust come out of a parking lot somewhere off 9th st a few blocks away.\r\nunlike the others that disappeared into the night sky, they\r\ndisappeared bellow the horizon just before the train depot. seconds\r\nlater, what i thought was a star for the last several minutes banked\r\nwest before disappearing. moments later i saw two lights flying very\r\nrapidly about 100 m away from each other from east to west. the front\r\n\"vessel\" seemed to have a cylindrical blue light standing vertically\r\non it, but i couldn't make out the actual shape. the rear light was\r\njust like the bright yellow lights i had seen before. the rear light,\r\nas they approached the train depot, sped up towards the other one\r\nwhile the other one looped entirely around the depot from front to\r\nback. the yellow light followed and they both disappeared somewhere\r\nbehind it. i walked up there and found nothing.\r\n this all happened between 9pm and 11pm.","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1 Mile,
