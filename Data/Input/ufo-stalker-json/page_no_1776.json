a trip to the store when seeing a bright orb like or sphere like light fly nearly overhead in a manner of about 2 seconds from horizon to horizon, traveling slightly more south to north than i.  it may have had a slight \"egg\" shape, although i believe that effect was just the speed of travel visually \"stretching\" whatever it was i witnessed.  the first thing that got my attention was the speed, size and brightness.  i don't believe i thought of anything other than a feeling of curiosity, my instinct was to follow but there was no chance.  the night had been foggy/hazy in early evening. by 9:33pm visibility had increased to one of the clearest views of the milky way ever seen from this area... very rare within itself.  we have an airport about 6 miles due south, my first thought was the rotational beacon shining on an otherwise transparent fog bank but this was far too intense and had zero curvature to it's path.  the closest metaphorical description would be the clarity, brightness and contrast of a full moon, without crater contrast within, and a slightly more \"yellow\" hue(red shift?), using the \"at arms length size comparison\"(finger, knuckle, fist,etc.).  with little to no way to judge distance and the speed at which the object traveled, it could have been at tree top elevation up to a couple 1000ft. or so.  intuition tells me it's in the range of 100-1000ft elevation, otherwise speeds would be absolutely unprecedented for anything with significant mass.  with several hundred hours observing the night sky, i have ruled out nearly every natural phenomenon from meteorite to known man made craft. there has been an influx of military presence in the sky the past week or so, but there should have been a sonic boom, which is unlawful here without direct order, yet there was none.  i have witnessed night time and day time supersonic flight at multiple elevations, this was much, much faster in my opinion and had no exterior lighting other than the item itself which appeared to be \"made of light\".","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

the fire, past my tent and found a nice place to urinate before i went back to join the crowd by the fire.  i was facing downriver from our location looking down the river valley.  as i stood there relieving myself, i noticed a bright light, much larger than a star and considerably brighter begin descending from the sky straight down into the river valley.  it dropped steadily lower until it was below the mountain ridge line towering over the river valley and was now silhouetted with the river valley cliffs above it.  it was then i was certain i was looking at a possible ufo.  at this juncture, i hollered at my trail companions and they all came out to where i was standing to observe the phenomena.  we all watched the craft noiselessly descend to treetop level, jink back and forth a few times, then turn on a light on the bottom of the object's hull which was aimed below the craft into the trees below.  presently, the object appeared to hover and then settled down below the treeline at which point we lost visual sight of the object.  entire incident from the moment of initial observation to conclusion was maybe 15-20 minutes in elapsed time.  \r\n\r\nwe tried to videotape the craft and only got a single clear view of the object on the video footage --the point where the craft put the light beam down into the forest.  everyone  including the cameraman was pretty agitated and the camera moves around a goodly bit which is disruptive of the overall view of the ufo.  however, after carefully examining the film footage at length, i could easily make out a known mountain ridge's appearance directly behind the object.  i was then able to guesstimate the distance from our vantage point to the object as approximately 1 1/2 miles distance downriver from our campsite.

pulled off for about 5 minutes at the entrance ramp to hwy 51 off of rainbow run rd.  from that vantage point after about the first 2 minutes about 5 orange orbs reappeared. they too disappeared after about 1 minute.  again, after about another minute 2 more orange orbs reappeared for a third time.  these two orbs were present for about 1 minute.  they seemed to join into one light as they \"fly\" away.  then they disappeared, never to reappear.  i called the pittsburgh international airport to see what they had on radar, and they reported that the supervisor had nothing and no other reports.  i also contacted the pittsburgh post gazette to report the story.  they too had no other reports. to sum this up, just saw many (40+) orange orbs that appeared to hover until we got as close as you

number of jet contrails overhead so i decided to take a few photos of the jet just to see if i could identify it. \r\n i downloaded the phtograpghs to my computer and when i opened the images i could see a very small object out in front and above the jet. there was also a evry tiny dot behind and above the jet.\r\n when you zoom in on the photo you can clearly see a huge disc shaped object above and in front of the jet and you also will se a smaller disc shaped object flying on an angle behind and above the jet, almost in line with the disc out front. \r\n i was totally shocked and surprised to see these two objects in the photogragh and all my coworkers were just as surprised as i was. what are these discs doing here? who is piloting these objects and why are they flying along withan unmarked jet spewing contrails or chemtrails?\r\n i went outside again about a half hour later to phtograph another one of these jets and to my amazement there is an unidentified object behind and above that jet as well. it's a different shape almost looks wedge or arrow shaped but about the same size as the jet in the photo.\r\n don't know what's going on here but it is pretty curious! these jet pilots had to have known these objects were there, especially the first one as the disc out front and above is as big if not bigger than the jet itself! \r\n i get the distinct feeling that we are being lied to and not in any small way either! the government knows a heck of a lot more than they are saying! these objects seem to me to be working in unison with these jets. and justr what exactly is in those contrails? there had to have been at least tywenty ot more of these flights over our skies here yesterday. all at about the same altitude but on different flight paths and all spewing these large contrails. it seems to be happening on pretty much a regular daily basis lately. i will definitely be taking more photos of these jets just to see how common this phenomenon of other unidentified objects along with them is! \r\n  i could not see the objects with my bare eyes and it was not untill i downloaded the images to my computer that i could see the objects. i have not edited the photos in any way, they are just as they came from my camera. i wish i had a good zoom lens for the camera but unfortunately i can't afford one at the moment. i was using my cannon eos rebel xsi camera with an 18-55mm lens zoomed in as far as possible and using the image stabilizer mode on automatic camera settings.\r\n i have attached the two photographs, unedited and also a third with the two objects circled ( a copy of the first photo) you may not see the objects very well at first as the jet and the objects were flying at a very high altitude and quite a distance from where i was standing, but just blow the photos up a small amount and it becomes quite apparent. when you really zoom in on the front disc in the first photo you can clearly see that it is a disc shape and has shadow on the bottom and is sunlit on the top. and you can also see the back disc is lit from the sun on the front edge while the back is in shadow. it is on it's side following behind and above the jet. you can also see that these jets seem to have no external markings of any kind. none on the fuselage and none on the tail or the wings that i can see. just plain white jets spewing plain white contrails. but it's these discs that truly have me wondering!","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Straight-line

west just south of bozeman, as i was observing the plane i noticed what i thought was a typical satellite flying across the sky from south to north and west of bozeman when suddenly it stopped for a moment and then changed direction from west to east. this object/light appeared to be in space or very far away soon after it changed direction i lost sight of it. at almost the same moment that i lost sight of the small satellite like object i noticed a very large bright star like object moving from the s. west to the n. east coming straight towards me. this thing was very large and silent, the lights did not flash and i could not notice any kind of strobe as i was trying to identify it as a possible giant plane. the object flew right over my head and continued towards the n. east and never changed direction, it moved at a very steady speed, it appeared to be pretty high in the sky but, it was lower then some of the clouds i was expecting to lose sight of it as it approached some clouds but, it was lower then them and i continued to watch it until it was just to far away to see. when the object was very far away but, still barley visible a jet did take off west to east from gallatin field. now for the kicker! this morning 9/24/11 at exactly the same time 6:20 am my wife observed an object very similar to what i saw yesterday only she saw it making zig zags and changing altitude right over bozeman she observed this for several minutes.She came to wake me and when we rushed out to look it was gone. i did not have my phone on me when i made my observation therefor i have no pics or video.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional
