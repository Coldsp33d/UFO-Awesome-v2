rested on my truck to avoid movement, it appeared to be a bright white light, and on either side of it were four smaller objects that also appeared to be stationary lined up at a 5 degree angle from the horizontal. they appeared to be lit up by the object. i could not see any other stars in the vicinity of the object. the object appeared to be stationary. i observed the object for an additional half hour but it did not appear to move. during this same time frame, i watched several planes flying either east or west and north and south along which appeared to be flying at a much lower altitude than the object, and they had the typical blinking lights. the sky was moonless, and we do not have street lights on our block, so the area is dark and bright lights in the sky are noticeable, and since we are in the flight path between hill air force base and the air force base at las vegas i am used to seeing routine aircraft flights at night. this object stood out because of its brightness in the dark sky. the smaller objects on either side were not visible with the naked eye, but only through the binoculars.\r\nat 1050 hours i checked the location of the object and it appeared to be higher above the horizon than earlier. it still has the smaller lights on either side of it. it is most likely some object in

observed some flares flying in the air directly over my house, which is approximately three hundred meters down the road.  wright patterson afb is near my house but they never drop flares in dayton, ohio so i immediately parked and stepped out of my car to investigate further.\r\n\r\n     i witnessed five lights about 40 degrees off the horizon flying from south to north.  the lights were about the size of a baby aspirin and were gold/yellow in appearance.  sort of like a dim fire.  the lights were flying in a formation unknown to me.  one was in front, the next three followed approximately 10 arc degrees behind the first light in a diagonal, top left to bottom right.  the fifth light followed approx. 10 arc degrees from the fourth light but was on the same plane as the first light.\r\n\r\n     i sat back in my car and turned the ignition off so i could listen for their sound.  they made no sound.  another man was standing out front of a verizon store and also witnessed what i did.  as those five flew to the north and appeared to dim out of sight into a cloud the man and i talked.  i told him i was in the army and never saw anything like that.  he replied he had spent twenty years in the air force and had never witnessed lights like those.  he went back in the store and i went back to my car.  i picked up the phone and called my wife just down the street. \r\n\r\n     just as she answered i witnessed the sixth light appear over the treeline.  i told her to get outside and look up.  her first words were \"oh my god, it\"s round!\".  i poked my head in the verizon store and told the man inside who was describing it to his family there was another one.  he came back out in time to watch it from about half way through its visible flight path until it disappeared as the first five did.  it just dimmed into a distant cloud.  i asked the other witness about how far off the ground he would've guessed they were and he replied no more than 5,000 feet.  \r\n\r\n     i have seen military flares, i have seen jets, and i have seen airplanes.  this was not any of those.  i even considered parts of that satellite that was due to burn in tonight but that was coming in at a 55 degree angle or something and this was moving too slow to be falling from space. \r\n\r\n     i went home and asked my wife what she saw and she described a round light almost directly above her.  she said when it entered a cloud she saw a distinct round shape around the light as if the light was just the center of a much larger round object.\r\n\r\n     i called the centerville police dept. to see if anyone else had called anything in.  the dispatcher replied no.  i described to her exactly what i saw and she said she actually witnessed something very similar to that description about 15 miles away in farmersville, oh on her way into work.  she said she would log it in and we ended our conversation.\r\n\r\n     i then contacted wright patterson afb base operations desk and asked if they had fired any flares.  he replied no foreseeing where i was going.  i described to him what i had witnessed and said  hate to be that guy, but there was definitely something in centerville.  he said \"no man, we haven't had anything out in that area.\"  thus ended our conversation.  \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

indiana). it was a clear night with many stars when i happened to look up and see an orange \"fireball\" flying overhead. i had initially just glanced up at the stars, but the object quickly got my attention. i quickly pointed it out to the rest of the group and we all observed it making it's way across the sky above us.  it seemed to move in a straight path, was completely silent, and showed no trace of a \"tail\" or flames around it directly.  it was a solid, glowing orange. i grabbed my camera to take some pics and got one.  however, the detail in the photo is not good, but the \"true\" color comes thru nicely.  we all watched the object as it moved towards the west (it traveled east to west as best as i can tell, as it was already almost directly over us when i noticed it).  hard to tell what size/distance it was...But definitely large....And definitely obvious to the naked eye.  \r\n\r\na short time later, maybe 20 mins or so, we saw it again (or one just like it).  same description as before.  i once again pointed it out and everyone there observed it.  i did snap a couple more pics, but once again, little detail but great color. when i pointed the object out initially, all of us started speculating what it could possibly be...A meteor? satellite? i came inside to check the news online to see if there was anything mentioned about a meteor shower or observable satellite in our area, but could find nothing. we live in an area about 100 miles southeast of chicago, so we see a fair amount of air traffic...Definitely not any of that, tho.  i did observe a plane very shortly after one of the objects went by (can't remember which one) that seemed lower and with a different lighting pattern than the usual planes we see in our night skies.  i think that was a plane, just a different type than we see normally. \r\n\r\nwe are all still baffled and no one there could determine what it was for certain...But none of us had ever seen anything like it before (age range of witnesses were 13-71).  it caused some excitement for us all, but especially for me because the curiousity about what it was just wouldn't go away.  i mentioned it on my facebook status and only one other friend said she had seen something in the sky that night as well that matched my description while she was driving back from purdue university to her home in goshen, in. she wanted to know what it was as well.  the object, and the second one, eventually faded from our view as it travelled beyond our line of sight heading in a westward direction. \r\n\r\nwould really like to find out if there is an official explanation for what we saw because whatever it was it was stunning to see. kept waiting all week to hear about it on the news or from other people that might have seen the object(s), but nothing has ever been mentioned...If you know what it is, please let me know.

bring my ipad 2 with me on my next visit to my parent's house for dinner to use the astronomy apps on it to determine the identity of the object if it was a star or not. i also planned to take any pictures if possible. after dinner and awhile later when i was leaving, i almost forgot to look up for the light while leaving down the driveway when i saw it already high in the sky brighter than any star.\r\n\r\ni felt anxious at the time to get my ipad out as quickly as possible in case the object disappeared. i had no doubts what i was seeing was something out of the ordinary because i do a lot of stargazing when i find the time most of my life. especially since there had not been any sightings in the area since 93-94.\r\n\r\ni backed my car up the driveway and called my dad to come outside to see it. my mom and sister also saw it but were too nervous to stay outside so they went back inside while my dad and i took pictures and watched the object move slowly across the sky. sometimes the object would seem to come closer or further away judging by the existing landscape for reference points. the whole time it continuously blinked a series of colors extremely brightly, almost seeming to rotate but hard to determine at such a distance. unfortunately the colors of the lights did not come through on the photos i took. i took about a dozen pics but am sending only the least blurry of the bunch since i had no tripod and the second photo is an inverted color version. \r\n\r\nduring the observation there was plenty of other planes flying high and low to compare the object to also and it was far larger and brighter than them. there was even a airforce c-130 cargo plane flying solo and low that passed through the area. usually they fly in pairs at least, but rarely if ever solo. while watching the object, we could faintly make out small orbs flying to and from the larger object but moving too fast and small to pick up on the camera. i also was not able to use the built-in video recorder on the ipad or iphone because it had no zoom like the camera does and there was a street light pole nearby causing glare.\r\n\r\nwe kept expecting the object to do something other than to move slowly about, but it never went out of view and i was pressed for time to head home so i had to leave. i have also heard from my mother since then that when fbi agents were interviewing her yesterday about a friend of mine who had applied to work for them, they asked her if she had happened to see the object in the eastern sky as i had described. my mom admitted seeing it and the agent agreed with her saying he felt it not to be a planet or known object.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

aproximadamente 15 anos ( sera chamada de \"b\") e um outro amigo deles que eu tambem vim a conhecer naquela noite ( o chamarei de \"c\").\r\nnoite de carnaval em todo o pais, e nos decidimos ir a praia que fica a uns 300 metros da casa do \"ab\", fomos de carro, aonde paramos a apenas alguns metros da agua, por sinal nessa praia a areia e bem dura entao eh normal pessoas dirigirem usando a areia da praia, e tambem nao exite praticamente ondas, voce pode andar na agua por algumas centenas de metros e o nivel daqua nao vai passar da tua coxa ou cintura.\r\ngostaria de poder deixar as

iria para a agua. continuamos ali, alguns minutos se passaram, nossa amiga estava ha uns 30 metros de distancia, quando derepente uma luz toa forte, saindo de baixo d���gua iluminou todo o morro que fica ha nossa esquerda. a luz estava muito proximo a garota, foi quando comecamos a gritar: \r\n- sai da agua, sai sai, corre.\r\no morro que eu me refiro, deve ter uns cincoenta metros de altura, e foi praticamente todo iluminado por aquela luz branca e extremamente forte.\r\nquando \"a\" voltou, perguntou para nos o que houve?! porque de onde estava nao conseguiu ver absolutamente nada, mas todos as outras pessoas viram a mesma intensa luz branca.\r\nficamos nos questionando por alguns momentos, quando uma outra luz mas agora no ceu e do lado oposto do nosso ponto de vista apareceu.\r\nano me lembro ao certo a ordem e nem mesmo as cores. se eu nao me engano uma era de cor branca e a outra acho que meio amarelada. \r\nbom como estava dizendo, uma apareceu no ceu, como que abaixo de uma nuvem, sumiu, depois apareceu outra luz mas em cima da nuvem, e ficaram assim por alguns momentos, e nos seis nos questionando que aquilo la poderia ser.\r\nficamos por la ate nao vermos mais nada, o que tambem nao durou muito tempo , acredito que tudo nao passou de uns dez minutos tudo junto.\r\npode paracer bobeira mas essa e a primeira vez que escrevo sobre o assunto, e como

vicinity.\r\n\r\nat first i thought it was a flag or something, but soon realized there was no flag  pole and from frame to frame it's shape stays regular.\r\n\r\ni'm hoping an expert in this type of thing can help me to rule out any other possible explanations for what they think this might be.\r\n\r\nplease contact me a.S.A.P. as i am curious to get another opinion, especially an expert one.\r\n\r\nthe three images i have supplied are lower resolution details of the actual four images that were taken as described above.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

orange sherbet.) the lights were behind a group of clouds. i kept looking up to see if anything was falling, ascending, traveling left or right and i seen nothing. the lights didn't go anywhere. the flshing reminded me of lightning, but the flashes weren't brigh enough to be lightning as it only lit up a small area of the sky behind the clouds, not the entire sky like lighning would. \r\n\r\ni
