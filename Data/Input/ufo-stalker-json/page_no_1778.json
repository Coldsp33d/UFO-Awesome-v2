the world visitors. instead they were four f-16's doing a flyover from the buckley air national guard for the opening monday night football game of the denver broncos shortly after 8 pm. there was 7000 feet cloud coverage and the f-16's were flying formation with their navigation lights on, which may have given the illusion of bright white yellow orbs. i wish this was a true ufo sighting, but i

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I previously sent a report in on my experience, but have had second thoughts about revealing more of my encounter.  as i previously reported, the ufo was shaped like a mercedes benz emblem, three spokes 5-6 ft wide, 25-30 ft long, each spoke. the center was 12-15 ft. across and round, where the spokes met. when i first sighted the ufo, it was just above the horizon across the valley, the spokes were lit a beautiful blue, with white light ends on the last 5 or 6 ft of each spoke.  the center was a large white round light almost the entire center, in fact i could not make out the center outside edges because of the light, even when up close. as i drove toward the ufo, it descended down into the valley and toward me.  the blue lit spokes went out, leaving one small blue light in the center of each spoke near the end white light on each spoke. the spokes were a dull black where they were no longer blue lit.  the white spoke end lights ( barrel like in shape, encompassing the whole spoke end ) began to pulse in changing 2-1, 2-1 several times, in different spoke combinations, and then the center light pulsed brighter that ne  spoke lights one time,while the craft hovered silently less than 100 ft above and off to my front, right side. it was a full moon, no clouds, top down on car.  after a short period, the ufo drifted over my car and then i heard my first sound. the sound was very directional, first i heard a hushed jet engine sound, then a loud crackling / popping sound. very much like static electricity, only very loud, it drowned out the turbine sound i heard as it started across me. as soon as it passed directly over the sound went off. not on/off like a switch, but like quickly turning the volume up and down with a dial. the craft slowly drifted up and barely over the tree tops on the left side of the road and out of my sight. i immediately turned my car around and drove back out into the valley to see if i could spot it again, with out success. a few minutes later across the valley, side i just came from, there was a craft with a spotlight on heading down the ridge the same direction the ufo was last headed, and i could not hear any sound from it as i sat and listened. i failed to mention on my first report that my face and head got warm, or flushed, as the ufo directed the static sound at me, but it went away in a couple of seconds and i just thought it was me getting excited as the static sound engulfing me did startle and concern me at the time. more importantly, after i filed my first report here, i began to feel that a message about our welfare was given to me from that encounter, messages concerning the welfare of our civilization. i have tried to share this with several government and news agencies, and no one is interested in what i have to share. whenever i think of giving up on getting this message out to the public, i get a feeling of despair that is almost overwhelming. the message that i feel i was given is also very clear in my head, and almost overwhelming at times. i fear that i cannot be adamant and clear enough to do the message justice. i have taken and passed a polygraph test, scoring <.01 deception, the best score you can get on a polygraph. i am willing to take more polygraph test if necessary, i will even bet thousands of dollars if anyone is willing to call me out on my encounter. i have been trying to share this for over a year now, and no one in authority is interested.  the messages were about social evolution and pollution worldwide. the need to rid ourselves of tyrants, religious dictators, and corporate owned governments ( basically the whole world needs to change the corrupt ways the governments are run ) we also need to close all nuclear power plants, and go with renewable energy. on renewable energy i got a feeling of using the earths magnetic fields, or electro-magnetic

we see these at least 2-4 times each week, so it���s not really that big of a deal at this point (i���ve already put a report in on the mufon site). however, this orb was a little different.\r\n\r\ntuesday night, on our way home (we were driving west), we saw a large orange orb in the twilight sky, and right as we lost it behind some trees, it flashed rapidly between red and white, then between red and orange. we watched the orb move farther south, over a period of about 40 minutes. by the time we got home at about 9pm, the orb was pretty far away and looked like a faint star that was moving slowly south west.\r\n\r\nwe thought it could be one of the orange orbs we see all the time, but couldn���t say for certain, because the orb didn���t do anything that couldn���t be attributed to some type of aircraft.\r\n\r\ntonight (sept. 21, at approximately 10pm), we were driving home from karate (heading east), and we saw a very bright orange light in the southern part of the sky. it didn���t seem to be moving and looked very far away, so we figured it had to be a star or something. my husband tried to find it with google sky on his smart phone, but couldn���t. however, the object didn���t seem to be moving, and it was in the same spot earlier in the week, so we decided it was probably just a star.\r\n\r\nso, about a mile away from home, (about 40 minutes later), my nephew was like, ���what���s that in the sky?��� we started talking about the object again, and i noted how it had moved up in the south-west part of the sky, and was now higher on the horizon. just then, my husband looked up, and the orb flashed white for a split-second, then vanished. \r\n\r\nwe tried to guess how far away it was, but considering that we don���t know how big it was, it���s hard to say. if i had to guess, i���d say it was about 50 miles south, maybe about 20 miles or so, west of detroit. but that���s just a guess.\r\n\r\nmy husband, who normally writes off all orange orbs that aren���t right above him, as airplanes with their landing lights on, flying in on approach, could not attribute this to any aircraft.\r\n\r\nseriously, we see these things so much now, that after the object vanished, we just sort of shrugged, then went about our business. also, the mufon form to report a sighting is extremely long and detailed. if i had to fill this thing out every time i saw a ufo, i'd probably freak out. as it stands, this is only my second report, and we've been seeing these things regularly since july.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

my boyfriend was on the couch next to my recliner and he was asleep also.  aproximately 3 a.M. i awoke to a horrific jabbing pain im my mid-lower back right on my spinal column. upon awakening i can vividly remember sitting up and grabbing my back at the same time..As i turned to sit all the way up i saw a \"large human like figure\" turn away from me and proceeded to walk toward my front door with some sort of very large clear syringe he placed on his right hip like a gun would be placed for carrying purposes.  i remember trying to scream out and pointed at the same time but \"nothing\" would come out of my mouth no matter how hard i attempted to shout i could not produce even a whisper.  it was as if he possessed some sort of immortal power over my actions until he was out of my sight.  he never once turned around where i could see his face but he was all \"black\" and \"soldier like in his walk...Like on a mission he needed to complete?\"...\"very muscular and strong in appearance\".  i remember immediately grabbing my arms and saying to myself, \"oh my god...I am not dreaming...This really did happen and this alien creature just inserted something into my back...Or took something out.\"...I had no further pain from that episode and could not bring myself to even tell my boyfriend about it for aproximately 6 months thinking my family would think i was insane..\r\none of the wierdest things about the situation was that both my dogs never even budged....Nor did my boyfriend wake up during the incident...I was in total disbelief.  not scared for some odd reason...Maybe because he never showed his face...I dont know. however, to this day...I don't know if he possibly abducted me during the night and had just finished bringing me back consciously by inserting some sort of medication to awaken me or not.   i \"do know\" for a fact that he had just finished using that large syringe on me because i watched his motions intently and he was walking away and at the same time placing that syringe to his hip \"holster\".  the last thing i saw was him walking towards the front door but right before he got to it he veered to the airconditioning vent as if he had come from \"it\". possibly from underground i wondered?  i then faded out for aprox. 30 minutes and awoke with a very clear vivid rememberance of this event.  i never believed or even thought something like this could be true but i now know they are out there and in our homes at their own leisure!!  they are \"quiet\", \"meticulous\", \"strong\", \"unafraid\", and i think \"curious\" in nature.  they seem to be in a \"time zone\" that only they are familiar with and seem to have that mastered so well as to quietly appear as they \"need or want to\" then disappear without a trace.  things are still happening here in gulf breeze and now in my new residence as \"glowing type\" foot prints are appearing continually everywhere on my carpet during the night!!  i am not a story teller and would love to take a polygraph so badly..People believe me...I do not know if there has been some sort of government cover up about this ufo issue but why would we have full grown aliens walking around right now in our homes of all places???  they had to grow to get that big so there has to be many many more of them...Right?  omg! i do not know why \"i\" am being targeted as an \"experiment\" to \"him\" or \"them\" but it is not ending for me...I really am not scared because i have never lost faith in my god above..He has his hand on me...But i really really need some help on this other issue...If there is some sort of alien specialist out there feel free to call...A.M. preferably...And only serious inquiries...I am not a gossipist or yapper....And would not be writing this if it were not true...But heed my words now...We are being watched and experimented on...I just dont know why or what they want...Be safe and please believe this is no joke folks..I now

sky.  then possibly around 7:30 pm, i saw what could be termed as a meteorite falling at close proximity. that meteorite was a standard size meteorite falling, but the color was a green tail. it lasted less than a few seconds. the angle of that meteorite was not at a typical angle but horizontal heading south.\r\n  then about 8:00 pm, i observed a pure orange light that was solid round about the size of a pea if it was held away from me at arms length.  it was located slightly se in direction at a distant what appeared to be less than a mile at a very low altitude near the horizon.  i had never observed in the past an orange light like this, but i was thinking that it may be coming from a jet heading my way. it didn't appeared to be flickering but just a solid orange light. the light just seemed more or less to be just hovering in the sky from my perspective.  regardless to if it was jet, i decided to take some pictures of it. the first sighting of it lasted about 14 seconds.  about a minute and 30 seconds earlier, there was a plane near the area flying bizarre: it looked like it was just circling this one particular area before finally heading off to the north. \r\n  shortly later after the first sighting, some of my family members came outside too. i was revealing to my mother what i just observed and i was beginning to show her the pictures i took when my brother yells out, \"there's an orange light!\"  i quickly aimed the camera and took some pictures.  i didn't tell my brother about the orange light, yet he spotted it for himself. that orange light briefly flashed on for a second or two, then simply stopped emitting light like somebody turned the lights out. it also was not in the same location i observed the first sighting for it was now directly due south.  then i noticed a very dimmed pin-point white light which was seen for a brief moment like a quick flash near its location; then another flash at a different location like upwards, then a flash downwards, move to left flash, move to right flash of light. then after the flash of white light, another orange ball of light lasting maybe 1 to 3 seconds.  i had my camera set at iso of 1600 with shutter speed of 1/30 second.  while watching for the orange lights, above our heads was another white light more meteorite that quickly went by in a second with tail at a 45 degree.  then shortly after that, another orange light sighting now located sw.   then few moments later, it was sighted directly south, then se.  it appeared to me that whatever it may be, it was moving at an astonishing rate almost like the orange light was instantaneously moving back-and-fourth and around which briefly emitted an orange light. this was clearly no airplane lights.  the general sighting of the orange light last about four minutes.\r\nthen about 30 minutes later, i observed a white light that flashed lights in a regular pattern while it moved horizontally across the sky. when it went behind a tree, i quickly walk out into the yard; however, it was not located again.  but briefly after that sighting, that orange light was sighted again directly south. which was also the last sighting of the orange light. before i left for home, i noticed an extremely bright light directly east.  possibly a star or planet, but extremely bright. i took a couple of pictures of that. it didn't seem to twinkle. a total of 4 people observed the orange light. no clouds. no wind.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

satelite.\" we watched the object get extremely brighter,(brighter than the north star),and then disappear. i asked my wife if she just saw what i did and thats when she told me about it doing the same thing though going the other direction. a few, (maybe 3?), minutes later we both see what appeared to be a boomerang or cheveron shaped object, but it looked invisible or cloaked,(if your a trekky). we could see the stars behind it but we also were able to see the shape. it flew off, out of our view, very quickly, but we were able to watch it until it was distance that allowed it to leave eye sight versus just disappearing as it had just minutes before, hard to explain. it reminded me of star trek when a ship is cloaked. the whole thing lasted for around 5 minutes. after words we couldn't believe it, but it was a shared experience, so we agreed it has some validity. i'm a 19y air force veteran who works on aircraft and could not explain what we had just
