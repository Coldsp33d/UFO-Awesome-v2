someone was watching me from the sky. as i looked up into the night sky, i saw this brilliant white, yet very specific, light shining not too high in the sky. as we road for several minutes, it seemed to be either emitting more intense light or descending closer, or maybe even growing in size. there was a jet headed parallel to it, going north west, bit then hurriedly changed its course, abruptly flying west, seemingly getting as far as possible from the object. as the jet did this, the light didn't fly away, but appeared to vanish in an instant, sort of a vacuum type vanishing. throughout all of this, my girlfriend refused to look, which i thought was odd, since i didn't tell her what it was that i wanted her to witness. then it was over.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

2011...And while driving south at the beginning of the parkway (135)of nassau county, long island, new york from the ramp to the most of the ride, i was able to perceive as a planet like mars the size of a dime perhaps...Bigger than the other surrounding planets and stars...I thought that mars had become larger and felt surprised that mars looked bigger since i was traveling where there are little lights of electricity and little trees (the parkway is like a big bridge...) so i as i continued driving south, the driving was easily a straight line for approximately 10 minutes (or so). since the driving was manageable i was able to see more than once at my left ((north/)east of the sky of long island how the steady dome of a planet like figure (or the north of a semi circle) shined with a dim...But still noticeable light with a some what white/light greenish color and with a three tips at the south of the object...(that is how i thought it was a plane coming towards you) but there was no movement, noise or intermittent lights...I also thought it may have been a satellite...But there was no blinking lights, nor was it in motion, nor was it small enough...\r\nas i drove i figure it may have looked like a science fiction film or cartoon (perhaps dragon ball z..) where planets are noticeable at the naked eye with partiality...It shone as if it would have been an electric plant, since the light was so focused and it did not diffuse...It was concentrated...Fixed.\r\ni drove for ten minutes or so and as the road steered away from the south into the south west into southern state parkway...I noticed that as i drove away from its view i noticed that a small thin cloud heading north passed at the south of the view of the strange object/light...It was heading really fast as i was traveling south (opposite direction).\r\none of my thoughts was that it was either a new planet (big one) or a new star or a comet (since i personally thought it could not be a plane or satellite)...Since i do not \"believe in extraterrestrial intelligent life\" i thought it may have been a comet really far away that some have told me would be visible in october....But i think it was too early...So then i also thought would be a light from land of nyc...But the light was too east of the nyc that it probably would have been over the atlantic or even outside of the atmosphere or further...Not further than the moon. i figured it would not be a comet since at a driving distance of 8 minutes or so it was a bit to the north of me...While i still perceived it to be steady...Meaning it was close to the earth's surface....Anyways...That is what i saw...It was big enough to catch my attention and was visible long enough from me to see it more than once and wonder if there were other people who would see it...It is something i will never forget and conclude that it was either a blast of gas at great distance that would make it cold enough to stay steady and reflect a great light to last for so long or it would be something that would need further explanation by nasa...The us government or by cold science....I finished seeing it at about 10:05 pm. and wonder if i would see from home....Unfortunately i was not able to because of too many trees in my area and i had to get up early for work and was hungry. i told my family...And the coincidence of the earthquakes in guatemala raised my eyebrows as well as the reporting of similar lights at the south of usa and even one reported in another website, which referred me here.\r\n\r\np.S. i am color

college no less.  over the years, i have observed a number of times what appears to be ball lightning and an excessive number of meteorite impacts within this county and in a particular area just south of millbrook, al.  this area also contains a large meteorite impact crater.  it is miles wide.  i live on one of its hills (300 feet) that was created in the impact.  it was created i believe 80 million years ago.\r\n(url moved to fi box) cms 09/20/11 09:46 cst flg\r\nwe get meteor explosions here every few years and see one or more make it to the ground probably as frequently as every year.  i need to note that while this area is somewhat rural, there is a lot of light pollution.  you cannot see the galaxy from here, for example, but you can see the major stars quite well.  so this is an urban and suburban area for most of the eastern i-85 area to georgia.\r\n\r\nthe report:\r\nseveral times over the years and again this year, i have seen what appears to be a small, maybe sub-car sized object, a sphere, come darting in, hovering for a moment, lighting up a spot on the ground, then flying off in the general, but not exact same direction that it had come from.  it is orange in color and lit up like the whole thing is just a little light.  its luminosity is pale, not bright.  they only appear at night.  one night this year, i cannot remember exactly when and i think i reported it to another ufo site, i saw it again.  it was off in the distance as i was driving home from work late, say 12:30am.  it was bright enough to distinguish at several miles distance and it appeared to be coming closer. thinking about how pale it was when i got close to it, it must have been very bright and reducing brightness as it approached.  i was driving west.  as i turned to the north, it came as close to the highway as the trees (us-231) and then turned north to parallel the highway.  i watched it through the trees until i lost it about a mile north.  as i was driving just about a mile more from there, it darted out from the tree line and crossed the highway.  i was no more than a few hundred feet away at this point.  it was at tree top level, far too close and small to be any craft or helicopter, etc.  it went over into an empty field, slowing, speeding up, moving around a little, then it lit up the ground for a few seconds with a regular looking while light, then went back the way it came.  the field in question is completely benign and an abandoned lot that was skimmed off with a pond for sale.  i told my mom and she said at the time that she had seen it several times.  i had seen it years before, and another time at our old house not far from there in montgomery, where i had a much more interesting encounter.\r\n\r\nin montgomery, 2007, 3am, this same orb (one looking just like it) was moving by at several hundred or thousand feet very slowly from south to north and nearby our house.  i thought it was a satellite or high altitude plane as this is a flight line and we do have an air force base nearby.  as i watched the light, it moved on beyond the tree line and out of view.  i knew it didn't match anything i had seen before and it just seemed to be so high for some reason.  higher than any planes actually that had come over.  moments later, it returned slowly at lower altitude and stopped (still thousands of feet high it appeared).  i had a flashlight and did flash to it several times.  after a few moments, it moved on again, then stopped as i was flashing.  i was wondering if it sensed me, so i stopped flashing at it.  finally, it moved on and did not return.  i went back to bed.  the next day, it returned about the same time and just crossed the sky and disappeared.  i didn't flash at it.  another time at this house, i saw a daytime ufo.  i was sitting in my room at 4 in the afternoon on a cloudy day.  i looked up from my bed just in time to glance a blue and black ufo through the slits of the blinds on the window.  it had several lights on it, blue, red, green.  it was so low coming over the treetops down the court and behind the houses down the street that i thought it was going to dive in and hit the house.  it was like a saucer from the profile, head-on view, but that can be easily misinterpreted as quickly as this happened.  it could have been more like a plane, but not a copter.  there was no sound and it was moving very fast.  near to there, my mom and sister and a family friend from out of town have reported nighttime black triangles.  anyway, i darted from my room and out the back door just in time to see it go down behind the trees and out of view.  through the trees and with the close proximity, i would say it was as big as a c-130.  we have those come over time and again.  however, it was no c-130.  it was black, blue stripe, lights, and too compact to be a plane with wings, and again, the silence made it plane weird.  another thing, this thing had to have crashed as steep the angle and low to the ground as it was, but there was no crash, and i went to the area by bike to make sure.  nothing was there.  this thing had only inches to miss the trees for me to see it over our short yard through my window with such a small field of view.    \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering

ufo at about 6 a.M. from his place of employment. he has a job that allows him to be outside and able to look at the sky. the entire viewing lasted approximately 44 minutes. he was looking in a south-east direction and he saw a bright, shining object. at first he thought it was one of the few stars that was still visible around daybreak, but as he scanned the sky there were no other stars visible, even when he looked up with his binoculars. \r\n     he grabbed those binoculars to get a closer look and as he focused, he saw what looked to be a bright, metallic and diamond shaped object. the side that was facing east was getting the most sunlight and the object was showing an illuminated rim with a bright glint and a hot spot. as i mentioned before, the object was diamond-shaped (meaning traditional diamond, and not baseball field diamond shaped)and it remained stationary during the entire time that it was visible. after my boyfriend got off of work he kept checking the skyline to see if it had moved, but it didn't.\r\n     at around 6:44 a.M., the object itself had still not moved, but a smaller object was seen separating from the larger,diamond-shaped object. the separated object was heading in a south-east direction. after that, my boyfriend couldn't find it anymore.   \r\n        ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

and tried not to take my eyes off it, but as i was driving on the freeway had to be careful also. i mentioned it over the phone to my brother also because i wanted to see what he thought it might of been. \r\n\r\nit wasn't until i read on (url remove to fi box) cms 09/20/11 00:19 cst flg about the notre dame game being disrupted by an almost identical object sighted & then again this article  - \r\n\r\n[link moved to additional evidence section/cms/tg]\r\n\r\n- that made me want to contribute what i have seen in this area recently. i have never before seen anything like this, and although i believe we cannot be the only intelligent life in the universe have never actively read or researched \"ufo\" sightings.\r\n\r\nunless this was some kind of secret military machine i know exactly what i saw was not normal. i am of sound mind, body & vision.\r\n\r\ni hope this helps to add to your sightings & research.\r\n\r\nsimilar to this video (which was also filmed in san diego county) only what i witnessed was in the sky for longer period of time & the shape was more pronounced with the two triangular 'peaks' (not seen in this clip but wanted to portray the contrast of white/blue)- \r\n\r\n[link moved to additional evidence section/cms/tg]\r\n\r\nuploaded picture below doesn't quite depict what i saw, but again is general idea again. \r\n\r\n**for question also in the area - i have checked helicopter, planes & balloons because although i did not see any of these on the days in question, they are known to be active in that area as a matter of course.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Louvres","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":31945,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.9738375,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09202011-0003","longitude":-117.2506112,"occurred":1315983600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang,   Triangle,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1316505390000,"summary":"Have twice observed white craft-like object hovering in the sky whilst driving north on i-5 between del mar & carlsbad","tags":["hovering"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/31945_submitter_file1__white_object_sky.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"92024-1405","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":6,"locationName":"Del Mar, California","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:34722"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82758,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1779}
