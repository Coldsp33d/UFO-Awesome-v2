and 11:15pm. the outdoor lighting around the house was off so we had a very clear view of the night sky. we were taking in the view to the east, watching falling stars as we often do, and noticed a flash of white light to the north east.\r\n\r\nthe flash of light caught our attention and we began to watch the area of the sky it came from. the white light blinked on again. it was not an abrupt flash but rather an increase in luminosity from nothing to slightly brighter than the surrounding stars then back to nothing again. at first we thought it might be a uas from fort huachuca or another aircraft but that proved quickly not to be the case.\r\n\r\nat first my wife and i thought it was a single object hopping back and forth a short distance in the night sky (less than 1 km), but it quickly became apparent that there were actually two objects. we ascertained this because we noticed that after the white light would die down, there was in fact, a faint red light remaining. the red light glowed constant and did not blink. we saw two faint red lights that would take turns glowing bright white for 1.5 to 2 seconds before fading back to a dim red. \r\n\r\nit was exceptionally hard to make out these red lights due to the distance and altitude. my guess is that they were only about as bright as the faintest stars visible to the naked eye. my wife and i had to stare off center (to avoid the night vision blind spot) to even catch where they were when they were not glowing the much brighter white. the objects must have been at extreme range and altitude given their position in the sky and relative brightness compared to the stars/planets in the sky. i would suspect the viewing distance exceeded 10 miles and whatever they were must have been at an altitude in the excess of 15,000 ft. msl.\r\n\r\nthe objects remained visible for 4-5 minutes, then one of them shot off to the east at extreme speed (traversing 1/4 of the visible sky less than 2 seconds). the object vanished above the highest clouds and never returned. the second object moved west, at much slower speed, but my wife and i lost it due to light contamination over sierra vista. the dim red was very difficult to follow.\r\n\r\noverall, i was quite fascinated by the object, as was my wife. she is quite skeptical of ufo phenomenon, and i have never personally witnessed anything like it i could not explain.\r\n\r\nreasons i decided to report it:\r\n1. the lighting pattern is inconsistent with aircraft lighting typically used by the faa in us airspace.\r\n2. the objects were hovering at extreme altitude well beyond that expected of a helicopter or other rotary winged aircraft.\r\n3. the acceleration of the object is inconsistent with known aircraft.\r\n4. shooting stars don't hover.\r\n5. flares don't burn out in less than 2 seconds, then remain in the same spot and re-ignite.\r\n","distance":"Over One

mothers screened in porch having some drinks and conversation. i was facing the indicated direction when i noticed the first light come into view above a nearby tree. it appeared to be moving towards us and pass overhead. i noted the unusual orange light seemed to glimmer, but dismissed it as an aircrafts' lighting being distorted by the porches screening. the viewable sky between the top of the tree and the top of the porch allowed for approximately 5-10 seconds of viewing. the greater rochester international airport is nearby and aircraft can routinely and readily be seen in the area. after approximately 5 minutes another orange light appeared in the same spot of the sky, moving in the same exact trajectory as the first. i went outside the porch to obtain an unobstructed view of the light. the light appeared to glimmer or flicker as if fire like. no smoke or tail trailed the light. as i observed the light it passed nearly straight over head, the closer it became to being over head the glowing orange light seemed to dim and disappear, as a car headlights would as it passes. i was able to capture 2 cell phone videos of lights 2 and 3, 21 and 58 seconds, respectively. i retrieved a pair of small 8x binoculars from my truck and was able to more closely observe the approach of light 4. the orange light appeared more fire-like, it was not glaring but more of a shimmering glow. i followed the light through the binoculars as it passed over head and the light again dimmed and could not be seen. it was then i could see a form, or shape. it appeared to be a disc. from my perspective, and through the binoculars, i gauged it to be approximately the diameter of my thumnail held at arms length. it appeared to be faintly illuminated by the lights of the city from below, and it also blocked the stars as i followed it. i was only able to observe the object for a few seconds before the house blocked my view. it was very difficult to judge the altitude, it was a clear sky, my best guess would be between 5,000ft and 8,000ft. likewise, the speed is difficult with an unknown altitude. again, best guess, 100mph to 200mph. it took approximately 1 minute for the lights to transit approximately 70 degrees of sky.\r\n i have been a licensed private pilot, though not currently current, since 2003. i am very familiar with aircraft of all types and their operational characteristics. at no time were navigational or anti-collision lights visible, i used off-center viewing trying to ascertain any, especially when i was able to view the object after the

boulevard.  i was stargazing, and while looking for jupiter, at around 12:30 am, a large, bright light appeared about 32 degrees about the horizon, approximately south-west of me.  the object, to the naked eye, appeared to be about the size of venus in the night sky.  at first i thought i was looking at mercury for about 30 seconds, until i consulted my sky map to find mercury had already dipped far below the horizon and would not be visible until the early morning.  the object changed colors rapidly, changing between white, silver, red, pink, orange, yellow, and green.  it's brightness also changed, and it appeared to be moving up, down, and side to side slightly, as if dodging something almost.  it stayed within a relatively small area, however, never moving more than half of a degree in any direction.  i trained my telescope on it, which has a six inch diameter, and brought it into focus with the use of a 3x barlow lens.  this action revealed nothing new about the object's appearance, and was hard to keep steady in the telescope's view on account of its dodging motions.  the object was obviously far away, maybe even in the upper reaches of the atmosphere.  upon consulting my sky map, i found that there was nothing in that area that would have been so visible.  the object continued to change colors and brightness while moving back and forth like this for at least an hour and a half.  it never moved closer to the horizon, really, nor did it ever move further from it.  it stayed within its .5 degree by .5 degree box in the sky.  the rest of the stars around it did move, as they should have.  whatever i was seeing, it was geostationary.  i initially felt confused, as i had no way of knowing what i was looking at.  it was incredibly difficult to discern any true information about it, except that it was clearly closer than anything else in the sky, but too far away to make out details, even with a telescope.  i stared at it in awe, along with my friend, then started to kind of ignore it, but never truly taking my eye off it for more than five seconds.  it wasn't until the next day i decided i had no explanation for what we had seen, and i

after going around a small left curve, and turning back to our original direction.  we had our eyes off of it for no more than four seconds, and it was gone.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":85531,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.0102425,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07312017-0017","longitude":-116.1043326,"occurred":1501286400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1501533732000,"summary":"Large,

some similar sighting. and it appears to be somewhat rare.\r\nfor years after this sighting i was terrified. had terrible nightmares. so it was something i didn't talk about. \r\nin the past five years or so it became somehow easier to face this subject.\r\nit happened around july 1984. i was in the playground with my sister and another friend. i was 10 years old, my sister was 7.\r\nthere were no other kids there, only the 3 of us.\r\nwe saw a hexagon shaped flying object. it was a dull light copper color. it was big. it had a light underneath, in the middle. i can't remember exactly the color... today i would say it was red. but i'm not that sure as i'm of the other details. i'm not also sure if there were other light, only this bigger one in the middle. it was flying low. really near. maybe around 80 ft.\r\nthe craft stayed in this very slow hovering for some minutes... then went into a straight ascendent path. and simply disappeared over a building a block from there.\r\nit hasn't made no distinct sounds. and i haven't seen windows or anything inside. it appeared to be solid.\r\nthinking back from this happening i would say it changed me a lot. i wasn't a very bright student. and i became really quick to learn everything... in school, languages... sense things.Predict some other things. sense energy all around me. \r\ni was terribly shy. i became much more extroverted.\r\ni don't know if it is related... but i was thinking back these days... and it felt weird the changes that i went through after that.\r\neven though i'm not used to talk about it. in two occasions if asked my sister if she remembered something about that day. in both occasions she said she remembered. she also doesn't seem to like the subject. this weekend was one of this two occasions. and maybe this is one of the reasons i'm submitting my sighting. because maybe it's important to spread the knowledge and help with the understanding of the subject","distance":"21-100

cloud structure in the sky , as i usually do to learn more about cloud formations & how they move through the sky. i've taken literally hundreds and hundreds of little videos like this, however, upon playback, i noticed a light anomaly appearing then disappearing in the blink of an eye. the anomaly was in view for less than 1 second.  i didn't see this anomaly myself when taking the video, so i was intrigued & decided to slow the video down to investigate it frame-by-frame in order to try to identify what, if anything, this anomaly could be, or whether it was simply a lens flare or some other sort of photographic glitch from the camera itself. so i began the frame-by-frame review of the video. and what i saw both perplexed and astonished me. \r\nnow, i need to preface this by saying that this object moves so fast that it takes less than 1 second for it to fly through my entire line of sight before disappearing fast out of camera shot, it's moving almost as fast as a lightning strike - humans can't travel with such speed. \r\nit is a clearly solid object that starts as a boomerang-shaped object. but as it moves through my video shot it seems to be changing shape from a boomerang shape into an orb-shaped object (although it could be an illusion due to the dramatic speed at which the object is traveling. \r\nwhen you stop the video to analyze its boomerang structure you can see it is mostly a white, reflective object with what appears to be a red stripe on its left side (to my left, at least. \r\nthe object appears in the video from the top left corner of the shot, flies down then through ghe middle ground of the video, appearing right under  the cloud forms i was filming, before twisting itself in mid-flight then blasting away from my location into the distance & out of my camera view. as someone that has been studying the sky for nearly 20 years, i have no explanation as to what this object is besides being a potential ufo - i was lucky to have even recognized the anomaly to begin with, as it moves so fast through the video that most people wouldn't have even recognized it was present in the video. fortunately for me, i've trained my eyes to detect things like this, but to the average eye (and to most people i've shown this video to), they have trouble noticing the anomaly at all until i slow the video down & show them myself - and once they do notice, people have freaked out about it. \r\nplease review these videos to analyze what you believe this object is. to me, it's clearly a ufo moving so fast through the sky in clear daylight that nobody would even notice its presence..I urge you to slow down the video in order to analyze it frame-by-frame in order to determine its flight path, then cross-reference by watching the video in real time in order to determine its approximate speed...\r\nto me, its truly astounding. i've observed various potential ufos in the past, & even have some grainy video of them, but this is the most clear video evidence, at least for me, that ufos are a real phenonenon that are very active throughout our skies, if you can explain his, please let me know. and if you draw the same conclusion that i have, please let me know. i'm interested in what, if any, conclusions  mufon can draw from this video. \r\n\r\nthanks. please get back to me, i look forward to further communications regarding this matter. \r\n\r\njosh gardnet","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:00:01","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface, Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

lot. the parking lot is on the corner of highway 46 east and golden hill road in paso robles ca. after about a 30 min chat we said our good byes and i turn to get in my truck. i saw over my truck cab a bright orange type light in the distance. at first i thought it was a street light but then noticed it was to tall or high to be a street light. i told my co worker to come look at this strange light. it looked to be standing still in the north sky. as we watched it we could tell it was moving south and right at us. it moved very slow and we then though it was just a plain since there is a small air port nearby. as we watched it get closer we could make out a red light blinking and the orange light that first caught my eye looked to be 2 lights. it stayed on a straight line right over our heads there was a few lights under it. i thought maybe it's a drone but i have been around drones and if a drone was that size i would clearly hear it. it was a dark night so it was hard to make out the true shape of the object but from what i could see it had like jet outline. with 2 orange head lights under where the cockpit would be a blinking red light at the tail end of the object. there was 2 lights back from the 2 orange lights but they were not far out to the sides like you see on most airplane wing lights. i want to say those 2 lights where blue and one green. after it flew over us it kept to a south heading but it looked to move a bite to the west. we lost it in the trees and parking lot lights. i felt mixed on what i saw because i thought i could make out the shape of a plain. the object was moving very slow and from my guess it was 500 to 1000 ft in the air and i could not hear any sound from it!! there is a freeway very close by but it was not a very busy night on that road so there was not a lot of sound from there to drown it out. i see plains fly by a lot and over head a lot in that area but i have never had a \"plane\" fly over me that low with no sound!!
