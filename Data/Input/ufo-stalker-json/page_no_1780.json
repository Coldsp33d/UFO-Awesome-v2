plus we didn't hear any chopper sounds. it was east of us maybe all the way over to lake county. we tracked it against a structure to be sure it was moving. over the two hours it moved more towards the west and by the time we went to bed it was about 85 degrees up from the horizon. \r\n\r\nwe star gaze quite a bit -

the fall creek area called geist resevoir. a popular place back then named \"the point\" near county line dock off fall creek road. the time was about 9pm-10pm at night. it was a clear moonless night and we were not drinking or high but just there for a little romance. an aircraft type light appeared moving slowly west across the other side of the resevoir. there were dog kennels across the water near this approaching red light. the 20 plus dogs began barking violently as this red light came near to the kennal. the object stopped directly over the kennel and a bright white light flashed from the bottom of the craft like a flash bulb and instantly all the dogs stopped barking. that got us all up off the ground and the girls wanting to leave\r\nbecause of what we observed this craft's light effect on the wildly barking dogs. this light seemed to totally stop all those excited dogs from barking completely and the dogs never started barking again. it started to move slowly again in the same direction and then a light of the same intensity came out of the front and stayed on as it moved west.\r\nit's right side dipped to it's right and it began to turn towards us and as it did, it's top appeared to us as a yellow orange domed surface with\r\nround pulsating multi colored lights around it's edge on top. at this point all the girls about peed their pants and they all ran to the car that was less that a 100 yards away. as it completed it's turn towards our location, that bright front light bathed me and this other guy that stayed to watch and also the whole cliff we were standing on, but then it went out and the craft stayed stationary as if it was watching us. it began to move slowly again westward with an increased angle upward. suddenly it shot off like a bullet and the only way to discribe it was faster than a night time tracer round out of a military weapon and it was gone. we ran to the car and the girls were freaking out and said, \"what took you guys so long?!!\" we had to have the girls back at 12 midnight and we got them home near 2am. years later i learned of \"lost time\" and thought about this incident alot and came to the conclusion that we lost about an hour and 1/2 but this whole event only lasted at the most 15 minutes. i have always wanted this sighting to be investigated and this is the first official report i have made because the times i have told it, everybody thought that i was making it up or just crazy. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

\r\n\r\nfront tip one white light at each wing tip and in the center of the craft on the top side right where \r\n\r\na cockpit would be was a red light all these lights were about the size of a golf ball just basically \r\n\r\nindicator lights . the crafts seemed it wasn���t solid it seemed to be transparent like see through \r\n\r\nand these jets were roaring  the sound was why we all looked up in the first place  well it must of \r\n\r\ntook us 30-40 minutes to get to r friends house and through out the night we would look up too \r\n\r\nkeep a eye on these supersonic  jets and i swear to you at on point it was on the east side of the \r\n\r\ncity then the north,west, and south it was miles away from us in the sky but it circled the whole \r\n\r\ncity there's just nothing i know of that can  circle around the city that fast it wasent natural we got \r\n\r\nto the house and just couldn���t stop talking about it . well fast forward to 10pm n here���s where the \r\n\r\nreal juicy

\r\n\r\nminuets go by an  across the street from us is a 3-4 story tall building  an i just happened to be \r\n\r\nlooking at the roof  and right over the top of this building i see this black triangular shape craft  \r\n\r\nabout the size of a fighter jet with the exact same lights as the crafts i saw prior only this time it \r\n\r\nwas one of them and it wasent translucent it was black it hovered a few feet over the building top and then it continued to travle \r\n\r\nright above me at the same height as the roof top  but right before it came over me the craft tilted \r\n\r\nits body on a side way lean and as soon as it came over me and my buddy on the bottom of each \r\n\r\nwingtip two soft ball sized perfect circles just lit up white for about 2 seconds and then the 4 soft \r\n\r\nball sized lights turned off  the craft  leveled again(it came  off its lean to straighten out) and it \r\n\r\nhoverd right over us down the block and we lost sight of it due to trees and houses \r\n\r\nand i noticed something up close\r\n\r\nabout the craft i didnt from earily when it was high in the air at high speeds \r\n\r\n well when it hoverd over us i noticed yes it was triangular in shape\r\n\r\n but at the rear it had a stingray shaped tail about2-3 yards long and  while the whole time it was floaitng over us not one bit of \r\n\r\nsound was emitted from this craft

bright amber/orange and looked as if it was emanating light from the inside and had a soft glow around it. there was also a thin reddish line on the bottom. as i said, it was dark out which made this

of 1990, approx 8:00 p.M. est.  the location was phoenixville, pa (approx 40 w of philadelphia)it was so long ago i cannot remember the exact day which it happened, but i know it was during one of those months during that year.  \r\n\r\ni was 13 years old at the time and getting ready to go bowling with my family.  my mother asked me to change the kitty litter, so i took the bag outside to our attached shed.  i have always been fascinated with the night sky, and as always looked up at the stars.  \r\n\r\nflying directly over my head/house was a giant black triangle.  by giant i mean this thing was huge, approx 1500 feet along each side.  you could have fit an unknown number of the largest airplnes in the world inside the outline of this thing, it was massive.  as soon as i saw it, i dropped the kitty litter bag and key to the shed right where i stood.  i was scared and mesmerized at the same time.   \r\n\r\ni watched this thing for about 3-4 minutes.  it had 3 smallish red lights at each point in the triangle.  it was low to the ground, maybe 1000-2000 ft at the most.  it made no noise whatsoever and flew over my house in a ese direction.  it did not deviate from this course at all and flew at a very slow speed.\r\n\r\nit was a clear night, no clouds at all and the stars were visible. the object was solid as it blacked out all of the stars behind it.  when the object was starting to get further down on the horizon i came to my senses and ran inside to get my mom and grandmom to see this thing.  unfortunatly when i finally got them outside the object was too far away for them to see it as the triangle had gone far enough towards the horizon that the trees blocked it out.   \r\n\r\ni haven't reported this before and have really only told my closest of friends as i didn't want people to think i was crazy, but i know what i saw, the sight of it is burned into my memory.  for some reason it has been on my mind alot recently and i felt like i had to tell soemone about this.  i can't think of any other details to relay.  i figured this would be all over the news and the newspapers at the time as i live in a fairly highly populated area but i have never heard a thing.  i still to this day am freaked out by what i saw as i can't possibly imagine this thing is earthly.

talking to my dad, brother in law and sister.  i looked at the jet trail for a while and noticed something that looked like a yellow dull metalic sphere above the contrail.  i first thought it was a yellow child's balloon floating in the sky.  the object was just hovering motionless and i told my dad to go get his binoculars toget a better view of it. it stayed there for a long time, at least 20 minutes.  when my dad gave me the binoculars i looked at it and noticed it was a sphere with a yellow dull metalic surface that was at i would guess 50,000 feet in altitude, much higher than the airliner at 20-30000 feet in altitude.  i was able to see 3 aircraft now in a triangle hovering flight formation.  i noticed a fourth one close to the other 3 and it moved horizontally in a linear path slowly to the right and i noticed then 3 more spheres hovering motionless.  they all formed a trapezoid flight position.  the surprise came when some of them started glowing brightly as a bright yellow to white light. some of them changed shape to an elongated sphere and then looked disklike with edges on the outside of the shape.  they all stayed in formation for over 20 minutes and then some of them just disappeared as i was looking at them in my binoculars! my dad, brother in law,sister and later mom all heard me describe these objects while looking at them in the binoculars.  they were not very visible to the natural eye, just tiny starlike spheres. i watched them for a while as i looked at them they disappeared one by one but changed shape first and glowed a like a white brilliant light like snow with the sun reflecting off it or a bright mirror reflecting the sun.  i was amazed and it was like nothing i had ever seen and i had been to air shows by the air force.  i have seen weather balloons, balloons, helicopters at night and in daylight.  nothing was like these things.  they were at 50,000 feet in altitude at least and were motionless and not moving for 20+ minutes. they changed shape, appearance, and disappeared while viewing them.  one moved linearly and stopped as it formed a flight position to the other objects.  unbeliveable but actually happened.

in a row traveling from east to west off in the distance just over the trees in our direction. \"planes don't fly that close together do they?\" i said. as we watched them come closer, the center light went higher forming a triangle juxtapose the other two. the lights one by one slowly ascended up in to the clouds out of view as they seperated further apart from each other. there was no sound. we shrugged it off and went to our cars and left. the lights would have been going towards the charlotte airport. as my wife and got in the car and left the parking lot we saw two more of the orange lights flying very close together. as they came closer one either went behind the other or joined the other making one light. they then seperated and put a greater distance between them. as i'm driving south on park road i continue to watch. i confirmed with my wife that we did in fact see the same event that took place. off in the distance above the trees there were three more aproaching. i kept waiting to hear a sound which would identify what we were seeing but never did. i observed one fly over us just below cloud cover and saw that the bottom looked exactly the same as they looked at a distance, an orb of orange light. i didn't pull over because i kept expecting to discover a logical explanation, tail lights or a sound. there was none. they were not planes (we see them all the time) and they were not helicopters. \r\n  the oddest part is we had just had a conversation about ufo's during dinner and surmised the possibilities of what they could be including the biblical interpretations of angels depicted as having wings because they fly in the sky like birds. the last time you ever expect to see something like this is when you just get through talking about it. we

trailer, suddenly a huge whump whump whump from the sky made me look up.  a huge black object with white dashes of lights appeared - the sound made it seem like the object was braking before hitting the earth.  the black object against the black sky immediately made me think it was a ufo.  the vehicle in front of me swerved back and forth on the highway - finally pulling over.  when i first heard the noise - i tried to wake up my passenger - but he would not wake up.  i pounded on his arm and screamed his name and he would not wake up.  the object hovered above the highway for a moment and then ascended back into the sky from my perspective in a straight up heading just to left of my view.  the object filled 1/4 of the sky - maybe it was 50-100 feet above us.  i thought oh no - not again!  i admit i was afraid because i could not wake the person with me.  a friend said it was probably a black helicopter - but aside from the fact it was way too big for any helicopter i have seen, the whump sound only came when it appeared to brake above us , and then the abrupt direction change was not accompanied by sound and it zipped straight up out of sight - admittedly - it was black but it also had white dashed lights along a varied surface bottom.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Path with

moving directly away from me or it faded out while shrinking. there were no observable effects or sounds that i associated with it and was otherwise unremarkable. i could not tell how large it was or

(13 years old), my middle brother (16 years old), and my middle brother's girlfriend (17 years old) home from seeing batman forever at the movie theater.  honestly, looking back, the only thing abnormal about the night was the abundance of lightning in the sky.  we all noticed that and commented on the fact we were having a lot of \"dry lightning\" that night.  in fact, it was so intense that we stopped at the local cemetery and turned off the headlights and watched the sky light up almost constantly.  i believe we sat there for a few moments and reminisced about old ghost stories we had heard growing up before heading out to continue the trip to take my brother's girlfriend home. it was close to midnight.\r\n\r\nafter driving across the mountains and after dropping my brother's girlfriend off at her house, we began our journey home.  still, the lightning was flashing continuously...But we thought nothing of it.  \r\n\r\nit wasn't until we were driving down the largest mountain we crossed that we spotted something in the sky that appeared to be the moon at first glance--it was circular in shape and gave off light.  however, the only reason we knew it wasn't the moon is because we could see it better when the lightning flashed and further illuminated the object.  my brother asked, \"what is that? \" and all three of us stared curiously at this round object in the sky.  we knew it definitely wasn't the moon when we realized the object was moving.  at one point my oldest brother asked, \"is it following us?\"\r\n\r\nwe sat in awe as we drove down the only road home trying our best to keep our eyes on this strange object in the sky.  my heart pounded in my chest as the car drove down the road and almost stopped after driving over a small hill about 1.5 miles from home.  my brother immediately stopped the car upon seeing the sight: in a field 70-100 yards in front of us was a flaming circular object that hovered in the air as a constant stream of lightning shot down to the ground while other bolts of lightning shot out of it in all directions. it looked to be about 50 feet off of the ground and at arm's length, it looked to be the size of a quarter.  \r\n\r\nwe were terrified and looked at each other with our mouths gaped open in shock, wondering if we were all witnessing the same thing.  in reality, we thought it was the end of the world and began praying.  my brother wouldn't budge the small vehicle and we sat there for what seemed to be several minutes wondering if it was the end of our lives while staring at this impossible sight in front of us.  finally i told my brother to speed past the object to make it home to our parents, but he was hesitant since the object was fairly close to the paved, one-lane road.  i started to cry and somehow my brother found the courage to drive home.  when we moved, it moved fluidly away from the field and appeared to be following us.  we sped down the country road while trying our best to keep our eyes in the sky.\r\n\r\nwe woke our parents up immediately upon getting home and we all tried explaining what we saw in the sky to my mother.  we even tried showing her the object out of the bathroom window, but at that point, it was already sinking down and was hidden behind the thick line of trees in the western horizon.\r\n\r\nto this day, we still talk about that night and wonder what it was we saw.  we all agree on one thing: whatever it was, it wanted to be seen.  we only wonder why.\r\n","distance":"101-500
