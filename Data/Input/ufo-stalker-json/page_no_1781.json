can't even remember the year, but it was a late autumn evening. i was 16 back then, and that night i was leaving the summer cottage. i locked the door, and as i was turning around i froze looking up: a glowing disc flew wobbling over my head and disappeared behind the houses and trees in 3 seconds. it made no noise, i only felt vibrations from it���s wobbling - it made ~10 one-two meter jumps side-to-side while flying straight. it's color was very outlandish, i guess between cyan and turquoise. \r\n\r\nafter i lost sight of the object i rushed to the gates where my brother was waiting in the car. i asked if he saw a ufo, but he didn't. that evening i told my parents about what i saw. and then i buried this event in my memory for a few years before telling my friends and other people.\r\n\r\nnote 1: i made an illustration from a recently taken photo.\r\n \r\nnote 2: object wasn't flying fast, but it's rapid wobbling made it hard to see the details of the surface, but it definitely wasn't smooth.\r\n\r\nnote 3: i have had a number of ufo sightings (orbs of light) in the recent years, and i saw what looked like two stars shooting light beams at each other when i was about 5 or 6.\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:00:03","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

more. i watched outside from the front of the house in the street. i saw a bright white light moving quickly across the sky,with absolution there was no sound, so i went inside to grab my camera. when i came back out, i didn't see anything out of the ordinary again, but i stayed outside for approx 20 minutes to make sure. i came into the house to warm up a bit and decided to go outside on the back porch to check out the stars and the sky again, just to be sure. i was out back approx 3 minutes when i looked over my head, like i always do when looking for stars in the night sky, and saw a slower moving ufo, whisper quiet or no sound at all, in the shape of a 'v', with the nose of it being the converging point of both sides, or an upside down 'v', with multiple bright white lights scattered all over the bottom of the craft, flying southwest. i yelled for my husband and continued watching the ufo move in a southwest direction for about 40 or 50 seconds. and then, it just seamed to converge into one main round light before it just ''took off at the speed of light''. the craft or ufo didn't appear to have the standard defined hull to it. it was just gone after that, and no matter how long i stood outside, it just didn't re-appear. it was strange that after the event i saw a larger number of airplanes and helicopters in the air that i have ever seen in our area, especially at approx 10:00, 10:30ish p.M., as well as for a while afterwards. this was the most amazing specimen of a ufo that i have seen to date! and i have seen at least 5 ufo's in the last 20 years. this one was different than the others, in shape, size, color & light color. it almost reminded me of a stealth bomber, but from where i was it had passed just to the left of the big dipper and it was at least the size or larger than the constellation of the big dipper! i wish i had just turned on the video portion of my camera to capture it, but i was in such astonishment and didn't want to take my eyes off of it, because this is a once in a lifetime experience, for some, and i didn't want to miss a thing! i had an experience this past summer where it was extremely quiet, clear and perfect summer night. no rain for almost a week before, and no rain for almost a week after, and very low humidity with consistent temperatures. at around 3a.M. on a weekday, i was in the restroom with the lights off and windows wide open, when all of a sudden an extremely bright white flash of light came from nowhere! i sat in awe for a few moments almost unable to move. i looked out the windows and didn't see a thing, or hear anything for that matter. to this day i am still trying to figure it all out, but now i believe it was a ufo.  i know one thing is for sure, i will be watching the sky more often, and with my camera in tow!\r\ni am wondering if anyone else saw this, especially in my area!? don't be afraid to say so, this can be done anonymously. thank you all for listening and reading my story!

southwest sky a bright light caught my eye about 50 degrees above the horizon to the southeast. i quickly glanced over to find it getting brighter until the light faded slightly and proceeded to move about 10 degrees to the southeast before dissapearing,i then observed another faint object moving from the other way that materialized from the same area the initial object dissapeared. this second object was followed by another object that took roughly the same path as the first object. the duration of the event took about 30 seconds in all. my girlfriend witnessed the event as well and claims she saw the first object avoid something but i cannot confirn since i didn't see it. i am an amateur astronomer with 14 years experience and an avaiation enthusiast so i am well versed in sky phenomena and general operations of aircraft especially in my area. immediately following the event i checked the tracks of many satellites including the international space station which was the only explanation i could possibly think of but none were in the area. in my opinion the objects were moving to slow to be a satellite, i have often observed them in my countless night outside with my telescope. ive always been on the fence about wether i believe or not but im convinced now, ive been looking at the sky nightly for 14 years and ive never seen anything like this. at first it frightened me a bit because it appeared as if it was only gonna get bigger but that later turned to excitement when i reallized what i had just seen.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

 perhaps someone else from the area has a photo taken closer than mine. for the record i estimate it was about 5 miles south of me and just a few miles north of the sandia casino resort and should have been visible to a large number of people driving on i-25 corridor between santa fe and albuquerque.  i apologize for not including the mountains in my photo, as i was focusing solely on the \"balloon.\"","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":31890,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.2026346,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09182011-0019","longitude":-106.5779099,"occurred":1316313000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Mexico","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Teardrop","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1316397133000,"summary":"Re submission 31875 las cruces nm - saw it from placitas nm photo attached","tags":["photo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/31890_submitter_file1__Sept1811001.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Albuquerque, New Mexico","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:35282"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover), Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Newark","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It sends chills throughout my entire body to even think about it now. the strangest thing is this is not a one time incident. every night i go onto my balcony to smoke. i usually smoke anywhere from 3 to 5 cigarettes throughout the night while looking up at the stars. i have a pretty good starmap in my head so at any given time i am looking at big dipper and other star formations. it started a couple of weeks ago i started seeing this star-like light flickering in the night sky. it just appears like someone flicked on a lamp. i have tried cameras and binoculars to try and see the object in more detail but they lack the magnification to see better. the best sightings of it are with my own eyes. when i saw it the first time i immediately went thru my checklist. not a plane. not a helicopter. not a airport tower or a high rise building. what could it be then? so i start thinking even harder at the things ive heard such as high intensity flares weather balloon chinese lanterns and non of them make sense. if someone was to tell me it was one of these things i would be extremely offended sad even that someone would try and insult my intelligence in that way. i have seen it off and on since the first time and i have even got some of my friends to make sure im not a lunatic and tell me they see it as well. we speculate as to what it could possibly be but have still not been able to figure it out. it is sometimes brighter and more random flashing of beautiful colors the bluest of blues and the most purplest purples i or my buddy has ever seen. not knowing what it is is really bothersome. i know this sounds weird but i had a sort of intimate moment with the object the other night. i sat by myself it was around 2am i was smoking my last cigarette of the night and staring at the star-like object as i have done for about a week or so previous when i sort of felt like it knew {even from as far away as this thing was} that i was watching it. i felt an overwhelming urge to stare at it i felt like a moth. i could not look away. more like i didnt want to look at anything else in the world ever i only wanted to look at this flickering. i went thru two emotions at that point scared goosebumps followed by immediate relief as if i saw an old relative friend or pet. i actually had tears swell in my eyes but not bad or sad but really happy? like i always knew the possibility of life but at that moment i knew in my heart and soul what i was seeing and feeling was real. no one can tell me otherwise. when you know something and you can feel it.. an epiphany is the best way to describe it like i suddenly realized that i was staring into something different then anything else. i also saw it moving in very small almost nothing zig zags and there was at one point something smaller that came out of it an sped around a bit. looked similar to a bat flying around at night barely any light barely visible but very agile and without a doubt there... i have to say most people would be scared of being labeled or being told they are lying but i am not. i know what i saw and continue to see. the last time i saw it was last night after 10pm before 2am.

live on and noticed an extremely bright,red object in the sky moving from east to west over the gulf.  i called my paul out to see it, as well.  we have a lot of air traffic over us (middle of the florida keys) and i know it was not an airplane...It had no blinking lights and appeared to be large and extremely bright.  paul suggested that if you put a glowing cigarette up in the sky at arm's length it was almost that big.  \r\n\r\nwe both watched it as it flowed slowly though the sky from east to west, a couple of minutes perhaps.  it slightly veered off of a straight line...Like a plane would...But then just disappeared.  according to the compass in my iphone it was at about 38 degrees ne, about 20ish degrees above the horizon.  there were no clouds to speak of in the area, save directly north out on the gulf closer to the everglades.  living on a boat as we do we check the radar often.  \r\n\r\njust before this thing disappeared it appeared to \"fade\" just a bit in the front and then \"poof\" was gone!  we sat on the back of the boat for quite some time after that scouring the sky to see if it came back out from anywhere and not a thing.  thinking perhaps there was a cloud it might have gone behind we watched for that, too.  no clouds there. \r\n\r\ni have seen many unusual things in the sky but this one was glowing red which is different from any others.  it wasn't \"white-hot\" white.  this sounds funny but i was almost drawn to watching it and to look up at that time which may be why i called my paul to see it too.  \r\n\r\nwe will be on the back of the boat tonight just in case they are still hanging around cruising our waters.  we are a \"mature\" couple and not given to being aroused or frightened easily.  this one has me stumped. \r\n\r\nas opposed to being just a random entry in your data base, if you have any light that you can shed on this i will certainly appreciate any feedback you might offer.  i will keep you informed of any further findings.  thank you for the work you do.

don���t see many helicopters in this neighborhood unless it���s the law chasing somebody & if that were the case, there would have been searchlights. plane?  where���s the flashing?  also don���t they have white lights as well?  also, there was no sound whatsoever.  the sky was clear, however it had rained for the 1st time in over four months most of the day before.  the air was humid & thick. what i saw was hauling *** (word removed cms 09/18/11 14:32 cst flg), faster than anything i've seen. it remained at the same elevation, heading from my right to left diagonal path. as it grew closer, i noticed some sort of circular type field around the red light in center. the circle was translucent & it was glistening/shimmering opalecant colors.  not twinkling like christmas lights, not blink pattern at all.  there were also i think 6 rays surrounding the opal circle, shining from the circular field, all the same length, just about the length of the circle in size. i simply couldn't take my eyes off it, i then remembered i had my android mobile in my hand, so i hit the buttons to quickly try to capture it on digital. it took me 5 seconds to get it started, by then; the object was straight above me. i tried to get it in my viewfinder, but it was moving so quickly, i just couldn't keep up. i attempted 3 shots 8 seconds apart, i've no flash & the lens was on the full zoom out level. it then was out of my view once it flew over the building. i ran down the stairs trying to adjust the zoom in, got to ground level & my view was blocked by the building. i should have run to the street, but i didn't think of it, i was so amazed! i felt no fear of the object. i gave up & went upstairs & indoors. then i looked to see what i might have gotten on digital, but with no luck, just darkness. i went to sleep. i woke up @ 10am & the 1st thing went thru my mind was the event.  i plan to upload the photos onto my computer & see if i can find anything by resizing them.\r\n\r\n(locaton moved to fi box) cms 09/18/11 14:35 cst flg (this is the info from the camera)\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":31883,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.653268468215344,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09182011-0012","longitude":-97.38484943273718,"occurred":1316259060000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Star-like,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1316384453000,"summary":"1 red lite very low, flying hi speed saw a glistening translucent aura w/rays","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"76133","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Fort Worth, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:35289"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop, Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Algonquin","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"There was about 80 people at a birthday party(approx 40 adults). location was carpentersville. the lights came to our attention because someone in the crowd said that it was weird how many airplanes were above. at that moment alot of people looked up and people commented that it was not airplanes. they were reddish/ orange orbs with even spacing between them. they were moving at a speed faster than an airplane. the lights did not blink or flicker. people also notice that there were also search lights  pointing in the opposite direction of these orbs.  they emmitted no noise.  video will be posted shortly. several people joked that they were ufo's while some mentioned that they were those small candle \"hot air ballons.\" they were moving e to w. video posted can be see at the 20 sec. mark.
