we were sitting outside and noticed high in the sky and a pretty good distance away - three glowing solid yellow/orange moving lights in the shape of a triangle that moved from east to west in a horizontal path. the triangle retained its shape the entire time we observed it. this was followed by 8-10 more single orbs coming into view one at a time from the exact same spot in the east (behind the trees so we could not see where it was) into the clear night sky and disappearing into the west - where trees also blocked our view to the west but you could visually follow the lights a greater distance that direction. these orbs were in high the sky where you would notice airplane lights. at one point we did see an airplane in the distance somewhat below the orbs. the orbs appeared to be closer to us than the plane. we also noticed a glowing, a pulsating light that lit up a large area of the sky behind the trees, this light appeared caused by something ground level, it shined behind the trees and into the sky below the spot where the orbs first came into view - this reflection of light was similar to what you would see if there were a fire or something, and trees or buildings blocked your view of what was creating the light - but there were no sirens or noise of any kind. we ran to the computer to see if we could find out if there was something happening nearby, fire/emergency, but could find no information. we continued to watch the single orbs come into view one by one and eventually the glowing ground level light was gone when we looked back for it. during this time we also saw 4 rotating searchlights shining up to the cloud cover, the commercial type that are used to promote grand openings and things like. these were shining into the sky underneath where the orbs were traveling east to west, but did not reach up as high as where we were watching the orbs. we do have a small airport in the area but we did not think the searchlights coincided with the airport location. it was pretty hard to tell distances as the backyard we were in was lined with very tall trees and there are many tall trees behind those trees too. one in our group was able to video the sky with his ipad but was not interested reporting the incident or releasing the video.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":31876,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.1728901,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09182011-0006","longitude":-88.2847793,"occurred":1316242800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1316364400000,"summary":"Yellow/orange lights move from east to west above treetops, 3 lights in triangle formation","tags":["triangle","lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"60102","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Algonquin, Illinois","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:35551"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Las Cruces","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"While taking a walk at sunset i noticed a very bright starlike object in the northern sky, far enough away that it was obscured by the few clouds that passed in front of it.  i thought it might be a star but it was still too light out for any stars to appear.  i returned home and got my binoculars and viewed the object which was clearly the shape of a hot air balloon (or triangle or heart).  it appeared to be stationary and very far away. i then looked at it through a telescope and affirmed that it was reflecting the light of the sun.  my husband joined me and as we looked at it through telescope and binoculars, it slowly changed color to reflect the setting sun -

extremely electric).  this particular sighting (late august), the light instantly deadened into laser-like, non directional bright red light (not a boat light, i see thousands of them) and disappeared for the night. it is alligator hunting season on the lake right now, and i know a spot light, (or air boat) from something unusual, as this light is not directional, and perhaps many thousands of watts - something unlike of even the strongest spotlights.  it also appears that the when light gets excited, nearby dock lights and street lights nearby on the mainland began to pulse and flicker, as if a magnetic field is being disturbed.  the luminosity of the light is also not of a typical indacacent, or led lamp - just too dammed bright and mesmerizing.  light is extremely bright, sharp and clear, changing many colors as a morning star, pulsating from a small flicker to a ball of electricity in milliseconds.  light suddenly appears and disappears at random - maybe 10 minutes, to several hours, sometimes moving, sometimes not, (it doesn't seem to have a schedule).  another unusual aspect of these sightings are the location of the phenomena - always on the west shore, where development is very scarce, near yalaha (doesn't seem to enjoy human company).  object appears to be \"smart\", as every time i walk to the dock for photo's, and vid's, instantly vanishes to reveal faint, small, green/blue, and red lights, appearing to synchronize in unusual patterns, only to reappear once i walked back away from it (very spooky).  i have also noticed that overhead oia, leesburg air traffic, and passing boats seem to make it hide until the coast is clear.   on one particular occasion, light was instantly joined by several other lights - some appearing to \"wind\" down the hill to the shore, and then hovering above the lake, sometimes disappearing and reappearing in different locations immediate to original location.  i have lived on the lake for over five years and have never seen something quite so seemingly un-human.  i decided to file this report (i couldn't \"nah,it's probably a boat\" any longer. - 9/16/2011 - as this particular sighting, i studied the sky to find that overhead lights that i though were stars, were moving very erratically at very high altitude, if not leo - very strange to say the least, as if the overhead lights and lights on lake were working together.  as fore-mentioned, it is hunting season (i hunt myself) and i have been wrong before, although i have seen many hunting boats with spotlights that look like dwarfs to this thing.  i suppose it may be wildlife officials, however, why the same location numerous nights, and with such erratic, somehow pointless and  almost impossible behavior?  there are many thousands of acres of water here.  i seriously doubt that law enforcement would patrol just 1/1000 of the water coverage.  just doesn't make sense.  i will update mufon on future sightings, as i will research (and watch) a little further. i hope someone else has seen this phenomena.  i really don't feel like being the village idiot ya' know.  as a note - the particular location of phenomena happens to be the deepest point of this, and all connecting lakes, and is also home to a few fifth magnitude springs.  i found this to be a interesting.  peace!","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":31874,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.8070079,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09182011-0004","longitude":-81.721422,"occurred":1316329200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Fireball,   Flash,   Sphere,   Star-like,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1316360558000,"summary":"Star like orb -

showing her that the star to the right of the moon was on the left of the moon last evening. i was watching the sky as i told her that last evening there seemed to be crazy air traffic going on for about 2 hours, as i was saying this a huge white sphere with a beautiful blue halo / aura around it appeared suddenly, in fast decent at about a 45 degree angle. it appeared to be going to crash, i watched it disappear right into the trees of the mountain. i am a star/ sky watcher and have seen comets and shooting stars many times, i had the feeling as i watched this that this craft was in trouble, and would crash. i waited and listened, but heard nothing. i watched for an explosion, none, i waited but never saw the craft leave the trees. my daughter and i told no one what we saw, as the night went on, i became very aware that i needed to tell someone what i saw. i realized even if the authorities found something they would just lie anyway. while lying in bed trying to put the event out of my thoughts, i realized i could tell people that don't lie, and want to tell the truth, so i called a number on the mufon web site, and told them my story. this is not my first sighting, but it is by far the most upsetting one, as i am sure the craft has crashed. for those of you who are asking the exact same question i would ask if i read this story, why didn't i go check it out? i live in the country, i am not familiar with that area of woodland, it was pitch black outside, cold and i am a middle aged woman. frankly i was afraid, and i didn't wish to scare my daughter anymore than she already was. i may go in the morning though.

(wheat) with another friend of the family, a farmer of over 30 years in the business. i positioned my truck directly in front of my friends truck awaiting a loaded combine. i then stepped out of the truck to make a phone call walking several paces away to escape some of the noise. after i had dialed my phone waiting for it to answer, i heard my friend yelling to me from 50 yards away and saw him pointing to the top of a hill of wheat stubble. he was trying to bring attention to a wolf he sighted that came into view just over the hill about 150 yards in front of us. i looked but did not see the wolf that quickly retreated back down the other side of the hill. it was nearing the end of the day and the sun had just fallen behind the tree line to the west. what did become apparent to me was a stationary yellowish object maybe the size of an aspirin at arms's length at 40 to 60 degrees from the top of the hill. i disregarded at first but pointed it out to the other driver muttering \"its kind of early for a star to be showing up\", and this not being my first unexplainable aerial object, i went about my business for a couple of minutes and noticed that the \"star\" had \"dropped\" a few degrees and it was then that i brought it to the drivers attention. as we were both watching it, it started moving, not in a quick flash or sudden motion, but in a smooth even acceleration towards the east until it just faded out of sight in the distance making no noise. i know that the horizon was fairly clear and the line of sight was about 75 to 100 miles toward montana, as we were at 3,000 feet at the time on a hill in a wheat field with an unfettered view to the east. i asked him as the object faded from view \"did we just see a ufo\"? he replied, \"i have seen this type of activity before in this region as i was farming several years ago about 25 or 30 miles from here where i saw a stationary object drop out of sight\". as we watched this object we agreed that the object may have been moving 600 to 800 mph what with the perspective and angle that it traveled.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

observations being a hiker and birdwatcher for 60 years---i recently purchased my first boat-- a 22ft bayliner cruiser and made a trip to the city and misjudged my time coming back to newburgh and by the time i got to the tappan zee bridge it was totally dark on the evening of wed aug 10 at about 8:30pm--as i passed under the bridge and left it behind i saw in the darkness ahead of me about a mile --right off the bank of ossining several hundred yards there were two red lights and three white lights traveling just about the speed of jetskis going back and forth on the water--there were no other boats in the whole area anywhere near--all i could see ahead of me was the expanse of dark water and these lights going back and forth just like jet skis racing with each other---as i proceeded north i said to myself --these guys must be crazy driving around at night on jetskis and i better not get to close to them--as i kept going north i veered to the left but as i got closer --to my surprise i could not see any body riding jetskis---only the lights that were racing back and forth--and these lights were not above the water line as i discovered when my curiosity made me go closer to see what in the hell is this---the closer i got i could see the lights were underwater as though someone was shining a flashlight up from below and circular about the size of a grapefruit--as i slowly approached closer to the lights which were moving very fast back and forth they suddenly came all together in a small circle about the size of a pizza and all of a sudden started spinning around each other and just disappeared-i must have been about 20 ft away looking right down at them in the water when that happened--i have never seen anything out of the ordinary in my whole life and have always been skeptical of all the reports of ufo's etc and now here i am having seen this unexplained phenomenon---the next day [thur]i saw a report on the ynn cable news that ossining had some problem with a

another car on this well-traveled through-way at least for another mile ahead of me or behind me (you travel down a kind of steep drop, so you can see a lot of the street).\r\n\r\nat the bottom of the slope i come upon marshall park which would be directly to your north and looking left out of your window.  marshall street is the major intersection here with the light and the area is composed of a lot of schools and open fields so you get a view of the sky.  anyway, i see a blinking light above marshall park; it couldn't have been anymore than 500 feet above me and no more than 300 feet north of my vehicle.  the blinking light was attached to an object whose shape couldn't be made out because the light was not unusually bright, nor was the object itself illuminated.\r\n\r\nbeing that the object wasn't moving erratically and kept on a straight path, i originally thought little of it.  what began to really catch my attention, though, was that this thing was moving parallel to my vehicle, and it began to pick-up speed at an unusual (but gradual) rate, definitely faster than any airplane could increase it's speed.  what really got me disturbed me, though, was that the interval of the blinking light on the object (about the same brightness, size, and color (white) of beacons on a plane wing or helicopter) was just ever so off, and unlike the beacon on a conventional aircraft which either strobe or slowly pulsate off and on, this blinking light would go completely out when it dimmed and then appear back on; it's the only way i can describe it, it simply wasn't a normal blinking light.  i noticed that i was beginning to get uncomfortable because i couldn't make sense of what this thing was.  \r\n\r\ni couldn't have been watching it for more than 30-40 seconds, and was reaching where the homes and the neighborhood come back up to saginaw street at the intersection of fairview when i also realized that this thing wasn't making any sound, at all.  this is when i totally ruled it out as a helicopter.  i began to lose the thing over the homes, businesses, and trees around frandor shopping center as it continued to accelerate.  i was so mesmerized with the thing that instead of stopping at planned at the mcdonald's at frandor shopping center, that i continued to try and follow the thing by continuing up saginaw street (instead of continuing down grand river avenue where the two split at the city borders), but neither street continues directly east so i began to lose the object.  last i saw it it had not just continued east but was now heading upward, but not at some unusual angle.  i estimated at 12:38 am that the object had to be somewhere over okemos or immediately to the east of there given the distance.\r\n\r\nto summarize, what i found odd about the object was the slightly-off blinking light, it's unusually straight eastward and upward path as if it was being pulled on a string, its unusual acceleration, and the fact that i didn't hear any kind of engine despite the thing being only a few hundred feet away from me and above me when i first saw it.  the object seemed to move so smoothly through the air as if completely unincumbered by friction.  it didn't seem to be subject to any physical laws.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

event and i must say i was awestruck, however upon further examining it is my conclusion that the supposed ufo's/orbs were not out of the world visitors, but instead they were straight from buckley air national guard, more specifically four (4) f-16's doing a flyover of the opening night monday football game of the denver broncos at the conclusion of the national anthem, as they have done for many years on the opening day football game. the kickoff was held shortly after 8 pm preceding the national anthem, and there was massive low cloud coverage over denver at that exact time, which later turned to rain. the visual ceiling for that night for ifr, and vfr flight was approximately 6500=7000 feet broken!  the f-16's were flying in formation with their navigation landing lights on, which may have given the illusion of bright white yellow orbs to those who were more than a mile away from the stadium. my direct vantage point was in westminster, looking south when i too saw this event around 8 pm! once the jets flew over the stadium they broke formation turned off their nav lights to form a staggered formation to return to base! i wish this was a true ufo sighting, but i am sorry

didn't look like planes flying in formation and the three lights made it an exact triangle. it was enormous. it was something and it was huge. i can't think of anything logical that it could have been. other than three planes flying in a triangle formation very slowly with bright lights which is very unlikely as this is a small rural town in central california. we also do not have any tall buildings or radio towers in that area. it is just flat and the sky was extremely clear. i am skeptical because i don't believe in ufos but i saw something very unusual.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

around. even the smells from the pastures and farms around my home were more pungent than i had ever noticed before. while taking my dog outside at around 10pm est, i heard unusual buzzing/humming noises behind the distant tree line to the north, though having an indiscernible point of reference. the sound was unlike anything i would knowingly recognize (e.G. commercial/private plane, ultralight plane, motorcycle, atv, etc.) the noise faded and, while i still stared in the general direction, a light source began to emerge as if rising up from behind the tree line, seeming to be an aircraft gaining altitude and moving closer.\r\n\r\nas the light source rose in elevation, it then moved distinctly upward and left from my viewpoint. at first i viewed it as a plane turning and climbing in altitude, yet it rose as rapidly as any aircraft i am aware of could have. it then seemed to fall back (or circle) into the same path line that i had seen it initially rise. the exact way it moved is difficult to describe; almost as if redirecting from its initially intended change in course of moving upward and left from my perspective,(with the initial course as rising above the tree line toward my general direction) to heading back in the general direction of the point i was viewing from. yet it made this course change with no marked path of redirection, as would be seen viewing any conventional aircraft; by which i mean no banked turn motion or circular turn path. \r\n\r\nthe light source was moving at such a slow pace i felt i had enough time to run inside and get my father to come out to view it, which i did. running back outside after yelling to my father i found the craft continuing on the same path in my general direction. my father came to my side and i simply told him to look in the direction from which the light source was approaching. he acknowledged the craft, but began to watch silently, almost with confusion. this was the same reaction i was experiencing. \r\n\r\nas it moved closer it became clear there were multiple lights, some pulsating inconsistently as well as emitting different colors. the colors ranged from yellow to orange to red and even blue, though the changes were almost instantaneous or unperceivable. the lights would pulse/blink in varying patterns as well, sometimes seemingly similar to the way roadwork arrow sign lights move when indicating direction. to both of us there was no distinguishable shape to whatever craft was emitting the lights, and to me it seemed to have an aura or rather a dark 'shadow' surrounding. while my father and i intermittently muttered back and forth about what we were seeing, i noted that there were no true 'strobe' lights coming from the source as there are on any regulated aircraft. he agreed but stated, \"what gets me is that it isn't making any noise, no noise at all.\"\r\n\r\ni hadn't even thought about that at first, possibly due to being sensory overloaded visually, but he was right. the craft, which at this point seemed almost directly overhead (some 75-85 degrees above the horizon) made no sound. no sound even after passing our position as a modern jet would have. at this point i did notice the sounds around our position. every dog, or at least it seemed every dog within my hearing distance, was going absolutely berserk, barking. i had completely forgotten about my own dog and realized that she was, as best i can describe, 'nervously pacing' back and forth in our driveway while whimpering. \r\n\r\nafter it���s passing of our position my father and i watched as the lights and patterns became less visible in the night sky until we lost sight completely due to the hilly terrain. the entire experience probably only lasted around five minutes, but it affected me in a way i cannot explain. in recollection, it seemed so low and so slow moving. yet nothing about the craft's altitude, shape, or speed was definitive. i wish i knew what we saw. the only absolute thing i can say is that i do not know what it was. i'm not saying i saw aliens in a distinctly shaped craft with definable attributes, but i, along with my father, most certainly viewed an unidentifiable flying object. i will most likely never again look at anything in the night sky without skepticism.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet,
