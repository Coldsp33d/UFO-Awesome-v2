of hellertown in pennsylvania. there we had witnessed an extraordinary sight that we could not explain. above the sky we had witnessed what appeared at first to be an odd plane- odd since the lighting on it did not seem to match anything that we had seen on planes around the area. we had pulled over on the side of the road to observe this strange light (yellow-gold in colour)which, as it had approached, appeared to have oscillating lights mounted on it's metallic hull. we had observed the object for an approximate 8-10 minutes when it had subsequently glided effortlessly over top of us, proceeding past the nearby treeline and off into the distance. the object seemed to be metallic in nature, with three couplings (think jet engine-esque) which appeared to house three large yellow-gold lights. upon observing the object past the treeline it appeared to begin making jerky movements overtop of the city of allentown close by. the object had dissappeared past the treeline from sight and we had decided to begin heading out when we had witnessed several more of the same type of yellow gold lights in the distance. these were dismissed as being planes at first but upon closer inspection these objects had the same strange oscillating light patterns that we had observed in the first object. we had observed these objects for quite some time, one of them had begun dimming and subsequently re-igniting so to speak in an apparent timed manner. the included microsoft paint doodle is the best rendition i can create of the underside of the craft that had passed over us. if

could see were 5 large lights ( blinding bright) that blinked from left to right continuously as if on a circlular object.  i pulled into the entry of the graveyard and got out of my car.  it was hovering at tree hight(60 to 80 foot tall pine trees) near the edge of the graveyard and almost above the only house on that side of the road at that time.  then it moved off and i jumped back in my car and followed it down the road as it moved just above the trees and power lines in a sort of swinging or zig zag movement while the white lights continued to blink in a spinning pattern.  i chased it for about 3/4 of a mile and then it moved out over fields toward i-85/40.  when i arrived at my business, just another 1/2 mile away, it was near 3:00 am.  i have been bothered by this for years

outside, and i was looking through our back door (faces south) and i could see a white orb hovering due south of us. i asked my mom to take a look at it, and she thought it was a plane, but i wasn't sure, so i ran back to my room to grab my new camcorder and then i ran back into the kitchen and looked at the clock because i broke my phone earlier, it said 9:16 pm edt. i stepped outside, and i walked to our back yard, on the edge of the field and started taking video. i could still see the white orb hovering above the tree line to my south. then a second object appeared out of nowhere, to my south-southeast, and began heading west at a pretty good speed, i'm guessing between 300 and 500 mph and was about 500 feet above the ground. it was fairly bright, it was white and did not pulsate or blink, but remained constant. it went behind a farm that had three large grain silos, but i never did see the object again, so obviously it disappeared behind the silos. the first object began to slowly move northeastward. it took roughly 10 minutes for it to travel from my due south to my due east. i turned around to check the sky to the north, and thats when i saw yet a 3rd object coming from the north, so i started walking fast to the north of our house, i stood there for about 2 or 3 minutes, and this object got closer to me, and thats when i realized that it was just a jet with it's landing lights on heading into the evansville airport. right then, a 4th object, a white orb appeared to my north. it was hovering above vincennes, in, between 200 and 500 feet in altitude. the 1st object was now to my east-northeast, and was still moving northeastwards. the 4th object was stationary for about 5 minutes, and then began to move westward. it moved west at about 100 mph, and remained at it's same altitude as it was when it was over vincennes. another 5 to 7 minutes past when it got to my north-northwest, where it began to rapidly descend and got very bright, about as bright as jupiter or venus. it then began to head back east, again at about 100 mph, but was much lower in altitude, less then 200 feet. this is where it gets a little strange. it started to descend to the north-northwest, to the point where it was at the tree line. then it went behind the trees, where i lost sight of it. that's when yet a 5th object appeared to the northwest, it appeared slightly orange, but mainly white, and was about 500 to 800 feet in altitude and was also heading east. shortly after, about a minute or 2 later, the 4th object reappeared above the tree line, as if it saw the 5th object approaching. then i saw a 6th orb, a very bright white light, that i saw for just a second, it came on, and went back off, but i know it was not a flare, because i watch f16's practice their dog fights during the day and at night, and i've seen them drop flares, they are orange and slowly descend, and last about 2 or 3 minutes. the 4th object picked up speed and started rapidly increasing in altitude and headed east about 50 or 100 mph. the 5th object quickly caught up to the other object, to the point where they were only about a mile and a half apart from each other. then both objects stopped, and hovered for about a minute, and object number 4 faded away, but the other object began moving eastward again. right then, i looked up and saw a triangular object, simalar to the other triangles that i've witnessed in the past. a red blinking light in the center, with 3 white lights (not blinking or pulsating) in a triangular formation. there were some pulsating lights on the rear, but i could not see a specific pulsating pattern, but they pulsated regularly at about once per second. this object was making a turn towards the left and was begenning to head north-northeast at about 200 or 300 mph, towards the white orb near vincennes, as if it was going to check out the orb. both objects were now heading northeast. i was filming for almost the entire time. from about 9:17 pm edt to 10:09 pm edt. i finally lost visual of the orb, and lost visual of the triangle about 5 minutes after i lost visual of the orb. i did not see anything afterwards. this was certainly the most objects i've ever witnessed in one night, in about an hour i saw about 4. i did manage to take 2 photos of orb number 4 to my north before my camera batteries died (i didn't bring any extra batteries) and i managed to take a very long video, (over 30 minutes long) although the majority of the objects did not show up in the video, at times i did actually get some of the objects on video (i don't remember exactly which ones i captured). i am hoping mufon can do some examining of my photos and video that i attempt to send in. i will have to send my video in some other time due to our very slow dial up internet connection, i will attempt to upload the 2 photos that i took. i looked at my photos and both photos do have what appears to be the white orb, it is almost in the very center of both photos, but you have to zoom in a few times in order to see it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:50:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional

(we were visiting my mother in law in oakland, tn but we lived in nashville at the time.) we were outside for about 10-15 minutes when on the horizon a bright orange light appeared out of nowhere right above the tree line in the field behind the house. it grew brighter to a rich amber color, then dimmed to a white light, all while hovering in the same place it first appeared. then, it began to move erratically, shooting straight up, straight down, and suddenly from side to side. it then proceeded to fly to our left (west toward memphis and the mississippi river), stopped over the field, and hovered there for 30-60 seconds. it then began flying toward us and flew diagonally above the house. we clearly saw three big lights and several smaller lights on the underbelly of the craft. it was clearly not an airplane for it had no wings and no tail- it was a solid craft in a triangular shape. it flew very close to us, yet we heard no noise coming from it. we could not believe what we were seeing with our own eyes.\r\n\r\nwe watched the craft until it was out of eyesight. it flew southwest toward memphis/mississipi. we sat on the back porch again completely shocked and astonished over what we had just seen. it was difficult to accept. not two minutes later another light appeared in the same spot the first one appeared, and it did the exact same thing as craft #1. it began as an orange light that quickly grew brighter into an amber color, then dimmed to a white light- all while hovering in the same spot. it also flew west, stopped, and hovered in the exact same spot over the field as the first. the field where they appeared and then proceeded to hover over is behind the house which is on a five acre lot. this field that is behind the house is a total of 296 acres of unoccupied farmland. craft #2 hovered in that field for 60-90 seconds before flying erratically around, appearing to bounce around in the night sky. then it flew directly west across the horizon.\r\n\r\nwhile craft #2 was still in view, a third craft appeared in exactly the same spot and same fashion. it appeared as an orange light, grew to a bright amber, then into a bright white light, flew west and hovered over the same spot in the field as the others. it hovered there for 2-3 minutes. again, it began to also move erratically like it was dancing in the sky. it flew in pretty much the same flight path as craft #1, diagonally over the house. we could clearly see the underbelly lights and it���s triangular shape. like the first, it produced minimal to no noise. diagonally it was about 1- 1.5 football fields away.\r\n\r\nat this point we were in complete shock and disbelief. i called my friend (name withheld) to describe the three crafts we had seen. while on the phone with her, a fourth craft appeared in the exact same manner as the first three. it followed the same path as craft #2 which flew directly west across the horizon. while watching craft #4, a fifth craft flew from the west over our heads due east. it was less than a football field above us and was about 15 degrees lower than being directly above our heads. this craft was the one we could see the clearest with our own eyes. it was a triangular craft with three white lights in the middle, and blue and red lights on the sides. even though it was so close to us, we still heard no noise.\r\n\r\nat that point, my mother in law got binoculars for us to use. the crafts kept appearing in the exact same fashion. over the course of one and a half hours, we saw a total of 33-35 crafts. i kept count until we reached the 30th craft, and we saw several more after that. at the time we saw the 20th to 21st craft, we could see six in the sky at one time. three were hovering for several minutes right above the tree line, so still they could be mistaken for stars. the three others were flying in the sky. we began looking at the crafts through binoculars starting with the 6th craft. my husband and i each saw around 20 crafts through the binoculars. we could see them very clearly. approximately half the crafts were in a triangular shape and the other half were circular in shape. the triangular shaped crafts had three lights in the middle while red and blue lights on the edges, and the circular shaped crafts had one light in the middle with white, red, and blue lights around the circumference. crafts #1 and #3 flew southwest towards memphis/ mississippi, most of the crafts including #2 and #4 flew directly west towards memphis/ arkansas, one flew directly south toward mississippi, and a couple flew east toward nashville.\r\nthe crafts began appearing pretty quickly from about the 10th craft on, with six being seen at one time around the 20th craft. after about the 20th craft, they began slowing down in their appearance and we began seeing about three to four in the sky at one time. around 11:00 pm i had counted 30 crafts. we went inside around 15 minutes later, and one appeared right before we went in. there���s no telling when they stopped.\r\ni am in shock and in disbelief, but i know what we saw. it truly was the weirdest night of my life!\r\n\r\nthat was the actual written account the morning after the incident. the day after the sightings my husband and i put on old clothes, got our dog and camera ready, and set out on a journey to find the area where most of the crafts appeared from. we found the field and were pleasantly surprised to find evidence. among the green grass field, we found three distinct spots that were abnormal. they were large, swirled patterns of dead grass. we took lots of pictures and video. that night we decided to camp out again to see if they returned. they sure enough did! we had our binoculars and video camera. the video camera picked up the lights in the sky and our audio story as we saw the crafts, but it isn't the best quality visually. one of the crafts that night flew directly over the house from the back door to the front door due south, only about 300 feet above our heads. again, we could clearly see details of the triangular craft. we also could see details with our binoculars. this event has changed our lives.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

closer to our house. i was upstairs at this time and informed my husband of this. we got the kids and went downstairs. the light was so bright and big and almost to our house. it was silent. by the

reading about a sighting in fairless hills in the local newspaper a day or so earlier about a man seeing an object in the sky. the date i submitted is not approximate as i cannot remember even what month this was. my wiper blade flew off and radio died. it was sprinkling so i pulled into the turning lane. i got out and instinctly looked up at it without even looking for my wiper. i did not know it was there before i looked up. it was huge--wider then 2-3 football fields. i could see windows. i called for my mother in law to get out and look up. she saw it too and i must have asked her 100 times if she really see's it and asked her to describe what she saw. she described exactly what i was seeing. what i did not understand was why no-one else was pulling over because it was clearly visible right above the trees and this major roadway which was very busy with traffic and why was this huge object not making any noise. it stood stationary for about 10 minutes then it abruptly too off so fast that the only thing we could make out was a colorful snake-like trail. we jumped in the car an sped to follow it. we lost sight of it just before reaching morrisville, pa. it simply disappeared in the sky. i pulled over to collect my thoughts and i could not validate what this object was. \r\ni could not sleep as i felt like something was watching me. i'd open my eyes to find nothing there. the very next night i had the same sensation and opened my eyes. right next to my bed were 3 beings. each one a different size. i immediately panicked and slid sideways til i was under my husband screaming. i believe i was abducted as i remember details but will not go into that on here. after that experience, i remember being in my bed once more and i slid sideways under my husband and was screaming. he awoke and told me i had a nightmare & to go back to sleep. \r\nthere has got to be more witnesses to this sighting besides the two of us.

\"neon-green\" light low in the sky to my northwest, coming from the direction of phoenix. thought it was a helicopter at first, because it was so low, and too slow moving to be a plane. i proceeded to get the trashcan from around the other side of the garage and returned to my front door. as i turned to open the lid of the trashcan i had been pulling behind me, the bright green light again caught my attention, as it was on a path that was approaching my home, but would pass to the north of it.\r\n\r\nas i was noticing that there were still no strobe lights flashing as you see on any other helicopters, a brilliant red light that was smaller than but directly above the neon-green light came on. the red light took about 1/2 second to get to full brightness, then stayed bright for about 3/4 of a second, then gradually diminished over another 1/2 second and went out. the red light continued doing this over and over for as long as i could see it, until both of the lights disappeared over the tops of my neighbors homes.\r\n\r\nthe bright neon-green light never dimmed or brightened from its original high intensity. when the lights had reached a point slightly east of directly north of me here, they  suddenly \"zigged\" to a more directly southern direction, and continued that way in a straight line until out of my sight.There was no arc to the turn, it looked more like a ricochet movement, as if they had bounced off of something in the sky and continued on without slowing down. this happened when the red light happened to be at full brightness, and so it was easy to see the sudden change in direction.\r\n\r\nthe lights never got closer to, nor farther apart from each other as they flew, so i believe the lights were both attached to a single object, but i could not see the shape of it because of the brightness of the lights.\r\n\r\nwhen it was closest to me (about 1/4 to 1/2 mile)at about 300 to 400 feet in altitude, just before the turn to the south, i could see that the green light was much larger than a light on any aircraft could possibly be. i would estimate 25 to 30 feet in diameter. i kept listening for the sound of a helicopter anyway, and heard no noise whatsoever!\r\n\r\ni didn't report this or mention it to anyone else, because i had just filed a report (my first to mufon) with you of a sighting i had the evening before. this was a completely different sighting in almost the exact opposite part of the sky, and nothing was the same about it except the brilliant red color.\r\n\r\ni felt like \"oh no. here we go again! two sightings in two days! now even the people who believed me the first time are going to think i'm nuts!\"\r\n\r\nby the time i realized this was something strange again, i had no time to go get the camera. believe me, i didn't want to admit that this, too, was something strange i had seen in the sky and couldn't explain normally. that's why i kept listening, almost praying that i would hear the noise of a helicopter. \r\n\r\nwhen i heard about the similar green lights that have been seen and reported to you several times in the last couple of days in this area, i thought you should know, in case it would help you to know that those people making those reports weren't crazy. it is out there flying around, whatever it is. and whatever it is, it's not something i've ever seen before. and its dead-quiet.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

if it happened today. i am a single male father with 3 children, 2 were present that day.\r\n\r\nwe went to experience the military air show at alvin calendar field, naval air base, located on belle chase highway south of belle chase, louisiana. the sky was so bright that day, even with my dark lense sun glasses i could not look up at the sky / flight show for more than about 1 minute, then have to look down and give my eyes a break. thed sky was perhaps the clearest that i have ever see.\r\n\r\n1st sighting:\r\nduring a sky diving demonstration while looking almost straight up i noticed a quick flash like sun reflection from the corner of my vision which was about 1/2 mile in distance south of the sky divers. i looked and clearly saw 4 metal saucer shaped craft moving slowly parallel to the sky divers. i had to look away monentarily because of the extremely bright sky. when i looked back they seemed to have left the area. i asked everyone around me if they had seen any of these saucer craft but everyone denied seeing anything.\r\n\r\n2nd sighting:\r\nacross the field where the airport runways are is a tree line. about one hour later i saw 4 saucer shaped craft moving quickly over the tops of this tree line. they seemed to be about 30 to 50 feet above the tree tops and i estimate their speed at about 150 mph. i began to grab people around me and point at these saucer craft to get a wittness that could verify what i was seeing. after showing some 8 to 10 people and the crafts were out of sight, not one of these cowards would say they saw them. i was disgusted and confused with my fellow americans narrow mindedness and lack of a spine.\r\n\r\n3rd & final sighting:\r\nthe soldiers put on a mock combat landing exercise from several huey helicopters. the huey's came in front of us in a line about 20 feet above the ground. each huey took a turn circling towards us in a fish hoof type pattern then landed, the soldiers quickly jumped off and formed a perimeter with the huey quickly taking off anf flyinf away. as the second huey came around to land i became aware of a saucer craft hovering about 10 feet above the ground directly behind the landing huey. this one was close and very clear to see. i was thinking that this time the craft was so obviously in our face so to speak that everyone simply had to see it.\r\n\r\ni don't know if it cloaked or quickly flew away, but as i looked down at my children to tell them about it, aprox. 5 seconds passed, i looked back up and it was gone. i asked if anyone around me wanted to say they did not see that, and everyone denied seeing it.\r\n\r\ni have been telling this story to my family for years with no wittness to colaberate it. my daughter and i were going through our old family photos today and she found several pics from that day at the air show. i don't remember having a camera but i think my son was taking the pictures that day. as we started looking at these pics, we could see many unconventional and saucer craft. in one pic my daughter counted 15 of these ufo's.\r\n\r\nthese pictures are very good quality but the ufo's are small ranging from completely solid metal objects to semi-transparent saucer craft. also, there are some bright orbs that are both trailing and at the front of the blue angels jet aircraft. \r\n\r\ni scanned a few of these pics with my scanner at very high resolution and many of the craft are undemiably there, but others are in need of someone with more skills to clean up the images. i have all the originals that you can take if you wish to have them analyzed and/or cleaned up to bring out the many ufo's that i can't get clear resolution of.\r\n\r\ni wish i had seen these pics back when this happened and could have contacted you, but i am offering them to you now.\r\n\r\none additional note: as we were leaving the airfield i struck up a conversation with a usmc security guard. i told him what i saw and asked if they recorded any of these craft on their radar. he became sharp with me and said you did not see anything like that here. 3 other guards walked up and laughed at me and began to ridicule me as if i were a 5 year old child. i am a veteran of the marine corps and know this kind of behavior was totally inappropriate and not tolerated from any marine when i was enlisted.\r\n\r\nsincerely;\r\n\r\n[name

away from home.  nobody was there because it was at night, but there was a lot of moonlight and i could see plenty well enough to skate. i took my boots off and put on my new skates. after skating around for a few minutes, i noticed a light in the sky that didn't quite fit in with the rest of the lights in the sky. i stopped skating and looked directly at it, trying do get an id. it was stationary at first and then it appeared to come directly towards me for about a half a second. then it stopped and hoovered. i could not figure out what it might be. then it started it's manovers. it would excellerate half way across the sky, then stop abrubtly. then it seemed to drop down and swoop up like a bird landing on a branch. then it would streek acros the sky and change directions without loosing it's incredible speed. after about 30 seconds of this, i got very scared and ran home. in fact, i was so scared i forgot to take my new skates off and grab my boots. i ran a block on concrete sidewalks and damaged my skate blades. my mom was ferious about the skates and did not believe i got scared of a light. i did not bring up the subject again.\r\n\r\n i was a student of avaiation and i knew it was not a helecopter, blimp, ballon, satellite, rocket, missle, aircraft, fireworks or anything i could dream up.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

120 degree turn to the left.  my friend saw something in the sky and told me to look, i turned and looked at a 60 degree angle up to my left and saw three lights in a triangular shape. my friend then turned an looked back at the craft and he saw a very large object in the sky hovering over the treetops on the left side of the road.  it then hovered across the road and turned slightly exposing large white blinding lights along with a strange blue and green light on the front of the craft. we were then expecting to see a large explosion or see this craft on the ground as soon as we turned the next right hand corner.  as we turned the corner there was absolutely no sight of the craft, we have absolutely no idea or any explanation of the whereabouts of this strange craft.
