one star glowing really bright. i went outside to look at it and the second i went outside, i saw what appeared to be two red orbs floating up above my fence line. they were going up in a wave like pattern. at first, the only logical possibility i thought was maybe a weather balloon with flares or something, but these things were moving thousands of feet in seconds, and gracefully. i ran inside and woke up my wife. when we went back outside the orbs were brighter and were still going up, but in more of a straight line. one was a little bit behind the other and started fading. by the time the one faded away the other one started fading. when i could barely see it, it started changing direction and got bigger. i realized that it was getting bigger because it lowered and it came down to where it was about the size of a dime. it changed direction and glided right above us. when it got to it's closest point you could clearly see a disk shape with about fifteen or twenty red lights lining the edge of it, glowing the bottom a little bit.  it looked like gravity had absolutely no affect on it. it was completely silent. if it was a plane or helicopter we would have easily heard it, and i have never seen a plane or helicopter shaped like that before. we watched it as it got brighter and moved faster. it went over us 19, and after it got to the point to where my roof was blocking our view we ran out front. when we got there it disappeared. i'd like to note that every time it changed direction, moved faster, or raise it got brighter. almost like the brightness was linked to it's energy use.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional

the earth being the focal point of where a lot of light or lighting followed 15-30 minutes latter. to start this i would like to say that i know aliens exist. my manager wasn't sure to mention it at work, but then i surprised him with little images i drew with a marker to tell him what i saw fire off into the distance at crown hill after 8pm when i was out for a walk. he & others might think their alien but i don't believe this.\r\n\r\ni'll explain\r\n\r\nat crown hill maybe a block from the tower of memories that giant cremation tower near the public lake theirs a cemetery. i saw 4 moving objects. first hey were lighting up then dimming down. they disappeared then reappeared one after another so i think their was no more then 5. then these object's came to form like a +, no not a plus i mean they were moving in a circle as if on  wheel. they formed tails when they moved together, then they came to form a cross.  \r\n\r\nthey moved & became like discs but like baby galaxies\r\nit didn't seem like technology but something in nature. not like the wind but very supernatural. (not devin)\r\n\r\nthese galaxies reminded me of the falun wheel, in falun dafa's teachings of the buddha school. i think their a warning for human kind or for those who witnessed them not to miss the truth  that people don���t see with distractions in our world these days.\r\n\r\ni know their are aliens but i don't care. i cultivate buddha hood so theirs an issue of nobility. this takes great importance to me so i wanted to share.\r\n\r\nanyways my name is jerrod i witnessed this & wanted to share\r\nit was north of wheat ridge as if 50 or a 100 miles away yet they were still visible as they descended fading from their flam likeness before seeming to hit the groined. then light was flashing maybe like silent lightning. i saw a black helicopter flying that way 15 minutes latter..\r\n\r\nif people are covering up these things i find it ridicules!\r\nhuman beings are very special & we have nothing to gain by working with the grays. human beings can cultivate buddha hood & return to the heavens yet those beings belong just down here! this is my thought of the 4 changing objects that left tails when moving as ball's & formed into a cross then turned into discs like the ones shown in falun buddha law.\r\n\r\nthese thoughts are my own. falun dafa healed my spine from scoliosis many years ago so i can walk full time. it teaches truth-compassion-tolerance\r\n\r\nthank

away in the opening of our garage door.  i quickly told her what happened, relocated the object and had her fixated on it.  within several seconds, the objected pulsated again in the exact same manner.  my wife witnessed it and couldn't believe it either.  once again it returned to the satellite-like object and continued it's path.  we followed it until it was out of site.\r\n\r\nso again, the pulse occurred twice, each within 30 seconds of each other and each lasting for approximately 1 second.  i know of no other object that can do what this object did at that altitude and to that degree of brightness.  the altitude was much greater than that of an airplane or helicopter.  there was no sound, no other colors and no blinking lights.\r\n\r\nto note, before i submitted this report today, i performed a search in the mufon database.  there is an identical report on the exact same day in ga.  you may want to attempt to triangulate the time and location between our two events so that we can confirm the path of the object and determine if they indeed are the same.  thank you.","distance":"Over One

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Hello guys,\r\nthis is kind of a long story, spanning the last 4 years, but i'll do my best to explain. my grandparents own a farm in drakes branch, virginia. my father, my uncles and i all hunt on this land every year. mainly for turkey and dear, but we do shoot the occasional bear too. about 3 and a half to 4 years ago, we started to sew crops and put up digital game cameras throughout the property. for the first 3 years we had the cameras activated, all we ever recorded were some nice bucks, more than a few doe, and a couple black bears from time to time. about a year ago, that all changed.\r\nwe started getting some really weird photos last year with those game cameras (some of which i have attached) and my purpose of writing to you now is to see if someone can offer a reasonable explanation as to what is happening.\r\ni must say that we've never shook hands with aliens, our houses aren't haunted and we've never eaten lunch with bigfoot. so we are all skeptical about these photos. however, there is enough documentation on our end to say that \"something\" is definitely happening and we're so curious as to what it is, that we have decided to explore all possibilities, even the more exotic ones. with that said, let me explain some of the weirdness and allow you to form an opinion of your own.\r\nthe cameras we use are moultrie 4mpx digital game cameras. we have 3 of them in total. they were placed in 3 separate corners of the farm. the cameras have only 2 ways they can be triggered. the first way is with movement. the second way is with a heat signature. the cameras have an infrared sensor on them that detects variations in temperature. but the manual to the cameras says that both sensors (movement and infrared) are only good for about 45 feet away. anything further out than 45 feet should \"technically\" not trigger the camera to take a photo. however, we started getting photos of some really crazy looking \"orbs\" (for lack of a better word) on only 1 of the cameras we had setup. the photos were very strange considering the fact that whatever had triggered the camera appeared to be at least 250+ feet away. we erased the images and changed the cameras around so that an identical type, but totally different camera, was placed in the spot that we had taken the strange photos. then the \"broken\" camera (we thought it must have had a defect) was switched to the spot we had taken the \"different\" camera from. of course the broken camera was not broken at all, and ceased to take pictures of anything out of the ordinary once it was switched. it did capture many pictures, but only of the passing dear or bear. the pics were perfectly clear and had nothing in them that looked like what we had seen the same camera take photos of when it was in the other spot.\r\nwell, the photos of the strange lights didn't stop with the different camera. actually, they became more frequent once the newer camera was placed in the sweet-spot. we began to accumulate even more strange photos of these orbs, as well as some light phenomenon that isn't spherical, so i can't call it an orb. these photos we did not erase. we kept them because of the same reason the cat got killed, curiosity. playing the detectives, we immediately switched the 3rd and final camera we had to the spot the photos were being taken, and in turn, we moved the 2nd camera which had captured these images to another spot. this, of course, resulted the same way as when we switched the cameras the first time.\r\nwe caught a few more images but then the images abruptly stopped. well, we did capture \"normal\" photos, but nothing out of the ordinary. the abnormal images did start up again, but only after about a month or so. during that month of downtime, we started examining the photos more closely and realized that there seemed to be a cycle. the one thing the photos all had in common was that they only occurred in low light. you can see a country-mile in the full moonlight. but the lights never came on nights where there was a full moon. nor a half moon! the only time it happened was when there was little to no light in the fields. however, some nights we had a bigger moon and the lights did come, but it was extremely overcast and no moonlight could be seen. other than that, there appears to be no rhyme nor reason as to when the lights will occur. but we do know where. they always occur in the same field between sun down and sun up.\r\nbefore the lights kicked-up again. we invested in some better cameras. the newer cameras had the same sensor detection, but these new cameras were 8mpx and had the ability to take video. the new cameras also had a feature that helped our cause greatly. they had a battery that held for (up to) 1 year. however, when we set the video cameras, the batteries began to deplete almost instantly. sometimes we would have dead batteries within a few days. other times it would take a few weeks. but regardless, the batteries would be dead in no more than a month. we had bought 3 of these video cameras in total. so we decided to start putting more than one in the area of the phenomenon. what resulted was the batteries in all cameras dieing within days. also we had a few cameras cease to operate at all, totally fried! this did not stop the fact that the phenomenon was still being captured with the still cameras. no battery problems or malfunctions with them.\r\nwe then saw some pics that really were cool. the still camera had captured a black bear that was no more than 5 feet away from the camera, but there was an orb behind the bear. we also have a pic that looks as if there is \"something\" (not going to speculate here) in the lower half of the light-beam. very strange, in deed, but not even close to evidence of the paranormal. after all, it could be some weird weather condition or something of the sort causing these strange lights.\r\nthen one day, we were talking to my grandmother, who is very old but well within the sane-range. she told a very odd story that captivated our imaginations in such a way that we started actually considering something other than a natural reason for the lights. she told us a story about when she was only a little girl and had lived only 200 yards from the spot where the photos were being captured. she explained that her and her sister had seen the same strange lights in that field and had always been frightened of them. her recollection of the lights was vague, but she did remember one event that she said she'd never forget. one night the lights had been particularly bright. her and her sister were so scared that they had huddled together under the covers of their bed. in the morning, they had ventured in to the field and discovered their uncle had died in the barn of a heart attack. they immediately told their mother who, in turn, called their father to investigate the situation. their father found the body of his brother and uttered only a small sentence, that my grandmother said she'd never forgotten. he said \"must have seen what was makin' those lights out here!\". that story was so amazing to us that we decided that if \"we\" couldn't get better evidence and solve the mystery, maybe it'd be better to ask the professionals. so that is why i am contacting you now.\r\nsome of our better photos are still on the sd card from the cameras. so i couldn't show you one photo in particular that is pretty awesome. it shows extremely bright lights in the field. but they must be 200 yards in the distance, which is impressive, considering we know these cameras like the backs of our hands, and it seems impossible to us that photos would be taken of something so far in the distance. i'm sure we have new photos as well, but we have to wait until the data is retrieved from the cameras, which are active at this time.\r\nmy father also noticed a few places in the field where there are cylindrical depressions in the ground accompanied by dead vegetation. we don't want to jump to conclusions, but it is what it is.\r\nthe phenomenon only seemed to occur during the autumn and winter months. but that's probably because we only use the game cameras at that time. it is almost that time again and we'd really like a better explanation as to what is happening. if someone out there has any idea, please let us know. i'm currently in germany preparing for a european tour with my band. my father asked me to contact you because he has no idea how to use a computer. i have included the appropriate contact information in the above fields.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"12:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":31788,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.9175966514068,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09132011-0009","longitude":-78.53220904857116,"occurred":1285916400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,

between 9:30 - 9:40 p.M.\r\n\r\nmy 12 year old son and i were walking our dog around our neighborhood and when we almost reached the end of a court, i happened to look up into the south sky and noticed a very brilliant star-like light approaching( heading north ).  it looked slightly smaller than a golf ball from where we were standing.  i told my son to look at it.  we were both stunned and we both started saying \"wow... what is that ?\"  \"oh... my god !\" etc.  i said, \"that is definitely a u.F.O.\" and he agreed, as we had never seen such a large orange/amber moving star-like object like this, in our lives !  it was coming toward us and i grabbed my son's arm and started backing up because it was very different, so i thought it could be dangerous.  we both just starred at it as it seemed to hover in one spot for a while, and then it began to arc( take a curved path ) toward the east.  as we watched, it began to slowly shrink / dim out.  it looked as though it was getting smaller and less bright until it was just a dot without any light at all... and then it vanished.  we did not lose sight of it, it just disappeared !  then my son yelled out that there was another one.  i looked around and seen the exact same thing, in the exact same area that we seen the first one.  again...  it was slightly smaller than a golf ball, extremely bright... brilliant.  it looked like a huge orange/amber moving star, just like the first one did, and it also seemed to stop and hover, but this one moved slightly slower than the first one, but it did everything else the same. ( no blinking lights, did not blink, just brilliant ( flickering ? ) bright orange / amber light... like a huge star )  it started to arc toward the east and then started shrinking / dimming... until it looked like a dot in the sky, without any light... and then it was gone.  vanished !!!  just like the first one did.  we waited to see if another one would appear, but did not see anything, so we ran home with our dog and told my husband what we had seen.  he asked us to show him where we had seen it ( all the while making fun of us ), so we ( my husband, son, dog and i )went back outside, and my husband noticed a star-like ( slightly larger than a large star ) moving object, up in the sky, moving from west to east.  when he pointed it out to me, i told him it was the same color, but much, much smaller        ( farther away ).  my husband is a major skeptic ( engineer ), but he did take a picture with his cell phone camera ( yet to see the pic ).  he also did make the remark that the color was unusual, and he did not believe it was an airplane or a helicopter.  he also said he had never seen anything like it.  i told him that what he was seeing was sooooo much smaller       ( farther away ), that it was not as shocking as the first two that my son and i had witnessed.  we ended up losing sight of this \"far away\" one, so my husband did not see it shrink / dim out and disappear, but at least he did see the orange / amber color of it.  we then took him to the exact spot that the first two appeared at.  we did not see them again.\r\nthis was a very strange sighting that my son and i will never forget !!!\r\nif there is anyone else in the canton, mi area that has also witnessed this /these u.F.O.S, please feel free to contact me.\r\n\r\n

across the back field (approximately 500ft). they watched it move across the sky from the south-east, and watched until it disappeared over the north north-west horizon. my mother says the orb was approximately the size of a small house, and was at a distance of about ��� mile. during the time the orb moved through the sky, it slowly dimmed to black, then returned to its original, brilliant orange. \r\n\r\nthe boys (ages 12 and 13) ran back home and told me what they had seen. i expressed disappointment that i had not seen the object and told them the next time they see something like that, to come and tell me. about ten minutes later, one of the boys came in crying, saying there was a ufo outside. i looked out the window and told my husband to grab the camera.\r\n\r\nas soon as i got outside i was amazed by how brilliant the orange orbs were. my nephew and i ran out into the pasture to get a clear view away from the trees. there were four brilliant orange orbs, slowly flying west, approximately 500-1000ft above us, within a quarter of a mile. they moved silently ��� three of them in a perfect triangle formation, with a fourth orb off the lower left. \r\n\r\nwe watched the objects for approximately 10 minutes, until they slowly dimmed to a blue-white, and then to black. this was just after sunset, and the moon was bright, making it difficult to track their movement after they finally faded to black. during the last few minutes that we were able to track them, they appeared to be solid black spheres.\r\n\r\nmy husband was able to take a few photographs, but the night-vision setting obscured the photographs. he was only able to get one good picture, which does not show the fourth orb off to the lower-left. the orbs look elongated in the photo because the camera was shaking.\r\n\r\ni was excited, because my brother and nephew are always spotting ufos in the area, and i never get to see them. i go to sleep early, so i don���t get to do much sky-watching. my nephew ran out into the field, waving and shouting, trying to get them to land. my husband was simply dumbfounded, being totally unable to explain what he was witnessing.\r\n\r\ni am an air force veteran, and former aircrew. my husband is still in the military and is also aircrew. we both have many years of experience observing aircraft. neither my husband nor i, were able to attribute the orbs to any known aircraft.\r\n\r\nin the following weeks, we have witnessed similar orange orbs flying across the horizon at a distance. the objects are orange with none of the standard aircraft lights. the objects can be tracked across the horizon until they slowly fade to blue-white, and then black, over a period of about five minutes. my husband, who is flight-crew, cannot explain the slow dimming of these lights to any type of military procedure. \r\n\r\nspotting these orange orbs in the early evening is now common-place, and no one gets too worked up about it when they���re spotted. in fact, i���ve told my nephew not to bother alerting me unless he sees them doing something out of the ordinary.  \r\n\r\ni would like to add that in the early 1990���s, about 10 members of my family saw a triangle ship with red lights (three on each end and one in the center), hover above the back woods (approximately 1/4 mile away at 200ft). the object spun slowly for about 5 minutes, and then shot straight up into the air in an instant. \r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

to try some digital astrophotography.  this fact really has nothing to do with what i saw other than it is why i was outside at the time.  i was with my daughter, who is 4 in my front yard.  it is the best place to use my telescope when i use it at home because i am somewhat shielded from street lights.  i am not an expert in aircraft, or satellites, or meteors and meteorites, but i am very confident in my ability to identify objects i see in the sky by those categories.  i have even managed to see a weather balloon on the horizon.  it is not abnormal for me to be outside looking at the sky.  literally every time the sky is clear at night, i am looking up.\r\n\r\nat about 9:45 pm, i had just managed to connect my digital camera to my telescope.  i was getting ready to practice tacking photos of stars, and later on that night if i could stay up late enough i planned to try and photograph m31.  i noticed out of the corner of my eye a light.  it was in between the roof of my house and my neighbors roof in the distance.  where i noticed it first was in the vicinity of polaris moving from west to east pretty slowly.  it was bright red, maybe with a little orange.  i am not sure how to describe what i saw perfectly, but this should help you understand.  my first thought was that it must be the iss.  it seemed bigger and the color was and brightness were way off, but the way it consistently moved across the sky was similar to a satellite or the iss.  i watched it for probably 45 seconds until i decided it was odd enough to go inside and get my wife.  so my daughter and i went in to get her, and when we came back outside, i was unable to locate it again.  after a minute or two of discussion, she went back inside and my daughter and i went back to the telescope.  i thought that it could possibly have been the space station or a satellite that just happened to catch sunlight in a way that would cause what i saw, and didn't think much more of it. approximately 10 mintutes after the first sighting, my daughter, who had apparently been staring where we had seen it the first time, called out to me that she saw it again.  i looked, and sure enough at pretty much the same starting point as before, the exact same thing was there, moving in the same direction, west to east at the same speed.  this time i really tried to get a feel for what it was, and again i really couldn't come up with a good answer.  so again, i went to get my wife, and when we returned, it was gone.  \r\n\r\nafter thinking about it for a while, i checked online to see sighting times and locations of the iss, and some satellites.  nothing i found matched the time and location.  running over scenerios of things that may be able to create what i saw, i thought it was possible that they may be some sort of chinese lantern.  when i say this, i don't want it to sound convincing though.  because i am not convinced that is what i saw.  so the next day i reached out to some people in the astronomy community, and we came to the same conclusion together.  it must have been some sort of chinese lantern.  on a side note, i live close to a major airport, and the 171rst air refueling wing of the airforce, and the 911th airwing as well.  so between all of this, i just put it aside in my head as something explainable by something along the lines of airports being close by or chinese lanterns. \r\n\r\naugust 12, 2011\r\n\r\nabout 4 weeks later, on august 12th, at about 9:00pm i was in geneva, ohio.  my wife, and daughters were eating at an outdoor restaurant (old firehouse winery) when again i noticed the same light moving through the sky.  this time i was able to show my wife.  the light was moving almost directly overhead, this time east to west.  i watched it until it dissapeared behind some trees about 30 seconds later.  i started explaining that i had seen it before, and that it was strange to see it again.  about 5 or so minutes had gone by, and it again drifted out of the conversation when i looked up, and saw it again.  in the same path and trajectory, with the same color and speed.  \r\n\r\ni personally ruled out the space station or shuttles.  i am completely convinced it was not a satellite.  it was definitely not a meteor or meteorite.  i am not sure what it was to be honest.  it has been weighing on my mind for a month now.  i usually have no trouble identifying what i see in the sky.  i doubt that this story in itself is spectacular enough to really warrant your attention.  however, maybe others have seen the same thing, and this could help determine what was seen.

just off 44th and pecos.  when we rounded the corner and faced due south we both saw three brightly lit orbs to the south south west leaving what looked like tails of sparks flying over the tree tops.  our first reaction was one of disbelief and excitement.  they were some distance away, anywhere from 500-1500' agl, and appeared to be near the mile high football stadium during a broncos game.  one of them appeared to be falling, or stationary while the other two were changing directions and flying around each other.  they left brilliant trails of sparks, and their movements were smooth and gentle.  i have seen footage on you tube from oxford uk and california that matched what we saw tonight.\r\n\r\nwe were driving towards the lights, and eventually lost sight of the objects through the trees, and stopped the car to find a better vantage point.  i had line of sight on them for a good 45 seconds out of a minute or two we were observing them.  i called 911 to report what i was seeing and make sure there was a log of our sighting.  we knew what we were looking at when we saw it- just like the footage we have seen of ufo's elsewhere.  the only thing that might explain what happened is if it were somehow part of the halftime show, but honestly, i don't think this small town has the sack to pull something like that off.\r\n\r\ni hope we are not the only ones to see this- and i

very large, bright blue orb traveling at a steady, slow rate from north to south and approximately 10 degrees below the elevation moon.  when the object had passed approximately 7-10 degrees to the southern side of the moons path, it stopped and hovered, and appeared to remain motionless for approximately 2-3 minutes.  \r\n\r\nafter the time of remaining motionless, it then moved from it's position northward along the same elevation...At quick, but steady pace...And covered approximately 15 degrees of arc over perhaps 5-7 seconds.  it then stopped to the northern side of the moons path, and hovered in that position for perhaps another 3 minutes. it was in this position that i was able to capture the pictures of the object with my phone. \r\n\r\nthe object then simply disappeared from view.  no flash, pulse,movement,  or anything...It just disappeared. \r\n\r\nthe object was larger than any star or planet....Approximately 1/8 to 1/6 the diameter of a full moon.  it's color was an extremely bright blue, and it seemed to have an irregular pulsing in intensity.  i am positive there is no possibility of this being a mistaken star, planet, weather balloon, airplane, or helicopter of any kind  the skies tonight were crystal clear, cloudless, and without any heat distortion.\r\n\r\nthere was no sound emitted of any kind.\r\n\r\ni have no way to estimate the object size, distance, or altitude as it appeared as just a glowing orb hovering in the air. \r\n\r\ni'm a pretty avid star gaze and satellite watcher, and in twenty years of looking up, i've never seen anything like ithis before.  what first caught my eye was the brightness and size of the thing.  it couldn't be missed if you looked up in it's direction.  it actually had the kind of appearance of what pictures of earth taken from outer space look like...An intensely bright blue orb.   truthfully, it caught me off guard, and it took a couple minutes for me to process that i was seeing something i couldn't explain.  fortunately, i dug out my phone and captured the pictures attached.  the photos were taken with an iphone 3gs.\r\n\r\nwe're used to seeing all kinds of military aircraft around this area, but there is no way in hell this was a plane, helicopter, or ariel flare.  i'm hoping others in the area saw it too, because it was so bright, clear and visible that if someone looked up, it couldn't be missed. \r\n\r\nanyhow, i have no idea what it was, but i've never seen anything like it in my life.
