tree line. it did not move or blink or make any noise. i am reporting this sighting not because it's the most spectacular but because it's the most recent. i took notice of it because i've seen these before. the first time i saw the orange ball was while i was in high school and living in peru maine( best guess fall of 98). i was sitting on the couch looking south at an orange ball that looked like it was hovering over the ridge line but at that distance i couldn't be sure what i was looking at so i was trying to figure out if i was looking at a star and i noticed a second one a ways down the ridge so i kept looking for about 15 minutes. then the ball started to move in a straight line along the ridge. of in the distance a jet came into view. and started chasing the orange ball. so i ran out the back door so i could continue watching. the orange ball made a right angle turn across the back yard and the jet persued it until they were out of sight. the jet was low enough so even though it was dark out you could very clearly see it was a jet about the length of 2 quarters and yet the only feature i could see of the other object was that it was a glowing orange ball. i looked back to where the other ball of light was and it took off straight up and disappeared into the atmosphere.  i have seen this orange ball off and on for years. on my way to work about 7 years later driving to work in the late fall at about 3 in the morning. an orange ball of light about the size of a moving truck was shadowing my movments downs the river of route 2. i turned and looked away and it had disappeared. i descided to report this becuase i have just watched the fayetteville case on ufo's over earth and was freaked to see the reanactment clip had orange balls just like what i have seen. so even though this is a witness case i have no proof, no pictures and such that it could still be helpful in mapping where these different kind of sightings are happening.\r\n","distance":"501

on the kitchen clock when we went out the back door. beautiful night, temperature was 88 degrees, no wind, high overcast, but clearing. visibility was over 10 miles according to the local weather.\r\n\r\nfor some reason, my dog didn't want to come down the steps to where i was standing, and he usually can't wait to. he stood looking toward the west-northwest corner of my property instead. he wouldn't come down even when i called him. he just stood there staring.\r\n\r\ni looked to see what the heck he was worried about, and saw what i at first thought was a plane approaching to land at phoenix-mesa gateway airport, which is northwest of me here, about 16 miles away. it was in the same area of the sky as where the regular flight path that planes use is.\r\n\r\nit looked like a plane coming head-on at me with the white landing lights on. i couldn't see any faa lights on it, but thought that was maybe because the landing lights were so bright. then, as i was just about to lose interest and turn away, i could see that the light was becoming more and more orange-colored, and getting brighter. the more orange it got, the more oval-shaped it became, and the larger it seemed to be.\r\n\r\nafter this continued for about 10 seconds or so, it appeared to stop at the same height as, and right next to the top of the big hill in the desert about 4,000 feet west from my back door. it stopped growing larger, or closer, when it was about 75 feet wide, and seemed to hover next to the peak about 200 feet north of the hill.\r\n\r\ni was confused, and continued to watch it as it sat still in the sky without a sound, for about 15 or 20 seconds. if it were a plane at that distance (4,000 feet), and at an altitude of roughly 350 feet, i should have for sure heard the sound of the engines. there was no noise whatsoever. no traffic way out here, all is pretty quiet.\r\n\r\nsuddenly, the oval shot sideways about 150 feet, flashed twice as it moved, and completely disappeared! it didn't accelerate away, it was just all of a sudden moving at a rapid speed to my right instantly.\r\n\r\nas i stood there with my mouth hanging open, looking real hard to find any trace of it i could see, a very, very bright red light lit up at the peak of the hill that the oval was just next to. i focused my eyes on it, but couldn't tell if it was around the other side of the hill, or sitting there on the ground at the right side of a spot just below the rocky peak.\r\n\r\ni could see it was a perfectly shaped ball of red light, and the lower left edge of it was hidden by part of the hill. the red light didn't reflect on the hillside, it seemed to be contained inside the ball somehow, but was still extremely bright anyway. it made me squint.\r\n\r\nthe red ball light didn't come on gradually, it just snapped on, stayed lit about 1 second, maybe a little bit longer, then snapped off. if it was on the side of the hill as it looked like it was, it had to have been about 30 feet in diameter. when the light went out, i couldn't see it against the dark hill, or the night sky.\r\n\r\ni was trying to figure out what it was that i just saw when my dog came part way down the steps, looked in the direction of where the lights used to be a couple of times, then meandered off to do his job just like nothing happened.\r\n\r\nthat's what i saw, and i don't care who believes me and who doesn't because that don't change nothing about what happened. i been living here almost 10 years now, and seen probaly hundreds of planes coming in for a landing, and also some other strange lights in the desert, but this wasn't no plane or other lights like i've ever seen before. no way. what they were or where they went, i just don't have a clue.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

over the horizon of cypress, tx directly south of me, i saw some lights that appeared to be headed ne kinda along 290 but with a more westerly trajectory. i thought it was a low flying plane coming from bush international airport as it originated in that general direction. as i got closer to 290 it looked like it had stopped though. i hit 290 and turned left back south along the 290 feeder. at this point the lights were about 100 yards west of the freeway and were no longer moving. it was a triangular pattern of 3 red-ish steady lights. at 1st i thought it was just some sort of a tower that only appeared to be moving because i was driving along a winding road. however, as i got closer there was absolutely no tower to be found and the lights were still just hovering there, at a pretty low altitude, under 1000feet. ide say a couple football fields up. i kept driving slowly past it, but once i was under it, my  car roof obstructed my view and it remained out of sight. i kept driving south about a minute before i came to the light at mason rd and was able to look back once more, but at that distance, through my tinted rear window, i could no longer see it. i thought it was all strange, but nothing crazy. then about a half hour later, a friend and i were sitting in an open area behind our neighborhood when i thought i saw something again. this time it was two lights, not the same as the triangle, just one white light each, obviously independent of each other, but working in tandem. they were off to the northwest up 290 from our location (tuckerton rd between queenston boulevard and barker-cypress, 77095). the lights were in about the same area i saw the triangle. we watched them for a while and i actually got some on video. they started way far apart, one east and one west, and then passed close together before moving up and down the west side of the freeway several times, almost making a complete circle, with our location oriented to the se of the center of this path. they were just sweeping back and forth over the whole area. they made several passes over about an hour and a half span (approximately 10:30 through midnight). when they got closer (almost directly overhead) we could hear them and determined they were just helicopters, so i cut the video. but both of us agreed they weren't normal sounding. they almost sounded more like a plane but i think its because they were military choppers, which i assume are much more powerful and different sounding than the conventional choppy helicopter noise you might think of. both helicopters were also completely black, strengthening my suspicion that they were military aircraft. several times these helicopters turned out their forward facing lights as they passed over residential areas. a third light was also seen farther nw that never got as close as the other two, but judging from its size, flight pattern/speed and single light, it was also a helicopter.\r\n\r\nseptember 12, 2011 - i returned and drove the same path i took august 21st tonight around midnight, just to be sure it wasn't a tower or anything. the lights were no where to be found and there is nothing similar anywhere in the area.

afternoon breaks outdoors, weather permitting, where i would watch and try to identify aircraft coming and going at the nearby hayward airport.\r\n\r\nthe event happened one day as i was taking my customary afternoon break. the weather that day was sunny and clear, with some high clouds in the distance. as i watched the small civilian aircraft (i.E., cessnas, etc.) flying to and from the airport, i became aware of another craft that appeared to hover above/near the airport, roughly 1000 feet above the air traffic. it was cigar-shaped, so at first i thought it might be a blimp, but then i noticed that the afternoon sun would glint off of it every so often, as though it was highly polished. it was silver and highly reflective, like a shiny chrome car bumper. \r\n\r\ni then thought that maybe it was a helicopter, but realized it was too large and the wrong shape. on top of all that, the object seemed completely silent. about that time i called a co-worker to come outside to have a look, but before he came out the object suddenly shot straight up into the high clouds in a split second. \r\n\r\ni know what i saw was solid as it reflected sunlight. i am also very familiar with the flight characteristics of both fixed and rotary wing aircraft, as i am an faa-certified aircraft mechanic. i have seen fighter jets at airshows perform spectacular stunts, but i can tell you that what i saw that afternoon far exceeded the capabilities of any aircraft i have ever seen. this thing accelerated from zero to thousands of miles an hour in an instant, and it did so vertically from a hover.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

tree tops of the surrounding woods. the weather at the time was stormy, with thunder and lightning.\r\nthe object had a ring of bright, rapidly flashing, multi-colored lights(red, green, orange,

shining  a couple of very large spot lights up into the sky, but the trajectory would have required for them to be doing so from our position where we were sitting.  in addition, there was no light beam eminating from the ground, and, as i looked closer, the lights appeared to originate from above the clouds, not shining on to them from below.  the two seperate lights measured (best guess) about 20'across??  they lights sat stationary for a moment, then began to move in erratic directions across, back, forth zig zag, etc. all while staying directly over our head.  there was no soung apparent,

(then and now).  i remember thinking out loud \"holy ���������t that's haley's comet\". i could not believe my eyes. i pulled the car off the right side of the road and turned off the ignition.\r\n\r\nas i inspected the object it became clear that what i was seeing was not the comet. first of all, it was far to large. from my vantage point, it looked about the same size as a basketball. behind it was what appeared to be the tail. which was very thick (broad), and about 8 to 10x  in length versus width. the head was silver in color and reflective.  \r\n\r\ni remembered that haley's comet had been a bit of a disappointment to observers. it was barely visible to the naked eye at night. and what i was seeing was quite incredible. so that made me suspect. also, there was no visible movement or motion. as i watched the object stared to change it's shape, it's form. the object began to separate. what appeared to be the tail, or contrail separated. the contrail dissipated, or evaporated. leaving a large chrome ball (sphere). from my viewpoint it hovered there, staying static. the sphere did not move. \r\n\r\ni watched the object until about 2:35p.M. i had to leave or be late for work. as i drove off i noticed that the sphere remained stationary. no movement at all. when i arrived at work i contemplated reporting the sighting to public relations at plattsburgh air force base.  i told a few of my fellow officers about my experience. i received the standard ridicule. so that stopped me from reporting to anyone. well until now.\r\n\r\ni fancy myself a bit of an aviation buff. i was a pilot. i have seen all different kinds of aircraft in various stages of flight. in daylight and darkness. on that day in 1986, i saw something that i could

first noticed them, there were maybe 4 or 5, almost stationary. then i saw that they were moving, very slowly. more appeared. they would rise, one by one, from the ssw and move northward until they dissapated/faded. i live near a jrb and i can recognize jets, commercial planes, fireworks, blimps and weather balloons, day or night. these were none of those. \r\n\r\nthe objects seemed to be about a quarter the size of the moon, but it was difficult to judge the true size or distance. they appeared much like actual flames in the sky, almost like the holiday lights covered by paper sacks people place along their sidewalks during the holidays. a neighbor a block away called me stating he saw them too. we can't seem to find any evidence anyone else saw these things! if anybody else saw this, please say something. it's frustrating and a little scary.\r\n\r\nthe neighbor and i took some pictures with our phones but, they don't seem tobe very good.
