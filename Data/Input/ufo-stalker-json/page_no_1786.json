lake new york toward route 30, my partner and i were having a conversation, a pretty in depth conversation.  while she was in mid sentence she said \"what are those lights\".  dismissive i tried to look to see what she was talking about (and still drive at the same time at 55mph) but did not notice anything and told her that it was a plane.  my partner was insistent that what she was seeing was no plane or planes but bright, moving, and color changing objects. she then told me to pull over.  we pulled over into an area that use to be farmland and was now being turned into a housing development (no houses built) located near paul smith's new york on state route 86 (easy street).  i kept the car running thinking we were going to be seeing nothing out of the ordinary when we took a closer look, and i asked her what she had saw?  she told me she saw three bright objects, changing color, with movement.  the objects (which i thought were stars) were very easy to notice as there was not a cloud in the sky and the moon was unusually bright.\r\n\r\ni evaluated the brightest object that was located to my right and was assuming it to be a planet.  i did not witness any of the color changes that she was witnessing for that object.  i then looked for the second object that she had seen, in the middle, but was no longer there.  i then turned my attention to the third object that was more star-like and had significant changes in color.  thinking it was just the light passing through our atmosphere to produce the \"twinkle\" that i see with stars, we continued to watch.  the object then, slowly, started to move to the left across the sky (approximately moving two inches or more).  the object then quickly returned to the point of origin and stood still, but showing dramatic color changes from white, red, orange, blue, green, gold (not so much yellow).  the colors did not blend together, they were distinctly and independently visible.  thinking it was an issue with light passing through my windshield, i turned the car off and went outside.  i continued to see the object move from its point of origin, slowly, to the left, then quickly to the right.  thinking i was moving, i propped myself up against the car and found a stationary reference point (2) one being a pair of foot-hill mountains with a valley between, and the second being a stationary star that was slightly lower and to the objects left.  \r\n\r\nusing these two points i continued to watch the object move in this same pattern; however, unexpectedly the object made a dramatic move (of what seemed like a change of altitude) then rush quickly to the right, and rise back to original point of origin.  at this time i used my phone to google \"moving star\" and \"reporting ufo in new york\", and it brought me to the mufon webpage and two phone numbers for new york.  i got back into the car and called the first number and woman answered (i felt horrible because of the time of night) i asked if this was the number for mufon and she quickly put me on the phone with the mufon representative. \r\n\r\nmy partner and i began to explain what it was we were seeing, provided him with basic location and direction (to the best of our ability).  we had been told that the first, brightest object might be a star named spika or pika(spelling) which is the brightest star in the sky.  the object to our left was now our main area of concern.  the object was much higher than the brightest object (now known to be a star).  i explained all the information that i had written above, and he asked me to approximate the degree of elevation (i was not able to do this very well).  he asked me if the object was star-like, which i confirmed it was.  he asked me about the approximate size and i stated that it looked smaller than an aspirin, i stated that it was; however, after the incident i can say that was approximately the size of a low dose aspirin.  he then asked me to use my thumb as a tool of measurement.  the object was staying true to its area of motion and went past was i would approximate four thumbs to the left, and shot back quickly to the right.  as we continued to talk, the object would move left, shift right quickly, begin its color change, and start over again.  during the incident, we did notice the traditional blinking lights of a plane that would fly near the object; however, distance was very hard to determine.  my partner described the object as being like a kite (in terms of its movement) meaning that it was moving but yet looked like as if it were attached to a string.  this steady state of movement took a sudden change and began to almost move in a circular pattern, but taking very sharp turns.  after taking the up the gentleman's time for about 20 minutes (or more) he asked us if we could make a report on the mufon page.  i agreed and ended our phone call.\r\n\r\nmy partner and i continued to watch the object for an additional 10-15 minutes, and as we were about to leave, the object seemed to change its movement cycle again and do more of a \"figure eight\" type pattern.  my partner became emotionally uncomfortable and we left the location.\r\n\r\nopinion-\r\n\r\ni do not think this is an object of any origin outside of our own means.  we do have military aircraft that occasionally fly over our area, but never like this.  i also vaguely remember a news article which stated that the military was using the adirondack region to practice controlling uavs.  \r\n\r\ni dismissed the object's potential as being a satellite as i see them nearly every night from my back yard.\r\n\r\nthere could be a possibility that it is some sort of law enforcement aircraft trying to find unusual ground temperature which could indicate someone attempting to grow marijuana.  \r\n\r\nwhat i cannot potentially explain is the speed and acceleration.  i think the acceleration is more unexplainable, plus the acceleration with change in what i think was altitude and then direction.\r\n\r\nwe are stumped.

was on my way to work at mehrabad airport.  i was in the usaf at the time working at the mac terminal and was an aircraft mechanic with  14 years of experience on many types of aircraft.  i had just turned west on the access highway to the airport and was about halfway between the shahyad monument behind me and the eastern access road to the airport ahead.  as i pulled into the left lane to set up my turnoff i saw directly ahead crossing 90 degrees left to right, a cylindrical object right at the top edge of my windshield at an altitude of maybe 150 feet.  it was daylight and a clear morning.  the location meant to me that this object had just flown across the eastern end of the main runway which runs parallel to the highway.  at first i thought someone had accidentally fired a missle again (it happened a year earlier) because the rear of the cylinder looked like a blunt multi-port propulsion system of some sort and had a faint exaust resembling steam comming out.  i quickly realized it had no fins, no wings, a blunt front, and was flying much to slow; hardly fast enough even for a small plane.  i pulled over to the left shoulder so i could get out and look.  my thought now was that a helicopter must be hauling this pipe-like thing somewhere.  but, no helicopter and no noise.  two other cars had pulled over in the right lane and watched as i did.  the object maintained a northward direction staying just above ground level and away from the residential area of northwest tehran.  we could actually watch the item for about 5 minutes until it went past a rolling ridge just short of the mountain range which borders north of the city.  i waited for another minute expecting to see an explosion or smoke or something, but nothing happened.  i continued on to work, told what i had seen and had inquirys made of all agencies both military and civilian.  no one had seen anything and no reports were filed.  i found this very hard to believe but since i was in my last days there and getting myself ready to be reassigned back to the states i didn't bother to take the time looking for the location that i suspected it might have impacted.  i want to make it clear that this was in october of 1975 and not 1976 when they had the larger ufo incident which also included a cylindrical object.  the other witnesses were local iranians and we just looked at each other after the incident and went our separate ways.

and sits right next to the lake of clear lake.  i happened to bring some binoculars and my camera because the last time we were there, we saw 4 other ufos.  we arrived at farmers beach to find that we had the place to ourselves at around 8:20 (estimated)and started a fire.  it was a somewhat clear night but the stars weren't as visible as they usually are. at around 8:45 i looked up towards the south to see a few glowing lights moving, one of them being blue.  i quickly grabbed my binoculars to check it out.  the objects were miles away and when i looked at the object it appeared to be a moving white light with a blue glowing trail behind it.  immediately excited i grabbed my camera and snapped my first picture at 8:55.  in the picture were three white odd shaped objects that were somewhat in a triangle pattern.  i was very intrigued by them since i had three on one picture, they have a somewhat cross like shape to them.  at 9:01 i snapped another one.  this one is eery and sends chills up and down my spine.  the details that i am describing are coming from my camera as the naked eye would have just seen lights and shrugged it off possibly. when zoomed in on this picture, it almost appears to be a planed with a ring around it.  within the next minute it just disappeared and i do not know how.  after this, i just started snapping pictures in the direction that i saw these objects in the sky in hopes to catch something.  at 9:08 i caught what looks to be an object with three lights, one in front and on each side.  this object was being followed by a small white orb.  these orbs have shown up by these objects in almost all of my pictures.  eight minutes later, i had a picture with 7 similar glowing white, cigar like shapes.  one of them almost looks like a space shuttle with an orangish glow emitting from the bottom. the weirdest one in this photo has a vertical glowing white light along with a horizontal one towards the bottom of the object, almost like an upside down lowercase t.  when i zoom in, this object also has a blue and sort of orangeish light on it, exactly diagonal from each other. the friend that i was with witnessed it all happening too, although he was more interested in the fire. my pictures speak more than my words as these are hard to describe. the objects were in the sky for maybe thirty minutes, i cannot explain how they appeared and disappeared, they just did. later that night at 2:45 am, when i was back in town at a friends house i had decided to snap a picture of the stars so i could compare with my zoomed in images.  not one star appeared in the photo but to my surprise there was a straight line that was illuminated.  i definitely did not see this before the photo.  in my photos, most of them look just like lights until zoomed in once again as they were so far away. total, i caught maybe twenty on my camera, adding up in the multiple photos.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
