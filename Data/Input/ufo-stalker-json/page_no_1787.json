sitting on the back deck of my house i saw something unusual in the night sky that has been driving me crazy ever since.  to avoid any misunderstanding regarding what i am about to relate, let me first provide a little background about myself in that regard.  first of all i am an experienced sky watcher and from time to time will actually use high powered binoculars to observe a variety of activities in the sky including aircraft, natural phenomena, wild life, etc.  i am also interested in astronomy and have a telescope which i use on occasion to view celestial objects including planets, stars, galaxies and the moon, etc.  my point is that i am very experienced at what i am talking about.  as a case in point, a few years ago while viewing the southwestern sky at dusk, i was fortunate enough to observe a meteorite come through the atmosphere in my direction.  it made the local newspapers and was a prelude to a series of sightings that occurred about a week or two later in the bucks county pa and nj area of the country.  as a matter of fact over a period of a few years i have observed three meteorites come through the atmosphere, but that was the only time i saw it happen in daylight.  in the night time sightings they were basically what appeared to be basketball sized fireballs streaking across the sky.  but in the daylight sighting what i saw was a trail of tumbling smoke coming in my direction.  this took place over a period of about 15 to 20 seconds and then the smoke trail dissipated over a period of about 5 minutes or so.   \r\n\r\non the negative side, i have never observed a satellite or the international space station from earth although from what i understand it is possible to do so by naked eye.\r\n\r\nbefore going into what really prompted this post let me first relate what led up to it the day before.  while looking up in the southeastern direction of a clear but slightly hazy sky sometime around noon i saw what appeared to be the fuselage of a large passenger liner high in the atmosphere.  what got my interest was simply the fact that i could not see its wings and didn���t hear any noise from its engines.  so, it could possibly have been a dirigible from what i could tell.  to be sure i went into the house to get my binoculars.  but by the time i came back out it had already gone over the roof top and was no longer visible from that location so i just shrugged it off as i have done countless times in the past.  i could have gone out front, or around the side of the house but it was no big deal so i didn���t bother.  the point is that this was nothing new to me and has happened in the past where when view with binoculars i could see the wings of the aircraft that because of haze were not visible with the naked eye.  now, for what i saw the following night.\r\n\r\nwhile looking at the night sky at about 11:15 pm in the same southeastern direction i noticed what appeared to be a very bright star (or possibly the light/s of an airplane) peek through a faint cloud in that part of the sky.  it only lasted about 3 to 5 seconds and then went out as if blocked by the cloud.  it seemed like it could be moving in my direction but it didn���t last long enough for me to be sure.  as i continued to watch the sky including in the direction i thought the object might be moving in, about 5 to 10 minutes later it suddenly lit up again.  but it was now far in front of the faint cloud and in a perfectly clear part of the night sky.  again the light was on for only about 3 to 5 seconds and went out again.  i quickly went inside the house to get my binoculars but by the time i came out, whatever it was never lit up again.  to be clear on this, i never actually saw the object but only the light from it.  in both cases it was as bright as a very bright star and seemed to be a single light and not multiple lights as used on aircraft.  and in both cases, it simply turned on and then went out a few seconds later.  there was no sound of any kind associated with it.  i have no idea of what it was but have never seen an aircraft do that.  it would probably be a violation of aeronautical law to fly at night without lights.  it is driving me crazy trying to figure out what it could have been.  whether it was related to what i had seen the day before, i have no idea.  it came from the same general direction of the sky but was moving toward the left of me whereas the object the previous day went to the right of me as it passed overhead.  as a final note it should be understood that the former willow grove naval air station is about a mile or two away in the general direction, although about 45 degrees more to the south, that the light came from. \r\n","distance":"Over One

back home after dinner at my parents house somewhere between 8pm-10pm, dark outside and clear skies.  the drive home was from boulder to loveland.  i took the back roads.  after driving through hygiene and crossing highway 66 via n 75th st., we saw three lights - where the points of a triangle would be.  it appeared to have a very large wing span (if it had wings).  for example, looking at the hills to the east as you drive north between hwy 66 and the sharp turn on n 75th,the lights spanned the entire big hill with the weather station or whatever that place is.  at first i thought the lights were coming from there.  once we turned the sharp turn on n 75th we realized the lights were way out there, possibly over mead and appeared to be maybe 10,000ft.  after the turn, n 75th turns into woodland rd., its a pretty open view of the sky.  the lights didn't flicker or move at all, and as we drove east on woodland rd. the object didn't get any bigger - so it must have been far away.  i turned left onto n 83rd st., the lights still shining, and drove up the hill.  over the hill, the trees block the view of the east for a mile or two, but once a clear view was able, near yellowstone rd., we looked for the lights and they were gone.\r\n\r\ni'm curious to know if others around my area have witnessed anything similar and what the logical explanation might be.  i've seen video clips shown on tv of similar light formations in the sky.

9, 2011. my son noticed an object in the shy that was flashing different colours and didn't appear to be moving. we live in an area with plane traffic and dark skies, so i assumed it was a plane that was travelling away from us that looked like it was stationary. after 1/2 hr of watching the \"plane\" it was still appeared to be in the same position. while watching the object, i noticed that the colours were not typical of a regular plane navigational lights. in additional to white and red pulsating lights it also had blue and green. the object was at about 30 degrees on the horizon towards the ne and at a considerable distance.\r\n\r\ncurious, i brought out the binoculars and the object did not look like a plane and the binoculars were unsteady, so i brought out the dslr with 300mm telephoto lens and took a couple of pictures. because of the distance, i also mounted it on a tripod to steady the picture. \r\n\r\nwhen viewing the pictures on the camera it looked \"disk or cylindrical\" shaped, however i assumed that the camera must have been shaking and left a tracer shape. it wasn't until i brought the camera inside uploaded the pictures zoomed in and enhanced the resolution to see the background stars that the cylindrical shape was not caused by camera shake. specifically, i looked at the stars in the background and you will notice that they are perfectly round to a pinpoint (indicating that the camera was not moving). in two of the attached pictures the object is the same disk shape and there is no movement, however in one pictures the object appears to trail something below it and move position (these are long exposure pictures approx. 30 seconds). you can also clearly see the different colours in that picture and the stars in the background are still pinpoints (again no camera shake). \r\n\r\nthe object was \"pulsating\" rather brightly and although you cant see the different colours in two of the pictures, you can see them in the third one (where the object appears to be moving). i also noticed in the picture that the stars appear to be \"blanked out\" around the object. i am attributing this to the long exposure time and the intensity of the flashing which must have muted out the rather low light intensity of the distant stars around the object. it is now midnight and the object has been visible for several hours. it appears to be slowly moving across the sky which leads me to believe it is some man made object that is tracking with the rotation of the earth. but i still can't resolve the shape nor the colours, nor the reason for the weird 3rd picture.   any input or logical explanation of what the object is would be greatly appreciated. thank you, deirdre\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":31688,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.08501,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-09102011-0001","longitude":-80.19769,"occurred":1315551600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1315639025000,"summary":"Strange

pulsate and abruptly fade. i am an aviation nut and can easily identify most any aircraft at a glance. i have also witnessed the passing over of countless satellites and manned spacecraft over the

was like what? no. where?

school\"   , i followed it and it went up the curb like it had went down ...And stayed their for a moment...I really wanted to touch it..But it then  started to move away from me and went so fast it was gone \r\n\r\ni been married 47 years, i told my parents...My husband, my children and my grand children...No one understands that i have no explaination for what i saw that day.  its frustrating

details if needed. \r\n\r\ni received a report of a large craft hovering over grays hwy (hwy 278) cross street wooden horse run on the sharp curve.\r\n\r\ncaller was very upset and stated that she just observed a large unidentified craft move and hover in front of her car from the sod farm fields next to the hwy at tree top level. the current information i have is that the craft had an unknown number of bright white lights surrounding it or encircling it, after hovering for a moment it then departed at a very high rate of speed and was visible again in the distance through the trees on the opposite side of the hwy for a moment.\r\n\r\nnote: i have also found that this isn't uncommon for that area and that in the past a vehicle was \"pursued\" or tracked by a similar object. obviously many of these reports are not readily shared. i also made a report about 2 years ago in which myself and a number of other emergency responders witnessed similar lighted crafts within 15min north of that area from different locations.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

town of deering. we were riding from the high school down the road to his house. all the sudden we looked to the left of us, and there it was, a yellowish orange orb floating about five feet off the ground next to us, keeping the same speed as the bikes. i have to say it scared us,and we didn't have far to go, we sped up and didn't look back. to this day, i don't know what it was, but never forgot.\r\n\r\nthe above is just the first strange siting. now living in new jersey, and grown with children, retired new jersey air national guard,something else happened. one day after work, 4:30 pm in the fall of 2010 i had arrived home from work. i sat back on the bed upstairs to rest and noticed while looking through our closet door mirrors, which was inline with the window, at the trees outside and i noticed an outline in the trees. the figure was very tall and thin, looked to be seven feet in height with long arms. i couldn't believe what i was seeing. i thought the tree bark was playing a trick on me, but i stayed in place to study it. as i mentioned, it was tall and very thin, had the large head and black eyes and the limbs were away from the tree trunk. it seemed to be looking at me through the mirror. so i thought maybe it doesn't notice me looking at it because i was viewing him through a mirror. so after a few minutes, i decided to actually get up and look through the window. i did, and wasn't able to find it. i then went to the bed, same position and looked through the closet door mirrors again. i couldn't find what i had saw previously. \r\ni don't know what it was, if anything, but it still bothers me.\r\nbe advised, i don't need to be contacted, just wanted to tell someone other than my family.","distance":"20 Feet or

companion, walking on michigan state university's campus.  we were walking back towards the stadium, crossing the bridge over the river, the one closest to wells hall, when i noticed the lights.  at first i only noticed the four, and pointed them out to my companion.  i also pointed them out to two female students passing over the bridge at the same time.  \r\n\r\n the light pollution illuminated the clouds, as did the objects.  they appeared to be heading towards the stadium.  i'm not sure what direction i was facing, but the stadium was to my right and the objects to my left in the sky.  after watching for about thirty seconds or a minute, i told my companion that they reminded me of the phoenix lights, something i had seen on youtube a couple of years ago, which turned out to be flares.  i suggested that these might be flares because the color was similar.  he pointed out, correctly i think, that the objects were moving steadily (albeit slowly, without making any sound) to the right, towards the university, and that they were not breaking formation.  they were not simply hovering and flailing about.  there was wind, so i would think that balloons with flares should have been moving about more.  at least, one would think.  then i saw a fifth light trailing the others, following at the same pace and in the same direction but not part of the rhomboid formation.  i then realized that the lights might just have been points on a much larger object that was obscured by the clouds.  a short while later, they faded away behind the clouds.  \r\n\r\n unfortunately i couldn't take any photos because my sd card slot on my phone is defective.  not sure what it was, if the lights were solitary objects or if it was part of a larger object, but it was a little eerie and unsettling.  i'm pretty sure that extraterrestrial intelligence exists as a matter of probability, but i don't personally subscribe to the belief that sentient extraterrestrial life visits earth on a regular basis and is responsible for ufo sightings.  this is the only time that i have ever truly seen something that i would describe as an unidentified and unidentifiable flying object.  i kept thinking it was possible that it could be a hoax but i don't know what the mechanism would have been.
