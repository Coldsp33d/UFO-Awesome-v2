it's just like in close encouters of the third kind\". dan complained because victor had made him screw up on rolling the joint, broke the paper or spilt it or something. dan gave the lights in the sky an off-hand look and decided to get back to work trying to roll a joint. dan procceded to tell the tale of how he and victor had been to see the movie which had just opened two weeks before. he was telling us the tale of the movie when victor just about came unglued... \"put that shit away and look at this. they're coming right to us. their coming right here\". dan looked up and out the front windshield and was freaking out. i looked at the guy who was sitting beside me in the backseat and we both leaned over the back seat to get a better look at this thing. we could see it big as life. it was approaching us from the north, heading due south, right at us. it was moving slow and low over the foothills, just to the west of town. and it was headed straight out to where we were parked, in the midlle of this circle of rocks. as it got closer to us it slowed down even more. i remember this ancient oak tree that looked as if it had been hit by lighting once or twice in the past five hundred years, standing there under that flying sauser as though it had seen this craft before. victor said, \"i'm going to get out and make contact\", and immediatly both dan and i grabbed victor. i had wrapped my arm around him from behind and dan had his arm. i said \"like hell, i'm not going to go home tonight and tell mother you were abducted by aliens\". dan said, \"ya right, you don't even know his parents. it would be me trying to explain this shit and i say we're all staying in the car no matter what happens\".\r\n    i want to call the other guy in the backseat with me jack or craig but i can't say for sure. well, he spoke up and suggested that we roll down our windows and sit in the windows so we could see it better. we all agreed. that sauser hung there just above that old oak like it had just been headed out to the woods and found us in its' parking space. then it began to just sort of moosy off toward pozo. \r\n    this is the point in my story where i want to describe the craft for you...  it was as big as a nfl regulation football held at arms length. approximately 200-300 yrds in diameter. it was hard to tell.\r\ni don't remember there being a moon or not, or we would have been able to see the skin of the craft better. it was the classic shape of one dinner plate inverted on the other. there was no dome on top per-say, but there was a plasma like blue eletricity flowing from the top to the center and from the bottom to the centerline where the two plates would form the edge of the craft. just so you get the idea of how low to the ground this thing was...On the bottom of the craft there were two glowing orbs of energy, one greenish-white and the other redish-orange, but as it started to move away slowly, you could see a blueish orb on the far side, so as to make a group of three glowing orbs on the bottom of the craft. as it moved off it began to gain altitude, but not much. as it went out and around the foothills toward santa margarita,ca. it kind of gave a wagging off the wings. (i used to dream that i was on board and gave myself a dipping of the wings, so that i would remember that it was me flying by that night, saying goodbye to myself). the story doesn't end there.\r\n    victor said \"it's headed for black mountain\". he fired up the car and we through out our beers that we had just opened and dan started cleaning up that joint he never finished rolling. we scramed to the 101 south bound. victor doing about a hundred miles per hour to margarita. as we screamed past the graveyard at hwy 58, i finaly talked victor into giving up the chase. i told him, \"look, that thing could have sat down in any one of the valleys on either side these ridges and we would be driving right past them\". we turned around at the 58 junction and headed home. i figure the only reason we weren't pulled over is because the cops were busy with the aliens. turns out that wasn't too far from the truth.\r\n    victor dropped me off at 23:30. as i walked up the driveway to my house i decided that i had to wake up mom, dad, everybody and tell them what i had seen. if i waited till morning they would just blow me off as having gone out and partied too much the night before. i had to show them right now that i wasn't stoned or drunk or anything else by looking in my eyes tonight and seeing for themselves that my eyes were clear and that i was telling the truth. i had really seen a ufo. they're real!!!\r\n    i got everybody up and gathered in the living room. i knelt down in front of my father sitting in his chair and looked him in the eyes and said glancing back and forth to mother, \"tonight i saw a ufo, for real\". my mother leaned over and sniffed me, \"you've been drinking\". \"yes mother, i had maybe three swollows off a beer. don't you see? that's why i got you all up, so you can look in my eyes and know i'm telling you the truth\". mom dismissed everyone while i knelt there at my father's knee and told him my story. \"well\", he said. \"sounds like you had quite a night. let's go to bed. we'll talk about it in the morning\".\r\n    seems like the next morning was school. victor and dan amushed me at my locker, physcally threating me with kicking my ass if i told anyone about our ufo experiance. they knew it would take the two of them if they were to have have any chance of carring out thier threat. what really bothered me was how scared they were that i was going to say something. what was it that they were so afraid of? \r\n    that evening i was watching the evening news when there it was. ksby san luis obispo's television said that the sherif and police departments had responded to calls and witnessed the object cruising on by. i tried to get my mom into the living room to show her but it was too late.\r\n    that weekend my uncle jerry and his brood (who lived in santa maria, ca)were over playing cards with mom and dad. when mom told uncle jerry, jerry called me into the dining room and asked me what i had seen. i told my story again. he said, \"i saw it too\". turns out he had been on the head end (he was an engineer for southern pacific rr) of a train pulled up to the gate at surf, ca.. for those who don't know, surf ca is the siding that trains have wait at before they can enter into vandenberg afb, the coastline. jr proceeded to tell of how he was just sitting there when our flying sauser came cruising over the coastal mountains at his back. he took notice when it dropped into his rearview mirror on the engine. it paralleled along about half of the trains length, slowly looking over the train. just then two jets scrambled off the runway headed in the wrong direction. when they started to come back around, my uncle jerry said \"that sauser did a zig north and a zag west and that thing was gone like a bolt of lighting. those two planes didn't have a chance\".\r\n    it just so happened that my uncle jerry was actively pursuing his pilots' licence and knew just who to call at the santa maria airport tower. he asked if they had seen what he had just saw? his friend told him that the craft had cruised by slow and low that they thought it was going to hit the tower.\r\n    a few days after the card game, jr calls me and tells me to go down to the store and get the telegram tribune and look on, it was either the forth or fifth page... and there it was. no bigger than a postage stamp, tucked in among the public service announcements... \r\n             \"vandenberg afb reported tracking a ufo. contact was lost. an investigation is ongoing. there is nothing more to report at this time\" (or something to that effect). i was 15 years old, a freshman.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Other","flightPath":"Path with

immediately unusual.  i live 20 miles south of an international airport, and 5 miles north of an air force base, and have grown up watching the skies.  this was completely silent, which was the first thing that struck me as odd.  i hear planes all the time.  this seemed so close, the light (singular) so much larger than normal that it should be emitting sound.  we walked out into the back lawn to get a better view.  the light was oval in shape and seemed to pulsate in waves, and almost spin, or maybe it was more like the light was showering down.  it moved at a constant speed, which seemed faster than the airplanes i see daily.  the size was larger than any airplane light i've witnessed (and the color all wrong), so i assumed the object was close, but perhaps it was larger and farther away.  we watched for maybe 30 seconds before it was no longer viewable.  planes seem to stay in view much longer than this object did.  it appeared from the north, and disappeared to the southwest, and quickly.  we sat back down and scratched our heads, and a couple of minutes later a second object appeared and followed what appeared to be the exact flight path, and had the identical features.

relaxing in the backyard on the deck laying in lawn chair with my grandaughter sitting next to me enjoying the nice afternoon and watching humming birds at the feeder and looking into the sky with a few clouds i noticed a flying craft with(brilliant silver cylnder shaped with small hump) no wings moving very very slow from the south east to norhtwest direction just barely above thin clouds.....My grand daughter saw it too...As it went over a small cloud and the cloud drifted it never appeared again....As we watched it was as if it disappeared into the blue sky.....Ha.She yelled for her dad to come out but he was to late and just dismissed the incident but did believe we saw something...From watching airplanes at that height in the past it was the size of a southwest airline plane..... about 5 minutes later the same place in the sky a huge crarft just appeared .....It was ten times larger than the smaller craft we observed earlier as it moved slowly from the northwest to the southeast for 2 minutes....Wonder how somthing thay big with no wings or tail can stay in the sky moving that slow(i must assume the don't need aerodynamics but use another source of power to move)....Then all of a sudden it just disappeared as if you would turn off a light..It was a brilliant sliver color....Having served in the military i've seen flying craft from the b-1,b2 and b52 bomber... been in fighter planes and touched,walked around and looked into the cockpit of the infamous supersonic  blackbird and have seen aircraft carriers...That was not swamp gas,optical illusion or a weather ballon,or any know craft i've ever observed.......It was as large as an aircraft carrier....Cylynder shaped,but had a slight hump on top --my grand daughter and i thought we were lucky to have witnessed the ufo event....She believes in them now....I always have since i saw one in 1957 as a teenager along with thousands of people across the city and as it went north of st.Louis in the early morning on a saturday or sunday when we were out on the school yard playing ball and it was silver and huge ,but never had mufon then.......The government stated the that it was mass halucination or possibly swamp gas (ha... no swamps north of st louis) well thats the end of my sighting...Keep your eyes open and please report what you see as thats the only way to understand what

in the town of north east md. it was summertime and still light, but soon to be dark. my brother and i were having a catch in the backyard. i was app. 8 or 9 years old at the time and my brother was app. 10 or 11 years old. my brother threw up the ball in the air and i went to catch it. i saw a bright, shiny aluminum type egg shaped object with the sun reflecting off of it fly over top of our two story farmhouse, my brother and myself and just over the tree line. it was broad day light. i asked my brother did you see that? he stated he did not see anything. it was egg shaped and just barely cleared the treeline about 40 ft. it was about 30 ft in size lengthwise and about half that width and had strange black writing on the bottom, which is the  angle i saw it from for the majority of the time. it looked liked some kind of foreign writing like russian or hieroglyphics which were in black. it moved very rapidly and the whole event took only a few seconds.It was moving so fast if you didn't happen to be looking up at the time you would have missed it. i attribute this due to the fact my brother did not see it and he was only about 20 ft away from me. it made no sound whatsoever. i was so scared i would not go outside at night for the rest of the summer. twenty five years later while working with someone who also lived in north east at the time and bringing up the subject, he stated that at about the same time he and his friends were playing basketball in town and saw the same object, during the summer and in broad daylight as well in that same time frame of 1968.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:00:04","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Insignia","flightPath":"Straight-line

(mediterraneamy) my wife and i were in the company of maltese friends on our home flat roof top, which overlooks coastal mellieha bay. \r\ni hasten to add we were not and had not been drinking alcohol, as open minded skeptics we do not follow ufo spotting as a hobby or interest. we had simply gone up to the roof garden to observe the coastline and townscape lights of mellieha bay... \r\ndate was august 31st, 2011 and the time was approx 0200am. the weather conditions a warm 25 degrees (+/-) celcius & humidity 40% (+/-), there was a welcoming slight sea breeze and it was a clear cloudless star filled night sky. \r\nwe each saw what at first seemed to be a conventional jet airliner on approach from a north west direction moving over mellieha bay and watched as it headed over our house to, we assumed, land at malta international airport. the 'aircraft' was moving noticably slower than a conventional jet airliner but we put this down to the fact it could be 'stacking'. very noticeably was it size, it was massive and easily four times the wing width of a conventional passenger airliner. we thought at first it was the new double deck a380 air bus coming in to land and we watched with added interest, but as it approached closer and above us was much bigger and had a non shiny opaque silvery look about it. there were no carrier company emblems to be seen. white/amber lights were set in pairs at the wing tips (one above the other) and these were quite bright. there was also a single white/amber light at the nose tip and smaller blue/greenish lights at each wing mid section. on the undercarriage a bright light pulsated between bright red and dull orange. the 'aircraft' as it passed above us banked from horizontal wing positon to nearly vertical and turned towards a south east direction, heading towards saint paul's bay area where it 'seemed' to stop for a short time before moving back out to sea (mediterranean) and disappearing from sight. \r\nthe sighting from initial observation was approximately fifteen to twenty minutes. hard to be precise but wing tip to wing tip it was about 200 feet wide and 25 to 30 feet width at widest point. heighth (+/-) 1000 to 1500 feet up, maybe higher depending on the aircrafts size/dimensions... \r\ni'm not saying we saw a 'ufo' or anything unworldly, but it was definitely a weird aircraft, especially with its massive size, no recognisable jet engine noise and strangely arranged navigation lights.... \r\nhowever, on a lighter note...There is the possibly this strange 'aircraft' may have been an oversized illuminated chinese lantern or even a new type of weather balloon fuelled by marsh gas and piloted by a singing dancing monkey from nato on a reccy of mediterranean weather anomolies.. well, thats the sort of hog-wash explanation the so-called 'sensible' phd boffins would like us to believe !!???
