place i looked they just appeared out of thin air. i remember thinking to myself why nobody else saw what i saw. there were others round but nobody seemed to notice even when i pointed it out to a couple walking in the opposite direction. the first thing i noticed when i saw them was that all three appeared at the same time. they were all the same size and when they first appeared they big enough to hold a quarter up to. they were all the same colour. it was a very bright yellow or gold that had no illuminated qualities about it. they were coming close to me then far away agin and seemed to have no flight plan. they almost seemed like they were having fun. i could see them so clearly because the sun wasn't down yet but it also wasn't all the way up anymore. it was pretty cloudless as well. when i saw the object my first feeling was of a benevolent nature. i felt warm and comfortable. excited and adventurous. it was amazing that i was getting to be a part of this sighting. the object seemed to fly into or through something i couldn't see at one point. i figured this because they seemed to warp or bend and expand with the air. it was a sight to behold. i immediately came to the conclusion that what i am seeing is non other than an extra terrestrial craft hard at work or just plain around. the three object took up a triangular formation then an odd looking bending light came out of all three on the furthest part from the inner triangle formation. these lights were just plain odd. they were very thick and oddly colored. they seemed to do something to the air around the crafts. when ever the craft moved the light moved with as if it were a rope hanging off the side of the craft. the light also distorted or bent the air or space around the objects until they were covered by the off looking air around them then a sudden red streak flew across the sky directly into the object and the objects, lights, and red streak all just disappeared. once they were gone my happy feeling suddenly turned sour and i felt very angry and walked home completely forgetting to go to my friends house.","distance":"101-500

the pacific from behind me. it was dark out, but i'm in the city of springfield, oregon and its pretty bright here in the apts i live in&the hotel sign that's shines for the freeway makes it bright.

new something was there.As i continued looking at that spot a ball of pulsating light appeared.I would say it was abought the size of a softball or maybe a little larger.My mind was trying to figure out what i was looking at.I stepped to my right a couple of steps and relized i could see behind this object and that it was just sitting in thr air pulsating.As i watched this object and my mind was scrambling trying to find an explanation, it expanded vertically and i found myself facing a being with very large black eyes, a tiny nose,a slit for a mouth,very small flat ears and long fingers.I would say its height was less than 4ft.It appeared to be very light complected.It scared the hell out of me and i could feel some kind of energy hitting me in the lower forehead as if it was trying to communicate or observe me,i was aware it was moving closer and i ran ! i told my family i had seen a ghost ,i did not know how else to explaine it.A short time later my mother and i were in the car driving when we drove up on a orange ball of light sitting in the air ,when we got close to it it just disappeared we did not know what it was.About two years after my first encounter and in the same place i had a huge triangular shapped vehicle stop over my head.It was black in color and made no sound at all.It had 3 huge round lights, 1 on each corner with a panel of white lights across the rear.This ship was easily 400ft long .It sat above me for at least 10 minutes.I dont believe it could have been more than a couple hundred feet off the ground.When this craft started to move the large corner lights went to blue , green, and red.The rear lights flipped on in sequence left to right.It moved away in a very slow ne direction,no sound or air movment. i swear these events happened and i would not hesitate to take a lie detecter test.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 101-500 Feet","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then

on the allegheny river near cheswick/oakmont/harmar by floating with life vest in the calm part of the river -- as many others do who come and throw anchor on a hot summer day.\r\n\r\ni was in the water for about 20 minutes swimming around while my partner was in a kayak and leaned back to relax.  i noticed what appeared to be a far away jet at high altitude (about 1/3 inch at arm's length), but i saw only a dash of white and no wings/tail or contrail - which i would expect to see on such a humid day.  well, i thought, perhaps the sun wasn't shining on it at correct angle to see structures besides a tube or cigar shape, which would be not out of the question at such altitude (if high).  so i watched it fly straight path slowly into a puffy cloud (or above it, not sure of height of cloud or altitude of object).  i decided to keep watching for it to exit the cloud which was about 8 inches long at arm's length. i mentioned this to my partner who saw it as well, but was too interested in the goings-on on the water to be interested and proceeded to paddle off to get some refreshments.\r\n\r\nat the estimated speed it was traveling, it should have come out the other side within 3-4 minutes tops.  it didn't.  so i waited, not taking my eyes off it.  after an amazing 12 to 15 minutes or so (enough for at least 4 or so songs on boat radios to have played) it surprised me by emerging, continuing slowly in straight line to the next cloud over about 1 foot at arm's length away.  \"well okay then, perhaps you aren't a jet after all,\" i thought.\r\n\r\nso i watched that cloud too to see if it would repeat the hide-in-cloud behavior.\r\nit didn't.\r\nit never came out that second cloud even though i watched until that cloud dispersed into nothingness.\r\n\r\nthe area it was over is by the pa turnpike and route 28 interchanges and not far from 2 cheswick coal-fired power plants on the river.  i thought it pertinent to report this since i've seen other recent pa ufo reports that seem to be located not to far from or near the pa turnpike as well.\r\n\r\nrecording it obviously wasn't an option since i was in the water far from shore the whole time.  you would get more reports if \"anonymous\" truly meant not having to give you any personal information.  i do not wish to be contacted.  i report this only for other eye witnesses who might have seen these too, because i know you can't study such a sighting.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path

increased elevation of perhaps 35 degrees. soon these objects faded out. finally, within another ten minutes three of these same objects appeared in a sideways vee formation at about 25 to 35 degrees.

that the objects were attracted to the fireworks displays further down the beach. at one point not long after the three objects disappeared,my wife carol and i noticed two silvery cylindrical craft

the sky caught my eye.  through a tree i saw a large orange light and since it wasn't moving in the sky i thought it was a helicopter flying toward our house.  i went to the outer garage door of the house to get my son to look at it as my son was coming out of the house.  i told him to hurry over so we could watch it.  (it's still cool for my 10 year old to watch planes and helicopters fly over). when we got to a spot where we had a clear view of the sky we saw not one, but 6 or 7 of the same lights in the sky. my son got nervous right away and asked me what it was.  as i told him it was probably helicopters and we should hear something soon (which we never did). the lights on the outside of the line quickly moved left and right respectively.  at the same time working into the middle, the other lights also moved in different directions and out of site.   as i was telling my son that they could still be helicopters the last light appeared to go straight up/back, and within about 4 or 5 seconds it was gone.  the lights were at first about as big as making a circle with you fingers about the size of a pea, and holding your arms out at arms length.  the color was an orange color and they were just \"shining\".  not the pulsating thing i have since read about online.  i don't have a clue on how far away these things were, but even at close range the speed in which they left is something i have never seen.  i'm not a big believer in ufo's but i now have a new appreciation for the conversation.  i hope all of this helps you all to find the answer.  i know my son would appreciate it.
