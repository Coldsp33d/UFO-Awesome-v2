(my friend, on the other hand, told me she was so scared for her life that she didn't move from her passenger seat in the vehicle). \r\n\r\nthe object that appeared above the house was about 500 feet from us, and about 50-60 feet up in the air. it was unlike anything i've ever seen. it appeared hollow, but not like any hollow 3d structure in that i couldn't detect  a definite inside edge. there were bright white lights on the structure that appeared to glow from the inside out. initially, i believed it to be helicopter-sized. \r\n\r\ni started yelling to my friend, \"what is that?!\" that is when this object stopped hovering above the house and changed directions, coming right toward us in our car. it appeared to be getting smaller the closer it got to us, but never smaller than about 15x15ft. about 50 feet before our car, this object descends down towards us in a u-shape, then corrects itself and gains elevation. at its lowest point in the descent, i thought it might hit our car and i was afraid for my life -it was no more than 30 feet directly above the top of our car. \r\n\r\nit then regained its initial elevation of maybe 50 feet, and disappeared into the tree line at the edge of the property. we immediately turned on the car, pulled out onto the main road and attempted to see it again, but it had disappeared. \r\n\r\nthe most interesting part of this was not only the almost indescribable shape, but that it seemed to know we were leaving the property. it's very obvious (and terrifying) lurch towards our car was either on purpose (maybe to scare us?) or the result of whatever was operating it losing control of the structure. either way, this appeared and disappeared out of nowhere with a clear intent that we should see it. \r\n\r\nadditionally, this object was completely silent and appeared incredibly aerodynamic. it wasn't inherently malevolent, but also didn't appear to be particularly friendly or welcoming. i honestly  love reading about ufos, but now that i have actually seen one...I wish i hadn't. this was a very scary experience. \r\n","distance":"21-100

with a red light in the distance, then corrected her. she then told me that i wasn't looking at the correct thing. i then noticed about 100 meters above the surface was an object with slow rotation, and white blinking lights on each appendage that pulsed slowly across the two. the object was triangular or square, though a rotation was present i didn't get to see a full rotation, and only one light was active at a time. in the centre of the object was a large sphere, which seemed to produce some sort of plume that extended roughly 5 meters from the sphere. the appendages only produced the white lights from what seemed to be greyish circles. the object was shaped somewhat like a pyramid, with convex sides, like the attached drawings. on the exterior of the object, the triangular features seemed build up to the sphere in an overlapping pattern, and did the same but inverse on the inside leading up to the sphere. imagine there's more layers of triangles overlapping in the attached (poorly drawn)drawing. that convex shape on the sides is nicely displayed, though. the drawing is of a top view.  \r\n\r\nthe object approached relatively fast. the speed of my vehicle was around 75 mph the whole way. while the vehicle approached at about 60 m/s, it slowed to about 25 m/s once it reached me. it seemed to follow a straight path in my time observing it. when i wasn't able to focus on it, my girlfriend noticed it's closest point was about 200 metres from us. at this point it appeared to be about 15 metres in diameter. my girlfriend pointed out that it flew over the road, then simply vanished once we had driven about half a kilometre from the closest approach. \r\n\r\npersonally, i'm an avid rocketry nerd. it somewhat comforted me to know that that could have been an extraterrestrial vehicle, regardless of the chances. i'm sure others may have had a different reaction. i simply wished that i could study it, and it peaked my curiosity my whole journey. as for my girlfriend, it was a mixture of fear and excitement.

with me as the foreground and we attempted to get the stars and clouds in the background. we took two pictures, one after the other in a certain spot. they both seemed not too different to me so i never noticed it. over a year later, i look back and notice that there's nothing occurring in the first picture, but in he second there's an obvious glowing object n the top right corner. i don't believe its a star trail because it does not exist in the photo taken seconds before. it's very confusing to me and i tried to think of reasons why it wouldn't be in the first picture. but i couldn't think of anything.

could you please forward this information to them please:\r\ngentlemen,\r\nsince our visit, as i promised i would keep a vigilant eye on the sky if you would. i've been able to identify what you thought were military satellites.I've also seen the iss twice, no mistaking that. in retrospect i can confidently say what i saw was neither of those.\r\n\r\nmy reason for reaching out today is to in form you of several more instances of oddities in the night sky. on at least four occasions, twice with witnesses, i've seen what start out as a bright flash in the sky followed by other flashes of light varying in intensity and clarity. there is no commonality as to where in the sky they begin but event the shortest event (45 sec) consisted of single flashes of light following a somewhat random path. the last one on this wednesday 7/26 began in the se sky moved eastward the turned northward for several minutes until it disappeared from my field of view. as i said, i've seen at least five of these lights since we talked. i have witnesses to two. one military aircraft munitions expert who was speechless except to say \"what the fudge is that\" over and over again.\r\n\r\nthere were two sightings that were different from the above and honestly quite disturbing to me. on july 7th at 10:15pm and 10:35pm. first just to the ese of my view i saw what looked like a medicine shaped capsule in the sky. it was quite large but still far away. maybe one inch at arms length. it gave off a cloudy white light with a black stripe in it's center and appeared to be rotating or swirling. as it became more defined the black stripe intensified, it abruptly split in two and vanished. the exact same thing happened that same night in the sky nne of my field of vision.\r\n\r\ni can't possibly be the only one who is observing these event o almost a nightly basis if i want to sit and wait long enough. we look into deep space everyday but who's watching our own backyard? the dual encounter on the 7th has me really thinking perhaps i need to think about the potential of the unknown.\r\n\r\nregards,\r\ntom  ","distance":"Over One
