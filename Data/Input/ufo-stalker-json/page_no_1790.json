to the out house. i was waiting outside for her when i spotted the large plane like object.It came into view over top of the  mountain,moving at a very slow speed. i sat there watching it amazed at its size and lack of sound. i remember a drowning sound kind of like a wind, but not the sound that you would think would be associated with the large craft(as i often watched planes fly over the mountain tops at night, i  knew that the  object that i was seeing was very large indeed and like nothing i\"d ever seen come over that mountain before). the ship looked the size of my hand, yet the object was not low flying; it seemed to be flying at least at the same altitude that the larger jets would.\r\n it was in view several minutes before i got my sister to come outside to check out what was going on. i wanted someone else to see this too. several minutes after she was outside, the first of the smaller ships zoomed into view. \r\n several smaller ships came into view at a much higher speed than the larger one had done.The smaller ships came to the front of the larger ship,and went into formation around it (about three ships?), and then slowed down to match the speed of the larger ship.\r\n when the larger ship flew into view, it was moving in an straight line. then it slowly changed its direction by flying in a wide arch pattern (like a \"c\" ), before going on a straight course again toward wendover. note: if you could look at a topographical map and draw a line from flacky creek,to lick branch hollow, that would be the direction of the first part of the flight pattern, then the ship arched its flight toward hyden, then turned like a car in a curve to head back up lick branch hollow and eventually over the mountain top toward wendover, and eventually flew out of view in this direction heading toward pin mountain.\r\n when the large ship was making the change in direction, by starting to fly into the arch, my sister and i went running to the house to get our parents and others from the house. by the time they were outside other ships had came into view. there were two distinct colors of lights on the smaller ships. one set matched the lighting on the larger ship in tones of red. the other set were odd blues to blue-green in color. the red lighted crafts were in formation around the front, back, and sides of the larger ship, there were other smaller groupings of the small craft farther out from tip sides and back of the ship. it looked as if they were flanking the large ships. as the blue lighted crafts came into view the red lighted craft would break away from the formation and pursue them. there would be flashes of light, as if various ships were shooting , and as if the other ships were then hit. but, we never heard explosions, and we never saw debris falling. some of the craft would fly away over the mountains in pursuit of other craft. they could switch direction so fast it was amazing to watch. they could bank, and drop, than seamlessly raise back to a higher altitude. we watched this for several minutes. at least twenty, then the blue lighted ships were chased out of view, and the red lighted craft came back, went  into formation around the larger ship, slowed to its pace, and drifted off over the mountain top moving toward pine mountain/wendover. \r\nas odd as this sounds, we thought we were witnessing the start of world war three. we had never seen anything like it. we were terrified. the smaller craft looked very similar in shape to some of the jets that you see in military operations on tv now. except these things could move so fast, and fly in such odd ways. then there was the larger craft, exactly in shape like the smaller craft, but it had to have been enormous, you could have parked all the smaller craft on top of it and still had room left over. \r\nmy dad had a friend who had flown in world war two,  and he used to fly over our house and put on a dare devil flight show for us. we would also go to the hazard airport to watch him fly from there. i was used to seeing what small jets, and planes, looked like in the sky and on the ground. \r\ni guess that is why i was so into watching the planes as they flew over the mountains. i was amazed at how small they looked high in the sky. that is how i can tell you that this ship was very big indeed.  this was different than anything i'd ever seen. the whole thing lasted about twenty to twenty five minutes. after it was over, we went inside and waited for the 11:00 news to come on. we were sure that we would hear about impending attacks and war being waged against the usa. we sat up most of the night listening to the radio, and even listened the next day. to our amazement no one was saying anything.  we never figured out what it was that we witnessed that night in the sky. i'd love an answer if you can shed light on what it was that we saw happen. \r\n                 ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

by bus to chicago.  \r\n\r\nmy friends parents were having a card party, and she and i were sitting in her parents car in the driveway, listening to music and looking at the stars and talking about ufos.  after a short while, i noticed an odd bright light in the sky, and jokingly told my friend that, \"...And there's one now...\"  we both got out of the car and started waving our arms saying goofy kid stuff like \"come on down\", etc. and laughing.\r\n\r\nto our surprize, the object we saw simply 'dropped' from it's very high location to a much lower one.  it was at this time that i could clearly see what appeared to me to be a large circle of round individual lights.  we stopped goofing around, and were totally stunned by what we saw, then the object shot up, sort of zig-zagged, and sped away (north) in a blink.\r\n\r\nwe both ran into the house, but of course, the adults just laughed off what we were saying.  we did not go outside to check anything again, as we were truly shocked and a little frightened by our experience.\r\n\r\nmy friend's cat acted very strangely the rest of the evening - sort of moaning and meowing in a way i've never heard a cat act.  the next morning when we went to meet up with our friend, we were 25 minutes late.  unbeknownst to us, the clock had lost time, which had made us arrive late to our friend's house.\r\n\r\nthe only really interesting thing about all of this was that i have always been amazed and liked to read stories, etc about ufos, but i never once saw in any picture, story, whatever, what i witnessed that night.  not until 25 years later in january/february 1992 when i was casually watching an episode of unsolved mysteries narrated by robert stack.  it was about ufos, and i was watching it in passing. it was then(and only then), that i saw a supposed picture of a ufo that was 'exactly' what i saw that night in lafayette, indiana...  come to find out, the picture was taken in indiana and it was taken by a policeman.  i have never been able to locate that particular episode of unsolved mysteries, but it is on record, and i definitely know what i saw.\r\n\r\ngrowing up in lafayette, indiana, on occasion, there was air traffic backed up from the chicago airports in our location, but even though this was an odd sight once in awhile, this is 'not' what my friend and i saw in 1967.  it is truly something that has stayed in my mind like it happened yesterday my entire life.\r\n\r\nthe only other time i have seen (in a movie) something closely resembling what i saw was when the spacecraft took off in et

i noticed what appeared to be two satellites moving across the sky.  i immediately thought it strange that there should be two alongside each other and they didn���t seem to follow the natural satellite path and i have never seen a satellite in the sky in my whole year of living in kwazulu natal, whereas i am used to seeing them regularly when living in johannesburg.\r\nsuddenly from two, there seemed to be many satellites all floating across the sky in the same direction.  from where i was standing it would have been from ballito side towards durban north.  at first i couldn���t believe my eyes, it was surreal.  then all sorts of emotions began to flood through me.  i was filled with powerful need to share the experience with others and to check if they could see what i was seeing.  i began frantically calling friends and got no answers.  then, a friend called me back and i was able to describe what i was seeing.  it was absolutely incredible to see so many 'satellites' moving in random formation across the night sky.  i phoned my father in johannesburg and asked him to check if he could see anything moving across the sky using the moon as a reference point. i wanted to know if what i was seeing was visible only in natal or if it was also visible in johannesburg.  neither my dad nor my friend could see anything happening up in johannesburg. \r\n at this point i was filled with awe and excitement.  at no time was i afraid, albeit i could see that the sky was a mass of craft.  i kept on thinking that i have had a dream of just such an event and now here it is materialised.  i then, contacted another friend who lives locally and asked her to see if she could see what i was seeing.  she said that she couldn���t and that it was simply the clouds moving across the stars making it appear as though they were moving.  for a little while i was disorientated, and could not actually determine what was moving and what was stationary.  suddenly i began to feel foolish and mistaken.  mostly very dizzy and disorientated.\r\nnow that some time has passed i am clear on what i witnessed.  the scudding clouds have cleared up from the night sky and i can see the fixed stars clearly - so at one time, the sky was full of moving stars/satellites and now it's clear with only a few 'fixed stars'.\r\nalso as the satellites were moving across the sky some were in groups of three and some seemed to be joined together.  they were too far away to make out the shape.\r\ni have witnessed 4 ufo sightings to date, but this was the most powerful 'statement' i have experienced.  i cannot believe that i am the only one to have experienced or seen this incredible phenomenon.  the message seemed to be; ���we are moving in, you are not alone���.\r\ni went from feeling tired after a long day and two plane journeys, to feeling empowered, invigorated and uplifted.  perhaps i���m a lone ���crazy��� but i���m a very happy

straight overhead, and blinked out in the south west sky approximately 35-45 degrees above the sw horizon. \r\nit traveled at a constant speed, like a satellite or space station, and never wavered. there was no contrail or smoke being emitted. no strobe or nav lights noticed and no sound.\r\nthe color is what caught everyone���s attention. it was orange, and when it was overhead it did appear to be ever so lightly changing in intensity, as if it were on fire. it was also obvious it was not an aircraft since at such an angle, and as it continued away from us, the landing lights would not have been so bright or visible at all. \r\ni doubt if it was a bolide or space junk entering the atmosphere due to its constant speed and other characteristics. i have also witnessed bolides, meteors, satellites and space junk in the past due to one of my favorite pastimes, star gazing, for over 40 years.

(about 50 feet) i watched the entire 6 minutes and we lost interest as the \"craft\" moved farther away at slow speed. later that evening we saw comercial airliners flying high overhead, we could easily see green, red and the strobe lights. we could hear them also. the craft we saw moved less than 1/4th as fast of a commercial airliner (commercial airliners at altitudes of at least 35,000 feet) and appeared 4 times bigger. there is also a cell tower east of this sighting that we can easily see the blinking red light on top. we each commented several times that there were no other colored lights on the craft but bright white. there were no strobes. we saw several airliners over the next 3 evenings while around campfires and never as low as this craft and never as slow. my wife also saw a meteor the night before the sighting that streaked west to east and lastest 10-15 seconds. what we saw was not a meteor, commercial airliner or satellite and we saw several airliners over the 4 nights we sat around campfires. i would describe this craft as a very large blimp with only a long string of floodlights down it's center. no visible cabin, control surfaces or rudder. can't imagine why a blimp would be flying across the prairie after dusk with about 15 flood lights on it's side and no strobe or red/green lights. we could see the left side and back of the craft.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":31567,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":47.2707403,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09052011-0025","longitude":-101.7733562,"occurred":1314934200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North Dakota","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Blimp","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1315283709000,"summary":"String of lights, about 12 to 15. wife described the sighting as light bar. moved west to east for 3 minutes then turned to sse and moved off over then next 3 minutes. we stopped watching.","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":4,"locationName":"Beulah, North Dakota","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:37207"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Ottawa","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was in my sons bedroom just admiring the nice eveining when i happened to nice the objects.  first sighting ever......2 orange, glowing orbs, raced around in and out of the clouds at about 1500ft.  they moved as fast as a passenger jet but changed direction very quickly.  they disappeared for about 30 seconds and then reappeared for less than 1 minute and repeated the same behavior.  i felt i was witnessing intelligent live as these orbs seemed to \"play' with each other as they darted in and out of the clouds.
