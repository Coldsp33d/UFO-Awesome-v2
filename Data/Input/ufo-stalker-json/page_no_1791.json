 an implant up the nose kind of thing?  i've read the stories of missing time, but not really anything about foreign objects found after a sighting.  just curious.  i was reading in the kc newspaper about a rash of sightings in the area and it brought back all the memories of my sighting.  i did see it with another person, so i know i wasn't crazy.  and i've got another question.\r\n     since this thing was only about 50 feet off the ground, could it have left 'radiation/element' traces or markers that could be picked up from the ground today?  i would be more than willing to take anyone out to the location.  i suppose i have some unresolved issues with my experience.  the whole missing 6 hours of my life is a big one too.  it's the not knowing part.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":31556,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.81256090761653,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09052011-0015","longitude":-94.68094757308165,"occurred":519206400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,   Oval,   Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1315267340000,"summary":"A luminescent light hovered 100 feet from us.  after 10 minutes or so it shot off into space.

(on top of this seawall there is small house) at first i assumed it was some kind of torch, like a tiki-torch or citronella candle that the owner of the house had placed there. i ignored it, and none of the people who were present mentioned anything about it, so i presume they thought the same. after my brother found his cell phone, we explored the rocks. it was extremely low tide that night, so consequentially the large congregation of would-be submerged rocks were very accessible to walk around on. at some point during this sort of loitering, we payed more attention to the object, and began to question the identity of it. it looked to be too large for a torch, but it was above the ground so it could not have been a bonfire. it almost looked like a miniature sun, like a ball of fire, but no flames. it was about 5 to 10 ft. in circumference, completely motionless, besides a slight pulsation or flicker like that of a flame, and quiet (although it is possible that i/the group was not close enough to hear any sounds it could have made). after about 30-45 seconds of observation, it simply \"took off\" extremely fast. it ascended to approximately 500 ft. as it sped away from land out into open ocean (did not go into ocean, it maintained its altitude going offshore). it did this so fast that we all witnessed it actually bend along with the curvature of the earth, and eventually fade out of view (approximately 5 second duration). i have testimony of the entire group that this event took place. all of us were literally in shock, and i'm not sure about the other witnesses, but i also felt excited. i don't believe any of us were frightened or scared, but we were all amazed during the event. i have spoken to all the witnesses since last year's incident, and all recall the event with accuracy. \r\nnotes:\r\n- the ufo did not spin or oscillate to my knowledge when in motion\r\n- there were no other aerial vehicles present during the event\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":31553,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.2441403,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09052011-0012","longitude":-82.5340098,"occurred":1284610200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1315256218000,"summary":"Several friends and i witnessed an orange ball ufo while on the beach at night.

too dark or the object/s too quick/darting to get close-up photos/videos at night with conventional equipment.\r\n     my family and i are in the category of those of you who are unsettled and confused by these witnessed events (but fascinated).\r\n     last night we used high-power binoculars we recently purchased when the large star-like object appeared (suddenly from the east this time)after sunset. for some reason it worked better than our telescope.\r\n     it was nothing like the bright star-like object we saw by the \"naked eye.\" \r\n     large light-blue/grey spherical orb that had small black lines that moved \"snake-like\" around the orb.  there was a definite black \"v\" marking that remained prominent to the right side of the orb from top to bottom. the whole thing appeared to have movement on its surface like the sun's gas emissions and looked like its surface was slowly spinning.\r\n    the other \"stars\" had the same quality but not as pronounced as this particular \"star\" that shows up all of a sudden lately.\r\n     \r\n    \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n      \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

could but just could not make out a shape, it did not move very fast just sorted glided across the side road and over a little building across the street then it went behind some trees and i could not see it anymore. i felt scared i  have never seen anyting fly that low before with no noise, i have seen airplanes in the sky and heard them and this was no airplane. the last few nights when going to bed i get scared, the lights were just to big and the object flew lower than any airplane would. i was to stunned to even think about getting any pictures, i just stood and watched it.","distance":"21-100

morning by low guttural growls, and hackles full up. my chihuahua sleeps on my pillow, i grabbed my gun,and so did my husband, sensing someone was in the house, he listened for a minute, only to see a huge bright light light up the bedroom, and was quickly followed by the loudest sonic boom, shaking the daylights out of our house rattling the windows, even shaking our big garage door. at this point my husband and i jumped out of bed,and went racing down the hallway. as we reached the living room, we could literally feel what ever it was shoot off above the house, we still did a quick check of the house, but we both knew what we had just experienced. we have both been having experience's for years. the next morning my youngest son ( 12 at the time) he is now 13. asked if he could tell me something, he didn't want me to think he was crazy, he then told me he had alien's come into his room, he was hovering, the next thing he knew he was in the air craft with the aliens, they had suction cups connected to his arms, he then showed me the marks they had left. i took pictures immediately, and asked him if he knew the time this had happened. he said about 4 am that morning. i called my husband, and told him what my son had just told me, he was not surprised. i then let my youngest son know that this had been happening to his father, and brother,and stepfather, and grandparents for years. he asked if i had any experience's. i told him that others that had been in the room with me when the alien experiences had happened said the aliens were afraid of me especially the greys because they could not get me under control. that his father, had said that my violent reactions and movements had kept him safe a few times. i have absolutely no recall of any  of these experience's. i have woke up with they feeling like i was fighting,and have found finger print type bruises on my legs, but that on the night of his experience, i had nothing other than being woken up, and the light's, and the sound of the craft taking off. i immediately contacted a well known ufo psychologist about this experience, and spoke with him for about 45  minutes.","distance":"20 Feet or

at about 20% elevation; a very bright orange light caught my eye. once i had focused on the light, you could see at the top, a red light. this object was moving from southeast to northwest at a very quick pace, covering approx 45 degrees in less than 2 seconds. at this point it seemed to slow down to less than half its former rate, to almost a hover. i then could tell it was moving up, and through the clouds. i did not see any reflection of light as it went through the clouds, but could tell that it might have passed through an opening. once it had completely disappeared, i started to return inside when i saw a second orange light (orb), coming from the same area. this orb followed the same path as the first, and up through the same area in the clouds. this orb was approx 1 minute or less behind the first. again, i turned, but this time looking for another orb, and sure enough, there was a third orb, moving on the same course.\r\nat this point i called out for my son-in-law to come out and verify what i was seeing, which he did. we watched three more orbs, moving along the same course as the first group. at this time, my daughter and wife came out to see what was going on, and during the next few minutes, they too saw this event, and counted approx 8 more orbs, totaling 12+ orbs.\r\nnote that with the passing orbs, there were several times that two orbs were in plain sight at the same time, moving in the same direction. also, there were several orbs that took slightly different paths, varying by altitude, and angle of approach. during this event i moved to several different angle/locations to see just where they were coming from but never could get a clear view, with the exception of two different times, where they seemed to flash on, then head out.  this event started at approx 2150hrs and lasted until 2220hrs. we watch until 2300hrs or so not seeing any further orbs.\r\n","distance":"Over One
