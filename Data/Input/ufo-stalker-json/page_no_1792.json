6 ships covered in clouds just flying off. but the weird thing was that these cloud like ships flew away and there was no way they were cloud because seriously, all the other clouds in the sky stayed still and the cloud i was looking at earlier that was shaped like a genie was gone. i was well freaked out and i didnt know what to think about anything, on the train ride home i felt good for some reason but at the same time i thought i was going mad. and i know it wasnt the weed that made me hallucinate because weed doesnt do that. it was the weirdest experience ive ever had in my life. i did feel alive after it but at the same time mad, i didnt know what too think or do. i only told one person and he didnt say nothing to me after i told him. so i never told anyone until i saw mufon on tv.\r\n\r\ni couldnt remember the exact month or date but it was around may - april time.\r\n\r\ni drew a rough sketch on paint, ive also added another picture which the ufo reminded me off. if you combined the too covered in clouds, you see what i saw.","distance":"501 Feet -

area\" half joking because of my hurricane sighting, when he received a call from his wife at work notifying us of an object in the sky.   we quickly located it and by that time it had already been hovering, according to my sister in law, for 20 minutes.  we sat and watched as it seemed that there was a white bluish light that was flickering and pulsating a red light with no apparent rhythm or pattern.  it was stationary for about 10-15 minutes, and about at that point my brother left to go put his children to bed.   maybe 5 minutes after he left it began to move west from it's location extremely slow.   it traveled until it seemed to be reaching the area of sh 99(i was right off of mason rd.) then turned south and basically was heading right towards me, in a southerly direction.   all the while changing it's center light from a bluish green to red.  when it arrived almost right atop where i was standing i could make out a bluish green light in the middle that stayed constant while red lights around it blinked rapidly with no rhythm at all.  by this point i don't know if it was other aircraft in the area but there was a sound roughly like a small cessna (but a bit more choppy) with intermittent jet engine noises, it was quite strange.   i could make out the lights to be roughly 2-3 red lights on one side blinking rapidly with a giant red one on the opposite side blinking just as rapidly.  as soon as it was about 80 degrees in relation to me in the sky it turned suddenly and started heading back east and then back north/northeast.   it traveled north until it was in the same spot, roughly where we had first located it and hovered again for about 5 more minutes.  it then began to move again... did almost the same exact circle, but didn't come quite as far south, but was changing it's 'main' light from bluish green to red.  it then by the time it was reaching it's 'hovering spot' for the second time began to move very quickly off north, i mean fast, probably 3-4 times faster than it was traveling in the first place, and then disappeared behind the tree line.  the whole ordeal lasted (in my account) for a little over an hour, it started right before 9:00 p.M. and ended right after 10 o'clock.  \r\n\r\ni'm including a video that my brother took when it was on it's second 'loop' around katy.  it's on the far right side right above a street light in the video.  you can see in the video how it was lighting the  clouds up around it as it moved.  he captured it, on it's way back east and right as it was about to turn north.

like a bug at a street light before i tried to get someone else to see it,i ran down stairs and remembered it was to late to get the neighbors so i ran back up stairs and continued to watch it ,then i noticed what looked like molten medal pour from it when it would stop and hover, it would fly around like a bug then stop and hover and drop this stuff, about 15 min in to this it got real bright and flashed out,i sat there for about 10 min and saw nothing ,i went back in my apartment and sat by the window and waited another 10 min or so and saw a flash like cloud to cloud lightning and went back out also had a high pitch ringing in my middle ear  \"may not be related\" ,there was another big flash and it came back as a small light ,it grew like cell under a microscope with time laps photograph back to it original size and went back to doing what it had been doing ,about 10 min later it pulsated 3 big flashes and split in to 2 ,they flew like 2 planets in each others gravity spinning together and at the same time still flying around like bug's and at times they would spin apart and fly alone but still with in 100 yards of each other,this went on for 10-15 min, then they both stopped and and flew at each other merging back in to 1 it flew around for another 10 min or so and then flew to the north west at high speed toward mmnas ,shortly after that 5-10 min the helicopter flew back over there and flew around the area for about 5min ,by this time i was so flipped out i called the police lol ,i asked if anyone had reported any lights in the sky the woman said no and asked me if i wanted to make a report i said no..Later i talked to other that had seen same thing on different night's and even years before and years later..","distance":"Over One

time. i promised to you new photos and i have some. but, i do not think that they will be what you have expected. i am anyway planning to go with my camera to one place in the next few days and try to get some more. to try. \r\n\r\nin the evening of the same day that i sent you that letter i went to sit in a park. above me and among branches there was a nice patch of sky. it is evening, it is still completely bright. there is a star switching on and off just in front of me. it is blinking, but blinking unbelievably bright. it is blinking like it is trying to tell me something in some code. i look and laugh. \r\n\r\nit is late in the evening and i am sitting alone on the terrace of my building ��� drinking beer and thinking. i am watching sky. it is a bit cloudy. very bright yellow-green star starts to move very fast over the sky. its color is phenomenal. it is not high above me. i do my signal with hands to it ��� the one i always do. it stops above me and starts again speeding away. \r\n\r\nthere is a yellow star going around. my parents saw it a couple of nights ago. i called them via mobile to see. i told them about this all. \r\n\r\na couple of days ago i am again sitting on the terrace. it is afternoon. i have a very large piece of sky in front of me. i can see airplanes flying over the sky. you can see its wings and vapor trails. something flies that looks like a translucent donut. it has no vapor trail. i am thinking it is just a plane. but it really looks like a donut. i turn around and take my beer. it is gone. i am searching the sky with my eyes. i cannot find it. every single plane that i see is completely visible all the way flying from one part of the sky to another. \r\n\r\nthere are military helicopters constantly flying in the night. foreign ones. you can see that it is a helicopter because of its red and a strobe light. you can hear its sound. chopper is flying over the hill. it is night and i am watching it. all of a sudden behind it there is a strobe. just switched on and off a couple of times. i started laughing. i am mesmerized.  \r\n\r\ni am a dissident here. i can not go out as i like. they are threatening to me. this is the reason i sometimes sit alone on the terrace of my building and drink a beer. i enjoy peace and quiet. nobody is harassing me. i sit and think. this is going to be important for the rest of this story. just to say that nobody ever comes on this terrace. it is always locked and maybe only 4-5 neighbors have keys. it has two entrance doors. i asked my neighbors to give me the keys. they gave me the key only of one door. i simply sawed the second lock to be able to go out.  \r\n\r\none day i am constantly arguing over my mobile with those idiots that harass me. it is night. i am mad like hell. i am surfing facebook and listening linkin park. i am listening this http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=dhtwz07n1ic&ob=av2e . i drop my head-speakers turn around and i am taking my phone. i want to call those idiots and to tell them that i am going to kill all of them. i am fed up. it all lasts just a couple of seconds and i turn back to my computer. the computer has alone changed this song into this one http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=_c1w056mitu&feature=relmfu . this is not the only time it is has happened to me. one night i am listening http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=bbmzy3nkzok and feel really lousy. i turn around to take a cigarette. it lasts just a couple of sends. i sit back at the computer and the computer has switched that song into http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=pxnr8y89tvi&feature=related . \r\n\r\ni have a bit longer hair. i take off a band that i use to tie it into a small pony tail. i put it in my left pocket. a couple of minutes later i am again reaching in my left pocket to take it out. it is not there. i check my right pocket and find it. i am positive 100% that this was like i say it. i come home an hour later. i undress and leave my shorts on the floor. i am thinking about taking out that band to put it in its place just not to lose it. i do not do it. i lay down and rest a couple of hours. later i want to go out. i am going to take another shorts. i check my left pocket. the band is not there. strange. i look on the place where i always leave it and find it there. i am totally confused but i know that i am not crazy. this never happens to me. i am positive about this what i am telling you. they manipulate matter.\r\n\r\nnumber 2 is my favorite number. this will be important for the rest of the story.\r\n\r\ni come home and take some change and the key from the terrace out of my left pocket and put it in its place. i am positive that i took both out. i saw the key in my hand along with the change. later when i want to go out i again take the same things. there is no key. strange. i check the left pocket nothing. i check the right pocket and it is there. the same thing happens to me one more time. i am positive about this. \r\n\r\nsimilar things happen to me a couple of times more. every time i question myself for days if i may be wrong about it. i know that i am not.\r\n\r\ni have a friend. she is a girl. we have known each other for a long time. we go out sometimes in the city for a drink. we sometimes drive together and we are sometimes together on the same terrace. \r\n\r\nwe sit in a car that i took that night from my father to have a ride with her. we are outside of the city, in an industry zone, sitting in the car with opened doors in front of some non-functional supermarket. we are drinking beer and listening techno music. this happened 4-5 days ago. she says i need a cigarette and starts looking for them. just to say that i have previously told her all about this and that i told her that i would introduce them. on a dent on the top dash board there is a cd. she takes the cd up and looks for her cigarettes. she tells me that she is positive that she put it there. i can see that there is nothing there but just a disc. she says strange. she turns around to check her purse which is on the back seat. there are no cigarettes in it. she is a bit mad. she tells me that she had two packs in the purse and that she can not find any. i tell her to check again the dash board. i say it just to say something. she lifts up the disc and the pack is there. she looks surprised. all of a sudden she screams. the second pack is in her lap. i start laughing. she says that she is not feeling well. she looks shaken. i explain to her that the same thing is happening to me. i am telling her that i had nothing to do with it. i was slouching comfortably in my seat all the time. an hour later i move the car to one plain. we go out, drink beer and look the starts. she looks up mesmerized. she sees a very bright star switching on and off two times. she says again i do not feel well. i explain to her what is happening and laugh. i am telling her that i told her that i would introduce them. i did not lie. just to say that i could have known positively if they would want.\r\n\r\nshe told me that her computer also started to act strange.  \r\n\r\na couple of night ago we are sitting on the terrace, drinking beer and chatting about unfair world. it is night. i see a star moving across the sky. it stops and stays in one place. she sees the same. i watch one patch of the sky and see nothing. she watches another patch of the sky and sees whole bunch of them. she says again i do not feel well. i am laughing. i am asking if she is scared. she says not a bit. i was at the beginning. she is cool. \r\n\r\ni call her yesterday and ask her how does she feel. she has had a bleeding for the last ten days. i wanted to force her to the doctor on monday and to go with her. she says it is getting better. she bleeds less. i tell her that they can fix her. i know that they can. i will call her later anyway to check. i hope she will be ok. \r\n\r\ni am sitting on the terrace a week ago, i think and drink beer. there is a wall where i always go to pee. i am peeing and seeing something strange on the wall. those are the photos that i sent it to you. i am thinking that there maybe some kid which has made a practical joke with me. if you check the right side of the symbol you can see that there are three circles. i stay and look into it amazed. on the left side there are 3 circles that look the same, there are 3 in the center and there are 2 on the right side. i look for over a minute not knowing what to think. i go back to the other side of the terrace and finish my beer. i come back to check the symbol for one more time. there are 3 circles on the right side and the geometry on it side is not the same as it was before. i laugh. strange. next day i take my camera and take photos. with my mobile it is simply not possible to shoot anything. it is a piece of junk. the terrace is not big, there is never nobody there. i was maybe 5-6 meters away from that place. if anybody had come to change the symbol i would have heard him. there are no noise there. just the dampened sound of a traffic and people bellow. \r\n\r\nthere is something else about the photos that i sent you. for the first set i saw clearly a metallic sphere. all by now i have thought that there was something wrong with the optics of my camera. it cannot be. all other photos are ok. they manipulated my camera. on the second set of photos, where you see a black sphere, i will send you one of the last two photos marked exactly where the sphere was when i photographed it. only it does not look like a sphere any more. my camera was again manipulated. you have better equipment and you can maybe analyze it a bit better.       \r\n\r\nat the end just to say that i would like to talk to somebody about this all. i have to. i do not lie ��� why should i. if you ask me what they are ��� they are simply a higher intelligence. i have a feeling that they even understand a multidimensionality of the space. we have eyes as sensors. i think that they simply see the energy. i know that they understand everything.  \r\n\r\nand just to mention that i am trying to go abroad. for me it is has here become unbearable.   \r\n\r\nwish you all the best.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

remained visible until the sun rose. \r\n\r\ni live in thompsons station, tn. i awoke at 5:25 am to get my 11 year old ready for school. as i exited my master suite, i noticed that my roller blinds were up on one of the three living room windows. i also noticed smudges on the windows, which concerned me, because i had heard 3 strange noises earlier that morning (around 3:00am that i dismissed as non threatening, and remained in my bed). i immediately, stopped in my tracks to evaluate these things, being concerned that we may have had a breakin. the roller blind was extremely concerning because we always close them because you can see in our house at night, when they are left open. not to mention, i had just cleaned the windows the day before, because my family has been sick with allergies, so i know that the smudges where knew. \r\n\r\nas, i approached the window, the realization of the noises, that i heard earlier settled in. it was the roller blinds. now that i realized that, it was apparent the three noises, where 3 attempts to get the blinds to that level. \r\n\r\nonce, i arrived at our window that faces east/south east (murfeesboro proper, i reached to pull the blinds down, i noticed a stationary flashing object in the sky. i watched it for a few minutes, and then noticed a smaller object to the right of it that appeared red in color and remained stationary for that couple of minutes. \r\n\r\nnext, i went to awake my husband and asked hin to please come see something (not telling him what i had seen, seeing that he would have laughed and went back to bed). after much cohercing, he went to the window and confirmed that i was not crazy. that i was seeing these things in the sky. he observed them for atleast 10 minutes and i went to get the camera. i kept trying to take a photo or video, but had alot of difficulty getting my camera to work. mostly, i attributed to being in the dark. i then went and woke up my 11 year old who also came down and witnessed the smaller object approach the larger object, then the smaller object changed direction, and zipped across the sky at a speed not even possible.\r\n\r\nafter, a few days i decided to google ufo sightings near nashville for that date, because certainly we were not the only people to see this. i also uploaded the footage from my camera and did find that i had captured images of it. they are shakey and i was really frustrated, however, they show it morphing and changing color.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit was quite remarkable. i tried to record it but everytime, my camera would turn off. i have seen many strange things in my life, and i have always been able to rationalize them out. this was different...This was \"unique\". it was a larger object stationary with spiralling colored lights, then a smaller object near it that appeared red in color that went from stationary to a speed that took it across the horizon sky within a second. the speed actually was not as interesting as the direction, it went to the north quickly then reversed its position 180\r\n\r\nat a 50 degree climb.

light coming into field of view off to our right front (northwest of our position) and assumed it to be an airplane of some type.       at altitude already\r\n2.      next noticed a second and then a third light/object appear in midair the same shape size and colors.  my thought now was that maybe ohio air guard or something similar was doing maneuvers of some kind but then seeing it closer threw out that notion. \r\n3.    continued to observe increasingly brighter light and started to notice its shape and color (red/orange and seemed to be changing/flowing/bit of pulsing but not blinking,ball like shape).  all then appeared to be equidistant and following from each other ( ie 3 in a row).  \r\n4.       they continued to track to the south getting to a due west position from our vantage point.   at this point the 4 of us were rather mystified by the shape and color of the lights.  they made no audible sound either propeller or jet.  there was ~ 5-7 seconds of travel time between each light.  general speed may have been that of a light aircraft but may have been less than that.  we did not notice any structure between or around any of the lights.  estimated entire distance of the length of lights 500 ��� 1000 ft?\r\n5.       the lights continued to track due south and toward the southwest of our position until we lost sight of them behind trees.  likely viewed for a 3 mile track.  general track of their travel seemed to be from north to south.\r\n6.       managed at the last minute to capture a cell phone photo (5 mp) of the third object before going out of our view (attached)  a bit blurry but you can see the general shape and color.  photo does not due visual experience justice.\r\n\r\nobservations - the objects traveled a steady pace/speed as would a light aircraft if following their same pattern.  the altitude level/constant the whole viewing.   possible altitude of 2 ��� 5,000 feet.  estimate degree of inclination of 15 degrees.  believe that distance from our position at closest to the west was between 1-2 miles. equidistant from each other and level, never varying as in locked in with the other.  these objects made no sound, had significant size and brilliance, were certainly not normal aircraft, rotor craft, satellites, iss, fireworks, rockets, flares, meteors, planets, stars, weather phenomenon, blimps, balloons ��� hot air or otherwise, suspended objects, reflections, remote control devices, projections, or lanterns, and were not being towed by another aircraft,  etc.   no exhaust or smoke could be seen emitted.  i must say if this was a hoax it is one very very elaborate well-funded/planned coordinated high tech hoaxer(s) covering an amazing geographical area (basically around the world based on my limited research so far).    no visible structure between above, below, in front, in back\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

colombus ohio. it was a very clear night, there were zero clouds in the sky.  we stood and watched for about an hour to an hour and a half. we observed many aircraft including helicopters, airliners or jets, small aircraft, and a few different military aircraft. i am very familiar and used to seing small aircraft since there is a small airport less than a mile from my house where i have lived my entire life.  we observed and talked about each aircraft we saw that night guessing what type of aircraft it was since we are both \"fans\" of aviation.  it was just about the time for me to go into my house and for my friend to leave. we said our goodbye's and he walked towards his vehicle and i turned towards my house when out of the corner of my eye, i saw a bright yellowish white light that was bright enough to get my attention. the light was just above my house from my point of view and to the south of my house towards the nearest city.  i said to my friend what the hell is that??? he turned around and walked to my side when he said i have no clue, we went back and forth, both saying oh my god what could that possibly be? i was very scared and im sure my friend was too, wondering what this was and what it would do next. it was just a ball of light. there was no aircraft for the light to reflect off of. it was just one single light that remained solid for the entire time i saw the unidentified flying object. it was hovering very slowly but it had one general directional path, however it moved slower than any flying object i have ever seen.  i remember my friend telling me to shut up for a second so we could listen for the engine noise but we heard no engine at all. there were no other aircraft in the area at the time. the light was also much brighter and larger than the other aircraft i saw that night or any other night. we observed the object for maybe one to two minutes but its really hard to say how long it was because it seemed liked it lasted forever, it was like our shoes were glued to the pavement.  after a few minutes of watching and discussing the object it dissappeared and the light was gone. it just vanished, no more light.  we looked and hoped to see the object again but that was the last we saw it. we sat and talked about it for atleast another half hour trying to think of some explanation for what we saw, in the end we couldnt come up with anything that we know of on our planet that could explain it. eventually my friend left and i went inside not beleiving what i had just seen.  i immediately ran down my steps to tell my father what i had seen, thinking to myself on my way down what am i going to tell him? is he going to think im crazy? i told him anyway and he listened and surprisingly he believed me, but how much can you believe when someone tells you a story like this.  i know if someone told me this story i would probably think there crazy.  so thats the end to my story, was it aliens? i dont know but probably not, who knows? what i do know is that its something that is either not from this world or very well hidden from us by our government, but it wouldnt be the first time out government kept a secret from us.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then

i had just passed ave l and a small house on the side of the road to my right (in the direction toward 60th). through my peripheral vision i could see an object moving quickly toward the ground in a straight line. i turned to look at it since it caught my attention. the object was emanating many colors, i couldn't tell what color it was exactly, it was as if it was cycling through many colors at once. there was no point from which lights were coming, the whole object was that color or colors all at once as it moved, it wasn't shining and it didn't project any beams of light. the object looked to be round in shape however not a sphere, more like a donut shape or a wheel but no hole in the middle or at least i couldn't see one it moved too fast. once it reached near the ground i lost sight of it for a split second as if it disappeared completely. then it reappeared and moved straight back up. not at an obvious angle like a plane or any angle i could tell. simply straight back up. i was still moving toward the object the entire time (which was about 3 seconds). once i saw it moving up toward the sky i tried leaning forward to look and see if i could catch it again but it was already gone. the object had only been gone for a second when my phone started beeping low battery, that scared me further. i had also heard a static noise when i first saw the object, i was talking over speaker phone and over my car's speakers so when i heard the static it was quite noticeable. the distance from me in my car driving toward it at around 65mph to where it was is probably about a football field in length, it wasn't very far but it wasn't close enough that i could see many more details and it didn't linger. it was a very scary few moments that had me

on our way back to town when all at once the four of us saw a disc of about 30' to 35' hovering about 10' off the ground right over a juniper tree not more than 400' away from us, and just slightly above eye level. as i went to shine the spotlight on the object, the driver pulled the cord out of the cigar lighter. he and the outer two passengers began breathing very hard and gasping in distress as the driver sped us off away from the object. the object did not move, and i was the only one willing to keep looking at it. as we approached the main road out, the road went uphill. no, as we sped off up this road, we were now looking down on the top of this object. the other three would not stop until we reached town. i found a willing friend who drove me back out to the location, but the object was long gone.\r\n\r\nthe other three that were with me were almost in tears and very scared. i kept telling the driver to stop, but he would not. \r\n\r\nthere was no doubt that this was a flying saucer hovering right before our eyes. the saucer was towards the bottom of a very steep hill about 50' above the small creek, and just above the 8' to 10' high juniper tree. although it was emitting very bright blue light, this light did not cast outward very far only shinning on the ground right below the craft. i probably could have hit it with a rock\r\n\r\nthis is just one in a series of even greater sighting with multiple witnesses. this being the second of several very close encounters, this area is still very active, and these witnesses will not go back to these areas after dark. as the crow flies, this area around bagdad arizona is not that far from luke air force base, who does daily training in this area, and also not that far from area 51. however, i'm sure we

looking at the stars in the clear night sky trying to identify constellations and pulsars. we watched the stars for nearly an hour and noticed how they moved across the sky over that hour or so, from our view out over the atlantic ocean we could observe that the pulsars we saw flickering moved in an upward/ rightward motion over time. i stopped looking at the stars and moved to the bed to watch tv while my wife sat down on the sofa having turned it towards the balcony door to view the ocean and hear the waves. a short while later she mentioned that she saw a really big and bright star, i got up to look and was immediately amazed by its brightness and size as it was undoubtably the largest and brightness object in the night sky. i grabbed our dslr and tried to get a picture of the star, at first i attempted to set it to the slow shutter manual focus setting, range the object by hand and take a standing freehand shot of it. i got a fairly clear picture with a lot of appendages and short protrusions and immediately recognized that i could not keep the camera study enough to take a stable shot freehand. i grabbed the ice can and a box of cigarettes and made a base for the camera i took a decent shot with a 200mm lense as close up as was possible with my camera.  i used the camera's after shot zoom in function to see the object closer and noticed that it was accompanied by two small red orbs (too small or too far away for high resolution viewing) these orbs may might be lense artifacts, i'm not sure, but they were not equal distances away from the main object as one would expect if both objects were both artifacts of the lensing apparatus. my wife suggested that i set the camera to the slow shutter autofocus setting and let the camera range the object to see if it could range it better automatically, and to my surprize the camera easily ranged the object and put it in focus (tried this before with other stars and the camera cold never adequately approximate the range. once again i zoomed in and noticed a slightly greenish hue around the object and the same two red orbs near it (again these may be lense artifacts) i took about 7 shots of it over the couse of about 30 - 45 minutes and over this time frame the object only moved upward (slowing and at an unperceivable rate) and never to the right as the other celestial bodies did. i found that odd. there was something strange about this object i felt kind of anxious watching it. the object remained at the same position horozontally relative to the balcony for an undetermined time, as it was still there when we finally went to bed for the night. it did however appear to move directly upward vertically at a extremely slow rate between the time we first spotted it until we walked away from the balcony.

around and jumped off the speedbump in direction of jenny,s scream, there directly south of us at where we had just rounded the so. end of the complex ,across the other side of the rd. were 30 to 40ft. trees scattered all the way down to the end where the light was. it was monstrous. like that of a freight train the beam ,30ft. up into the trees ,was beaming through them and was moving fast, it was as if it was roaring but it wasn'nt ,christ it was coming rt at us through the trees, god what the hell is this, i moved forward to the opposite side from us to get a better look. where we were, it had to exit the trees and come in to view, as it did  the world stopped, as if in a dead time, it came through, two huge cylinders like torpedoes not one, but two, that flew side by side, nose to nose, blu-white light, in bands of intense arc-light blu, followed by white and blu again, so blue like an arch welders blue, so intense , past our heads not 30ft.. above us. at the speed of light and sraight in to the the next blding up from us and changed into bright lines of geometric patterns of laser light colors of orange, changed direction and shot out into tke sky. in a nano second, it was over the santa catalina mtns. now spinning and revolving as a sphere of orange light, then in a flash it moved over midtown tuscon as a spinning sphere n blu-green and white. like the

dancing in the street, yelling,\" did you see that!, danny did u see that\", i couldnt speak ,my throat closed up, suddenly looking up, way up in to the giant eucalyptus skywards, it came back! god, \"it was in the tree\" , a bright living laserlight of orange ,living,moving, 30ftx40ft. like moses,s burning bush of god, it stayed for 30seconds, and then as quickly was forever gone.  were not

july, 1952, a few weeks before my seventh birthday. new houses were being built on hollywood street in detroit. i was with my sister and a friend playing king of the hill on the dirt mound from a dug out basement. we heard loud jet sounds and looked up to see them. the sound was coming from the north. flying south as if over woodward ave was a round object that was like the size of a dime held at arms length being followed by two jets we had known as thunder jets. we thought it was a ufo being followed by jets. it looked like a ballbearing, a silver sphere. we watch as they headed south toward downtown detroit. the silver sphere, as we watched turned west. this was a sharp 90 degree abrupt turn with no change in speed. the two jet made a large radius turn as they followed. at arms length the sphere seem to travel 15-18 inches accross the sky after turning. it then stopped in mid air. as the jets got closer the sphere got smaller as if we were in direct line with it as it accelerated into space. we could no longer see the sphere but the jets circled two or three time in the area where the sphere appeared to stop, then they headed back most likely to selfridge ang base. we ran home and told our parents what we had seen. they checked the news papers for the next couple of days and said there was no mention of it. \r\n\r\na couple of weeks ago my sister asked me if i remembered the ufo that we had seen. i told her i never forgot it and have been telling people about it all my life.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then

there talking & scratching lotto tickets i noticed a light out the window approx 400ft. away i told her \"check those out\"! while we were watrching the light move around up down left right, a second one appeared, then they were both bouncing around as if they were dancing. the lights went about40 ft away from eachother, then they took off towards eachother and the 2 became 1, then a few seconds later they separated and started bouncing around more. after a few minutes of this a third light appeared and it was red, it was like they were talking to eachother and dncing around. eventually they all just dissappeared, but i have returned to the very spot on several different accasions and the lights are there, kind of like the marfa lights of marfa, tx. the first time i saw these lights, they scared me crazy!! \r\ni would go and take different friends with me to see if they saw them as well, and they did. i would not let anyone out of my vehicle, i would keep the doors locked and windows up!!\r\ni can't figure out a \"logical\" explanation for these lights. they have been driving me crazy wondering what they are. i have been to the area in the daytime and there is nothing out there that could explain this.Alkso i have been there in different kinds of weather- cloudy, raining, clear, windy,calm etc...- and they are there. however, it is not every night that they come out to play, sometimes they're there and other times they're not. i dont know what they are, but it's driving me crazy!!\r\n            thank you, tamy","distance":"101-500 Feet,
