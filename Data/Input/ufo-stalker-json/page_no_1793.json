2011 rev war reenactment of the battle of monmouth. i arrived with my family friday night and several people said to have seen a strange glowing object with no sound flying overhead but i didn't see it for i was in the bathroom at the time. plenty of witnesses to that sighting. saturday night\r\naround 10:50pm est i was outside talking with my commander when another member pointed out there is something in the sky. that is when i turned and looked up and could see a round disc that was glowing red/light pink with an aura of the same color around the edges (reminded me of the reentry of the space shuttle glowing from the burning plasma underneath. same color and aura effect.) no sound coming from it what so ever but could hear a passenger jet and see one flying in the distance away from where i was standing. this had no wings and i kept saying it looks like it might be entering our atmosphere or skipping off it. that is when i noticed it making a left turn and continue to fly out of sight. we all didn't know what it was but most laughed it off as a ufo. after that i kept an eye out for it and close to 20 minutes later it appeared again but this time seemed to be flying slower and had a slight zig-zag, wobble as it was turning and slowing down even more. same burning aura covering it and around it. again no sound. it flew the same flight path as before. knowing that an altitude of 120 km (75 mi) is where atmospheric effects become noticeable during atmospheric reentry of the space shuttle the disc appeared to be a about 2 centimeters radius. this tells me that this disc is huge that is entering our atmosphere.\r\n\r\nmy personal feelings at the sight were that of awe as well as investigative as to what it was i was seeing and taking account of others reactions to it as well to make sure i was not alone in seeing it. my whole family seen it too. when i seen the zig-zag wobble in the flightpath and slowing down i recalled the space shuttle doing the same to bleed off airspeed. there were was a couple fighter jets (f-16) flying in the direction of the disc's flight path 5 min after losing sight of the disc the second time flyby. \r\n\r\nthere were others that seen

5-10 minutes when we noticed a ufo flying towards us from the west heading towards the east.  the object would move from side-to-side zig-zagging it's way towards us until it stopped and hovered.  this amazing object was very bright and it flickered every color in the rainbow.  the colors were extremely vivid and it changed colors extremely rapidly.  we couldn't see this from the ground when we were watching it, but after reviewing the video we noticed a smaller light located at first to the bottom-left of the ufo, and then to the top-right of the ufo, that would randomly blink on.  this

at 10,600 ft. asl. sitting on couch looking through windows at the peaks of mountains (ski areas) above breckenridge, co. was looking out at peak 9 and 10 (from emmet lodge rd) and noticed a 'huge' submarine like object hovering (stationary) between the 2 peaks on the west side of breck. it wasn't moving at all. metallic dull grey in color and could only see the 'front' of the object, but because of the 'nose' of the object it was easy to assess that it was an actual 'nose/front' of a very large cylindrical object having no wings or other extended phalanges of any kind. it stayed there for at least 2 hrs. totally motionless (i did not report it or mention it to anyone).\r\n\r\n2nd. sitting: nov. 18th. 2008 about 3:15 am. observed from new residence in blue river (10,240 ft asl) just south of breckenridge on rt.#9. was up late that night and lounging on the couch while reading. after, turning out the lights and just relaxing in the dark while looking out at the many, many astonishing stars on a clear unobstructed night noticed 'one' particular star (at least it looked like a star, but i could not tell how distant it was although it looked like a star among the others) began to expand its countenance so-to-speak. it caught my eye and i was fixed on it. now, you know how in movie films the camera man zooms in on a shot of a particular object or person -- as in really quick spaced steps? you know, how the object through 2 or 3 really fast and deliberate steps zooms closer to you and immediately takes place and the object or person is immediately in your face as you are viewing the movie? well, that is exactly what happened: with only about 3 or 4 immediate 'zoom steps' towards me the object presented itself and then abruptly stopped over the mountain my house faces just above the trees. it was absolutely amazingly beautiful...A spherical shaped (flying saucer type) with windows all around...Like a mouth piece on harmonica's face (spaces for placing the mouth over to give out harmonics). the 'harmonica's face/windows' from what i could see were faint but noticeable and well defined, filled with radiant white-gold light and also wrapped in a beautiful and brilliant golden white light that almost concealed the object in its stunning auric glow. yet, as i said it was quite view-able and defined in its saucer shaping. it was about 1/2  or 3/4's of a mile above me as it hovered over the tree tops of the mountain where my house faces. it hovered there for about 20 seconds or so in brilliant array as if showing itself off in all its splendor--no, there was no inward revolving of the 'windows' from what i could observe.However, the up and bottom borders of the windows did look as if they were revolving. no other lights than what i have described. it was about the size (from that distant) of about 2 football fields. then it backed up at a 90 degree angle, i.E. lifting it's back end up as if the 'harmonica type face/windows' were pointing directly down toward the trees. again, with the windows pointing down...It backed upward - paused for a brief second and then descended instantly behind the mountain. it was absolutely incredible.\r\n\r\nsitting # 3: this just took place the other night about 2:30 am. the stars were visible on a clear night. it seemed like ten's of thousands of them were out and there was a lot of commercial plane activity as well. all of a sudden from the same directions of dia (denver international airport)an object shaped just like the space shuttle flying-more like gliding at such a perfect hypnotizing-gliding type of speed. it was positively stunning in its flight pattern. just gingerly gliding only about a mile or so above the mountain that my house faces with commercial airline planes flying miles and miles above it. the entire object was shaped exactly like the nasa space module except for one thing: the entire object was pure white-yellow light...That's correct; the entire object was entirely light shaped just like the nasa space module and about 3 to 5 x's the nasa space module's size by my visual observation and subjective assessment as to measures.Yet, clear enough all the same! the observation took about 30 seconds as it passed over the mountain--my house and the mountains on the other side of where i reside (mount quandry) and continued 'gliding' at that pure and perfect pace--looking absolutely care-free and chilling out. like the other two sittings there were no sounds. of course, being in colorado one has to wonder whether it is 'our's or 'extra-terrestrial' because of the government bases in the area. \r\n\r\nnote: in the last two weeks there have been some very strange occurrences in the night skies taking place above where i reside. just early this morning around 2 a.M.: as i was looking out the window toward the skies there was a very brief projection of a lighted object of which shape i cannot describe. it took place so fast and unexpected, yet visible enough for my eyes to catch it. it wasn't lightning or a comet (shooting star) albeit...About an hour later i did notice a comet flashing by. another, occurrence that took place two nights in succession about 1 am where there was much cloud covering because of storms were flashes of lights in sequence order of motion with triangular shapes beside one another totaling 4 in a row equal distant apart from one another. they flashed two times as if there were moving behind the clouds. now, whether these last two occurrences i am posting are storm phenomena of some type...I cannot say for sure. however, as far as the 3 sittings mentioned above i have described them as best i could. why i have been 'fortunate' or just in the right place at the right time to observe these objects--i can't say, because i would think it unusually to see 3 different ufo's over a period of 8 years...At least i think so!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

and i were in the car on our way to a halloween party in redlands, california around 9pm. \r\nmy friend was looking for a place to park and i was looking at the moon because it was full that night. then i spotted what i thought at first was a falling star. i told my friends to look at the falling star. we all stopped and watched from the car as the star suddenly came to an abrupt stop. \r\nat that moment our ooos and awws became gasps of confusion and shock as we watched the star make a precise triangular maneuver. i was still confused as to what i was now looking at because i knew it was no longer a falling star. i remember one friend saying, \"it's a ufo, it's a ufo\" repeating himself in astonishment. i now couldn't believe what i was seeing. the starlight then starting moving north at about 500 mph and started a blinking light pattern with different colors. red being one of the colors i remember for sure.\r\nafter the blinking light pattern, it then appeared to charge up with an extremely pure white light and then shot off unbelievably fast. in the blink of an eye, it was gone. \r\ni was then convinced that yes, as my friend had said, it was a ufo. i was in shock, but also felt really lucky to have witnessed such a phenomenon. i had never seen anything like that before and till this day, as i search countless on-line videos clamming to be footage of ufos, i still have not come across anything that looks like what i saw. \r\nthe ufo's lights were so pure and bright, i've only seen light like that in stars and no aircraft that i know of as a civilian goes way past

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I had experienced other strange encounters in the past before this event took place. i had never really given much thought however to the past experiences. in 1991 i was with some friends swimming after dark at a nearby lake when we all witnessed several small flickering lights that danced above the surface of the water, and then instantly one by one shot straight into the air, disappearing from sight once they reached the height above the treeline in the distance. we all thought it might have been car lights reflecting on the water, or maybe someone in the woods with lights that were playing tricks on our eyes. we never really knew how to explain what we saw, we just knew we had seen it and it was enough to make us get out of the water. all we really knew was the objects resembled the actions of fireflies or lightning bugs but were moving and flashing at a higher rate of speed. and according to the distance across the lake from where we were, we all agreed they must have been about the size of baseballs or softballs. needless to say it wasn't something i would forget, but still questionable, or at least i thought it was at the time.\r\nthen, in 1995, i was talking with a friend outside of our church building. we saw what looked like 5 golden meteors, all different tail lengths, stream across the sky above us. their tails looked like amberish gold flakes or some sort of fiery golddust. again, kind of spooky to think of something that close to me, but i always thought it must have been meteors or something like that. we even entertained the thought that it would be really neat if they were angels! but without any proof we just chalked it up as something natural that we had witnessed.\r\nin '97 or '98, i can't be certain of the year, i was driving on an interstate that winds through a lot of trees. upon driving past a point where the trees clear for a bit, i was met by other drivers that had pulled over on the side of the shoulder. some were standing outside their vehicles and were pointing to an orb-like object hovering in mid-air approximately 2 or 3 miles from where we were. i pulled over behind one of the vehicles and got out myself. with my eye on the object, i made my way to the guy in front of me and asked \"what is that?\" he smiled, shook his his head and answered, \"you got me! but that lady 2 cars up said it's been there for about 5 minutes!\" it looked like a full moon, brightly lit, stationary, and spooky! well, before i could get too astonished at what i was observing, and before i could even question what the source of light could be, you know, large flare, spotlight on a plane or helicopter, it began to ascend slightly and very quickly started making distance from our line of sight. in seconds it was as if we all had pinhole vision and we were squinting to see it. like a star that suddenly quit emitting it's light, it was gone! i didn't even think of it at the time, but i should have exchanged phone numbers with some of the other witnesses while we talked on the side of the road. by the time i did think about it we had already disbursed from the area and were again back on the road. my apologies.\r\nnow, several years had passed before my next encounter. this encounter is what prompted me to make this report. i've thought about this for quite some time and finally decided it's time to share with the public this particular experience. okay, i'm sure by now most everyone has heard of the famous phoenix lights. if you haven't i would urge you to research it. it's quite interesting and i should note that before this experience i had never heard of the 1997 incident. \r\nmy son and i moved to phoenix shortly after my father passed away in '04. needing a change of pace after a brutal divorce, i took a job training sales associates for a company located in the center of the metroplex. we moved into a small 1 bedroom suite, enrolled him in school, and i started my new job the next day. our routine would last about year before we would seek a roommate with a larger space. a friend from church had a similar situation so we decided to join forces, and we moved into her garden apartment condo. fast forward to july 4th 2006.\r\nthe day was just like any other. i went to work that morning, got home around 4:30 pm and discussed briefly with my son on how his day went. we were preparing to let him spend the night with my roommates grandchild in scottsdale. after he left with them for the evening, my roommate and i discussed dinner plans. too tired to go out anywhere, and too hot to grill, we decided to cook inside and invite her daughter and fiance over.\r\nafter eating we all decided to retreat to the garden patio to visit. it was almost dark outside. the space within the patio area is approximately 12 ft. in width and 42 ft. in length with a 7 ft. wall that encompasses the area. on the west end is a gate that leads to a basketball court, and on the east end is a divider wall that seperates the neighbors patio area from ours. 3 ornamental orange trees lines the length of the south wall. although having larger canopies now, they are still there according to a google map i looked at today. we no longer live there so i'm not sure of any structural changes. google won't zoom down far enough to check it out, at least mine won't.\r\nanyway, the time was approximately 9:45-10:00 pm. my roommate had just stepped back in thru the sliding glass door to freshen a glass of tea. her daughter, fiance, and i were standing by the slider door talking when all of the sudden, something strange happened! starting at the west end gate and moving quickly across the patio floor, a shadow darkened the whole area, blocking out the reddish looking glow of smog and city lights overhead. we all stopped talking immediately and upon looking upward i almost fell to my knees. my roommates daughter gasped and her fiance darted torward the door but stopped to keep looking up. we thought the sky was falling! it scared the living daylights out of us! mesmerized, we just kept staring upward. immediately the air around us had changed. hearing a slight hum as the craft flew over us, the air felt really thick, and a sense of slow motion took over our bodies. i remember looking at each other, our mouths gaped open, eyes wide, utterly shocked. we all turned in the same direction the craft was flying, positioning ourselves to view it from that angle. my roommate was still inside freshening her tea and i remember hearing a couple of cubes tinkling the bottom of her glass. the kitchen window was open and her daughter called in to her saying \"mom get out here quick!\" still looking up, we observed the underbelly of the craft. the whole surface was wavy and shimmering kind of like water at night. there were no lights underneath as best as we could tell, but the surface was like that of mercury or some sort of liquid black metal. the underbelly stretched as far as we could see to the north above the roofline, and as far as we could see to the south on the other side of the block wall that runs the length of patio area. it was mega huge! if you google map the area between union hills and west bell road, you could get a fairly accurate estimate of the span. left wing tip union hills, right wing tip bell. after the craft passed over we observed the back end of the craft. this is how we know it was triangular in shape, much like a boomerang. the craft was outlined on top by an edge that inverted toward the center. it was also outlined on the bottom with the same inversion. the estimated space in between was about 30 to 40 ft. about as tall as a 2 story house. usually when i'm telling someone about this, i usually refer to 5 evenly spaced lights, but because of our field of projectory, it was impossible to see the far left side. we were however able to see 4 lights. the lights were blue-white in color and very bright. they were located directly between the outlines top and bottom and inverted toward the center. all the lights were the exact same size. two on the right, one in the center, and we assume two on the left although we could only see one.\r\nthe craft continued east very slowly until it left our field of sight. the whole encounter lasted approximately 1 minute. we were perplexed and amazed and spent the rest of the night talking about it until about 2:30 am. we talked about it often before my son and i decided to move back home. my roommate never did make it back outside in time to see it.\r\ni often think back to that night and wonder. who was piloting it? was it being piloted at all? how in the world was that thing staying in the air? and why would our government or anyone else's allow such a large craft to fly over the heads of so many people? obviously there exists a confidence that it's not going to crash. i still ponder it's origin. it doesn't seem like we should have technology that could produce such a machine, but then what do any of us really know?\r\nwell, i guess that's about it. i should tell you i haven't seen anything since that night. i'm not entirely sure i want to. but every now and then, after the sun goes down and the stars come out, i will sometimes go outside just to look up at the sky. i pray more now than i used to. not because of ufo's, but because i have had the opportunity to realize there are things that exist that are much bigger than me. i've learned to trust my creator. i've learned to study the bible and put to practice it's precepts. is there life on other planets? i don't know. while it seems arrogant on our part to dismiss the idea, i'm not sure i've understood why it would be all that necessary. at any rate, i guess god could do whatever he wants and if he wants et's then i'm sure he will have them. until we know for sure it's anybody's guess but i can say with confidence that i will never, ever forget that night.\r\nthanks and god bless!  \r\n     \r\n    \r\n","distance":"101-500

2011 and a shooting star caught my eye. then while i was standing in my back yard i looked to the south east wow i thought thats a bright star... so i watched this thing in the sky move slowly and as to hover and move around the sky bobing up and down.... it at first looks like just a bright star and ya think oh!!! thats the northern star.. ummm but it was south by south east hmmmm.... so i started to stair at it and it revealed some streaming lites out of the bottom of it like in a open to pointed shape all downword five of them.. it would glow brighter in a yellow white pink edges semi round starish shape and flash the tails of white blue green on and off slow not super fast or like a plain or helli, so also it was too close to be a star... i ran inside the house and got my cammera and started taking night shots of it.. then it hit me this is no star!!! so i wanted to flash a light at it as to get its attention maybe make it do somthing... a plan ran through my head and i jumped on top of my rack on my jeep with the cord of my hand held high powered 4000 watt plug in lite ran through the window and i pointed the lite at it and started flashinhg my lite on and off like morse code in mind to maybe get a reaction and all the while doin this at the craft... it moved i got excited and did it again it floated behind the top of a tree as to avoid my flashing it... then came out to one side of the tree adn for like an hour we seemed to flash back and forth at eachother... i realized at that moment it was not as far up as i thought but farther out in the skyline maybeee... duno??? but it would as it seems wait for me to flash back so i would wait different times to test it and it would wait too before flashing the streamers. i was verry drawn to this lite the longer you look at it it would like just freak ya out, ya wanna look away you feel weird kinda wanna rub ur eyes... ha! which trust me i did lots!!! it would flash five streamers out of the bottom and get bright then they went away. they seemed to grow out the bottom if that makes sense??? i stared leaving the lite on and circling the orb /star thing and it would bob move slightly get dimmer... then after about 30 minnutes of this game a flash of blue and red orbs slightly appart shot diagnal across the sky several hundred feet bellow the white yellow orb with streamers so fast i cant explain what the heck it was for anything... nothing we have in our world moves that fast!!! so now by this time i really wanna know what this orb/ star thing is at this point,now im thinkin milatery fly by was the red and blue orbs/ lites maybe??? duno???...  but this thing in the sky could make one side of the streamers go out and turn on the other side back and forth and could dimm itself so as to look smaller as if it was just a star in the sky .... i just two months ago got my eyes checked i have 20/20 vision!!! this was no star nothing i have ever seen before and not a helli or jet or plain or toy or ballon i watched it for two hours i cant say its not a space craft... if anyone is in disbalief i was at that very moment i just couldnt believe my eyes i watched it for hours thinking to myself no one will ever believe me.............

viewed over the bank of america building at roughly 11:20 pm.  at the time, we were sitting on our balcony of our building.  the two of us were speaking when an orb caught my eye, flying in a circle, disappearing and then reappearing.  i wore glass and thought maybe it was a reflection from my lens.  i asked \"hey, out of curiosity, do you see that behind you above the bank of america building?\" she quickly did see it   \r\n\r\nthere were multiple lights for about 5 minutes.  they would fly in circles and then spiral down and quickly shoot back up.  we viewed at least 2 to 3 at a time at one point.  at first, we tried recording / shooting photos on an iphone4 camera.  nothing came out.  we remembered that there was a camera in the bedroom so we ran in to grab it.  by the time we were recording, we only got about 40 seconds of footage and they were no longer spiraling down and back up again.  however, you can see in the video that they are circling, disappearing and reappearing.  \r\n\r\nunfortunately, the video quality is horrible compared to what we actually saw (kodak easyshare m380).  although they come up on the camera, they were actually much easier to see with the naked eye for the majority of the sighting.  also, although they appear to be blinking in the video at some points, the lights were never blinking; they remained solid, disappeared, and then reappeared seconds later.   \r\n\r\nas for what we thought the object was, we considered started discussing what we were seeing (the conclusions of our discussion is located below).  i try to keep an objective mind so i can't say what this was.  all i know is that there was something physical there and i've never seen anything like it before. \r\n\r\nsome facts to note: \r\n\r\nwe live 15 minutes from miami international.  however, this did not appear to be an airplane.  they did not maneuver like airplanes and moved to fast to be airplanes.  also, with this proximity to the airport, the airplanes fly extremely low to the ground both during takeoff and landing; these were too high to be taking off or landing aircraft.  further, we are pretty familiar with the flight paths both to and from the airport and this area was not part of the typical flight paths that we have previously witnessed.\r\n\r\nseparately, this seemed unlike any helicopter i���ve ever seen.  they seemed pretty high, did not make any noise, and did not have any blinking lights.  also, again, i���ve never seen a helicopter maneuver this fast or in the same fashion.\r\n\r\nadditionally, if these were helicopters/airplanes, they were flying extremely close together . . . probably too close under faa regulations (though i'm not 100% certain what those regs say). \r\n\r\nlast, in the video, there appears to be a spotlight pointed up into the sky, possibly from the bank of america building.  i do not believe the light was reflecting off of these uafs (they seemed to bright).  however, the moment they spotlight is shut off, the uafs disappear. \r\n\r\ni would be interested to know what miami international had on radar, if anything.\r\n\r\nif you require any further information, please contact me.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional

north /north/east sky. there were clouds of the very thin type and the object was just passing over them as they passed by the object. i went in to grab a kodak easy pic camera but was unable to locate the object with the camera, but |i could still see it visually. at this point i went back in the house to get my mothers 10x binoculars. it was a large translucent object that was starting a flight path from north/east to the south/west. the object was starting to gain a lot of altitude. i went back in to ask my dad to come have a look and when he found the object with the 10x binoculars he said it looked like a clover. i was surprised at his comment so when i looked again with the 10x binoculars it was three glowing round object / like a clover formation behind / beside the original object which reflected light in the beginning but was translucent through the 10x binoculars. this object was starting to gain a lot of altitude so my dad went back in the house and grabbed a 25x power binocular and the object was hard to locate but when i did find it it was really high way up there, still had the clover object with it. when i handed my dad the 25x power binocular to see he could not locate the object and when i turned my attention back to the sky it was no longer there. i was sure it had climbed to such a height we could no longer see it.\r\n\r\nit was 6:30pm at when we gave up. but there is a lot of air traffic here from the atl heartsfield air port as well as dobbins afb which is close. i did not see any f22 ect check out the object but it was really high, higher then the cloud cover to begin with then it ascended to a extreme height.\r\n\r\nthe object was not a plane or helicopter. and guessing from the height and the viewable size it had to have been really large, even my dad comment whatever it is it is big. way bigger then any weather balloon or birthday balloon.\r\n\r\nsurely this was observed by other people through out this area.\r\n\r\nthe height can be figured by the cloud cover this day as the object was just over the passing clouds when first seeing
