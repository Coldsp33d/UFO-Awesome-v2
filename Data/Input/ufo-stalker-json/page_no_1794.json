b and her family were celebrating the 4th of july in front of their house in chino hills, ca. chino hills is approximately 40 miles sw of studio city and witness a. the adult witnesses present were

lights was suddenly spotted. witness b already had her camera in hand, and began to film the object. the witness stated that she only filmed the object for about a minute, due to the fact that she had her hands full with a baby in arms, and was simultaneously supervising the other children who were playing with fireworks. she stated that even though she only filmed it for a minute or so, the sighting actually lasted for a good 15 minutes or longer. she called her sister out of the house (also holding a baby) and her husband was helping the kids light fireworks, so he also immediately observed the object. in total, there were eventually five adult witnesses to the object. witness b stated that the neighbors two houses down also seemed to notice the object.\r\n\r\ni asked why she and her family seemed to have a casual attitude while viewing the object. she stated that at first she did not know what to think-she is not given to \"believing in aliens\", nor is her family, and at first thought that it might a remote controlled toy. she stated that after watching it for a while, she decided it could not be an rc craft, because it was too large. i asked her how large it appeared to be, and she stated \"about the size of a small helicopter\". the witness stated that the object moved through the sky in an ascending straight line, se to nw. they watched the object until it

work.  it was approx 6:30 am on july 3rd, 2010.  i was aprrox 5 miles from the allentown exit when i took note of the morning clouds and the vibrant colors they were displaying.  the clouds were low lying and as i was enjoying the colors, i noted a flash of light from within the cloud.  the flash was pure white, illuminating the cloud from within.  it consisted of two lights, parallel to each other, length approx 100 yards.  the pattern followed a daimond pattern, moving in a counter clockwise motion.  the size would be approx 800 yards or larger.  i thought perhaps something was reflecting on my window, so i rolled down my window.  the lights were still there.  i then thought perhaps something was reflecting off the clouds while i was driving. i pulled over to observe the lights while stationary.  i noted no light source from the ground.  the lights were still there although i had traveled a mile or so down the road.  as i was watching, two small, pure white circular lights took off from the main source of light headed south.  they rate of speed was astounding.  they traveled approx 2-3 miles in seconds.  one turned left towards nj, the other south, towards philadelphia.  they moved so fast they were out of sight in seconds.  it was then i got an uneasy feeling about what i was seeing.  i always thought if given the chance i would want to see unknown things up close, but not that day.  i continued to work, and could see the lights for a few more miles.  when i got to work, i told my coworkers.  not much to my surprise, i got laughed at.  but, the next time i saw one of my coworkers who resides in bethlehem, pa., he told me he thought i was nuts.  but he saw it on the news that night.  made me feel a little better.  i would submit to a

the opposite lane.  the craft was landed in a ravine alongside the freeway, outside of the dalles, or.  there was a state police car there and 2-3 passenger cars parked behind it, on the side of the freeway, pulled over watching it.  i was on my way to the airport so i couldn't turn around and go back to pull over to view it better.  i didn't want to miss my plane.  i have never forgotten it and always wonder if the cop made some kind of report, or if anyone else reported it.  it was so long ago now that i don't remember the exact date.  i do know my daughter had just been born (aug. 28, 1978) and she was with me in the car as an infant, newborn actually, so it had to be sept. or oct. of 1978.  that's all i have.  i'm really hoping someone else reported seeing it because there were people pulled over and the cop there too, plus everyone like me who passed by but didn't stop.  it was in the eastbound lanes and i was traveling west, somewhere maybe around mile post 93?  that's a total guess because it happened so long ago.  i saw it because it was large and had lights on it.  i also noticed the state police car along side it.  it totally looked like a ufo.  it wasn't doing anything that i could see, i drove by pretty fast.  i was just sitting, parked at the bottom of a \"draw\" or ravine.  as near as i can remember it was cigar shaped with red (i think) lights around it.  i was so amazed that i had actually seen a ufo!!  i wanted to go back but thought \"with a state policeman there surely there will be something in the paper!\"  i really thought there would be a

at the autumn of my life and it needs to be told for my own peace of mind. it was 1972 and i had to go to the store for milk, i had three small children. we lived out in the country and the convenience store was about 5 miles away. there was a burn ban in the area due to very dry conditions. it was dark, and as i was traveling along the road to the store which was elevated from the large field below by approximately 8' on a large slope. there were no other cars on the road at the time. as i drove along the road, in the distance to my left approximately 50-100 feet, i noticed a glowing, burning area that i could not make out clearly from the road as i was on the opposite side and going about 35 mph. it resembled exactly what a lit cigarette looks like in the dark when someone inhales. it was that kind of a glow, like embers, but very bright and pulsating in the moonlight and the size of a small bon fire but yet not on fire. i remember saying to myself, \" those darn teenagers around here, they're out in the field starting a bonfire and there's a burning ban on. when i come back from the store, i'm going to knock on the door of the house (which was on the opposite side of the road from the field) and let them know what's going on in their field.\" this was of course before cell phones. when i came back from the store, i had to pull over pretty far onto the opposite embankment facing the wrong way to see where the glowing was as it could no longer be seen from the other side of the road.  as i slid over to the passenger side of my car (my window was already opened), there it was. i was at once terrified and transfixed at what i saw, and my heart began to pound wildly. there below me in the distance, approximately 50-100 yards, was a disk about 8-10' across. it was off the ground about 5-6', perhaps hovering, but i saw no visible means of support or heard any noise or witnessed any movement.The entire top of the saucer was invisible, or not there, as if whatever forces were at hand, had put the top down like a car window, and out of sight. i could see clearly down into the craft which was silver in color on the outside. there were instrument panels about 10\" deep (with small squares and grids) encircling the entire inside approximately 3' off the floor of the craft. all the panels were tilted downward at an angle, there was nothing else inside. the diameter or floor space only appeared to be 4 or 5' within the interior. the colors were iridescent, pulsating and neon like, with reds, blues, yellows, and white, like no colors i have ever seen before or again. all this took place within a few minutes because the terror i felt was overtaking me. upon the realization that there wasn't any entity in the craft and they (i thought at the time) would have seen me. i sped away wondering the whole time if anything was in my car or behind me. my imagination was running wild about what might happen to me. upon arriving home, i raced in to tell my husband so he would go back with me, but he told me to lock the doors and refused to go back with me. i wanted to call the state police, but he said no one would believe me and i would be ridiculed, so i didn't. we went back the next day and there was no visible trace of the incident on the ground. i made a sketch of the craft, but over the years, cannot find it. my friend has since married a state trooper who worked in that county and we talked about it a few years ago. he remembered there were several reports of sightings of a ufo in the area during that time.  i am now a grandmother and great grandmother, but this mystery will always be my most amazing and frightening experience.","distance":"21-100

work area. on the horizon coming toward me i noticed a silver object that resembled a party balloon(octagon) in shape but was spinning very quickly and was much larger. the sun reflecting off of the edges of the craft gave it an appearence of pulsating. my first thought was that it was a helicopter. it remained on an eastward path toward me and suddenly made an abrupt turn to the north and started to ascend rapidly. as it climbed up above what clouds were there, i noticed two other formations of crafts. they were in a diamond formation, with 6 in one formation which was 4 in a diamond and two that looked like they were forming a second diamond attached, and 3 in the second. the one craft that had been flying near the ground then filled in the second diamond shape. my co-worker and i both watched in silence, and no one else on the site ever mentioned it. we did not share the experience in fear of ridicule. i would have estimated the speed of the low flyng craft at around 150 mph and the height was anywhere from 150 to 350 feet and then it accelerated quickly on ascent. i would estimate the altitude of the other crafts to have been around 35,000 ft. they also had a silver reflective look to them.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

of my apt.I let 1 off leash and tethered other on 30' rope. i looked up and there it was pinkish in color what looked like two jellyfish facing away from each other but connected by rigid tentacles , the rounded spear shaped ends had flowing lights with a constant hue in between ( tentacle part) remember im comparing to two jellyfish, the outer shapes. it sat there like there was a slight distortion between it and i like gas fumes but still very clear visually. it was very large, my guess if it were to be laid in a  football field it would cover width and length. i know someone else must of seen this, after watching it for almost a minute i felt my female dog shaking against the back of my legs, scared, i had also let go of the rope that had my male dog sometime during the event, i looked around to see if i could spot him when all my hairs seemed to fill with a static electricity, the craft then shot off towards the southeast in a downward angle , still searching for it i saw what was the opposite  of a falling star shoot up into the sky with a tail of light behind it, miles to the south of me. i did find my male dog back on my porch, im talking about a dog that would live in that field rather than indoors if he could, he was also shaken up badly. both dogs acted very skitish for many hours following, i feel that was the most beatiful thing ive ever seen or could ever see in my lifetime. i would like one of your investigators to contact me, this was not my imagination or a lie or the first experience  ive had of this nature. its appreciated  that someone finally has the brains to look into these events, thank you. im submitting this to you via ps3 i cannot attach my sketch.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
