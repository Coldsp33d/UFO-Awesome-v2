the video either. these were not airplanes! i have never seen anything like it. i called the national ufo hotline to report it but they were not very helpful. i just wanted to document it in case

a shopping trip in medford. i had just entered the local one-lane access/maintenance road, when i noticed a very bright blue dome sitting on the ground to my left and up ahead. i pulled half way off the road and parked.  i always thought that if i saw a ufo, i would try to get aboard.  the dome was so electric blue and bright that after i had driven up to it, i slouched behind the car door.  i thought that the dome must be generating a great deal of heat, but i got up the courage to straighten up and look at it.  there was no heat and no sound.  i was about 12 feet from the object.  my radio was on and i could hear police, highway patrolmen, truckers, and other civilians calling in about the dome.\r\n\r\ni was afraid to try to approach the dome because it appeared to not be solid, but made up of 'electrons' only. it looked like the blue you see in an electrical arc, but it was a perfectly shaped dome. i felt at the time, that a solid object or a person could not exist inside the dome; it would just disintegrate.  the intense blue-light dome did not pulsate.  the dome appeared to be made only of electric blue light. i did not throw anything at it, because that seemed to me to be a rude and violent gesture.\r\n\r\nthe electric blue was the same opacity all over, the edge of the dome was totally defined to the eye. after about 20-30 minutes the dome gradually grew brighter(over 10 seconds, but i felt no heat and heard no sound.  at the end of that time it rose straight up and i could see the bottom.  it was perfectly flat.  i need to emphasis that the dome was a perfect half sphere.  the dome rose slowly at first, then it just took off.  i watched it as it zigzagged aroud the sky, then it went so high that i could no longer see it.\r\n\r\ni went back the next day to look at the site.  the dome reached from about five feet from the access/maintenance road to about 30 feet from the i5 freeway.  i couldn't see any inprint, nor any flattened vegetation.  nothing was discolored.\r\n\r\nsince i had been taught scientific observation techniques, i drew the dome so i could accurately describe to scientists, military, and government officials what i had seen and what had occurred. \r\n\r\nthere was a very short (3-4\") story in the ashland newspaper about the dome the next day.  i worked for the southern oregan state college (now university) in the chemistry department as a technical typist (i typed chemical formuls, etc.). i thought since i was a trained observer and a responsible citizen, officials would look me up and interview me.  that never happened.  i told a couple of chemistry professors about it and to my surprise they weren't interested, and they knew me. i felt very let down by the scientific community.  i also felt that our scientists are not inquisitive, but they should be.  i was astounded that neither the military nor the federal government interviewed me.  it feels good to set this down on 'paper'.  maybe you can find the newspaper article, the policemen, the highway patrolmen, and the truckers (all on i5) and interview them.  if i can answer any addition questions, please contact me. i chose the anonymous option above because i don't want to be contacted by a bunch of kooks.  if you have someone who wants to talk with me and you respect him, feel free to give him my name, e-mail address, or phone number.\r\n\r\nonce again, thank you for providing a forum where i could post my experience in detail.  i was afraid that i would die and no one would know that ufo's really exist, because of a lack of credible witnesses.  please excuse the spelling mistakes, no spellcheck. :)\r\n\r\nwhen i try to submit this document, i receive a message that says: the event date cannot be earlier than the current date, so i changed the event date to 2011.\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:45:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Stationary,Path

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"First thing is first i would like to apologize for the date being wrong on the \"date of event\" area. it was not approximately january 1st 2011. the website kept giving me an error saying that the date i put in was \"later than the current date,\" even though i listed it clearly as \"approximately october 15th 2010.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    sometime in the middle of october 2010, i was up late playing computer games in my bedroom on the second story of my home here in harleysville pennsylvania. i was getting tired around 12:30am and decided to go to sleep around 1:00am. i fell asleep quite quickly in nothing but my boxers. before i go into detail about the encounter i experienced, allow me to explain the layout of my room relative to the map i submitted.\r\n    my bedroom is on the second story on the southwest end of my home. i have 3 windows in my room on the front face of the house and have access to both the attic and the only fire escape on the building. this house used to be an old office building in which my bedroom was one of the offices used. my actual bed is located in the southwest corner next to a window and directly next to the fire escape door. this door has no handle on the outside and only a bar-release on the inside similar to what you would find on the inside of a school entrance door or office building. the door also has a 1.3x1.3 foot window in the top center. the actual fire escape on the outside of the door is nothing more than a metal platform and railing leading down the side of my house with metal stairs. i often use this to have a cigarette when i am at home since smoking inside the house is forbidden by the landlord. this goes to say i am quite familiar with what the scenery on the outside of my home looks like in this location.\r\n    i awoke on this day around 3am based on the dark of night outside, however, when i awoke i was already outside on my fire escape platform. i had not been dreaming as far as i could tell since everything was as it was when i am awake, and have had many vivid almost lucid dreams in the past, and i can tell you this was not that sensation. i was very groggy and confused as to how i had walked in my sleep. i have not sleepwalked since i was about 8 years old, and at this time i was 19 almost 20. i almost immediately noticed something very very large above me after this initial confusion, and took quick notice to my door being closed behind me leaving no way of re-entering my home.\r\n    as soon as i noticed this however, i felt the urge to look at this large object hovering above me. as i looked up i noticed it was sort of rounded in shape but had many many lights on the underside of it. it was directly above me so i had no view of the sides of the object. the lights were a very very bright white. nothing like any fluorescent bulb i have ever seen. these lights were flashing without any pattern it seemed and were located all over the underside of the object in rectangular and very long trapezoidal shapes. the object had to have been at least 250 feet in diameter, possibly larger.\r\n    the underside of the object also had many things jutting out from it with these lights on it as well, but i took a firm notice to one in particular. there was this large piece with the lights on the side of it coming out from the right of the object. it's shape was like an upside down cone with the end cut off. it resembled an air filter for a high performance engine in a car. it had symmetrical lights all around its sides that were identical to the ones on the underside of the object, however the bottom of this piece jutting out was a very very dark gray-black color.\r\n    when i had first looked up, the lights were so blinding that i had to shield my eyes with one hand to see they were flashing and their shapes and locations. i observed all of this within less than 90 seconds before i became very disoriented. i forgot what i was doing, where i was at, and who i was. almost as if these lights were inducing an acute case of amnesia. the last thing i can remember before passing out was the strange sensation of floating. i had never experienced this before, but it was as if i were suddenly weightless. my feet were no longer touching the cold metal platform and i was no longer shielding my eyes. as soon as i was blinded by the lights that were flashing i seemed to lose consciousness, unless the lights caused me to forget everything leaving me no memory of anything afterwards.\r\n    throughout these short minutes the object made absolutely no sound. it was as if it was making everything around it completely quiet. if you have ever heard the saying \"silence is deafening,\" i would have to agree, there were no sounds made after i noticed the object above me. this was extremely strange since my home is on a main road, and relatively close to the pennsylvania turnpike. hearing not even the sound of a cricket chirp or the hum of the highway was definitely weird. i also remember the silence being almost suffocating. it felt very heavy, as if it were making the air thick like soup.\r\n    in my short, and very close observation, i remember the object being about 20 to 40 feet above me and the space in between my house and the neighbors house, and the tree in between the front of our homes was blocking out a portion of this large object. there was no wind, as if time had stopped in its tracks. this is all simply speculation, but it was what it seemed to me.\r\n    after i lost consciousness, it got extremely bizarre. i remember waking up without any senses except for my sight and sense of balance. i was laying down with my eyes looking upwards towards what seemed to be a ceiling. my eyes were not working correctly though. it was as if i had been administered eye drops that you would get at the doctors to dilate your pupils. everything was very blurry and distorted. i remember very little, but i do remember everything was a green/brown/gray color around me. i also remember seeing strange objects above me that appeared to be tools or examination equipment above me, none of which seemed to be created by humans. it was very very blurry though so it was hard to tell if that was exactly what it was.\r\n    i then remember a figure move into view above me. i was unable to move at all, and my vision was very poor so i could discern nothing about this being other than it seemed a little taller than i am and it had appendages like a human being (arms, torso, head, legs, etc.). it did not speak to me, however, i seemed to hear a voice in my head. it was much less a voice than it was a feeling or emotion being conveyed. the very last thing i can remember was feeling very calm, as if this being was trying to help me in some sort of way. the \"trying to help you\" feeling i received was much less about me in particular, but more of a \"you\" as in \"your race.\" i then saw one of the objects above me move slightly, and i lost consciousness again.\r\n    when i came to i was sitting on the edge of my bed. my bed was made very neatly as if i had never layed down at all that night. when i looked at my alarm clock, the time was about 4:45am. i tried to remember how i got there, but nothing came to mind. i tried to sleep, but my thoughts were buzzing faster than i could even keep up with. i could not sleep no matter how hard i tried that night. the only thing i kept asking myself was \"why wasn't i scared or afraid throughout this entire experience?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    i am not trying to garner attention in any way shape or form with this.. this is why i am choosing to remain anonymous. i just hope that maybe this can help somebody understand things a little better, even if i can not understand any of this myself.\r\n    i always thought the ufo phenomenon was a bunch of crap before this experience. since this experience i have been haunted, and have wanted to tell somebody but have always been too afraid of being called a crackpot. the only person i have ever told this story to is my best friend, and he is probably the only person who will ever know who i am and what i witnessed. i have witnessed a few other strange occurrences that happened after this account i have just given you, but they are far less important i think.\r\n\r\ni hope this will help in some way shape or form.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100

better look when i did, it seemed to move then but only because i backed of my speed down to 35. now the craft was a little lower in my view and i had to clime over to the passanger seat to  see the other side and i also had to lower my body in my seat to see the left side the thing was massive. it was longer than the distance it was away from me. back to what happend after i slowed down. i stayed at about 35 for 5 min or so when all of a sudden the lights started to do things. the fisrt light turned off then the fourth light turned off then the second light turned off then the fith light turned off then the third light turned off then the sixth light turned off. and at that point i thought it was over and then like 30 sec later all the lights turned on in the some pattern. at

before. 1 4 2 5 3 6 then as soon as i could i pulled of on a side road and got out and look all over the sky and i noticed that there where 10 plus lights in the sky moving in all directions and no

object and said \" is that a plane?\".The ufo was a starlike craft. we didnt see any red flashing lights, and as it flew by it was silent. the object was a white starlike object traveling horizontally from approximately nw to se. about halfway through our observed flightpath we witnessed what we thought was a \"shooting star\" intersect with the object. then my wife said \"its gonna disapear\", i literaly had my hand over my mouth and it got dimmer and it dissaper.  \r\n     \r\n     from the time me and my f'iance saw this starlike object till it dissapeaed i would guess the distance to be

cover. and i had a good vantage point to observe. i figured the odds off a meteorite colliding with a plane or any flying objects are slm to none. i am not a professional astronamer, or of any ther

morning.I was half asleep but my eyes started to open on my bed headboard was the holographic message.Which i do not know what it means.Tow plantes with rings around them and a comet in the middle.I am thinking someone is playing tricks on me.But it was early morning and the blinds to my room were down and closed how could this be.It was a message either where they come from or some kind of an anlignment maybe in the future.Both planets had rings around them and what appeared to be a comet.I kept it quiet all this time never telling anyone in fear people would think i am crazy.After that my daughter and i have unusual electrical experiences..Now just the other night while i was asleep i saw a grey just his face staring at me with big black watery eyes.I did not feel threatened though.I
