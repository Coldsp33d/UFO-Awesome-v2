objects, oval shaped, one of them seamed different, longer and bigger, flying in a very close formation. i observed them for a few seconds and i was thinking in the same time if i have time to get dressed, grab my camera  and try to capture them on film. the objects were moving in a fast straight pattern. i went inside, grabbed my camera, got dressed and run outside. i had to go in a three clear spot to be able to spot the objects again. i tried to capture them on film but i've stopped after a few seconds because i was loosing sight of the objects and i didn't have time to focus on them. they got pretty far in a matter of seconds. so i switch my camera of photo capture and i snapped a few pictures of the objects. they broke formation and were getting distance between them when i was able to photograph them. immediately after that they disappear. not by distance like furthering away, they just disappeared like dissolving very fast in the sky. i have the original un-cropped photos that i cant send you for analysis. i really regret that i lost time, amazed by what i was witnessing and i lost the opportunity to snap photos when the two objects were so close to me and to each other and more detail could be observed.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

realized that the object had no wings, no tail, no windows, and had 'soft', indistinct edges.  the sky was a light grayish-blue with no clouds, and the color of the object made it blend in with the

windows rolled up and the air conditioning on.\r\n\r\nthe object seemed to move a bit faster than a small plane.  after observing it for about 6 or 7 seconds, it disappeared, as if it became

sky.  i finally decided i need to share this cause i haven't a clue what this was but that maybe others saw it as well and have reported it.  at first i didn't want to report it but it's really bugging me now.  this actually happened to me in march of 2010.  \r\n   but i was heading to work early in the morning, i had to open.  so i left about a quarter to 5 when i opened cause i was working in schererville, in at the time.  takes a bit of time to get there.  it was also early to mid march at the time too.  it was a beautiful clear early spring morning.\r\n   well i live with a cousin right now and his home faces north.  it's a duplex and his front door faces east.  well i left the house and locked the door behind me.  to get to my car i have to walk to the north down the sidewalk to the driveway where i park my car.  when i came around the corner of the house this light caught my eye.  i literally stood there transfixed because i've never seen anything like this before.\r\n   the object/light was to the northwest and it was heading in a northwestern direction.  it caught my eye because it was a large strobing light in the center with 2 smaller non-strobing lights above and below the larger central strobing light.  all 3 lights were also white.  there was no color changing or anything, just plain white.  the central strobing light was in a set rythem too.  i was a steady 3-5 seconds between the strobing.  so i stood there watching these lights maybe 5 minutes or so till they got behind some trees and then i hopped in my car and shot out to route 6 to see it again.  when i first saw them, they had to be 5-10 miles away and over lockport from my best guess.  by the time i got the car started and got out to route 6 which is a couple blocks, this thing had to be maybe 30 miles away by my guess.  i never heard any sound.  and it was a clear early spring day, there were no clouds so you could see forever it seemed.  i sat there watching the lights again till they went behind another set of trees and i never saw it again.\r\n   i haven't a clue what it was.  i've seen planes and blimps mt entire life.  i go out and see meteor showers when it's clear and always look at the stars, planets and constellations.  i've been teaching my nephews and niece about these things.  this object was none of them.  planes don't fly with the wings above and below and they don't have strobing lights in the middle.  planes also don't have just white lights like this thing had.  i never saw any structure because of the distance so all i saw was the lights.  blimps also don't have large central strobing lights either as far as i know.  and i know this wasn't a star, planet or a meteor.  your guess is as good as mine as to what this was.\r\n   as for my feelings about what i saw.  liked i said at the time, i was transfixed.  i didn't want to lose sight of it because of how unusual this was.  so i just stood in the driveway watching it.  when i got to route 6 in my car and spotted it again, i sat there watching it again till i lost sight of it a second time.  i don't own a cell phone because i hate the things but this was the one time i wish i actually had one.  and i didn't go inside to wake my cousin because i didn't want to lose sight of this thing.  the only feeling i've had since is that i want to know what this thing was and that i hope i get to see it again.  every morning or night that i'm outside now, i look in the sky for it.  i want to see it again.  i also haven't really talked about it to but a few people i know cause i don't want anyone to think i'm crazy.  i know i'm not.  i just want an answer to what it was.  i'm not even saying it was aliens either.  but this was something unique and not sure who or what was flying it.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

saw a few meteors and quite a few constellations. then out of nowhere a large amount of the stars started moving! we were examining them and noticed that they were definitely were not shooting stars. they were moving in several different directions, turning around, zig-zagging, and moving up and down, all of which a man-made craft could never accomplish in the present or even near future. then we witnessed a brighter lit craft blinking in accordance with a dimmer one which seemed farther out. then out of nowhere a faster moving craft with blinking white, red, and blue lights that were blinking rapidly changing between those colors came across the sky then halted when it came to the brighter craft i have mentioned earlier for a brief moment. then it continued onward ducking behind the tree line not to be seen again. we kept watching for about another 45 mins to an hour. then about 50 yards from us was a huge unmistakable noise. it sounded like a jetliner on the ground after a long flight, but then it within a split second was completely silent. then upon listening further we heard it again, this happened one more time as we were trying to figure out what it was as this is a setting where we are out in the boonies with nothing like that around. upon the last jetliner like noise we then felt a heavy aura and feeling of fear, as if there was something big pouring its essence our way. then we heard the farmer's dogs across the way behind the tree line barking as though they sensed something bad, and almost immediately we heard a somewhat mimicking noise as though the aliens were trying to mimic the the dogs but we could tell it wasn't the dogs because it was a little different, with a lot more echo to the sound. at this point we decided it was probably a good idea to douse the fire, pack up all our gear (i say pack up but i mean we literally just threw it all in the back seat of my friends car), then my friend said \"if i don't go look i'm going to regret it.\" so after the gear was in the car i was waiting for him to come back, i got impatient with waiting fearing what could be and went to go find him. i caught him as he was walking back in a rather fast pace as he seemed freaked out as we both were. then i told him to hop in the passenger seat and we left slowly trying not to make any excess noise. at this point my friend had his phone out recording just in case something else were to happen so we could capture it in video. nothing else happened unfortunately and i know no one will believe us but we saw what we saw and heard what we

friends. looking into the sky, say what appeared to be a satellite appear over treeline in the horizon. after realizing that first craft was probably a satellite, due to flashing lights combined with increasing altitude and accelerating with tremendous velocity. however, after the satellite left, a large, white, spheroid appeared in the opposite side of the sky. the object was a solid white with a smoky gray core, lights did not flicker and remained constant. the ufo ascended, took a series of 8 45 degree turns, first to my right, then left, alternating in that fashion. after that, it went across the sky, hovered directly overhead at an altitude of approximately 2500ft, then took off, to my right. the lights changed from white to reddish-orange, then to a dark red before completely vanishing from sight from all of my party. note that in the airspace in which the ufo became impossible to see, the sky was exceptionally  clear and also it did not \"hide\" behind cloud cover, or any sort of terrestrial interference. a short period of time later, approximately 2 and a half minutes, a total of 14 aircraft entered into my field of view, from many different directions, seemingly analyzing the domain. however, the red light reappeared, with no signs of its origin, changed to white once again, and started towards the point in the sky marked by the milky way. a jet changed course and seemed as if trying to intercept the craft. the ufo descended, slowed, then quickly darted towards the jet. after a very close encounter between the two objects, the jet preformed a 180 degree turned and went back to where it came from, as well as did at least 3 other aircraft in the area. the ufo then moved in a spiral, gaining approximately 1/16th of its original radius per revolution, clockwise, for a full 4 turns, then once again, changed color; however, this time it darkened, and faded into the darkness of the sky.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

island.  admiring the stars, i noticed an unusual 'line' of bright white vertical lights at about 55 degrees and very far away in the distance (star distance).  the lights caught my eye because they were perfectly vertical,and very close together, making a straight pulsating line of subtle color changes (very faint however, not obvious at first glance) like how a radio or cell tower might look if it were up in space.  this was not a cell tower. when i got home i stood on my balcony transfixed by the lights.  the crazy thing happened when i turned my head laterally.  if you hold your finger out in front of your face vertically (and keep it like that) and tilt your head from left to right, the perspective of the finger remains the same, it doesn't move, stays vertical.  these lights, however, would turn with my head.  for example, hold your finger in front of you, tilt your head to the left and also tilt your finger to the left, tilt to the right and tilt the finger to match.  it was if the light were connected to my vision somehow, whereby altering my angle of perception altered the vertical nature of the lights.  lying down would cause the lights to match the angle of my horizontal viewing perspective.  the lights were there for over an hour, but finally i got bored and went to bed, so they might have been there longer.  not sure what could account for this but i'll look out tonight when i get home and see if i see them again.  i gave a psychic wink to the et's if it's them so maybe i'll have a abduction story before long.  hope not, unless it's fun.  probably too dark

photograph it. these pictures were taken with an 8 second exposure. i zoomed one using iphoto. the object is not something i recognise. it is probably some sort of balloon/blimp. but it would be

star an object flying overhead passed my field of view and was traveling in a straight trajectory approaching from nnw and heading sse toward dishman hills. as i was looking at the object i was trying to process what i was seeing, as i could make out the fact that it was solid, but it appeared opaque in color (almost camouflage). i knew what i was seeing was not an airplane, helicopter, balloon, kite, plastic bag, helicopter or bird. i was somewhat mesmerized and rubbed my eyes to try to get a clearer view as i knew what i was seeing was very strange. it had the solid outline of an oval object but it was difficult to make out any other details. a commercial airplane was visible overhead at probably 20 thousand feet (i could see the blinking lights) the object was very close (relatively speaking)and well below the cloud line - but not close enough that i felt alarmed. there were no lights whatsoever and no sound. the object blocked the background but gave off no reflection of the surrounding environment. instead it appeared somewhat milky and wavy colored (very dimly pulsating?) i got the feeling whatever it was was trying not to be seen - as odd as that sounds. i knew that had i not just happened to look in that exact spot as it crossed my field of view i would have never noticed it. i wanted to rush inside and grab my camera but given the objects speed (50 mph? at a distance of 500-1000 feet?), lack of lights and the darkness, i knew it would soon disappear from my view. i watched as it continued along its flight path in a completely straight line towards the hills. the object made two seemingly impossible flight maneuvers where it shot straight up and then back down to the left as it was passing over centennial middle school and then disappeared out of sight. the whole sighting was 10-15 seconds. i was not scared before, during or after the sighting. i was more just trying to analyze what i was seeing. it was very weird and i have never seen anything like it before or since! i stayed outside scanning the sky where i had last seen the object hoping to see it again (i really want to know what it was). i remained outside for about 15 minutes looking - but never saw it again. \r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

friend saw. i received the pictures and interviewed the friend in great detail to put the report together.\r\n\r\nour friend, about 15 minutes after experiencing the minor earthquake, went outside to look around and observed a black diamond shaped object hovering or moving very slowly in the sky. curious as to what the object was, the friend took a couple of pictures with a cell phone.\r\n\r\nour friend isn't a great judge of distance, but believed the object was large and very high, probably at cloud level. it was a relatively clear day with high occasional clouds.\r\n\r\nthe object made no sound or smoke.\r\n\r\ni asked if it could have been a stealth fighter or bomber and the fried said it wasn't and that they had seen those before and this wasn't it.\r\n\r\ni asked if the object could have been a balloon, rc plane, debris or a hoax of some kind and our friend said there was no way it was that.\r\n\r\ni then asked why there weren't more pictures if it was hovering or moving so slowly and there actually is a 3rd picture that i didn't receive yet.  \r\n\r\ni also asked how did it leave the area or go out of view and it actually changed direction and ascended abruptly out of sight. it moved much faster than any plane or jet they ever saw.\r\n\r\nthe oject moved from east to west and i believe took off up. in pic1 it is farther, in pic2 it is closer and the sequence confirms the direction of travel.\r\n\r\nour friend isn't shook up or affected in any way, but incredibly puzzled by what they saw.  anyone else see something like this in the area?  does it have something to do with the quake?  is it the x37b?\r\n\r\ncan somebody look at these pics to see if they were altered? i can't see any signs of it when i zoom in to the pixel range.","distance":"501

corner of 7th and normandie and i saw this thing above a building spinning like a wobbly top, you know when the top is loosing its momentum and it starts to wobble; luckily that day i had my digital camera, i was taking art at the time at the local college which is why i had the camera that day, i only had a few seconds to react to pull the camera from my backpack, turning it on and snapping the two pictures by the time i had done that the object was gone. i've seen unconventional objects before but this was the first time i had a camera and i felt lucky to have captured it on digital film. the camera model is a canon powershot a95 5mp. the pictures don't do the object justice of what i saw that day especially the spinning movement characteristics of the object that i witness that day. afterwards i took a look at the pictures on the first image it looks like a black sphere, on the second it looks like the object is going, for lack of better word, invisible. looks like when i snapped the second image i captured the object turning invisible. i added arrows to indicate the location of the object on the pictures and cropped one of the pictures.","distance":"Over One
