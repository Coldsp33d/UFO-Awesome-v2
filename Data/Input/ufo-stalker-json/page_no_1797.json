through a cloud of tobacco smoke as i smoked a cigar in my backyard. then in spring 2010 i began to ghost hunt at my house as i took dozens of detailed photographs of paranormal phenomena (apparitions, shadows, orbs, and images emblazened into woodgrain walls and carpet). during this same time through the summer of 2010, i began to take pictures of these apparitions forming within the clouds as i walked. i have dozens of pictures of supernatural apparitions within cloud formations that i only noticed after taking these pictures of normal weather phenomena, and enhancing their contrast, shadows, and lighting on photoshop. these photographs are in no way falsified or a hoax. they are 100% real, and you can tell by zooming in around the apparitions and finding zero pixelation which would indicate tampering or introduction of a new layer. i'm attaching the best 3 in this report, but i have dozens more. i am also emailing your director and editor the rest of these photos in hopes that you'll contact me and we could possibly meet in person someday to discuss this. i've already spent 3 weeks in county jail and 9.5 months in a state mental hospital after repeatedly sending these photographs in emails to the local newschannel5 ksdk (nbc) in st. louis. i won't give up this fight for what is right until the american public are shown these images by the american media. i need your help. thank you and good day, your fellow countryman.","distance":"Over One

my sidewalk to pick up mail. i looked up to the northeast to see coming out of a very large white cloud an object that i could not recognize as anything i had seen before. when i saw this thing i was absolutely stunned and i remember thinking, what is that!!!???. i continued down my sidewalk and as i got to my driveway i saw it as it was heading to the opposite cloud.(going west) it looked like a rusty copper penny on its side. it looked like it had a small bulge in its middle. it did not bob, zigzag or emit any kind of lights or noise. it was completely silent. i could not fathom what i was seeing and did not know what to do. my husband and i have lived here for over 20 years and i have never seen anything like this in my life. i don't know what it is but i do know what it is not. it is not an airplane. it had no wings,no tail,no lights,no sound,no trail of exhaust. it was not a bird. it was not a hot air balloon because we have had balloons land across the street from our house many years ago. i know what one sounds like. i called the airport to see if anyone had sent up any kind of weather balloon and they had not. if anyone can tell me what this thing was/is i would certainly appreciate it. it was nothing i had ever seen before in my life. did someone send up some sort of balloon that looks like a ufo? i don't know. all i know is that this is consuming my thoughts and i just want to know what it is. i have always tried to have an open mind about these things and know that something is going on in the skies above us. i just don't know what. i went out and bought a camera and intend to keep it with me at all times. i will probably never see anything like this again but i will keep looking. last thought...I did not see anything in the paper about this or hear in the news. did anybody else see it and like me don't know who to call without appearing like a nut??? has anyone else seen anything like this object?

 this one wasn't as big as the first (and it didn't explode), but i noticed it because it came down along the exact same trajectory in the exact same part of the sky.  however, the strangest part was that it traveled along the same path, not of the first shooting star, but in the opposite direction along with the original object i saw.  i'm no expert, but common sense tells me if a shooting star follows 30 seconds behind a bigger shooting star it should be coming down in approximately the same direction, not the exact opposite direction, as one would assume the two are part of the same celestial object (or at least one of his friends or neighbors).  \r\n\r\nwe stayed outside for another 5 minutes or so before we had to get back inside because we had ordered a pizza.  we were so excited we saw what we thought to be a once in a life time shooting star, however i was still stuck on what the first object was and why in the world a shooting star would cross in a perpendicular path to another shooting star, and on top of that, why all 3 objects would appear along the same line in the sky all within a few minutes of each other.  this was all truly weird, but we had pizza to eat.\r\n\r\nfast forward to 4:45am pst and it's time to let the pups out in the backyard again.  (we work from home, so we often turn nocturnal and wind up staying up all night.)\r\n\r\nat this pre-dawn time, the night sky seemed even more impressive than it had in the evening prior.  it was crystal clear out and now jupiter was just about straight overhead, so i decided to go inside and grab my new 8\" telescope to get some great views of jupiter (of which we did).  i brought my binoculars out with me so i could view the sky while my fianc��� took command of the telescope pointing straight up towards jupiter.  \r\n\r\ni was looking in approximately the same area when i noticed another fast-moving point of light, like a star flying across the sky.  it was just like the first object i had seen last night, yet this time it was directly overhead traveling from the northwest to the southeast.  i immediately grabbed the astronomical goggles and locked on to it as it  flew past jupiter.  \r\n\r\nthis was the turning point of the night's events.  literally.\r\n\r\nas i followed this object i noticed it start to change its trajectory towards the south.  it wasn't a sharp turn, but a smooth arched curve done at high speeds.  there was no visible change in the sharp point of light, no change in shape, no visible mechanical maneuver, no contrail, no nothing... just a perfectly smooth turn.   \r\n\r\nit was at this point that another star came in to view of my binoculars.  as the object i was focused on turned slight right it passed near this other star, and that's when things really got interesting.  that star looked like every other star in the sky, but when the moving object passed close to it, the star started to move in an opposite direction towards the north!!  i could not believe what i was seeing, but it seemed as if this \"star\" reacted to the object flying close by and decided to scoot along elsewhere.  \r\n\r\ni immediately decided to let the first object fly out of my binocular's field of view and i followed this new object that just went from a stand-still to flying across the sky.  i followed it for what couldn't have been more than a few seconds when another \"star\" decided to pack up and move locations!!  this object moved towards the west away from the second object.  i felt as if i had just turned the lights on and all of the celestial bugs scattered in different directions.  in fact they scattered so quickly that i lost site of the trio as i tried unsuccessfully to keep a lock on the 3rd and latest traveling star.  all of this happened in the approximate vicinity of jupiter which was almost directly over head just starting it's trip back down the sky.\r\n\r\nafter loosing site of the objects i went around to the side of our house to get a view of the southern part of the sky that our house blocks from the backyard to see if i could find the first object.  i quickly found it, put my binoculars back up to my eyes, and watched the object continue southward.  soon it began to dim as it traveled too far away, but it was at this point that i saw what may be the strangest thing of the night.\r\n\r\nas i was trying to steady my hands to watch the point of light fly away, there was a flash of deep orange light (almost red) that appeared in the same area of the object i was watching.  it surprised me so much that i let out an audible gasp that my fiance heard - i had never seen anything like it.  it almost had a flame-like appearance to it, like someone trying to light a lighter, but fails, and you only get that first flash of a flame with nothing to follow.  it was that quick, in and out, and following that, i wasn't able to find any of the objects i had been following.\r\n\r\ni stayed outside with my binoculars in hand until almost 6am to see if they would come back, and decided to head back inside when the daylight really started to diffuse the stars.  \r\n\r\nthat was about two hours ago, and i must say that the events of last night and early this morning will go down as the strangest events i've ever seen in the sky, in space, or even in general, to date.  i don't know if it was the crystal clear skies that enabled this view, but i doubt i'll ever see that much action in the skies again (although i sure hope to!).  \r\n\r\ni can't say for certain what this was, and i don't know if the \"shooting stars\" had anything to do with it or whether they were just a mere coincidence (of epic proportions), but the hairs on my back and the tingle in my spine tell me i saw something very unique and very strange last night, and luckily i had my fianc��� there to back me up and let me know i wasn't imaging things.\r\n\r\nlet me just say that i'll never look at a little star in the night sky the same, because as i found out, little stars aren't always what they appear to be.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional

about 70 degrees above the horizon and lost site of it no thanks to the roof of a house when it was at about 50 degrees. heading in a straight line, speed and apparent size it couldn't have hit more

angeles, ca. hanging out, star-gazing, and taking night photos with great views of los angeles (at close to 2600'). noticed 3 very bright yellow lights to the n, ne that appeared to be hovering, but figured they could be helicopters or planes moving directly toward us in some sort of formation. then a fourth light blinked into view next to the other 3 and we noticed a 5th bright yellow light away from the group to the nw. tried viewing through binoculars, saw no blinking, just steady bright yellow/white light. called to my sister, who had her camera set up on a tripod, and told her to zoom in and take a picture to see if we could tell what they were. as she was switching lenses and trying to get a photo, all three of us saw a large, bright green-blue orb of light very rapidly descend as if free-falling over by the 5th light to the nw. it moved in a straight line down and slightly to the north then blinked out while still in the sky. no clouds were in that area and we saw no meteor-like \"tail\" on the blue-green orb. it seemed way too close and large to be a meteor and appeared to be about 45 degrees above the horizon. my sister and i saw it from start to finish and my boyfriend, who was initially facing me, saw my reaction and turned to look in the same direction in time to see most of the descent and the blinking out.\r\n\r\nimmediately afterwards, we were all amazed by what we had just witnessed and were basically repeating to each other, \"holy *$#!+, what was that?!\" we heard a bunch of dogs barking in the distance and, within less than 5 minutes of the event, we counted at least 7-10 aircraft in the immediate vicinity, with the typical flashing/strobing lights. an additional two planes flew almost directly over us at very low altitude with almost no discernible engine noise. these planes had a bright white unblinking light at what appeared to be the tip of each wing, 2 white unblinking lights toward the front, and one red light that blinked on occasionally in the middle. no red/green navigation lights. although we didn't get photo/video of blue-green orb, we have video of aircraft response immediately afterwards and pictures of the bright yellow orbs that appeared before the incident. \r\n\r\nwe continued to see an unusual number of aircraft in the area and also to the west, over the ocean, for the 30-40 minutes we stayed out there. then, on the drive back, we noticed a bunch of aircraft that seemed to be hovering or moving very slowly over the ocean. we checked webtrak once we got home and it showed nowhere near the number of aircraft that we counted in the area. we also noticed that flights in the area - perhaps coincidentally - diverted from typical flight paths observed at the same time on other nights. \r\n\r\nwe are all very mystified by this event and want to know if anyone else witnessed it or has information that can help explain it.\r\n\r\n\r\nmy boyfriend also wrote a description of the event: \r\n\r\n\"around a quarter to ten on august 21, 2011 (i'd say between 9:45 and 9:51), we were out stargazing in the hills between topanga canyon and malibu. there were patchy clouds and low-hanging mist along the coast, but the area in which we saw the object was certainly clear. turning at the reaction of my girlfriend, i caught the object (whose undetermined proximity to us felt much closer than any craft or meteor) halfway through its brief descent before it abruptly dematerialized. the object was bright, though a white solid body was visible amidst a glow that changed from yellow to green just prior to its disappearance. i perceived no tail, which would normally indicate a meteor or a small fireball. before and after this incident, but especially after, the sky was pockmarked with the lights of aircraft which did not register on flight tracks later investigated. not long before the object appeared, we noticed a strange pattern of various aircraft suddenly \"winking on\" one after another (as if someone were flipping switches) without any previous indication of their presence.\" \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

it was going to be there. in otherwords i wasn't surprised at all. as i pursued the object i was either lost in concentration or excitement with a hint of shock. when i reached my destination i told

sitting in my  backyard looking up towards venus in the ne crystal clear cloudless night sky.  to my delight almost directly overhead, i peripherally notice what i assume is a meteor streaking across the sky.  i snap up to look with my 20/20 vision and i am stunned to see an amber glowing orb with no trail behind it streaking as fast as a shooting star but in steady level flight without loss of altitude characteristic of controlled flight.  speed was many multiples faster than any satellite i have ever seen ��� unfathomable speed.  directly overhead i see a faintly glowing translucent diamond shaped aura around the brightly glowing amber orb.  the speed was mind bending fast and the object appeared to strobe as it streaked across the sky, but i believe that was an optical illusion caused by the best my eyes could humanly compute to track the streaking object (anyone who has seen a military air show has witnessed this when the air craft dive down high and fast swooping towards the stands).  once the high flying object was heading away from me and no longer directly overhead i no longer witnessed a strobe effect or the diamond amber aura, however the bright amber glowing orb remained distinctly defined for the entire observation.  at this point i conclude it must be one of the experimental darpa/usaf htv-2 hypersonic aircraft launched out of vandenberg.  that theory was shaken about two seconds later when i am stunned to see an absolute identical amber orb object traveling at the same mind bending speed coming head on towards the east bound object separated by only a few degrees from my point of observation.\r\n\r\na moment before the objects would cross paths in the sky, the east bound object (the first observed) turns a slight few degrees away from the others path, then pulls a sudden sharp 90 degree perfect semi-circle turn to the south (with the grace of a jet fighter at warp speed).  the object glows brighter through the turn with no signs of decelerating while maintaining its stunning speed through the turn.  an impossible maneuver that was hard for my mind to process ��� it felt disorientating to take in (did not compute).   it now heads southward but for a second or two and snap turns 90 degrees back east-bound accelerating and then fading away into the horizon as if in warp speed (almost looked like the object dropped straight down, but i think that was an illusion due to my perspective looking at it now far and low in the distance).  intuitively i was left feeling that the maneuvers between the two craft were playful in nature like a quantum cat and mouse game.  i stopped tracking the second object at the point the two cross paths as they were moving too fast and in opposing directions, i had to pick one to focus on and never got another glimps of it.\r\n\r\ni futilely looked to the sky for more of these orbs for about fifteen minutes before the elation of what i just saw was fully absorbed and turned to feelings of being completely creeped out.  like a child afraid of the dark i rushed inside the house.  i woke my wife in her deep sleep in an attempt to convince her i just saw something profound and fantastically unbelievable.  she believes me, god bless her.\r\n\r\nit all happened very fast.  come daylight i repeatedly recalled the event with times my mental replays with a stopwatch.  from this excercise i concluded the entire event was witnessed for a total of about 12 and 15 seconds.  about 3 to 5 seconds in when the second craft was observed coming straight for the first and about 2 seconds later when the objects crossed paths and the first object commenced its first turn.  that first 90 degree turn took about 3 seconds to complete but at the same mind bending constant speed it had at straight flight.  a few seconds later it snap turns 90 degrees back east bound and fades lighting fast into the horizon. \r\n\r\nthis was no laser, the sky was clear, the objects had dimension, and a laser is not going to deliver a show so crisp and demensional on a clear night  all the way to the horizon.  meteors do not look or behave like this nor do they defy the laws of physics.  chinese lanterns or flares....Lol...No way.  \r\n\r\nonly those of us that have seen these objects can possibly understand.  i certainly didn't believe until just a few days ago that we may not be alone.  i wish i never witnessed this event  in that i now have the burden of keeping it to myself or being stigmatized as part of the lunatic fringe only to hear,  ���i believe you believe you saw something���.\r\n\r\nimpossible physics ��� impossible propulsion.  pray these things are made in america by darpa, but i doubt it.   in the few days i have spent researching similar sightings as mine, most of what is being reported involve orange/amber orbs and almost always two or more, not just one.  that is odd to me and does not add up for this being earth bound particularly so in that most sightings of these amber orbs usually involve two or more objects interacting and driven by propulsion systems of unbound energy.  darpa's crafts are one time shots lasting minutes and only a handful have been launched.   if this technology is human, it is such that it is breaking the known laws of physics and humanity deserves to know more about it.  if what we are witnessing are objects from another world, our governments certainly know it and humanity deserves full disclosure.\r\n \r\nmark my words, if you haven���t seen these amber orbs yet, it is only a matter of time before you do.

 we had thought we had seen a satellite moving northwest to southeast across the sky roughly ten minutes earlier and i thought, at first, that maybe what i saw was a shooting star or some other thing entering the atmosphere.  i looked up and told my roommate to look up immediately.  what i saw was the most astonishing bright white light i had ever seen.  it was moving slowly across the sky from southeast to northwest.  as i watched the object, it appeared to be experiencing a rotation along its yaw axis because the bright white seemed to dim with the same characteristic one might see when a flashlight is turned away from them.  the light was still visible but it was much dimmer as it seemed to rotate.  we continued to watch, though it was much dimmer than when we first caught sight of it.  and as we watched, we saw the bright white light roll back over so we could see it.  it lasted for possibly 10 seconds in its brightest visible position.  it continued to rotate and we lost sight of it.  it must have been extremely high.  we noticed no noise nor did we notice any vapor trail.  also, it was moving extremely slowly across the sky.  as we sat in our chairs, not moving, i would say we saw it cover about 15% of the nighttime sky before we lost sight in an event that took perhaps three minutes at the very most.  it was, without a doubt, the most brilliant, clear, white light i had ever seen.  these were not landing lights as it seemed to project straight down and it gave off no halogen luminosity.  also, because it seemed to rotate along the roll axis, i do not see how it could be landing lights which point straight ahead (also, due to the extreme altitude of this light, landing lights seem impractical for any aircraft at that point).  also, because there were no flashing lights visible, like an airplane might have, we thought it might have been a reflecting satellite but i have never, ever, seen anything so brilliant.  it was the size of a pinhead but it was

campus is on the gulf coast of florida). it was about 10pm, and totally dark. we were standing by the water trying to look at the stars- there weren't many. the night was overcast and it had been rainy all day. we were mostly hanging out, joking around. none of us were intoxicated. i saw a bright light from north of where we were standing, and i actually jokingly said that it was a ufo. once everybody was focusing on the object, we became confused about what it could be- it wasn't too far from us, but it was moving very, very slowly. as we watched, it began to make a zig-zag pattern over the water, at times heading right towards us. it was definitely less than a mile away, but we couldn't hear anything. our campus is right next to an airport, so we are all very familiar with the noises that various objects in flight make-- this object was entirely silent. \r\nit continued to travel slowly, zig-zagging across the bay, in our direction. there were no other lights on the craft other than the main brightest white one, and the object appeared to be triangular in shape.\r\nwe were standing next to a copse of trees which separated the campus from a nearby neighborhood. the copse of trees is very small- maybe as wide as an average sized house. the ufo descended just beyond the trees and landed, very slowly and silently. \r\n\r\nwe didn't go into the trees to investigate because we were unsure of what the object could be. we didn't feel threatened- mostly just in awe.
