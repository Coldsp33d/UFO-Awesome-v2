backyard,the sky was very clear and so many stars were out so we decided to get a blanket and lay out and stargaze. we seen 3 shooting stars in about 10 minutes time. then with 30 minutes we seen about 7 to 8 shooting stars(maybe more) as i lost count because it was really something to see. i began to question was this normal? next we witnessed a star moving,the light looked different from a regular star,it's hard to explain because i have never seen a light source like it. possibly similar to the cars with the blueish halogen lights,if you take away the blue hue it was something like that,very vivid,very clear unlike any light i have ever seen. at first it moved across the sky in almost a serpentine motion and very fast,we have 2 acres of treed land here so we had to run through the yard to follow it as to not lose it behind a treetop. it then stopped and hovered and then shot across the sky at a very high speed,like a shooting star,then it appeared to be searching with the snake like movement going side to side as if it was looking for something. my mind couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing. now i think that some if not all of the shooting stars that we witnessed may have been this object all along. we ended up watching it and running all around the yard for 2 hrs+ it was almost as if the thing was playing with us i know that sounds weird,but it would hover wait for us to run over across the yard and then zip off stop and wait and then move... just very odd to me.\r\nthere seemed to be 3 of these,sometimes they would move so fast it was hard to keep up with more than 1.\r\nthe sky was extremely clear that night,the moon did not show up until just before sunrise,not sure why that is? but i believe it was about 6% full when it did show.\r\nnaturally, we were all tired from this event so we said our goodbyes and i went in to sleep not long after that a military jet the ones that make the sonic boom noise went over and shook my house.I suspect they were looking for these object(s).\r\ni searched all weekend trying to find a video of something like what we witnessed and i came across one that is exactly like what we seen on youtube. the man known as (magnetflipper) uses a high powered camera and has actually captured 60+ video's of these things.\r\nnotes* \r\n-the moving star stayed high in the sky maybe slightly under the stars\r\n-time seemed to speed up, it seemed like we were outside like 45 mins to an hour we had no idea that it was 5:30ish am until it started getting light outside and we lost the object and someone looked at the actual time.\r\n-object(s) moved at incredible speeds with precision movements\r\n-there was no sound\r\n-we did see 2 planes go over during this time, but they were much lower in relation to the object we were watching\r\n-sometimes it looked like a aura was around the object when it was just hovering\r\n-when it would zip off it left a slight trail like a shooting star but the streak would hold a little longer than that of a shooting star giving us time to see where it zipped off to, the trail looked blueish white in color.\r\n-for the record we were not drinking nor doing drugs,we don't do that anyway but i suspect someone will ask...I know i would if i read this. just saying.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

(5-10minutes) i got up to relieve myself in our master bathroom.  it was at this time i observed through my bathroom window a some what large pulsating red orb in the sky to the east/north east of my location.  the object appeared to be a considerable distance away (at least three miles)and about the size of a silver dollar.  i could hear no rotor wash or engines of any kind.  as i observed the object it immediately struck me as odd.  it literally moved slowly on a straight trajectory and then would zip backwards, forwards, up and down. my area of view is limited by several trees.  the observed object stayed within a my clear 15' field of vision for close to two and a half minutes.  it is during this period the object seemed to linger,hover and change location in a millisecond.  the object was pulsing bright red with hints of orange and white.\r\nat this point i'm in disbelief of what i'm seeing, so i called out to my wife to hurry and come look.  the object was moving once again on its original trajectory very slowly and was beginning to leave our clear field of vision.  as it moved behind the trees it struck me how bright this object was that it could still be made out through the trees.  at this point i feared losing sight of the object and threw on minimal clothes and grabbed my camera to head outside.  once i got out i searched the sky for the object but could not sight it.  i still have a sense of disbelief in what i saw.  it was unlike anything i have ever observed in the sky.  it is worth mentioning i served in the us army as a cavalry scout and received intensive training in observing and identifying all types of aircraft and armored vehicles.","distance":"Over One

turned left towards my parked automobile. it is a beautiful day outside with extremely pleasant conditions. i simply glanced up into the sky in appreciation when i immediately noticed a clear and unmistakable object stationary and flashing brightly in the sky... i paused because it required no momentum to stay air borne. my first thought was is it a \"star\"? but at 2:00pm in the bright afternoon, no way. not like this. what really caught my attention was the objects spinning motion. i watched for minutes. it just hung there spinning. i thought, how can anybody not see this? i had enough time to observe that the bright flashing was created by the reflection of the sun to my right. looking up, the spinning was clock wise. as it rotated about, certain sections of it were angled slightly differently. this created a varying degree of brightness per flash and size. i took all this in. very fascinating... now the remarkable part. i watched as a passing cloud slowly began to approach the object. they seemed to be at the same elevation. suddenly, as the cloud got nearer, the leading edge of the cloud began to be \"pulled forward\", like a \"whipping towards\". the closer the cloud approached the more of it was pulled or effected rather by the spinning of the object. the cloud was violently stirred clock wise into a whirlpool around the object. amazing! when i say violently i mean that the interaction of the cloud and the object began slow then increased as more of the cloud entered its area. it was incredible to see the cloud so peacefully floating along with the leading edge being swirled so fast. the leading edge of the cloud swirled around the object as the cloud engulfed it. i watched several more minutes for the whole cloud to pass in anticipation of observing the object again but it was gone. seems that once in the cloud it disappeared, at least from my view. i checked today's weather and the cloud elevation is 12000 feet. meaning this object was big and so was its effect.

you're just a regular guttergawker!\" so i decided to call my channel that. anyways one of the friends i made on youtube who live in the chicago-land area emailed me maybe 10 minutes after i saw these orbs fly over saying they had just witnessed similar orbs pass over including two dull ones and a third bright one, not knowing i recorded what they saw 10 minutes earlier. it was pretty cool and amazing to have someone else validate what i had just witnessed but in another part of the city. they said they lived near california and archer which is se from where i am located in forest park. if you want to check out the video search bright ufo chicago august 29 2011 or search my channel name. if you go on youtube and have a sign on and live in the chicago area and see the same things in the sky please email me i would like to start networking with other people to see if we can begin to catch these same events in various locations in il. \r\n\r\ni promised i would not make another mufon report a while ago because some in the ufo community think that people that have multiple encounters numerous times are full of it but i am here to say that's not true. everything i see the reports i make and the videos i capture are all sincere and honest. i have 25 videos on my channel so check out the different things i caught on tape. some of the things may be explainable and a little artsy but most of the videos are recorded and uploaded without any enhancement and are open to the viewers interpretation. i am under the strong impression that the things i see are extraterrestrial i believe this only from the first hand experiences i have had. some have been very up close and revealing. idk why i continue to see these things but i know i am not the only one. i think they target me to show themselves because the first time i saw the ufos aug 23 2009 i said a small prayer, thought positive and asked them to please come down and show their technology and knowledge with us to help humans end war, poverty, sickness, homelessness, etc. i think they were able to hear my thoughts and that positive thinking resonated with them so now when they are around they continue to \"show\" themselves to me. thanks for taking the time to read my report. hopefully someone will be able to tell us what these things are someday. peace.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":31320,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.8824758,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08302011-0016","longitude":-87.81126,"occurred":1314675000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,   Sphere,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1314744177000,"summary":"Starting at 830pm saw 3 orbs pass over in 5 minute intervals hd video ","tags":["video"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/31320_submitter_file1__SearchGuttergawkeronYouTube.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"60130","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Forest Park, Illinois","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:38633"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed, Unknown","city":"Santa Barbara","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Driving home from big sur on the 101 about 40 minutes north of santa barbara.  looked into the sky, and noticed a bright blu light that eithr apreared or was already there and it decended at a 45 degreee angle very quikly and out of site behind a mountain.

viewable here. the sky is very clear and stars are very bright.  i noticed one particular star low on the horizon north west from my location 39' 19' 39'n, 120' 10 57w which was pulsating blues, reds and whites. i grabbed my binoculars and with the increased magnification, could confirm this was not a star, planet or aircraft. the lights were being produced by the object and were not a reflection.\r\n\r\ni called my wife out to look and she observed the same thing. the object never moved and remained hovering in place for 2 hours. i eventually went to bed, but before that i reported what i saw to my friends list on fb.\r\n\r\non august 29th at 8:30pm, we observed the same object in the same relative place again, but also another had appeared due west just over the horizon. this one was larger or closer. after several minutes, we noticed a large amount of aircraft heading in that direction.  we could only see the lights on the planes, but they were identical with one red blinking center light and two white lights, one on each wing.  within 10 minutes, the northwest object disappeared below the horizon (behind the mountain, we have a range between us and the objects). the object due west began moving north in the sky and then dropped behind the mountain. it moved very slowly.\r\n\r\na friend in a town about 5 miles from me, who doesn't have the same mountain range obstruction as i do, called to tell me he saw both objects pairing up and moving north.\r\n\r\nafter about 30 minutes, we found 8 more of the same objects in the south west sky. four of them were paired up individually and one was brighter than the rest and more west. \r\n\r\ntwo friends in cold springs nevada also observed the objects. one friend saw just one object and he said it vanished as he was viewing it.  the other friend viewed one object this morning at 5:30am.  both friends described the objects the same way we saw them from here.  star-like, pulsating very bright blue, red and

july 29th. my husband and son were also in the car with me.\r\n\r\noff in the distance, off to the southbound side of the interstate, i saw three white flashing lights. i first thought them to be a radio tower because of their distance from one another and because they appeared to be stationary in the sky. i mentioned to my husband that i did not recall a radio tower being there.\r\n\r\ni kept watching the lights as they seemed to be getting larger. after a few seconds we all noticed that they were in fact moving. after a few seconds more, the lights were directly over our car and seemed to be hovering there. they appeared to be extremely low in the sky as well. \r\n\r\nwhen they first appeared over the car, all we could see were the lights; there were now also well more than three, perhaps six or eight, though we did not count. \r\n\r\nwe really could not imagine what it was as the lights seemed to remain directly over vehicle for at least 4-5 seconds, with no noise. after several seconds we saw a faint outline of what looked like a commercial airliner. we chuckled and dismissed it at first, however i quickly pointed out that i have never seen or heard about an airplane with lights on the underbelly.\r\n\r\nbecause we did see the distinct outline of an airplane after it was over head for several seconds, my husband and son were convinced it was just an ordinary airplane. i do believe that it was an airplane however, certainly a very odd one which seemed to move extremely slow and low and with lights covering the underside of the fuselage.\r\n\r\ni tried googling such an airplane and was unable to find any. i did however find two other similar sightings to mine. so i decided to contact you to report my sighting

formations, i.E. boomerang, diamond and v shapes as well as lining up vertically, three to four ships at a time. the ufo's would move in an erratic jerking motion as they moved through the sky as well as when they hovered. in all there was at least ten ships visible at a time. some of them were just beneth the clouds hovering or gradually moving in an erratic almost bouncing motion. there were numerous others that were flying in all directions, trying to mimic airplanes and helicopters. one ship flew over top of us at a height of about one hundren feet. it made a sound unlike anything i have ever heard. it hummed and sounded like a blimp and a helicopter at the same time but nowhere near as loud as the real thing,(i grew up very close to pitts. international airport and am familiar with both airplanes and helicopters). as the vehicle passed overhead we seen that it was a triangle shaped craft with two red lights on the backone on each side and a pulsating white light on the front that alternated to an amber color. the craft flew overhead at about one hundren feet from the ground and went southwest until out of sight. this is the second sighting that i have had the first being on june third in monaca pa.Both sightings were similar in many ways i.E., light colors and patterns,flight characteristics of the craft, and the shapes that were formed at higher altitudes, as if in a holding pattern, gradually moving sideways while erratically jumping or bouncing and then returning to the starting point. tonight was with out a doubt the single most amazing and scarry thing that i have ever witnessed. i have always believed in the existance of ufo's and alien life but this incident has made me a true believer.I guarentee that we are not the only people that seen this happen and hope that someone can get back to me to let me know if it was reported by others. anyone who looked up and has any kind of common sense, noticed that something very odd was

stars movement. well suddenly more stars starting magically coming in from the horizon. we then knew they weren't stars. we watched them move and interact with our requests for hours and hours pausing every few moments to ask each other if this was really happening.\r\n\r\nnow we see these lights almost every night. however, it seems we have almost developed a relationship with these beings. everyone always experiences similar feelings of warmth and joy and overall peacefulness. really an amazing experience. there are now many many people in this area that have been shown these craft and everybody has had many different personal experiences. i myself along with others have seen the \"moving stars\" as i before mentioned, but also what appear to be satellites moving across the sky. however these \"satellites\" can stop motion in an instant and immediately change direction. also what appear to be meteors shooting across the sky occur every so often while we try to make contact (often multiple craft manifest this way during this type of sighting).\r\n\r\nit is important to note that these sightings occur very often and happen right next to the university of oklahoma campus. anyone that is in the vicinity should keep an eye on the sky. we do not claim to know much about what happens, but we do know that it is very real and these intelligent craft are here for peaceful reasons and to communicate with us. i hope this can help some people out.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path

a cigarette. at first it appeared stationary just below the treeline in the distance, like a star. the light then moved upwards in the sky, startled the witness, and caused them to seek out a second witness (myself.) when i went outside i saw the light, very bright and much larger than the stars. upon seeing it and it's location, i promptly checked the nasa website, a \"star walk\" app that shows what bodies (stars, planets, satellites, etc) are visible in the sky that night using gps, checked other resources online, and none of them showed anything that would be that large and visible at night. there were no planets, bright stars, or man made objects located in that part of the sky at that time. after a few minutes of watching the object, it started flashing. it would go dim, then come back bright. go completely dark/ disappear, then come back bright. it did this for about 5-7 minutes. i got a video of it that covers a 3 minute duration of the pulsing. i was holding the camera by hand, so i was shaking it, but the pulsing wasn't caused by myself. after it stopped pulsing i got my tripod and set the camera up and snapped a few pictures of it. with the naked eye it looked mostly white with the slightest color changes and the slightest sparkle of other colors. on the digital pictures with them zoomed in, i could see that it was emitting a greenish glow, sometimes also emitting purple and a blue'ish tone as well. i had the camera on the lowest shutter speed and used a timer taking them so i would not shake them and so that the camera would absorb as much of the color as possible. after taking the pictures i looked at it for a little while and went inside. at about 1am i went back outside to see where it was and found it had moved a bit higher in the sky and to the left of where it was. at that point, it was flashing. it went completely dark instantly, then after a second or 2 it came right back. it did this three times. i returned inside again for a little while, returning back outside at approximately 2am. it was now slightly higher again, but this time it was far to the right of where we had seen it originally. it was checked one more time about a half an hour after that and it was seen very high in the sky, back toward the center of where it was originally seen again. this was the last time any of the witnesses checked the object, and it was gone by daybreak. upon reviewing the pictures i had taken, i noticed the object appeared to have changed shapes slightly from picture to picture. i know this was not a blur or my own mistake because stars can be seen in the background as single, crisp pixels. while looking at the object itself and the pictures even after, i had an eery feeling that this object was something unlike anything i had seen before. i had an odd feeling that it wasn't anything human made.  it drew me in and scared me at the same time. even now i really don't know what to think about the sighting.I took as many pictures as i could on the camera batteries because i felt like it was something that needed to be shared. i just had a feeling in the pit of my stomach that the object i saw was something new to me. something i may never see again, but something i won't forget.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path

had a strange feeling that i would see another ufo, but i was not sure if i should trust that feeling or not. as the object is passing behind the tree, my mom goes inside, and i looked at our '95 ford taurus to see if the windows were rolled up, and they were, so i looked back at the object behind the tree, and i could tell it was distinctly triangular, with a red blinking light between the center and the front, and three white lights, one at each point of the triangular shape. as it began to move roughly east-southeast of me, i could see that the back of the object had a panel of white lights that appeared to be strobbing from left to right and two white lights (not blinking) one on the left and one on the right. this is what immediately caught my attention, because back in 2004 i witnessed a simaler triangle that was much lower in altitude and appeared to be hovering, and it had a simaler light panel on the back with white lights strobbing from left to right. another familier part of this sighting was that it had no sound whatsoever, even at its closest distance and as it was moving away from me (if it was a jet, it should've had a roar from its jet engines). i went around behind our shed (south of the house) and watched it begin to bank slightly to the left, but did not change direction for some reason. as it got south-southwest of my location, it appeared to have stopped, and began to fade slowly (it was probably climbing in altitude causing it to do this). finally at 11:59 pm (i had my cell phone with me so i looked at the time to make a more accurate report) i lost sight of the object. i tried to take some pictures of the object, (i took 6 photos) but the object did not emit enough light for my camera to see. i did make a quick sketch of it though.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then

and the only lights at the time were the occasional headlights of passing cars.  what i originally thought was a star, began flying round and round in large circles.  i took out my l.E.D. flashlight and tried to communicate by pointing & rapidly flashing light towards it to get it's attention.  when i took out my lighter, to light a cigarette, i tried to use both the lighter and l.E.D. flashlight to communicate, trying to convince it to land at the park.  it did not land, however, though i did notice that it began flying in whatever direction i held the flame.  if i held it to my right or left, it flew that way, and if i held it still, it stayed still.  it somehow continued this, as it flew steadily and slowly away from us.  once out of view, my friend left to go into the house, to tell his girlfriend about it.  she eventually came out to see, but before she did and while i was alone, i noticed that i was getting swooped by some sort of enormous black bird.  it made absolutely no sound, looked something like a bat, but was more the size of a large hawk or an eagle.  it continued swooping my head until my friend's girlfriend came out to see what was going on.  (i didn't see it again until she went back to the house later, and i was alone again.}  when she came out to see, she had already missed the first one..  i noticed another one by radio towers, which i also at first mistook for a star, not so much moving in nice circles like the first, but in more jerky directions.  i immediately began using my flashlight and my lighter, trying to get it's attention.  just like the first, this one began moving in whatever direction i held my lighter, but unlike the first, this one didn't seem to want to fly too far from the tower.  (when the power finally came on, i went inside and i never saw it leave.  it was still there when i went in.)  i tried my best to convince it to land, using the two light sources i had, but it never did.  the two of us watched it fly around for a while, and then she decided to go back inside.  after she left, and i was alone again, that huge silent bat-like bird began swooping my head again.  i still continued trying to communicate with the star-like craft, flashing my l.E.D. light at it, and finally i got a response..  i saw, in the woods, about a quarter mile from my location, and about a mile or so to the left of the towers, what appeared to be something resembling fireworks shooting straight up from the woods.  it was absolutely silent and far more beautiful.  fireworks, for example, shoot up to a certain height before exploding with a large bang, leaving smoke.  what i saw, was super bright pink, yellow, blue, purple, and green colored light which began from the ground and lit all at once like a totally silent, yet beautiful tower of rings and balls of bright light, with no smoke whatsoever.  then the same thing happened again, but this time it appeared to be closer to the the tower.  this one was even brighter and more magnificent, though, since it was further away from me and the location of the first lights, it appeared to be the same size.  (i went online that night, trying to find something similar, and the closest thing to what i saw, that i found on the web, is the huge multi-colored light show that happened in texas. on youtube, look up fantastic alien light show 5/11/11)  after that happened, i saw a helicopter fly over-head.  i couldn't tell whether it was black or not, but it seemed to be very interested in what was going on.  i also saw a plane fly by that had two red lights on it's wings, and a white light in front fly over-head.  at first, i didn't think anything was strange, until the red lights disappeared.  i don't know anything about planes, but i just thought i'd throw that in there in case it means something to somebody.  i tried to get a video from my phone, but i just got a new phone, and realized that it doesn't have that capability.  i did take pictures from my phone, but i can't zoom or anything and all i got was a super tiny dot on the screen.  sorry.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":31304,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.3239172,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08292011-0038","longitude":-76.8951537,"occurred":1314514800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1314687552000,"summary":"3 of us watched starlike crafts fly in crazy patterns, then i saw a light show","tags":["light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"17110","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Harrisburg, Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:38649"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Manchester","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was sitting on my deck in manchester,ct around 11:30 pm when noticed a pulsating blue orb crossing the sky from west to east.It wasn't a plane or chopper because it was silent and there where no blinkung lights.I ran to see if i could record it with my camera but it was not possible.For me that was a ufo!!\r\nthanks!!","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":31302,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.75650280136426,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08292011-0036","longitude":-72.50095267828004,"occurred":1314685800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Connecticut","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1314687422000,"summary":" pulsating blue orb","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"06040","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Manchester, Connecticut","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:38650"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Tucson","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was at home, appx 8:00 pm arizona time, i am a home renter and we have to smoke outside, i got up to go smoke in the backyard, i always look to the stars to see if its clear or cloudy, i happened to catch a star to my east direction brighter than normal, didnt think much of it, but it looked like a power surge, it got brighter then faded out to black, i called my girlfriend out who has very poor eyesight to say i just saw a wierd thing, then it reappeared and went from dim to very bright again, she actually saw it too and also told me she had seen something like that a week earlier but thought it was just her eye, i told her to grab my phone so i could video it, but it did not reappear, it was moving in a straight line somewhat north westerly, i am not crazy and i hope others saw it as well. other than fadeing in and out i didnt witness anything that made it unusual except it was brighter than any other star and it went black, we watched for several minutes more in the trajectory i would have imagined it would have traveled but nothing further.We both felt as if we had seen our first ufo together i am 41 years old and must say i was excited, and the fact that it was bright enough for her to see was great, she has very poor vision i am glad we both got to share this. i watched the trajectory of what i thought it would go but nothing. i am hoping others saw it as well and together we can all share in what we saw.
