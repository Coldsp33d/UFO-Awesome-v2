that point it was partially transparent but still stationary, i yelled out to my partner and my friend and we watched it for a while (my partner was taking photos of it). it gradually began to resemeble a star but it was so far away we had trouble identifying it without camera zoom assistance, we took 11 photos some of which the object we observed seemed to change shape, opacity, orientation and position in the sky. in the last photos we took before it went behind the clouds were clear enough that you could see that the object was spherical in shape and had a shadow underneath it also had a sort of disturbance around it. the object was observed north west of my apartment and was viewed from my apartment window. i have observed similar things in the sky 5 times over the last

Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"April 24,2011-12 noon.I was at my kitchen sink, getting a drink when looking out of the window i noticed a silvery white object traveling in the sky slowly from right to left.I recognised this object as i had seen the same thing on the 12 feb,2011.It slowly pulsed a bright white as it moved.As it pulsed it seemed to increase in size and brightness.The pulsing had no discernable rhythm.I would call the shape more of an elipse than a disk.It was steady in flight and did not wobble.When first sighted its size was comparable to a 5p coin at arms length.After observing the object for several seconds i ran to the living room to get my camcorder and then proceeded to the back garden.The object was now hovering in the distance,a little further away than when first seen.I was in the process of trying to film the object when my 10 year old son came out and i pointed out the object to him.As i was trying to focus on the object my wife and daughter allso came outside.This is when the object came much closer and began making strange horizontal movements left and right.We were all in absolute awe as it began darting about in a fast,erratic manner.During this time the camcorder had been running for a couple of minutes but i was unable to focus on the object.Several times the object seemed to totally disapear while we watched it and reapear in a differant part of the sky.I soon realised that trying to capture this moment with the camcorder was a bad idea so i asked my son to fetch my nikon d60 dslr with 200mm lens from the house.As i prepared the dslr i passed the camcorder to my son who allso carried on trying to film it.The object was begining to go back in the direction it first came from as i began taking pictures.To the human eye the object mostly looked like a white,flashing,pulsing elipse which sometimes would blink black for a split second.When i looked at the object through the zoom lens i could see a lot more detail.The object seemed to wobble and vibrate at a very fast rate.For a split second i could see a metallic disc shape then a sphere and allso lots of black flashes and a fuzziness to it.I would best describe it as it seemed to be every shape at the same time because it was flickering and changing so fast.Allso i was shooting in burst mode with manual focus.Several times it disapeared while i was photographing it and it would reapear in another part of the sky.During the time i was taking pics my son complained that he could see the object with his eyes but the camcorder could not pick it up.I eventually took 119 pics which show a lot of details that were not apparent when i was looking at the object.This i think is due to the fast shutter speed of the camera.The object eventually gained height and disapeared behind a neighbours house.Whan i was watching this thing in the sky i was and still am convinced that this was a very unconventional object which showed impossible flight charachteristics and behaviour.I have worked outdoors all my life and planes ,normal aircraft,birds etc are a normal daily sight for me.This was far from normal and to be honest left me in shock for several days after it.

my back door which faces due north to smoke a cigarette. i stood in my doorway as i usually do and lit my cigarette. after i lit it i took a drag and immediately saw four very large red lights to my left in the western sky. they were approximately 1-2 miles away, 500 feet high (about 40 degrees), pill size, slightly pulsating, completely silent and travelling west (from left to right). the four lights seemed to be seperate objects travelling like a snake, perfectly spaced apart, following one another, taking as much space in the sky as if you held up two pencils in your hands with your arms extended out. i immediately realized that ive never seen anything as big or as fast. i believed i was looking at four possible ufo's. they were moving so fast i knew i didnt have time to grab my phone to record it so i decided to just watch this amazing event. the objects banked left while dropping elevation and began heading north, passing through  a small gap in a mountain range that is about 5 miles away that also goes from west to east. immediately after the last red light was  out of my sight, military jets came from the east and west, travelling side by side in pairs. about a dozen total. they were travelling very fast and were very loud flying back and forth as if they were looking for these objects. i saw the lights for about 10 seconds or so and the jets were in the sky for about 3 minutes and then flew off. i didnt notice any other aircraft while the lights were visible. i truely believe i saw four unidentified flying objects that were bigger and faster than any man made objects that were followed by many military jets that were looking for these objects. i believe the entire event took about 4 minutes.","distance":"Over One

this photo. i might still have it on the original memory stick if it needs to be analyzed. i have photos of the exact area taken in daylight with nothing there. there is also a blue orb in the photo

weary of anything having to do with aliens. this is not my field of interest at all. i kept thinking of it as a demon. but in the interests of science & because this does appear to be a

and i wondered how i was able to keep seeing it thinking i had changed direction in driving.. yet there it was. so at one particular area in pelham manor, ny facing the bronx- i was a traffic light and it was interestingly a very, very long red light. so at this light you could see out and over to the bronx.. and now i could see 2 hovering objects and thought.. okay there must be an accident on one of the highways or parkways? so, i thought to myself again 'eh no big deal' but then it happened. one hovering object (both were 'white' lighted) was on my left, the other one was straight ahead and i was looking at it waiting for the red light to turn.. this is the crazy part and i laugh when i think about it.. this object that i had convinced myself was a helicopter.. \"jumped\" forward in the sky.. like a 'leap' and it had lept about half the distance between where the object was and where i was so it was much closer now.. so i leaned my head forward and said a few curse words like 'wtf' did i just see? i put my car in park, opened the door and stood up then the lights went off.. but i could see its shape still in the sky but its lights were off and it passed directly over my head.. lights off and i looked directly up at it.. here is the description.. it was a trinagle and it had shapes and designs on it.. it looked like a plane (which shocked me because that meant something like a plane was hovering?) much later on i wondered if the object was able to change shapes ie., helicpoter, airplane? sounds crazy.. anyway one of the triangle's tips was where the cockpit of a plane would be and the other two tips came out like the wings.. then there was a long extension coming out of the back of the trinagle as if to mimic the shape of a long plane with a tail like an airplane had.. as it went over my head i saw it put the lights back on.. it was the craziest and weirdest thing i have ever seen with my own two eyes in my whole life! don't know what to think of it at all. and i just continued on to get my coffee. \r\n\r\nif interested i will draw a sketch... i didn't have my cellphone on this night.. of course?","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,  Wings","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":31268,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.894655,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08292011-0005","longitude":-73.809213,"occurred":1305442800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New York","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1314612766000,"summary":"Faux-airplane- hovered, disappeared, reappeared","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":106,"locationName":"Pelham Manor, New York","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:38951"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"La Conner","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Please call me.....","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":31267,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":48.411213927377176,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08292011-0004","longitude":-122.52448914761916,"occurred":1314595500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1314609721000,"summary":"Series of lights that come from south, turned to east, reminded me of chineese paper bags","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"98257","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"La Conner, Washington","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:38952"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Winnipeg","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"A friend and i went outside, i looked up andimmediately noticed an object moving very quickly in the sky. at first i thought it was a satellite, but as i looked i noticed that it had no defined edges and was moving too quickly. also i have not ever seen a red satellite.\r\n\r\ni urged my friend to take a look and we both witnessed it move across the sky. my friend saw it change direction, moving in a non-ballistic manner, travelling faster than anything we have seen in the night sky.\r\n\r\nboth my friend and i were puzzled as we watched the object move across the sky. it moved left, and then back to the right, and the disappeared beyond the horizon.

the evening at approximately 2000 hours. sky conditions were \"severe clear\".\r\nout of the three of us i am the most qualified observer. i am a multi engine private pilot with thirty years of experience around most types of aircraft, military and otherwise. \r\n\r\ndana and i were in the hot tub while genara was taking in the dinner dishes. as genara approached the back door of the dwelling she stopped and start to urgently call my name. there was obvious distress in her inflection and i bolted to her side, where she pointed up and to the south from our location saying \"look\". i initially observed three objects located approximately thirty degrees above the horizon and what appeared to be between four to six miles away. the objects were traveling obliquely to my position from ssw to nne. after several moment i shook off the amazement and called for my camera and binoculars. approximately ninety seconds later i was brought my requested items. during this period the lead object stopped illuminating. several others appeared fully illuminated stretched out in a line that was varied in lateral and horizontal position. there was no sound. the objects all had the same configuration. the illuminated shape was like a clear sphere approximately 50-90 feet diameter. the illumination was accomplished by what appeared to be a solid bar of light that resembles a flattened out letter \"w\". it changed color at times. bright orange on a couple of them yellowish on others. during their approach the last three trailing objects swept wide to the west before turning to the east unlike the lead objects. the illumination was not navigational lighting. the were no red/green white or strobes. i took several still pictures with a kodak digital camera and then switched modes and attempted to make two short videos using the same camera. the images are poor but do depict the lighting and the formation. the objects speed was very slow from my perspective. at times one or two objects seemed to be in a hover before continuing to the east. i switched over to a set of nikon monarch 10 x 56 6 degree binoculars. the oversized primary lens' are optimum for low light conditions. i tracked the last three of the objects. each of the last three illumination stopped while i was viewing them through the binoculars. i could still see the objects in some way even more clearly then when illuminated. the silhouette was bottom 4/7ths of a sphere with a slightly conical structure on top. this structure was centered on top and fell short of reaching either edge by 1/5th of the top distance of the shape. they continued on to the east until they appeared so low on the horizon that they became obscured by my neighbors roof line. i have not heard a single report on the local news as of today. i am glad i have witnesses i can speak with about this event.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with

a star, but moving, not a meteor, not a plane. just moving high up, in their orbit.\r\nthis was very high, i didn't hear anything, it was moving from north to south, stopped, this was when it really got my attention, since satellites do not stop!!! it turned right 90* then moved a little, then did another 90* turn almost in an instant!!  it was then moving in a south to north heading. it began picking up speed, then accelerated so fast, it had to be going thousands of mph, no plane could have done this, that fast.  i could not see this with the naked eye, only with the night vision goggles.  this happened at 10:10pm est.  over east north carolina. wilmington area.  was not a plane, not a satellite, not a meteor.  \r\ni was in the army, a scout, i've never seen something like this before. it was an object, under control, stopped, turned 90*, twice, then put on speed like something in the movies.  \r\nwhen i first noticed it, i thought it was a satellite, like i see often, then when it stopped, turned, turned again, in such a way, 90*, then pick up speed like a rocket engine, even more, soooo fast, then it was out of sight.
