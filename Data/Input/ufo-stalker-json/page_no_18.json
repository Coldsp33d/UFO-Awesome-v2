belt looking to the east. as i looked at it again it began to tilt and move towards me. i took my phone out and began to record it. not sure if my phone would record it i went back in the house and woke my brother for a witness. the reason i am submitting this video is not for the video but for the audio. the night was cold and the air was still with absolutely no noise pollution. although these crafts were rather close they were completely silent. as they passed over and headed west my phone mic recorded a strange sound that needs to be analyzed. the audio of this is a little colourful but i was caught in the moment of something that was beyond our technology.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

out to be a squirrel but as i looked into the sky i noticed this large triangle shape object rather large with a blue light flashing from time to time.  i thought it was a star at first because it was so high but after studying the object and using my binoculars clearly this was not a star or any type of aircraft.  it has stayed stationary for almost one year until a couple of nights ago it came down or when i noticed it had changed locations and much lower.  i took one of my very powerful military flashlights and flashed it on and off at the object not thinking anything of it.  when i went to walk my dog an hour or two later this object not only followed me around the whole complex but sent a drone of some type that stayed 350 ft ahead of me the whole time.  scared me to death thought i was going to be abducted for sure.  later that night a military aircraft flew over my complex in sweeping patterns for almost 2 hours the ufo's never moved and last night i counted 15 of the exact same ufo all throughout the sky very high and the reason i know was they all had the signature blue light.  there is something major going on here and i need someone with proper equipment to photograph this and catalog what is going on in case i'am  abducted.  i never lost sight of the object it stayed in the sky all night.  it moves very slow and have never seen it make fast movement

went into the back garden as is my normal practise. on looking at the sky trying to find stars i am familiar with. unfortunately because of the thick fluffy low clouds i could only see dimmer stars in the large gap in the cloud immediately above my head and to the right. on looking back to cloud edge on my left i noticed an object come from the cloud, the shape i can only describe as like a peanut half. the object proceeded in a smooth straight line across the gap in the cloud. the object was a brilliant white like that of a lightbulb or a full moon but without a corona or any kind of blurry effect. the definition was so clear and it took 5-7seconds to cross such a massive gap and on entering the cloud did not shine through considering it’s brightness as the moon usually does. living as i do close to manchester airport i am well used to seeing planes, helicopters and light aircraft day and night and i believe this was no conventional aircraft i am aware of. the short experience has been on my mind for nearly four years without really knowing why so i felt i needed to share it. i remember  thinking during the observation quite a lot in such a small length of time such as well u cocky so an so’s you really don’t care who sees you and many more. other feelings entered my mind like feeling serene and amused at the blatancy of it. i also didn’t feel it was threatening or

just chilling with a beer. i was looking down the parkway towards the west when something caught my eye. it appeared to be at about treetop level, hovering toward mission st. (eastbound) running parallel to the parkway. what caught my eye was the unearthly glow of the thing and its straight and even path. i almost dismissed it off as a lost silver balloon until i kept staring at it and realized it wasn't anything man-made. i even shouted to the houses near-by \"hey guys! we've got a ufo here!!!\" hoping someone would film this. i even stopped somebody on the sidewalk and asked \"what do you think that is?\" (witness 2). the ufo was about a football field away or less, about the size of a compact car or slightly bigger. the object appeared to have two distinct features, one is a dull black/green rotating wheel with a broken triangle or arrow pattern tread design that was rotating in the direction of travel and at the same speed. it must have been going around 10-15 mph up industrial. the second and more vivid part was the center axis of the wheel which consisted of a glowing morphing mass of supernatural light or energy. as it was moving, the glowing mass would flash pink, silver-white, go dim or disappear and repeat but it was really weird to watch. it seemed to be in a distinct sequence. the glowing mass would also appear to elongate diagonally in a semi-diamond pattern and go back to a morphing mass. i was in total awe, witness 2 didn't seem to be really interested, but admitted it looked very strange after watching for around 30 seconds and left towards the shopping center on the corner of industrial & mission where this thing was floating over. it changed course when it got to mission st. and started to run parallel to it and increased its speed some. \r\n\r\n  i followed it down the sidewalk, it started to ascend and move further away. it kept increasing its distance towards the nw to well over .5 mile. this whole time, it kept changing color sequence until it appeared as a silver star in sky. it ascended and hovered at one point, floated some more and came straight down and followed a path, at well over 2 miles away or greater. it finally took off toward the nw, appearing as a bright star. while it was leaving, i noticed a dim dot (part of it?) glow red and go after it at one point. it finally faded out. wildest thing i've ever witnessed. as it was leaving, there was a cessna in the area going to the east and must have seen it (potential witness 3). also, there was a high-flying \"contrail\" plane going towards the west who couldn't have missed that bright star outside his window to the north (potential witness 4).

very little light pollution. this makes the stars in the sky very visible, so when i happened to look into the sky i noticed a large chunk of it was solid black. \r\n     i stopped in my tracks and stared at the slowly moving black mass. my first thought was it was a giant bird of some sort, circling prey in the sky. but as i continued to stare i noticed the shape itself was not bird like but like a disc. the light from the building i was nearby reflected off the object just enough i could make out some features. the object itself was spinning very slowly while floating through the sky. i started to feel fear as my mind put the picture together. \r\n    i kind of always believed that there was other life in this world but i’m one of those people that i don’t truly let myself believe something unless i see it. i had no immediate explanation for what this object could be. and because of the way it was moving and the proximity of it, it felt almost predatory. my immediate thought was to get out of there and head indoors. my heart was racing and i kept looking up into the sky to see if it was following me. i never saw it again, i called my mother and told her exactly what i saw while i was walking. being on the phone with someone made me feel better about the situation. i haven’t walked at night alone again since that night. \r\n   the sketch i submitted is obviously a very rough one. but you can get the idea of what i saw. the little bit of outline and detail i could see was from the reflected light from the building i was near. \r\n    after reviewing the night in my

completely clear and bright with stars, i was looking at stars when i turned to the east and noticed a large pulsating/blinking light in the east halfway above the horizon. \r\nit was stationary, pulsating bright yellow and growing larger with each sequential pulse. mesmerizing. \r\nthen i heard a large jet coming in from the west behind me and it flew went overhead directly towards the light. note: our local airport (bgm) closes at 11:30pm. \r\nthe ball of light flashed brightly as if it noticed the jet, it became a much smaller light that ascended at an angle towards the southeast.\r\ni am a novice astronomer and there are no known stars in the same space.\r\narea of observation is elevated and no visual obstructions like trees, or bldgs. this had no characteristics of a meteor, fireball, and it appeared in an area that i have not notice any commercial flight

night to see if i can see any stars. i noticed a red glowing object (not blinking) off to the east, estimated at about a mile or two away (i'm not a good judge of distances i admit), it was about 30 degrees above the horizon, at first i assumed it was just a helicopter or a plane since there's a military base and airports nearby. but i noticed it was travelling faster than any military aircraft i've ever seen and being as close as it was it made absolutely no noise. i saw it travel left to right really fast, then stop instantly, like a sudden stop faster than any helicopter i've ever seen, then go back in the opposite direction and instantly stop, then go back to the right again super fast. it moved off towards the southeast really fast and i lost sight of it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
