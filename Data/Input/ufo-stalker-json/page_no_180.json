(generally the federal government assigned former military outpost or government related properties to serve as federal penitentiaries.) we lived in the  former military housing of this once radio communications transmission outpost for edwards air force base. we were 33 miles from edwards. it's now abandoned. \r\none afternoon in the fall of 1979 i was walking home from the bus stop with my sister to discover a extremely large very low flying 'ship'  moving toward us from the west and hovering directly above our house. it was a massive ship and shaped like the tip of an obselisk and massive it was so close i could see clearly the underside of the ship.  the ship was black, the surface was textured like sand. the underside of the ship had recessed symbols and shapes; trapezoids triangle and other  geometric patterns that looked hieroglyphic.  the ship was massive. it was larger than our home and made no sound at all. my sister and i stared at it for about 35  seconds. the ship then ascended directly up words slowly by about 50 feet then slid back towards the west and 50 feet then zagged to the right or east another 75 feet or so.  it then shot to the north east like a bullet. my sister and i waited to hear the sonic boom as we were accustomed to seeing the space shuttle maneuvers. we never heard it there was no sonic boom and at that speed it should've generated one. \r\n about 10 years after that event i met chuck yeager through one of my former classmates whose father served and was very close to mr. yeager. after i described to him in detail what i saw he answered me saying it was probably the harrier av-8b at which i laughed;  it wasn't remotely similar. \r\n\r\ni can send to you a google maps pin drop of the exact location/house of where i saw the ship\r\nthank you for your time. feel free to contact me if you have any questions","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:50","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

was clear with just a few white clouds. i would have never knew the object was flying by if i had not been looking up toward the eve's of my home. the object had to be pretty large because it was high above the clouds as i lost sight of it as it flew above the few clouds that were above me. the object made no sound and left no con trail as it flew. the object was outlined in white that matched the color of the clouds. inside the tear drop shape was a second white colored tear drop shape. this appeared to be part of the object. in between the first and second tear drop the objects color was the same as the sky.The whole sighting lasted less than a seven seconds. i have never seen anything like this before. i have seen plenty of aircraft from military aircraft, c17, c130's, f16's, and helicopters to civilian aircraft along with balloons and blimps. i did not have my phone so i could not take a picture. i did not have time to call my wife to come out to see the object as it was moving so fast. i got the impression the objects color was on purpose to help conceal it. a person would have to be looking right at the object to notice it at

only minor editing:\r\n(reporting witness) for about 3 weeks we have been seeing strange lights and objects near our home. we haven't had chance to fill out the reporting form, but we are still seeing really strange things in sky at night. \r\nyesterday afternoon we believe we witnessed a type of port-hole or something. it was around 630 maybe 7 pm, we were coming into our driveway, the clouds were blowing east, and way up in the sky the clouds looked like a tornado spinning, and objects were coming out of the bottom. unfortunately neither of us had a phone at the time but soon as reached the house, we saw unusual clouds. well saturday night we decided to entertain the lights in sky, so me & cathy and my two sons give them something to watch, lol. at first there were only about 10 flying around, and my two sons put flashing lights on themselves; so did cathy, but i wrapped my entire body in christmas lights we and all had play light-sabers that were my son's lol. we danced around and had fights with the light-sabers, gave them one hell of a show. after about 20 mins the sky was full of these lights. for some reason mine and cathy's phones both say 'no more storage' and won't let us take pictures or videos. we even deleted many things to make room but still can't. last night we took a magnet and ran it over puncture places on my body & to our amazement each one has an object that will move with the magnet.\r\n(additional witness) i believe _____ has contacted you as well. we have (in the last few days) experienced the most interesting, terrifying, life-changing events i hope i will ever have. around the first of june we noticed a few stars weren't stars. they blinked, mostly red and green, and darted all over, or hovered, there were also translucent triangles, & big white lights. it gradually became a living scifi series that occurred nightly. at one point there was the  most unusual thunder. we thought it was over but it's not. please help us; we have some video and many pictures. thank you.

 certainly not something from the world we know.  it did not make a sound and everything on and around the lake also did not make a sound.  it was as if the world had stopped in place.  i called my daughters to come see it.  one came and the other slept through it.  i called the police immediately and reported it.  then i tried to call fairchild afb and their phones were not working.  i called nellis afb and demanded that i speak to the general and they actually woke him up. i formerly had a top secret clearance working in washington, d.C.  he thought it might be a weather balloon and checked...No, he said, there were none in the area.  he asked what i was seeing and i told him.  he sent two men up from his base the following day. my daughter and i watched it hover for a long time and it then slowly moved across the lake ne and settled to the ground just beyond a rill in the hill. the police arrived and said they would go to a higher vantage point to see it. they called from mt. schweitzer which was too far away and could see nothing.  i woke up my other daughter and we all sat together in my bed hoping to stay awake to see it take off.  i fell asleep about 3:30 a.M. and when i awoke at 5:30 a.M. both of my daughters had fallen asleep, so we did not see it leave.  that morning we drove to find where it had landed and we found their landing pods (2).  the ground was burned where it looked like two pods had touched down as landing supports.  weird small plants had began to grow about two inches high at the time. squares of about 20 ft. by 20 ft. each. as we were hiking up the hill to see if there was anything else, i got a weird feeling and ordered the girls to the truck urgently.  just as we started the truck and pulled out onto the road, a chevy suburban grey with a small red stripe came by on the wrong side of the road.  my daughter could see them better than i as all i could see was from their noses down and the passenger's hands on the dash. she screamed and said punch it, mom. they scared her to death.  the thing that stood out most was the distance from their nose to their upper lip.  much longer than humans. the hands had quite long fingers. the next day the two men from nellis showed up and i took them to the spot where the landing pods had been and they took soil samples, tested for radiation and it was positive, took the photo my daughter had drawn (excellent artist) of the men and thanked me and left.  i never heard from them again.  the one man told me the visitors could walk through walls, etc.  i couldn't decide if he was trying to scare me or what his intentions were.  other odd things happened the following week and i will never forget any of this as long as i live.  i didn't mention it to anyone after that for fear they would think me crazy.  months later we had our driveway snowplowed and i ask him \"what's new?\"  he said \"oh, my wife saw a flying saucer.\"  so i know we weren't the only ones to see it in the area.  i've searched the archives and there is absolutely no mention of this sighting in sagle or any others for that matter.  the police should have a record and so should nellis afb for sure.

with the dog because the sky was unusually clear tonight. not a cloud in the night sky and no noticeable haze. looking to the west i thought that the sky was so clear that i could even make out the pleiades constellation. however that didn't seem correct because i thought that they were usually more of a winter observation. at that moment of thought, the constellation appeared to be drifting towards the south/ south west. after drifting approx. 60deg of travel, it faded away. \r\nthe object from my perspective appeared to be double the size of a jet liner fuselage but without wings. jet liners often fly overhead but the other direction (clockwise to cmh) and make noise. this made no sound. the object seemed to be fuzzy without a defined edge. it resembled the splash of a ground to sky floodlight against a cloud, but there were no clouds in the sky and no noticeable floodlight beam from the ground, just a light-up spot in the sky that i thought was the pleiades but moving slowly (drifting) to the south. \r\nlater i verified on a star chart that the object was initially spotted in the location between the constellations of hercules and lyra. it seemed to have about a dozen lights that i thought were the small close stars of the pleiades. they seemed to stay in their initial pattern. the object passed out of my view behind a tree then reemerged on the other side, i cannot be certain that the pattern of stars were still the same after reemerging or if they had changed. last that i saw of the object the stars on it seemed to fade away like it was banking up sharply and i could no longer see it in the sky. the time should have been about 12:50 am when this flew by. i was not bothered emotionally but felt surprised that i had spotted something weird.\r\na
