use the restroom. i was star gazing for a few moments and noticed one of the \"stars\" was moving slightly. i rubbed my eyes and cleaned my glasses and watched for a good 5 minutes. while intensely viewing the star i quickly began noticing two separate faint blue lights flashing in and out in an orbit like way around the \"star\". yet, the slight movement of the start that that originally caught my eye was in fact darting towards each flash of faint blue light. i witnessed this for several minutes before going back to the tent. the \"star\" was extremely high in the sky, perhaps in space itself or the upper atmosphere. for as high as the light objects were i believe that the slight movements the star made towards the blue lights must have been extremely fast, as it was moving back and forth, stopping, and then shifting toward another blue light repeatedly.","distance":"Over One

point out that we were far from city lights������ at a friend������s farm. just entertaining ourselves in the evening ������no we were not drunk ������just relaxing on sun loungers totally oblivious and never discussed anything remotely about looking for ufo������s in the sky, not until we saw what we saw the two red orbs. i can surly say without a doubt, the hair on my arms stood rock hard. explain what we saw no! i cannot, our conversion totally took a different track making suggestions and conclusions, they did not just vanish, and it was the distance between them and us was getting farther away and harder to see them\r\nmy thought was that they were on a mission as probes sent ahead to scout around, we watched them as far as we can see them before they were out of sight. \r\nthe second time was in north carolina\r\nonce again they were fairly high in the dark star lit night sky, no sound came from them and we could clearly see they were two individual objects as i can see the stars between them as they passed me by. the usual questions arose when this subject brought up, (lights from a distant car brake lights, airplane flying close by, as they have red and green lights, jet fighter, helicopter, as you know the usual debunking stuff)\r\ni live in the country, away from city lights and traffic, airfield, military bases, so again lights from other moving cars, planes, helicopters the answer is a blatantly no! what i saw is unexplainable, wish someone could\r\nif anyone can put an explanation to what these things were, we will be very interested to hear from someone.\r\nlooking forward to hearing from someone\r\nregards\r\nphil\r\nnow i watch the skies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmy response to the second sighting\r\n1.\twhere you and what were were you doing at the time?\r\n���x\tthis was early in the morning around 5:30am in the morning i was at home walking towards my truck which is parked in the rear drive way, getting ready to drive for work.\r\n2. what made you first notice the object?\r\n���x\t the moment i stepped into the truck, i just happened to see them these two red orbs in the sky, knowing i had witnessed them before and had thought great again. this time my concentration was encapsulated into more thinking on what i was watching  once again\r\n\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\r\n���x\tunable explain exactly what we saw!, only conclusion was that they were probes sent ahead to scouting mission\r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions in detail.\r\n���x\twhen i saw once again these two red orbs in the sky, they were fairly high in the dark star lit night sky. no sound came from them and i could clearly see they were two individual objects as i can see the stars between them as they passed me by in a straight line, they remained at a distance apart unti9l i no longer was able to see them as they were too far away\r\n\r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object.\r\n���x\tmy feeling before the sighting was normal as can be getting ready to drive to work like any other uneventful morning. my feelings after the

 the sky was cloud free and the weather was calm.  it was then followed by up to 20 or 25 more items of the same type, all of which appeared to travel together in a line from east to west where they seemed to vanish in the distance.  they were extremely interesting in the way they looked and the way they traveled.  they did not travel in a distinct formation, but appeared to be in a loose traveling group moving along fairly quickly.  they appeared to hover, slow down, speed up, and change direction at will, all while traveling in an east to west line.  the event lasted about 5 to 10 minutes.  they are unlike anything i've ever seen in the sky, night or day, at any previous time.  they did not appear to be a group of airplanes or a meteor shower.  i felt amazed then, and do now,

be a bright red firework descending in the sky just above the edge of a fence. i immediately interrupted myself and asked my friend what it was. he stood, turned around and looked to where i had motioned. \r\nabout this time, the falling red light diverted course drastically and began ascending and descending back and forth in rapid succession, all the while continuously changing color and shape. the colors varied, first red, then gold and green and possibly even blue. the object transitioned from one color to another with absolute fluidity. it went from falling and looking like it had a tail, to taking the form of a sphere before changing shape several more times to various shapes that are hard to describe. it then took a much more conventional and deliberate path west over the ca-99 freeway. the entire sighting lasted approximately 15 seconds. \r\nthe object began to leave my field of vision due to obstruction. at this time i ran around the front of his house where i saw neighbors gathered outside who had also just witnessed the event. at this point i tried to regain sight of the object, but did not see it again. i have never seen anything like it before and it was completely inaudible. i could not make out a definite shape for the object, which seemed to be.....Simply light. the lights did not seem to be placed on a craft, the light seemed to be the craft itself.\r\njust after pointing out the object to my friend and noticing it's erratic behavior, i pulled out my cell phone to record the object. i was only able to get mere seconds of the object, which

passing bowmens club on right. when i noticed 2 bright lights in front of me in the sky above hill, houses. about 400 feet-up. decending slowly down and to the left.They looked like 2 boxes a few feet apart.My 1st thought was maybe a kids kite in the park that i new was just over the hill.I was driving up a hill at the time so it was really easy to notice.And there was other traffic right next to me and behind me. my thought was they have to being seeing this too! as i was driving over the hill wacthing these 2 boxes decending down toward the ground, they were just a few feet apart. i thought maybe it could be two white birds decending in perfect formation until they started turning downward and the two boxes strecthed-out longer into two perfect shapes, like rectangles.At this point i got excited and looked for place to pullover. then these two objects kind of levaled-out and moved north towards folsom lake away from me. they moved about a thousand yards away in just a second then quickly faded away from view.So i kept driving just maybe one block and they reapeird again getting brighter in seconds. my thought at this time was maybe it was an airplane reflecting in the sun. a real white airplane. but it was two objects just a few feet apart.At this time a realalised the size of the objects were about the size of 2 cars. i glued my eyes on these and slowed way down and almost completetly stopped at the green light in front of the park. then the to objects slowly faded away again, so i pulled overand got out my binockgulars. the objects were gone but there was a vulture flying around up there where i last saw it so i focused on it. hoping the object would return. after a few minutes it did not so i took off driving north again on eldorado bulvd towards green valley road. i crossed green valley rd this turns into salmon falls road about two miles still looking towards the west when the object appiared again. this time it was one object, but looked like a square box. i emideantly pulled over. it was moving north rapedly about 6or8 hundred feet high and got behind some trees blocking my view. so i took off after it and could see it in the next few minutes through the trees as i was was hurring to get about a mile up the road to a place i new was clearer of trees. i noticed the object kept pulsating in and out of brightness and vision, and turning while i was chasing it. right when i was getting to the clearing it got real bright and stopped for a second.It looked like a perect big white box in the sky slightly rotating about 800 feet above the lake. folsom lake.With a hillin the backgrund behind it.Then it started moving slowly to the west and faded away. i stayed there for about five more minutes hopping to see it again but i did not. i realized this whole encouter lasted about 12 minutes and over 5 miles.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

north east mesa, united states.  i went out into the back yard to have a cigarette and shortly after i was outside i saw 2 red-orange orbs moving in the sky from the west to the east.  there were no exterior lights on in the back yard and the two orbs were very prominent, they appeared shortly after i went outside. they came into view as they fly over the house from the front yard to the back yard. my first reaction was one of amazement; i do not recall ever seeing anything quite like these before. that is what held my attention; they did not look like other planes or aircraft i have seen at night.   i consider myself a logic based person and i was trying to figure out what they were. i was thinking if they are not a ufo, what they could be.  they were at about the elevation single engine airplanes normally fly over at, about 45 degrees above the horizon from my view point.  they were not moving quickly across the sky; i would say approximately at about the speed of a single engine aircraft.  there was no blinking white lights or other colors of normal tell-tale signs of a regular aircraft navigation lights.  they were both this large reddish or red orange color in a bulb or orb shape with no definitive outer shape, they were fuzzy around the edges.  the diameter of the orbs seemed to be approximately twice as large as that of a normal small airplane from tip to tail and both orbs seemed to be the same size.  after the fact, i would say if i held my hand out at arm���s length the orbs were about the size of two of my fingertips together.  the color was a warm, fire-like color, almost pulsating, without any distinct pattern to the pulsing.  the orbs were opaque in the fact that i could not see through them or make out any distinguishing features other than the general orb shape.   the exterior air conditioner was on along the side of the home; however, there was no appreciable sound that i could hear.  they flew in close proximity to each other, but not in exact parallel, they were moving independently of each other, they did not circle each other or act in synch in a manner that i could tell.  there were definitely two distinct objects from what i could ascertain.  i had never seen anything quite like them, i was mesmerized by them.  i was the only person who saw them; there were no other witnesses with me.  my roommate was inside the home at the time, however, i honestly did not even think to tell him to come outside, i was fixated on the objects. they kept moving in an eastern direction, wavering a bit, one more in a direct path and the other starting to trail off a bit to the south east.  then the one orb just blinked out and vanished entirely���there was no residual color in the sky that i could see or any downward trails as a flair or such may make.  a second or two afterwards, the second orb faded out in a similar fashion.  the sky that night was clear, only some wisps of clouds.  i first thought that maybe they flew into

not know if they were extraterrestrial or not, i just do not have an explanation for what i saw.  my best guess is i viewed them for approximately 2 minutes before they vanished.

called grepi but i want to repeat it to you because of its very peculiar context.\r\nit started at the swimming pool,when people like me in water or around the swimming pool looked up when helicopters belonging to the french \"gendarmerie\" went to and fro above the glass roof.Shortly after,as i was out at the poll's exit, one helicopter was just above the canal in front of the s.Pool, in the same position (not moving) above the water.Until that time i had thought of a car accident or trouble with a gang etc.(the helicopters were 2 or 3 at least).Then i started going home...Shortly after, still hearing and seeing the helicopters, i was going home,on foot.Shortly after i entered my street i heard a helicopter on my left, looked at it and saw, just at its right and behind, a small round disc or sphere going rather slowly,very regular.It was going at times in front of the blue sky and at others in front of white clouds,which gave me a feeling that this object was small and not very far from me,althought it is difficult to tell...I walk home during a bit more than 10 minutes,looking at the strange object untill it approached the horizon,almost (above the distant houses and other buildings),it went on a straight line from beginning to the end,never changed its direction,as it seemed.At the beginning of the observation it seemed that it went clearer on the top,i thought it was due to sunlight.\r\nthe important question i put to myself was: what were doing the helicopters in the sky? was it coincidence?Were they trying to find something they could have found on their radars?\r\nif only i could give an answer!!!!!\r\nthis is very serious t���������������������������moignage,i wish i could find somebody who saw this object that day!I remember i crossed somebody and

under some trees when i first noticed something flying over us slightly to our right (we were facing east, so it came from ne....Possibly hillsboro airport?). this was shortly after the airshow so it could have been a stealth bomber with some new mode that our neighbor didn't know about, but he said it wasn't a stealth bomber or fighter. it had almost a cloudy effect to it, but this could be due to the only illumination was from the ambient light below. it seemed to bank to go sse as it crossed the little road we were on and it continued straight in a very fluid motion until it faded out of sight. it was a clear night and as it banked i could clearly see it looked like a boomerang with 2 side winglets, like if you could imagine a boomerang with the front flattened, so it's main width was flat and then it had side portions angling back. i shone a very narrow beam powerful flashlight at it and it didn't hit it (normally has about a 100 yard range), so it was higher than the treetops but was probably under 1000 feet. we all agree on that, due to the ambient light hitting it. it was huge!!! was the other conclusion. we couldn't be accurate as there was nothing to compare it against. also we don't know if that was it's accurate shape as it could have had a portion that didn't reflect ambient light and it was too short a time period to notice how any stars were blocked.\r\nwhat was odd is that my girlfriend and i had seen another ufo a week before (orange circular shape around 9pm with no sound) in the same spot. we found others have seen this one and a photo exists on another website....So we weren't the only ones to see that one. we thought the orange one could have been a hoax, but this flying wing was definitely not a hoax. i suspect it was a military stealth

ascend, follow straight flight, and descend then appear to change to circular glow that continued to ascend below line of sight. i have observed these triangular objects with binoculars, but i cannot make out a appearance except for the triangular position of the lights, the object at times appear to be transparent in nature, while observing these objects there is a humming, or buzzing like sound in the vicinity. over the last month, and half of observation of these objects i have felt as if there is a presence in the area, the light is white, blue in nature and at times appear to pulsate randomly, and at other times seem to keep timing perfectly. when these triangular lights are moving they seem to glide along, but they move as if you were watching someone accelerate, and decelerate  in sync power surges, i have noticed a pattern of activity with these objects as well, during the beginning of week(sunday, monday, tuesday, wednesday) they are much more active, and i have observed the objects much more during these nights, with a decline in the remaining days in the week(thursday, friday, saturday). i also went online during these sighting having wireless internet sitting outside observing, and have brought up live radar in the area showing all commercial airliners in the area that is in real time, and during these sightings there are nothing within 100 miles. these objects leave no contrail, i also attempted to record the objects on one occasion with electronic camera, and just prior to the sighting that i was going to record approximately nine thirty pm central time i had approximately twenty minutes prior placed new batteries in the camera, and proceeded with a test run with the camera showing full charge. at the time of the sighting of this object i tried to record only finding my batteries had no power upon trying to record the object in question. a family member was witness to this event, and other family, friends, and local law enforcement have witnessed these objects as i had pointed them out to several people in parking lot of local store.  these objects fly appear to be 50-100ft in size, and appear about size of golf ball. i have noticed on several occasions on nights that these objects are more active, i physically feel drained, and have noticed almost feeling of warmth when observing these objects at times. as for the cylinder shaped white glowing object i have only seen these three times in the area, but these have made me nervous at the time due to them appearing to be standing on end in the air with a diameter of approximately 5 ft, and height of approximately 12 ft, these objects i have seen appear in the horizon with my field of vision at approximately 25 degrees out of thin air, then ascend, and then begin to follow at flight path above the area only to disappear after slowly moving across the sky at approximately 20mph these cylinder object have been approximately within 150 ft of a family member, and i at one sighting, the other two sightings within 500-1000ft. i had followed them only to watch them just slowly fade out of sight, as if you were turning the burner down on the stove. i felt the most impacted as these came within a zone of comfort, my family member on the other hand did not feel bothered by the event but more interested than anything. since the start of witnessing the triangular lighted objects, and cylinder shaped objects, i have noticed while just observing the areas sky at angle of horizon to approximately 45 degrees line of sight i keep witnessing what appears to be just quick streaks or flashes of light that last fractions of a second. also just to note one of the local law enforcement officers in the area tried to record lights around the same time last year on his dash camera, but when he went to play back what he had recorded at the station it was complete static, with no apparent reason. i also have trouble with cell phone wanting to function properly when observing these objects, i continue to see these objects everynight, and will continue to update, and i will eventually get hold of high resolution recorder, and submit video. ive tried to take video

time, i was shocked to see a very bright white object, much brighter than jupiter.    the object was coming from below (east) and to the south of the moon. it appeared slightly ovoid, with no flashing or undulating light. it was obviously very high up.\r\n  i yelled urgently for my companion to come see, and he bolted to the door.  i hope i didn���t wake my neighbors with my exclamations of shock.  as a lifetime night owl and sky watcher, this was something out of the ordinary.\r\n  the object came from below and to the right of the moon on an east to west trajectory, traveling at a rate of speed similar to that of the iss.   upon investigation i found that this could not be the iss, which travels west to east.  i have witnessed the iss several times.  this object���s brightness was greater.  because trees blocked my view, (the object rose to above the trees to clear sky), the length of travel that i witnessed was about 20 degrees.\r\n\r\n i withheld any real excitement until i checked satellite transits, although i have never seen a satellite this large or bright,  including nasa for  iss transits on this date.  the iss was to make a pass at 23:21:23 to 23:31:43 on 8/19/11,

right angle turn back to the direction it had come from, then instantly sped to three times faster and out of sight.

nearby mountain, three more lights ascend below the ones in the arc.  these lights were between myself and the nearby mountain which i judge to be no more than five miles away.\r\n\r\nall the lights continued to ascend and travel southwest, and they all faded out when they got to about the 80 degree point. \r\n\r\nwhile we watched i telephoned a friend who lives close to where we were.  she watched them for awhile from her window.

sidewalk to the east and a brillant light caught my eye at about 45 degrees.  it appeared to be about the size of 1/2 inch next to my index finger. this is the flight path of tinker afb in midwest city, ok so i expected it to be one of the many planes i sight in daytime and nighttime. light was totally still so i figured it was flying toward me. i put my finger up to site it and it stayed the same size, not moving at all. it remained in the same position the entire 10 minutes i was outside. in about 1 minute 2 very small lights appeared next to the bottom of it and began making random, impossible flight manouveres all around the stationery object. one small object was bright red, one was bright blue. they didn't stay together, rather they moved all about up to the appearance of a couple inches around the stationery object. \r\ni went into the house to get a camera, but could only find my phone camera which takes bad pictures. i went outside to snap some pics fully expecting it to be gone since it had taken at least a couple minutes to find the phone. i took pics of the red and blue objects, but wouldn't take a pic of the stationery one. i tried over and over to no avail. suddenly the bright light was gone with only the blue and red ones left, then after a few seconds they too disappeared. no sound was made by anything including frogs, crickets etc. it was totally windless. i didn't hear the usual road traffic off i-35 or i-240. it was like i had muffs on my ears.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":31234,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.35763784213574,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08272011-0026","longitude":-97.4540386641391,"occurred":1314264600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oklahoma","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Blimp,

called me outside. was a bright red light light in the sky moving slowly in a southerly direction. the light was quite brilliant initially, looked diffused - fuzzy around the edges. the luminosity faded as it move across the horizon, so i am assuming it was moving away from us. \r\n\r\nthe path remained a fairly straight line, however the key thing that was unusual was it appeared to be stuttering up and down quite alot as it moved along. at this point it was viewable to us for about a minute until the light passed beyond view behind a large oak, after atleast a minute it appears on the other side. looked smaller, still travelling the same general speed. about half-way through the viewable space between the tree and the neighboring set of townhouses, it simply vanished. \r\n\r\nas we were starting our, \"that was weird\" conversation - another similar light appeared back over to the far left - completely out of nowhere - perhaps a bit higher on the horizon as the other - and began to move in the same direction, with the same behavior.\r\n\r\ni jumped into the house to grab my phone to take some video. i was able to follow the object with my camera for about 30-45 seconds before it again moved behind the tree. \r\n\r\ni went out on the walk to walk around the tree to try to spot it and follow with the camera, but this time it was already gone. \r\n\r\nthe video is very poor, it was simply too dark. the most you can see is a very small light from the object moving slowly across the sky. \r\n\r\nwe hung around for another 10-15 minutes or so, but nothing else showed. \r\n\r\nwe've lived here for a number of years and have become accustomed to seeing alot of lights in the sky - landings at pit. this was moving in completely wrong direction, for either an arrival or departure. the light was totally different from anything we've ever seen. there is occasional helicopter traffic in the area, usually during the day, however for the size of the light and relative proximity - we would've heard the rotors if it was one. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

you could consider me a 'trained observer'.  i'm also a backyard astronomer and was in the process of setting up my telescope when i happened to notice high in the east sky at about 70 degrees what appeared to be a circular edge-on disc shaped object moving very slowly to the north.  the sky was completely cloud free and the moon was not out. very few stars were visible since there was still slight residual daylight and i live in a large city with lots of light pollution.  a few seconds after i notice the object it brightened to extremely bright before completely disappearing.  when i say extremely bright i mean significantly brighter than venus when it's out. when the object dimmed out it did so in how an incandescent light bulb goes out, with a lingering fade out.  there were absolutely no other aircraft type lights (or other aircraft for that matter) visible.  as the object dimmed out i could clearly see that it had a physical shape of a circle or edge-on disc.  the object was about the apparent size of maybe a small pea held at arm's length.  a few seconds later the object repeated the brightening and fading one more time.  the second time i saw it the object had moved maybe the distance between two or three open hands held up to the sky.  i opened the back door and called to my wife that i just saw something that i couldn't explain and she came outside.  my wife is also a police detective with 10 years of experience and is not really into astronomy.  just as she stepped onto the patio i pointed to where i saw the object and we looked up.  a few seconds later we both saw the object again brighten, but this time it was much less bright than the first two times i saw it.  i would describe the intensity as just like a 'normal' bright star.  the object was further to the north in what appeared to be a linear trajectory from where i had originally observed it.  after this third sighting we did not see the object again (and i kept looking).  i cannot explain what we observed.\r\ni am familiar with satellite and iss passes and this did not look like any i have seen in the past.  when the object dimmed, it completely disappeared.  i then thought it might have been an iridium flare (although it didn't look like any that i have seen in the past) so i checked the internet for any visible iridium or iss passes but there were none for this evening at about 2100 hrs.  the size of the object was significantly larger than a visible satellite or even the recent iss/shuttle passes.  this object was large enough to actually resolve a circular edge-on disc shape and it appeared to be extremely high in altitude. i've never reported anything like this before but it was so completely unexplainable that i felt compelled to do an internet search on how to report a \"ufo\".\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
