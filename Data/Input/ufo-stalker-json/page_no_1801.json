i have no idea.  i'd like to believe they were alien in origin, but have no idea.\r\n\r\ncould there be a  simple,worldly explaination? of course, but whatever they were, it was breathtaking, frightening, and awsomely wonderful. i truly think i saw something special, and alien.  we are a few miles from inel, so maybe they keep an eye on it?  government stuff?  who knows.\r\ni made a picture of the best way i can remember it looked.  still so frazzled by it i probably have forgotten details that i wish i could remember better.\r\n\r\ni just talked to my daughter who lives about a mile from me, and she and her entire family saw it, almost identical story (it was too late to call me she thought, and was afraid i'd think she was crazy)now we are all freakin'out!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":31229,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.48256273892983,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08272011-0021","longitude":-111.99020177397179,"occurred":1314425100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Idaho","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1314508694000,"summary":"Clearly saw unusual, unbelieveable night sky objects","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/31229_submitter_file1__ufo.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"83401","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Idaho Falls, Idaho","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:39538"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Modesto","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Six red/orange orbs plus one blue orb moving north at approx. 300-400 mph, three in diamond shape, the rest in loose formation.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":31227,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.650789366710036,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08272011-0019","longitude":-120.99581079624254,"occurred":1314495000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1314507615000,"summary":"Six red/orange orbs plus one blue orb moving north at approx. 300-400 mph","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"95354","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Modesto, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:39539"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Otisville","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We were driving home from a friends cottage near otisville, mi around 9:00pm on aug. 20, 2011.  it was dark outside since we were in the country driving home.  we looked up in the sky and noticed a group of lights up in the sky which were reddish orange in color.  there were about 12-15 of these objects all in a staight line and then the line started to descend.  at first we thought they were a group of balloons up there tethered to a wire, but they were all so straight and then they descended downward.  they were not moving.  they were steady. we continued driving toward them and trying to figure out what they were.  we opened up the window and listened, but heard nothing.  we kept observing them, but there was no change.  we were not sure what they were up in the sky.  another couple were following us in their car and later on we followed them home and asked them if they noticed the objects in the sky and they said that they did. we all remarked \"what were they?\"  none of us had any idea of what they could have been.  we all said that they must have been ufo's.  it was the strangest sight any of us had ever seen.

in a bright ball of light at something between 10 and 20 meters of my kitchen window, and stood upright in front of two men dressed in military uniforms. i guess the were communicating (or trying to)

time.\r\nthere were soldiers very well disguised in a bush in front of my kitchen window, i asked them if i could go outside, if that would affect my physical integrity or disturn the ongoing event... not a sound ... i then dared to go outside and sit on a rock 5 meters from my kitchen door, i noticed they became shy and froze their swinging in the trees. i chanted the mantra om, which was told to me as being the sound of the universe and one of god's names, they bacame a little less shy and resumed their swinging in the trees. i felt i should go back in, as i did not want to disturb the

that weekend so i remember it was an off day).  i was in backyard of my parents house in collierville, tn (where i lived at the time) just to get some air. i looked up and southward and saw object traveling very slowly.  there were lots of trees so i saw it as it traveled from behind one tree out into the open and then went behind trees again as it moved strait from east to west at about 20 - 30 mph maybe.  way too slow for plane and it certainly didn't look like plane. just a big wing with the huge round lights that could have been 20 to 30 or more feet in diameter perhaps. it was huge with wing span of maybe 1 to 2 football fields.  it was right in front of me.  it was about a week before memorial day so at first i thought it may have been a b2 stealth bomber on it's way for an air show in memphis perhaps. but it only took about a half second for me to realize that wasn't the case. it was way too slow and it was also way to low to be in flight pattern for approach to memphis airport 11 miles away. i felt stupid afterwards that i was mesmerized by it but i never saw anything like that and never heard of anything like that.  also it was completely silent. i didn't own a camera and if i did it was over so fast i did not have time to run and get it. several weeks later, while in break room at work, i saw a usa today newspaper with article about ufo over phoenix.  it was the same story that art bell broadcasted.  i heard the broadcast that night when it happened in phoenix but that was a couple months before my sighting and no one was sure what it was.  in the article i saw a computer generated drawing and it was almost exactly what i saw in collierville only what i saw had wing angle that was much more shallow than the one pictured in usa today newspaper but that was the object. it was more chevron shaped and not like a v.  more like the chevron on my uniform when i was in navy. i was never able to tell anyone for fear of ridicule. all these years later i was obsessed with it and finally searched youtube and then on discovery website where i finally found couple who saw this object as well and it was during so called \"lights over phoenix\" incident that had happened a couple months before in arizona.  this is the video.  computer illustration starts at about 2:04 in the video and they describe it.  i also research other stories and have concluded there were military flares that night but they were a separate incident than the ship seen by these people.

occasionally  glancing up for periods hoping to catch a meteor, i looked up to see a normal aircraft about 70 degrees eastward, heading from a ne to s direction.  i then noticed a large (perhaps twice, maybe three times size of passing original aircraft),totally silent object \"floating\" to the right of the plane. the distance from the aircraft was maybe two outward held \"fist- lengths\" from the plane.    initially i thought \"whoa, really large bright satellite pass!\", but immediately realizing that it was too late in evening to view any passes.  and it was larger than the iss.  object path was, for lack of better word, \" meandering\".\r\n\r\n  i then tried to justify object being an airplane, and again, quickly dismissed the thought due to the following:  it had absolutely no sound.  there were no airplane lights - the white illumination was  steady, no fluctuation at all. and even if one considered that my view could have been from odd angle, the largeness of object dictated that i would have had to see the airplane strobe.  it was floating uncannily slow, in no particular flight path and was not blimp-shaped. in fact. would be hesitant to actually assign a shape. while watching it wander so impossibly slow and while trying to make up my mind what i was looking at, i saw some faint led-like red flashes randomly coming from object.  these faint red strobes occurred several random times, as i watched.\r\n\r\nwhile i watched it move in a slow, irregular flight path, in a northerly direction, i turned on the iphone camera but was unable to capture image. i thought, \"well heck, it's moving so slow, i'll run in the house and grab the binoculars\", which were just a few feet from the back door.  however, returning back to the porch, the object was absolutely gone.  this was not possible, given rate of speed and direction heading, it absolutely could not have travelled from my field of view.  i am very confident of this fact.   i thouroughly scanned the sky,  then ran to thru the house out the front door, in order to view the eastern and northern horizon ( central texas horizon - no obstructed horizon view) the night was clear, no haze.  on this kind of evening i'm able to easily view up to 2.6 mag. and  a bit fainter  satellites.  however after scrutinizing every inch of sky, even looking through binoculars, even veiwing whar i knew to be stars & planets; i kept thinking that i would see it fading to a faint point into the distance. illogically, the object had completely vanished from the sky.  lest the investigator thinks otherwise, i spend countless hours viewing sattilite passes, studying the night sky, and watching for meteors. so, i am not quick to jump to conclusions concerning objects that i see:  i am not going to mistake jupiter ( it had not even risen yet), or a sattilite flare for a \" flying saucer\".   this object was impressive and may well have been a new military creation, but it certainly was not following any of the rules with which i am familiar. \r\n ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

definitely noticeable.  however, as i continued to look at it, i realized it wasn't moving at all & it also had blue, green & yellow lights, pulsating.  the lights were going around in a circle.  you could see it with the naked eye, but especially well with binoculars.  it stayed in the same spot for at least 45 minutes, then gradually went further west & below the tree tops from my vantage point.  then, i noticed another, with the same pulsating lights north of me.  this one was also stationary, but did sometimes move, very gradually west, then back east.  it was still there when i went to bed at 3 am.  i also observed a very large triangle formation southwest of this new one- one at the top and two at the bottom making up the bottom of the triangle shape.  that all took place on thursday, 8.25.11.  tonight, i specifically looked to see if they were there & they were, several.  there was one that was especially bright, the same pulsating lights.  tonight, however, this object appeared to zip around when viewed through binoculars, almost creating a \"ribbon\" of rainbow lights, like if you whipped a ribbon around in the air, all kinds of loops, etc.  it was there for hours.  i also asked my neighbors to look & they had never seen anything like this & agreed it was not a plane, a star, a satellite.  it didn't move, but it must have, as it seemed to once in a while be farther away.  if you didn't know what you were looking for & stare at it w/o binoculars, you could easily dismiss it as a plane or a star.  you definitely won't think that when you look through binoculars.  i never lost sight of the object.  my arm got tired from holding the binoculars.  i'm hoping someone can investigate this with far better equipment than i have.  i just have a feeling they will be back tomorrow.  i'd love someone to bring a high-powered camera to capture evidence of this thing to show experts.  this is truly unexplainable and since they did move, cannot be stars.  not to

account as this could be a crashed or a landed ufo. \r\n\r\n    last night(8/26/2011) i was outside locking my truck up and my neighbor told me about an extremely bright beam of light shining through a window in her house that \r\nshe noticed through her curtains about 30 minutes prior to my walking outside. initially, i tried to ignore her, which is typically easy since her house is about 50 yards \r\nfrom my own and upon a small hill. however, she just wouldn't stop trying to get me to check it out from her vantage point so i walked up to her house and sat out on her \r\n2nd story deck waiting for the lights to reappear. i didn't see anything for several minutes but in the mean time i noticed a dozen planes fly over the area in a matter of about 5 minutes; which to me is an unusually high amount of air traffic, as i frequently \"star gaze\". sure enough though after several minutes i, too, saw this incredible, bright flash of a greenish-blue color. no beam, just a super bright flash that went away in seconds. after seeing this flash two more times in orange and white, my brother, neighbor, and myself decided to drive through our small town to see if we could get a closer look. upon arriving at a local gas station approximately 1 mile away we noticed one police officer and a hazmat coordinator(who is also the chief of the fire dept.) looking at the same light that was now more than a mere flash. the lights were now located across the valley and about halfway up a small ridge, only accessible by an old logging road, and it had become six to eight smaller flashing lights which were red,blue, green and white and aligned in what looked like a semi-circular pattern.There was also a small amount of smoke coming from the scene, but not as much as you would typically see from a brush fire; and the amount of smoke also fluctuated with time. we asked the officers what they thought it could be and the hazmat guy said \"no power lines had been reported down by ku\" and \"he wasn't sure\", while the uniformed policeman jokingly said, \"maybe it's e.T. with a blow torch\". both of which seemed to be more than a little stumped by this situation. there were also 6 other people who we talked to that confirmed the bright flashes. for the next 2 1/2 hours the three of us sat in the parking lot of this gas station and kept our eyes fixated on these lights which were now randomly flashing the colors i mentioned, but were dimming and then emitting powerful beams into the sky and through the trees in all directions periodically, and even went completely dark on 3 or 4 occasions. there was also a clearly audible \"humming\" sound coming from the area, that made more of a \"wah-wah-wahhh\" sound. there were power lines stretching in front of the lights that were completely visible due to the bright flashing of the lights and they appeared to be intact.The strangest thing to me though was we could spot a single light traveling up the logging road, which took about 30 minutes to get from the bottom of the hill to around the vicinity of these brighter lights, but before this light could get all the way up there, it promptly turned around and came back down in a matter of minutes.  dogs were also barking incessantly through this whole experience.  after the lights finally quit flashing about 3 hours in, the lights went totally dark for about 20 minutes, at which time all the other spectators left, and then a single small,white light reappeared that was too bright to look at directly without causing pain or discomfort. we witnessed all of this through a pair of binoculars but due to the trees on the hill side the only thing we could clearly see was the colors and pattern of the lights. the police came back several hours later and told us it was, \"in fact\", a downed power line that had been arching and causing the bright flashes. soon thereafter a ku truck came by, circled a short back road off ky-38, and left again without fixing this alleged down power line.\r\n\r\n also, this morning(8/27/2011) at about 9:00 am while on my way to class at the local community college i saw four ku trucks parked at different spots on ky-38, just parked there, sitting with no one doing any kind of work to power lines. only a single person in the truck, the driver. also in the gas station parking lot were two white ford pick up trucks with the standard diamond shaped nfpa chemical hazard label, unfortunately, i did not think to stop by and take down the numbers within the diamond. there were so many things about this situation that didn't make sense to me and cause me to question it all. here are a few of my most relevant questions:\r\n\r\n \r\ncan a downed power line create a beam of light so bright that it can be seen in a house through the curtains, one mile away?\r\n \r\nif it were a transformer that exploded, would it not create a single bright flash of a single color and then go dark? why would the lights continue to reappear and go black?\r\n \r\nwhy would several blinking lights consolidate into one solid light?\r\n \r\nif it was a downed power line, and ku knew about it, wouldn't they be obligated to fix the problem immediately? it could have potentially caused a forest fire. \r\n\r\n \r\nin this area, small storms cause localized blackouts frequently, yet there was no blackout to be seen anywhere near this downed power line or blown transformer. why?\r\n \r\nwhat was the loud humming sound? \r\n \r\nwhy would ku trucks be parked on the side of the road, but not have anyone working on the power lines?","distance":"101-500

approximate\r\non the night of november 15th, opening day of deer rifle season, the year 1997, i was camped out in my van about a mile across from the cellular phone tower outside of deep water mo. it had snowed slightly in the early morning hours, barely an inch. the daytime temp. was in the teens. after a fruitless day of hunting i retired to my van to grab a bite to eat and warm myself with some hot coffee. as it gets dark by 5:45pm, i was just sitting in the van in a pull in, facing a growed up field, imagining that a big buck would cross into my view. the old boy i was after. as one has nothing much to do but plot out the next days plans, i was just thinking of my game plan. while looking out my side window through leaves near a tree i was parked next to, i noticed some lights in the distant sky shining off and on. and now my story begins in all earnesty. i am, i think a man's man. i do not fear much on this earth, yet what i was about to have happen to me, being mentally unprepared, would change my way of thinking and/or life forever! i grabbed my binoculars, wallet, and a 9mm pistol i had, not wanting to leave them in the van. i put my pistol in my waist holster, and my coat on to step out into the road to view what i thought was a helicopter, about 3/4 to 1 mile away over the dark treeline. as i couldn't quite make out the lights flashing on this object too well, i walked down the road to where it curbs about 70 yards from the van. the road heads out to my left towards the communication tower mentioned earlier, behind me it ends at some rocky bluffs that people like to fish alot from, towards hw 13 out of clinton, mo. when i focused my nikon 8x40 binoculars on the object again, with and without my glasses, i could just make out what appeared to be a dish like form, a red flashing light on the middle top, and what looked like strobe lights flasing in the middle of the object in a circular and uniform manner. i could not hear any sound at that distance, but looking at the object and judging its movement if any, against the dark tree line, i came to the conclusion it was hovering and/or stationary. i did think this was odd for a helicopter to be in that area and no sound whatsoever. and in that frame of mind, all i was doing was wondering what could be the purpose. little knowing that my quiet evening was to take a sci-fi turn out of a movie! as i was just standing watching this object, i happened to look to my left, down that section of county road, possibly 1/4 mile in length and was shocked to see a blue like, lazer beam of light come from the sw horizen and make a 90 degree drop straight down to the earth, which seemed to be at the end of the road i was standing on. standing on mind you! i may have not put as much thought into what the disk like object i was looking at seconds ago, to be no more than some sort of man made craft, helicopter, etc, but this lazer light as you can guess, made me take a very profound interest in what was happening around me in the star filled, cold, dark heavens! i gazed intently in the direction of that beam of light which made no sound, yet didn't see anything. i then put my binoculars on the disk like object and saw that it was still in the same area and still flashing its lights the same as before. after what seemed like 5 minutes, out of the corner of my left eye, another blueish lazer beam of light appeared from the same area of the horizon from the sw as the 1st beam, and in the blink of an eye it stopped halfway down the road, above the tree line next to the road i was standing in. i can only describe this orb as one might say to be somewhat egg shaped,fuzzy in color, white around the edge, with a pilot flame like bluish tint of color, taking up 80% of the middle diameter. the hair went up on my neck and head as it very slowly, yet quietly, seem to be floating down the tree line towards me! i seemed to instantly forget that i had a fully loaded 9mm pistol in the back of my waist! i was very proficient with this firearm, yet the fear that seemed to overcome me made me even lose touch with the very ground i stood on. i was as one might say, reveted in place. i quickly looked back at the disk and it was still there, doing the same thing as before. in turning quickly back to watch the orb float towards me down the tree line, i tried to judge its size by taking my hand and encircling it with my fingers. i judged it to be at arms length about the size of a golf ball or slightly larger. in the process of doing this i also judged the height above to treeline to what one might think as 40 ft.Or so. i cannot safely say that this orb was directly over the tree line or just behind it. but it was in full view. after getting this info in my head, it had closed the distance to me by more than halfway. by then it looked to be the size of a baseball! to say i was getting worried is an unearthly understatement! then out of the same sw horizon, another lazer like beam, and a 2nd orb lines up directly behind the first orb! possibly 100 ft. or so apart. they both are floating along silently still coming towards me. as they near the end of the tree line, the curve i am standing in has a field road cutting into a grown up field that lays across their path, this i am nearly facing, although slightly to the left, as i am understandably watching their immenant progress towards me. all of a sudden, in the blink of an eye, the 2nd orb behind the 1st orb, drops down underneath and is directly lined up as if tied together, both silently coming on. i cup my ears and hear nothing, no humming, nothing! as they both cross the opening directly across from me, an incredibly bright, neon green, \"v\" shaped light seems to light up the star filled night sky where i had no view of anything but that light in that split second. in that light i just snapped a photo in my minds eye, was what seemed to look like a unbroken smoke ring, much as a feather would look like descending to the ground. how anyone could not possibly see this from hw 13 over the grand river arm of the lake is beyond me. but in that light i did not see either of the orbs. but as soon as the light was gone, what i assumed to be the 1st orb was slowly continuing that same path over the treeline to my right. it started to slightly veer upwards at a 45 degree angle and as it was in the direction as the disk further away, which i had not looked at for obvious reasons, i took a quick look and the disk shaped object was moving away over the far tree line in the general direction of clinton,mo. much the speed as a helicopter would. as i then looked back and up at the orb it was still at a 45 degree angle and all at once, like the starship enterprise of tv fame, it left in the only way i can see and think it! (in warp drive) to infinity and beyond! a blue lazer like tail, with the orb at the front, which move so quickly, that the tail was taken along with it and it looked to take its place in the stars of the universe and become a star! that is the only way i can describe how fast it moved and how long i saw it.\r\n\r\nafter watching and going thru all of this, what seemed to be an afterthought was that next to that 2nd tree line to my right was a parked, datson like truck with a camper shell on it. i never noticed this before or fully forgot about it as the night sky was filled with these happenings! i was hoping someone was there in that area with me and had maybe viewed the same things i had. i was truly hoping that i wasn't by myself out there as i had this feeling after the bright neon green light filled the night sky, something had landed. how far away, i had no idea! maybe someone was sleeping in the truck, in the back of the bed. i told myself to stay calm and go to the truck and look around, and if i saw them in the cab, as i had a small mini-mag light, to light my way to them to show i was there. but what if there was no one there? i eased up to the cab, covered the light just enough to look inside, and saw blaze orange apparel and a hunting rifle. could this person have gone into town with friends? was he sleeping in the back? i took a chance hoping i wouldn't be thought of as someone out to rob them or do some other mischeif, and called out quietly to ask if any one was in the truck! a 2nd time, no response. damn my luck! it was then that i knew i wasn't myself. i did not have control of my emotions. i knew what i had to say, and as i used the light to tap on the bed of the truck, i heard someone stir. then a man asked me what i wanted? i at first, tried to tell him that i wasn't drinking, nor smoking weed, but there was something happening out here in the sky, and i would like him to look with me, to prove to myself that it had happened as i saw it, if it was to keep on happening. i could not talk straight to him. my words came jumbled and run together out of my mouth, i was shaking like a leaf! it was fear! never had i ever experianced that kind of emotion! i can still think of that moment and relive those thoughts today. albeit with less intensity. the man came out, i cannot remember his name, and talked with me, and we watched the sky for over an hour, but the lights were gone. it took that long and possibly longer talking with him, to feel myself actually touch the ground again. i know not his name, nor ever saw him again, but will always be thankful he was there to calm me down. he mentioned he flew back in the 50's and/or 60's and he and his co-pilot would see things as ufo's, but not go thru the trouble of reporting as it would cause them problems with the airline they flew for. and that is the end of my story. i hope it will be usefull to others, and the only thing i would like to see is for someone to put on video what i saw and let others see and/or relive what i or they might have seen also!   \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

blinking with out a pattern. there was one solid red light on the craft and you could tell it was rotating around the craft. the other light colors were white and blue. this rotating craft was chasing

east on lpga to our next stop. it was a clear night out, full moon, stars brightly shining. as we were driving, i have a habit of looking at the stars or the moon, and this time, i looked out to my right, and i seen something i had never seen before in the 20 years i have lived here in daytona beach. to my right, about a quarter mile or so away, hovering over the tree tops, i would estimate about 100-150 foot off the ground, was this large triangle shaped ufo with white lights coming from the 3 corners,(1 on each corner). and in the middle of the ufo was a white/red strobing light, like a conventional airplane would have on its wing tips for safety. i was sitting there thinking as we were driving down the road \"what the hell is that???\". so as we were approaching our next stop, i kept my eyes on the ufo, to see which way it was heading, and it appeared to be heading west south west away from us, as we were driving east. so i kept my eyes on it until i could see it no more, and i noticed on the back of the ufo, what appeared to be 3 blue ion pulse drives. only reason i am calling them blue ion pulse drives is because of how they were setup on the back of the ufo, or what i assume was the back of the ufo. they were 3 seperated engines, each glowing blue, evenly layed out across the back. \r\n\r\nwhen i first seen it, i knew it was no airplane, because the local airport is not opened at this time of the night to commercial airplanes, and student pilots do not usually fly that far away from the airport for night training. \r\n\r\nnot sure why i looked that far right that night, but i did, and i was very surprised by what i saw. i wish i would see it again so i can get some video or a picture of it. \r\n\r\ni am unsure if the person i was with seen it or not, but i know what i saw, and i have made a rough sketch on our delivery paperwork. i find there is no way this to have been a light glare or reflection of any kind, because i rolled my window down when i seen the ufo, and it was still there when my window was rolled down...\r\n\r\ni have attached a map, to give you better idea of where i was compared to the ufo. locations on it are approx and to the
