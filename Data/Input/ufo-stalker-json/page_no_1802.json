approximately 8:35 - 8:37 pm on 8/21/11. in glancing up to the north/east, two unusual objects were clearly visible resting in the night sky. each object was about a half a hand outstretched and a hand apart. the formation on the left had two large white lights - which looked almost like a car headlights to an invisible car. the object to the right looked something like the pleiades but upon standing stationary and staring, there were white dots of lights grouped in a boomerang shape. both objects seemed to have a shape blending with the dark night sky to which the lights were attached. the two-light object on the left had brighter lights than the one on the right. the lights were white or whitish blue. the lights did not blink. the objects made no detectible sound. both objects appeared to be still but upon closer observation were moving in tandem off to the north/east. while trying to follow the trajectory of the objects on bike and upon crossing the intersection, the objects were suddenly no longer visible. if the objects were aircraft they would have still been quite visible from a farther distance but it appears as though they vanished from the night sky. there was a lot of air traffic during this evening but these objects looked absolutely nothing like air traffic and appeared quite large. no air traffic appeared to be nearby these

according to the beings. what is the point are the messages i received.  these being come to me when i���m in bed but i feel them all the time and can get messages from anytime almost.\r\n\r\ni have come across three beings at different times, there is this guy with white curly clean looking shiny long hair, he has bigger eyes than us, but the pupils are grey with white on outside. he wears a white cap, his uniform is also white with gold trimming on the shoulders chest and neck and by the ribs. he has some kind of marking on his forehead, but it has a light on t so i can really see it, he has a staff that looks like wood he stick it out towards me i can see he has a ring on is finger its silver with a grey sphere, he also has what looks like a white arm strap or arm band, this arm band has silver sphere���s or small domes on in going around it. he is very strong i can see his arm muscles. he also has a glow or light behind him.  he tells me basically to worry about my soul, to work as much as i can on my soul, to be as nice and kind and helpful as i can be, to change better. he tells me not to worry about worldly things he says it���s just a distraction from my goals. i have to stay focused. to be as pure as i can be. to talk and reach out to all who will listen.\r\n\r\nthe second man i encounter is a younger man. he has long brown curly shiny hair clean looking. he also has a light behind him and on his forehead, he also carries a wooden staff, he is not as big muscle wise as the white man. he has a grey uniform on with gold trimming on the shoulders chest and neck and by the ribs.  he was tall. he had brown eyes. he also has a cap. this man talks more open with me, he just gives me ideas or suggestions or thoughts he is not as firm as the white man. he just gives suggestion or thought and ideas.\r\n\r\nthe third being i encountered was a female. she had long blond shiny hair. it was not curly, it was straight she too had light behind her and on her forehead. she also was wearing a cap. her uniform and cap was a tan color with gold trimming on the shoulders chest and neck and by the ribs.  she also had a wooden staff. she had blues eyes. she was tall. she seems to be a messenger or maybe a transporter? or to get info from one being and give it to another, so it seems.  when she approached me she had her staff out then dropped her head. she then lifted her head and with both arms to stuck her staff out to me with both arms horizontally as is bushing towards me. she then dropped it a little but, then suddenly push it into the air and began to spin her staff around really fast t to the point where i almost didn���t see it, when she was done what looks like a star map or a galaxy appeared above her, i could see the map i don���t know much about stars or maps or anything like that but i remember it somehow,  she then pointed to a place on the map then to another with a few second pause she pointed back to her original place.  \r\n\r\ni have a picture of what i think it���s the ���star map��� i saw i based this on this because when she pointed the first place she pointed to was almost on the outside of the  star map and the second place she pointed to was almost  but not in the middle of the map.

car. i observed a bright yellow \"star\" which i soon realized was changing in orientation to the surrounding stars. my entire family in aviation, i naturally attempted to identify the make of aircraft i assumed it would be. while nearing us i began to notice various neon spectrum colors emanating in sequence from the craft that didn't seem to coincide with and commercial airliner lights i had seen to date. very rapidly the craft approached and descended to a very low altitude, roughly 60 feet, just above the tree tops lining the highway. the craft, whose primary hull was ovalian, with a structure resembling and iron cross cross section through the axis of the vehicle. one of the squared edges of the cross section was wider than the other three with 4 small yet intense yellow lights running parallel to it's edge. each of the other three squared sections had a large intense yellow light. there was a row of 8 multicolored lights flashing along the central axis of the cross section, each light would flash a different color nearly every time it illuminate, it did this in constant and rapid succession. the wider section appeared to be the rear at first, but as it approached us and descended  just about the trees it halted and reversed course almost instantaneously. we immediately pull off the highway at the cowpens exit and stopped at a closed fireworks shop just off the highway and walked out into the adjacent field. the craft slowly moved over us the shot at a dramatic angle towards the mountains and again halted. it was then approached by an identical craft. both flashed their sequential lights under theirs frames directly towards each other then both simultaneously made 3-4 clockwise rotations around each other then broke away from one another. these first 2 craft traveled silently in opposing directions with dramatic right angle movements towards 2 additional craft which had just appeared from behind the mountains. the first 2 repeated the \"communication dance\" with the 2 new craft. the 4 then began to rapidly comb the area silently covering great distances with erratic and jerky movements. one of the came back over to our area of the field and flew directly over us, lowering as it approached the ascending after passing us. this time it did not move in a straight line but side to side as it moved forward as if traveling on some sort of wave form. moments later they re congregated briefly the shot off in 4 different directions all disappearing quickly and silently.

my neighbors house. at that point it stopped and proceeded to move across the sky with the rest of the stars. two hours and fifteen minutes later a second object appeared where i originally saw the first one. it was fainter and more green and blue than red like the first one. it followed the exact trajectory as the first one, and stopped exactly in the same place. by this time the first one had moved some distance with the stars but both were still visible. i observed them through binoculars and the lights were plainly visible pulsing in reds greens yellows and blues. i kept watching them fascinated, and sometime later moving lights appeared near the first one. they moved like satellites, but two of them disappeared after a very short distance. one light appeared by the second one later, appearing and disappearing 3 times. i have gone out every night since and witnessed the same phenomenon every night, and seen as many as three at one time (one in straight line flight). oddly,

 upon reaching the village/city limits i noticed something slowly moving overhead at a creeping rate of speed.  once it was over the north end of town, i had to stop the car because i was struck in awe at the immense size of the craft.  could clearly see the underneath side of it from the street lights of town.  \r\nit looked like it had low rectangular protrusions with antennas on the underneath surface of it.  shadowing outline of the top of the craft made it appear to be hat shaped, but it was clear to see from the underneath side that it was an obtuse triangle in shape, with the long point going forward.  i thought i had better flash my headlights on the car at it in hopes that it would recognize me as friendly.  there were two lights to each side of it, port & starboard, that identically repeated my signaling back.  then it slowly geared up from its hovering position and was gone in less than 5 seconds.  i guessed it to be at least 300yards wide at the rear of the craft(which was facing me) and 500 yards long.  for something as big as this was, i was utterly amazed how smoothly and how fast it took off without one bit of sound.  what i thought took place in about 10 minutes, was actually about 30 minutes.  what really gave me the creeps was that i was not even 200 feet away from a farmers place, nobody appeared to be home, no other traffic came up or passed by. the only living beings that saw anything were peoples dogs in and around town, barking like crazy.  oddly enough, i was at the local cafe the next morning having breakfast and overheard an old man complaining about the dogs raising hell the night before.  nobody ever mentioned seeing what i saw, and i figured people would think i was crazy if i had said anything about it.  tried to tell a good friend about it and she just spoofed at me by telling me i was stoned...  i will tell you right now, i did not smoke anything or drink anything or take anything that would have impaired my senses ability to function properly.  needless to say, the sighting amazingly scared me into the love of jesus...  i didn't scared easily before the incident.

from the west approach, we noticed a large star in the western sky of rochester, ny, just after sunset, too large and low for a real star - realized it was actually moving.  it seemed to oscillate and wobble. 3 people walking by stopped to witness this also.  we are near the airport and aircraft traveled on their normal flight path (higher and away from the object)so it couldn't have been a star. \r\n     it shimmered shades of white/blue and a faint shade of red/pink.  we were not afraid but fascinated.  at that point we also noticed to the right of it, were 3 smaller star-like objects in the form of a triangle that were also \"wobbly.\"   i went home to get my camcorder but upon return, they all had faded at that point to tiny grey spots.\r\n     this is going on again right now as i type this with 2 other witnesses that were walking home from work at the hospital.  i just used binoculars and made out a large white glowing spherical shape but it was so bright and wobbling, hard to tell so i used our telescope (not state of the art).  it had the appearance of more than one glowing sphere either attached to one object or just clustered together. again it was moving and hard to focus but the triangle cluster of \"stars\" next to it appeared again but too dark to get a good picture.  \r\n     of note, this was an area where i had posted a sighting on the 4th of july with pictures of the original sighting of glowing spheres rapidly rising from the western horizon with approx 14 in all that flew above us and disappeared overhead.  the \"zoom in\" feature will show the \"x\"

the light reflection looked like its changing. so i\r\nstarted to wonder if it was a helicopter but very high up. as it turned,\r\nit got darker -- and suddenly it was gone. since i was driving, i\r\nreally couldn't scan the sky much to find it. i kind of smiled to\r\nmyself and thought that it was sort of like a ufo sighting.\r\n\r\nas i got closer to linnton, however, i saw the thing again! the experience was the similar only it took place over about 10 seconds\r\ninstead of 30 or so. it started out glimmering, then \"turned\", went\r\ndark, and was gone. at this point, i started to be curious. did i just lose track of it before? because i was driving slower this time, i was able to search the sky a bit. nothing.\r\n\r\ni got my first stop of the drive at kittridge and 30. i looked up again curious if i could spot it one more time. sure enough, i saw the thing a third time. i had better chance to watch it while the streetlight was red. there were clearly 3 lights and a y- or t-shaped frame that looks like a plane without its nose. so i thought that was pretty weird. all of a sudden, the lights on it go out one by one, briefly revealing a gray color. at first, it seemed like it has disappeared again. but i squinted and realized that i could it flying away se -- a little more east than i'm facing. it quickly faded away into the sky's haze. i' would say it was fast like a jet,\r\nbut the haze gave me the impression it was moving higher and faster\r\nthan jets i've seen. i eventually lost sight of it in the distance.\r\n\r\nand that's it! i'm still mildly spooked

5:15 am (obviously dark out)- my porch faces east and there are no lights viewable or civilization east of my home with the exception of one light tower (due west). at night when i have been on the

have never seen a plane this early in the morning...Then it stopped.  i questioned my sanity...Maybe i didn't just see it come towards my home...Maybe it was a star - so much brighter than any other in the sky this morning? it was early. but it stopped?  maybe i hadn't had enough coffee yet? i then picked up my binoculars, normally used for viewing cows/horses/armadillos & coyote's and viewed this object for almost an hour! i could only see the lights and a very faint outline of the top of something?  there were 5 lights, in almost a straight line....If you were to line them up 1,2,3,4 & 5 - 3 would be the brightest, biggest or almost like it was the \"point\" and mainly white.  was this because it was directly angled in my direction?  1,2 and 4,5 were a little smaller than 3 and looked as though they were slightly angled back from 3, but they were the same size.  the lights pulsated from blue to green to white to red (or maybe it was red to white), but #3 mainly stayed white.  the pulse was so very quick it was difficult to follow the sequence.  i was able to discern the different colors but they almost \"rainbowed or melded together\" in the process? i continued to watch for almost an hour, telling myself that i wasn't seeing what i was actually seeing...Putting the binoculars down...Another sip of coffee...Was it still there? - yes.  until...The sun was coming up, the stars were now gone, the \"lights\" were still faintly there....Then they went straight up into the sky... and gone?  i did not mention this to anyone until sunday morning...Trying to convince myself

sunday night, 7:00 p.M., jan. 07 1975.I had to drive a freind home to norfolk, and, my roommate and he rode with me. as we walked out to the car, we noticed up the hill was an unlikely white light with a red flashing light in the southern horizon.We were only one day out of a blizzard, and the winds were picking up to about 45 m.P.H. and some. we all noticed that the lights were hovering like a helicopter, but, we knew it was to windy for it to stay in one spot for so long. temperature was about 20 below with windchill.       we got into my brand new volkswagen scirrocco to warm up,and i turned my car towards the lights. as were watching through the windsheid as the car warmed up, i decided to flash my headlifghts at the craft. i flashed them twice, and, inbetween flashes a great white flash came from the craft and it dropped slowly behind the hill. at the moment it flashed at us my car totally quit running. it kind of startled me. i am an ase. certified mechanic, so i proceeded to check out my car, witch took ten minutes. by this time i was freezing, and, i told the other guys, lets go back in the house and warm up,and, talk about what we had just seen. i knew my car had lost spark from the ignition coil, but i didn't find any reason for that. after 15 minutes ore so, iwent out to crank my car, and without doing anything to fix it, it started right up. we all loaded up and proceeded to norfolk. we headed north from the farmhouse,when, all of a sudden the sky light up like lightning. less than one half mile down the road was aneighbors farmhouse. as we came to an intersection, we seen a green light,about the same color as a street light. it was inbetween the farmhouse and the barn (neighbors).It started out about the size of a softball, and then, it grew to approximately 25 feet wide. then it faded to black. it continued for about five minutes, as if, it were taking photographs of us(ground level). then it stopped until we went around the farmhouse and had to turn around,because snowdrifted road. we came back by, and it started glowing the green light again. this was very life altering for me. my witnesses cant help, because one passed away at age 38 in the 80's, and the other is either mentally fragile, or, the erased his memory {roomate}. i hope to here from you. i've tried for years to find someone to report this to.   p.S.  this ain't

(i've taken 20 hours of flight training, so i know a little about small planes, but i'm only a beginner.) i'd say it was as bright as the north star can be at times, perhaps a little brighter. the movements seemed too erratic and significant for either an airplane or helicopter. i scanned the sky and noted no other stars as bright, and in fact, based on the angle and city/town lights, there were only one or two stars easily visible from what i recall. they were an order of magnitude dimmer. i watched for about 30 seconds when i considered grabbing my wife's iphone 3gs off her night table as she slept. but the object was far enough away that the iphone's  camera (2 megapixel) would not have captured the movement, so i left the bedroom to find my digital slr downstairs in the kitchen. unfortunately, while i was in my bedroom, my daughter had woken up, walked to the top of the stairs leading down to the kitchen, laid down and fell back to sleep. i carried her back to her bed in the room next to ours and tucked her in. i retrieved my camera from downstairs and grabbed a more capable lens on the way. by the time i got back to the window, about 4-6 minutes later, the object was gone. in my mind, this ruled out the possibility of it being a star or other celestial body, but i'm no astronomer. i watched periodically for another 30 minutes, but did not see anything. i did some googling and searched twitter from any other recent sightings and noted a recent sighting in broad daylight in acton, ma. i also read about a correlation between disasters and ufo sightings. the aug. 23 quake in virgina was felt in massachusetts, so this came to mind. my wife had woken up and did a few things while i kept looking. i didn't want to frighten her, so i saved the story until daylight. in summary, it was very strange. i've never seen anything like it. i should have asked my wife for help so that i could keep my eyes on it.","distance":"Over One

terraced pasture from a wooded area where i had stopped. upon the highest terrace i observed an object that i thought to be some kind of airplane sitting stationary in the tall grass. as i approached the object, and before i was able to get within approximately 100 hundred feet, the object arose, hovered briefly then moved away from me.. slowly at first then when it had gotten maybe 500 yards away it just disappeared. i was unable to tell anyone exactly what shape it was, but best guess it was oval. also, it had what appeared to be windows, however all i remember seeing were probably just darker portions of the body of the craft. i remembering that i couldn't understand why i wasn't hearing any sound of an airplane. when i went up to the landing place all the tall grass was very flat and seemed to be swirled around in a circle. i remember riding my bike around inside that circle before i rode home to tell my dad and grandmother. and, later excitedly told my mom when she got home
