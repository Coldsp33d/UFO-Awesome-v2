from then on the next thing i remember was on the side of the road again. right after i realized what had happened still dazed n confused, tired, lost feeling. there was this cop who drove real slow right next to me and i asked him where a street was and he looked at me for a few minutes, he didn������t say a word just pointed and stared with this nasty look, blank see threw me look almost, i had lost 3 or 4 hours of time it was nearly 6 in morning when i got to my friend������s house. \r\n\r\n\r\n������ i remember the smells in the craft; they were like bleach, ammonia, or peroxide smell, the greys were at least 7 ft. or 8ft tall, long fingers, slips for mouths n smaller black eyes\r\n\r\n������ i was talking to them telepathic\r\n\r\n������ i use to have a crooked nose but since the alien stuck that small black tube up my nose it������s straight again\r\n\r\n������ i remember the colors of inside the craft white, purple, blue, \r\n\r\n������ i remember some of there tech, such as a thin about 7inch black tube, the thing i was standing against moves on its own and is capable at fast speed slamming down like a table or bed.\r\nthere are other accounts but this one stick outs in my head the most... please i need help in this matter ever since it has happened it has consumed my thinking completely and is all i can think about, it took me almost a year to go outside at night i was so petrified. since every night before i go to bed i just have to stair or forced to look up in the sky at nothing my eyes wide open with tears pouring down my face and my jaw wide open, i������ll be standing like that for at least 10 min if not longer. almost in a drown fashion. i am desperately looking for help and do not know where to look i am branching out to you in hopes you may be able to point me in right way in helping me on this matter i thank you very much for reading my email and you time thank you again.\r\nkevin\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),  Other","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":31151,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.8044821,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08252011-0006","longitude":-68.7695038,"occurred":1285830000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maine","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1314300180000,"summary":"I was abducted a few time, this abduction is the most clearest","tags":["abduction"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":329,"locationName":"Bangor, Maine","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:39906"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Willmar","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My girlfriend and i were loading our purchases into my vehicle in the parking lot of the willmar wal-mart at approximately 3:30 in the afternoon on wednesday, august 24th, 2011.  she spotted the object first and asked me what it was. we observed a craft that was a shiny chrome, cigar shape cruising slowly in a straight line, traveling from the east to the west. during this time, the sky was clear blue with no clouds in the immediate area. we could see that there were no wings or other structures on the craft. the only other detail was that there were 2 black colored circles on the bottom middle of the craft. i would look at the object, look away, then look at it again to make sure it was actually what it appeared to be. i did that a couple of times. i watched it maintain a slow straight path. at first, i was awestruck at how a craft that big with no wings could cruise that slowly. there was no sound coming from the craft as you would hear from a normal aircraft. as we were watching the craft, we kept asking each other if we were seeing the exact same thing. we were. then, as we were watching it, it just simply vanished. it did not zoom off anywhere, it just disappeared. afterwards, i was rather happy that i had seen the craft because i had seen 3 other ufo's within the last 10 years. this sighting yesterday, was the closest i have ever witnessed.

that caught her attention.  it was an extremely clear night and the sky was sparkling with stars.  there were two objects high in the sky that were glowing white, but clearly were not stars.  i got up to see the same objects that, i observed, to turn an orange-red.  they could be described as having lights like that of an airplane, but these objects were much too high to have been an airplane and if they were a jet we would have heard the noise as we frequently hear the jets from the air force base in spokane, washington.  these two objects hovered in a parallel position for a few minutes, long enough for me to also call my son in to look, as well.  he also observed the objects, but as he was watching them, the one to the left quickly took off to the north and literally disappeared in an instant.  my daughter stated that the other object shot off towards the west, back up over our house and out of view.  when we went to the front of the house there was nothing to be seen in the sky.\r\n\r\nin checking the internet we found that there have been several sightings in the north idaho area and nearby washington, spaced about a month apart.  most seemed to take place sometime between 9 and 10 pm.  also there were repeated sightings of the orange-red objects sometimes in a formation of five that head off towards the west. \r\n\r\ncoincidentally, we have an air force base to the west and a small naval facility to the north that they use for nuclear submarine research and testing.\r\n\r\nwe were all pretty excited about the prospects of what we were seeing, but the kids also were a little scared that whoever was in them might have known we were watching them or that someone from the government would find out and lock us up?!  of course, i hope none of this is a real worry.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

happened since i first reported incident.\r\n\r\nufo sighting 8/23/11 on august 23, 2011 at approximately 22:00 hours i stepped outside to have a cigarette. as i gazed at the sky i noticed a strange bright light, brighter than a star in the south southwest sky just under and to the left of the big dipper. it seemed as if it may have been 10 to 20 miles away. it had multicolored lights moving around the bright light horizontally while the bright white light was pulsating in a rhythmic fashion. the multicolored lights changed color almost as if the colors were smoothly changing from color to color like a prism or color wheel. this immediately got my attention. i continued to watch for 15 minutes and noticed that it did not move, at least not that i could perceive. i then went and got my wife whom saw it herself and made me aware that there were 2 additional lights pulsating in unison with the initial anomaly. the other 2 lights were smaller and only white with no other colors like the initial anomaly. all three formed a triangle. the other 2 were only visible for 10 ��� 15 minutes. we video'd what we saw but because of the lighting on the ground it seems as if we didnt get anything. when my wife and i confirmed at 22:30 hrs that it had not moved i called my friend who lives 20 miles away and in the direction of the object. while on the phone with my friend, i described the area of the sky it was in and he was able to locate it. we were very excited as this is a topic we are interested in and have been sky watchers for some time. the points that compelled our belief that it was a ufo were as follows: 1. they did not move. 2. no conventional aircraft has lights that are blue, green, red, yellow, etc. & 3. it seemed way too high of an altitude to be a helicopter. i then went inside the house and ended the phone call with an understanding that he would continue to watch it and call me if he saw any changes. at about 23:30 i took the dog out and noticed it was gone. i scanned the sky and noticed it was now resting in another area of the sky. if it were originally at 7 o���clock it was now at 11 o���clock and not moving. i observed for 10 ��� 15 minutes. this is where it gets strange. i consciously focused on the object and asked a series of questions in my mind. ���what are you?���, ���what are your intentions?���, ���where did you come from?���, ���i want to know���. immediately, my son came running out the front door in a panic. he told me when he came down stairs for a drink he saw a white hooded figure out of the corner of his eye. he said it looked like a white towel floating in the air and it moved. he said when he turned to look at it, it vanished. he was visibly shaken. i listened to his description then comforted him and tucked him in bed. bear in mind my wife was sleeping at this point. i played around on the internet and went to bed at about 1 am. the next morning my wife tells me she came downstairs in the middle of the night and saw a hooded white figure with no face in the same spot in the office as my son had seen. they had not spoken of this to each other. the difference was that she saw it facing her with just a black area where a face should be. she was visibly shaken and had goose bumps as she recounted her experience. she said that although it was very real and bizarre, she felt at peace and it did not scare her. we did not talk about this around our son as he is too young for these things. the possibility of one of them contaminating the other���s memory was very small as i made every attempt to control my personal investigation of the white figure. i had them go into separate rooms and draw what they had seen. they drew very similar pictures. the figure had human shape and only visible from the waist area up. it stood approximately 6��� tall. it moved when my son saw it. it seemingly looked at my wife. obviously this incident shook us up a bit. i don���t know what the significance of it is is but i do know they are related. we have never, in 7 years in this house, seen anything out of the ordinary. we are sane people. we are confused.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path then

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My now ex-wife and i were parked in the parking lot of the old triple s motel (now gone) on the beach at atlantic beach, nc.  it was a sunday afternoon, very cold, but sunny.  there was no one on the beach, and the parking lot was empty except for us. we were facing south. the triple s fishing pier (now gone) was to the east of us about 50 meters.  nobody was on the pier; i think it was closed for the season.  the sea was very calm, with only a slight ripple on the surface and about a six-inch lop of wave at about 4-5 minute intervals on the beach.  \r\n\r\noff to my right (west) at a distance of about 1/2 to 3/4 mile, i noticed a large dark spot under the surface of the ocean.  i did not pay a lot of attention to it at first; my wife and i were just enjoying the afternoon and talking about family things.  \r\n\r\nthe object was about 500 meters offshore, moving in toward the pier very slowly, at an angle.  at first i thought it might be a school of menhaden, but it appeared to move in a straight line.  it also maintained its shape, which was sort of an oval, big at the front and tapering to a very narrow tail.  i called it to the attention of my wife, and she remarked that it did not seem to change shape the way a school of fish would.\r\n\r\nthe object kept moving in from offshore at what i judge to be about a 30-degree angle, moving in from the southwest.  when i first saw it, i estimate the water depth where it was, was approximately 35-40 feet.  it kept moving in until it was almost directly in front of us, in approximately 25 feet of water, and about 50 meters west of the pier.  then it stopped.  \r\n\r\nduring the time we had been observing it (about 20 minutes) the object had not changed shape and had moved in straight lines like it was being steered.  it did not undulate or change direction the way a school of fish will do.  when it stopped, it did not change shape.  \r\n\r\nafter a few minutes it turned to its left (toward the beach) and then back to the right, then back to the left, like it was scanning the bottom.  it then moved forward, in toward the beach on the same course as before, stopped, backed up a bit, and turned to where it was facing almost due east.  at this point it was facing the main part of the pier but was inshore of the seaward end of the pier.  at no time during all these maneuvers did my wife or i see any disturbance on the surface of the water, a fact on which we both remarked at the time.\r\n\r\nthe object paused where it was for a few minutes, then \"sniffed\" its way around to where it was pointed approximately southeast, and began moving forward.  it accelerated from dead stop to what i judge to be about 35-40 miles per hour in roughly 4 seconds, and then (for lack of a better definition) appeared to hit warp speed.  it simply shot out of sight.  at no time did my wife or i observe any disturbance on the surface of the water.\r\n\r\na few months later i related these events to my father, who was a retired rear admiral in the us navy, and asked him if he could \"check it out\" with his navy contacts.  several months after that, i asked him if he had found anything out about it.  his response was, \"that is something you don't want to ask any more questions about.  ever.\"  and that was the last we ever spoke of it.  my dad died in 1999.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with

love. fishing.\r\nwe were about 45-50 miles from idaho falls,id. and we had planned to camp  and fish all week.\r\nin the early morning of august 2nd, i was awakened by my brother. he was shaking me and telling me to come outside. there was something i had to see. my brother was the type of person who very seldom got excited, so i knew it had to be something of importance. as i exited the tent, my brother was pointing across the small bay we were camped on.There, across the bay, was the strangest object that i had ever seen.\r\n\r\nthe bay we were camped on was about 50 yards wide and app. thirty yards beyond that was a fuzzy, silvery, object, hovering about five feet above the ground. it appeared to be completely stationary, except for a slight wobble from side to side. about ten feet in in front of the object, on the ground, was what appeared to be a much smaller object which gave me the impression that it was moving, though i really don't remember seeing it move.\r\n i wanted to get my binoculars and get a better look and they were in the truck. i slowly made my way to the truck, hoping to get a better look.As i opened the door of the truck the dome light came on, and the object across the bay, suddenly \"turned off.\" and then became very bright, and started moving slowly in our direction. my cousin had joined us, though i don't remember when. \r\nas the object slowly \"drifted\" towards us, i crawled under the truck. my brother and cousin dashed for the truck and the three of us crawled underneath it. although it was partially obscured, because we were under the truck, we could see the object coming our way.I remember glancing in the direction i first saw the object and the smaller object was no longer there. i was never so scared in my life. in about 2 minutes or so, the object passed directly overhead. i could feel it more than see it, because it didn't cast a reflection of light; i could feel the hair on my head and arms start to tingle, and then stand straight up, but i thought it was because i really was that scared. as soon as it passed over the truck the object went straight up and in about ten seconds or less it was gone.\r\nmy brother and cousin later told me, they felt the same sensations as i.\r\nwe decided to cut our camping trip short and head for home.We haphazardly broke camp and headed for home. \r\nwe told no-one about that night, how do you tell someone, specially when you're a teen-ager, that you were so scared that you wet your pants? so, we told no-one. my brother and cousin are both gone now,my brother killed in an auto accident and my cousin committed suicide and i am 72 and the last living witness.\r\nfrom what i have been told by more than 1 person, that is a very active area for ufo's \r\nthis area, though not far from civilization, is very secluded and the nearest house is about 20 miles away. it's a wild area, but accessible by dirt road.","distance":"101-500

home. i nearly went straight through my glass sliding door trying to get my video camera. i taped these events for around 2 hours, as they would not let up. the footage is so dark you can't even see anything. at exactly 11:50, opposite the events i was watching, the brightest meteor i have ever seen illuminated then fizzled out in to sparks. that put the shakes on me. i don't how i removed my

tell me these were birds in the moon light or something. i have been studying and looking at ufo footage for years and i have never seen objects move like this before in my life. they darted so fast

adult woman who has an open mind about the world around me with a heavy dose of skepticism.\r\n\r\nit was 9:30 at night, aug 23, 2011, my son and i were reading books in my bedroom.  my husband left to take our dog for a walk.  he returned after a couple of minutes stating that he had just witnessed a ufo.  knowing my husband, i knew he meant that he saw something he couldn't explain.  i listened to his account and then told him to go back outside with my son and see if they would see it again.  i joined them after a couple of minutes on our back deck.  my husband pointed out over toward the power lines in the field behind our house saying that was where he saw the lights.\r\ni stood with them for just a minute watching the sky when i saw a light appear.  it was white then turned into a bright green light.  it was stationary and had just \"switched on\" in the sky.  i asked my husband, \"is that it?\".  \"yes\", he said and as he said that, the light went out and reappeared to the left of where it had been.  it disappeared again, reappearing four more times in a clockwise arc pattern in the night sky.  \r\nas i watched it appear, disappear (always a bright green light), i tried to make sense of what i was seeing.  it behaved like a rc airplane as it arced and darted.  the color of the light looked like a laser color, but i couldn't see any clouds or smoke that would show a laser.  i saw stars in the sky.\r\nmy son said he saw it darting back and forth and he could see small bits of electricity shooting from behind it.  its \"movement\" was only assumed because the light would turn off and reappear somewhere else again and again in a darting pattern.  at one point it looked as if the light stretched out, again like a laser lighting a wire (my mind was thinking one of the power lines was being illuminated by a laser light).  the whole experience lasted only 20 seconds or so.  we didn't hear any sound.  no engines or motors, no people out in the field.\r\ni then got my phone and started to record.  even though the video is dark and nothing was seen after that, our first recount and discussion of what we saw was captured on the video. \r\nmy husband's account has

make a good picture, lizards etc... anyways. i noticed a blackhawk helicopter flying overhead and took 5 pictures of it as it passed over. this was back in the spring. around may i'm guessing maybe early june. well yesterday i transfered the pictures from the memory card to the computer, and as i was looking through them i noticed a white spherical or egg shaped object that appears to be at a higher altitude than the helicopter. about the 10 o`clock position as you are looking at the photo of the helicopter. well in the next photo there is a black cigar shaped object that appears to be almost directly in front of the helicopters flightpath and at about the same altitude maybe a mile out in front of the blackhawk helicopter, but the white sphere is not in this photograph. the other pictures of the helicopter show nothing. but in these 2 pictures there is definitly something physical in the sky along with the helicopter. i did not notice them at the time i took the photos.I have attached the two photos. you be the judge. pictures have not been altered in any way. not enlarged, cropped. zoom in on the objects in the pictures... its grainy when zoomed all the way in but it will give you a better view and shapes of the objects. \r\n\r\ni would like to add that approximaty within 2 weeks before or after this event i was standing in just about the exact same spot gazing at the sky and noticed a greyish/white sphere, then another, then another.... once my eyes were trained on that position of the sky i started noticing a lot of these objects. probably at least 10 and they were all flying in a westerly direction in a very loose formation at very high altitude,all of them had about the same flight path. a few of the objects were \"wandering\" within the formation though and i saw sunlight reflecting off of a couple of them, but it wasnt a bright glint, was more of a dull greyish reflection. i tried getting pics of those but i couldnt get the camera to autofocus on them and by the time i switched it to manual and pointed the camera skyward they were gone. i'm beginning to think that our skies are filled with things like this but they are very hard to notice if you arent looking directly at them. anyways thats it....

then suddenly he said, \"there it is again!\" shortly followed by, \"now the trees are in the way!\" i turned to look and see what he was freaking out about and just seconds later we passed a break in the trees and there were four bright, circular lights almost in the formation of a boomerang. they were just hovering above the trees. the lights were almost a white-yellow color. nothing like the lights on your typical airplane, they were much brighter and a different color. my mom told us they were probably just jets or helicopters, so she rolled down the windows, but we heard nothing but the wind.\r\n\r\nas quickly as we saw the lights, the trees were in the way again. my brother and i convinced my mom to turn left at the light near o' brady's in dollars corner, so maybe we could get a glimpse of the lights again. when we turned, there were only two lights visible. then just seconds later there was only one. when we turned back to head east again, my brother and i watched out the back window only to see the last light completely vanish. when the lights disappeared, we couldn't see anything visibly leaving, the lights were just simply gone.\r\n\r\nwhen my mom and i were driving home, heading west on battle ground highway, i kept my eye on the trees the whole time to make sure we hadn't just seen some sort of street lights or something, but there was no sign of the lights.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":31125,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.7809491,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08242011-0003","longitude":-122.5334307,"occurred":1314159600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang,

being driven home in the squadron van, which was heading west on i-94 just west of jamestown, nd.  the object was seen by 4 of the 5 civil air patrol members in the van just east of exit 248, a bright glowing object with bright \"vapor trail\".  both the object and the trail were bright blue green in color.  \r\nthe object's apparent size was that of a softball, with an apparent velocity roughly equal to or slightly greater than the vehicle, which was moving at freeway speed (75 mph).  the flight path was roughtly 10 degrees descending, i.E., not quite horizontal, and appeared parallel with the interstate, east to west.  after being observed for 20-30 seconds, the object disappeared with a flash, reportedly making a couple of \"popping\" sounds which were audible in the vehicle while driving.  the intensity of the light was such that the inside of the van was lit, described as similar to the light of an arc welder.\r\nthe sky at the time was dark, and relatively clear with no moon and no opposing traffic to interfere with observation.\r\nthis is not a first-person account; i am compiling this account from the descriptions given by the people in the van. i am the squadron commander, but was not at the meeting; my wife, the deputy commander for cadets, was driving. based on the descriptions, i asked if this object could have been a meteor, but most felt that it looked more like a man-made object, burning with the color of magnesium on fire.  we have speculated on the possibility of a satellite reentry, but the flight angle is not conducive to that conclusion.  also, the trail apparently did not contain debris as would be expected.\r\nreports have been made to the local sherriff's office.\r\n\r\nthank you,\r\n\r\njohn nyberg\r\ncaptain

object in front of the constellation cassiopeia about 30 degrees up in the sky.  initially, i thought it might be the green light of an airplane wing but immediately realized that it was very different than that.  it was not a point source of light like a bulb but rather a rectangular sheet of bright green color light that appeared to shift or flicker in patterns across the object from left to right.  there was no blinking--the light was bright and constant (though a changing pattern).  the object moved quickly to one side (maybe 2 degrees) and back and forth and then disappeared.  about 20 seconds later, it reappeared and then starting moving across a larger arc in the sky (maybe 5 degrees) faster than any aircraft could.  the green light moved the other direction across the object (almost a short ribbon shape) and then it disappeared.\r\n\r\nthe anomaly was obviously not a plane (they can't move this fast) and the green color was brighter than the green used by planes.  it wasn't a meteor shower because the light was in the shape of a wide rectangular shape.  there was no moon and the sky was completely cloudless.  the object was not fireworks nor did it appear to be laser light reflected on some surface.\r\n\r\ni ran upstairs and told my wife and son so we all went back onto the deck and moments later, the light/object appeared again (all three of us saw it).  this time, it moved extremely fast about 10 degrees from right to left (again with a pattern flowing across it), disappeared for a split second, and then reappeared heading fast in the other direction so one could \"fill in the blanks\" to see that it had just turned in a tight counterclockwise arc.  the object disappeared for about 10 seconds and then reappeared much farther to the right above, to the right, and far beyond an electrical tower behind our house.  it was quite bright and then disappeared altogether and didn't return.  it remained at approximately the same altitude for all of the sightings.\r\n\r\ni am a scientist and extremely skeptical person by nature.  i don't believe in aliens, deities, miracles, ghosts, or any other supernatural or other phenomena.  after much reflection, i cannot explain what this was.  this is the first and only ufo i have ever encountered.","distance":"Over One
