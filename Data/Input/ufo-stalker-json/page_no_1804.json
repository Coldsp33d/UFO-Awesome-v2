leash and harness on her i noticed that she was far more excitable than is normal for her.  as i walked outside on my back stairs, it sounded as if all dogs in the neighborhood were yelping and howling at the same time.  i looked up, and out in front of me, moving over several houses and trees was a jumble of extremely bright, white lights, which appears to be flashing in a sequence.  the lights were approximately 500-600 feet above ground and moving in a straight flight path away from my house (difficult to determine exact altitude, as the object/lights was above and moving away from me).  as they passed over a far tree line, the lights/object banked to the left and then to the right, revealing what appeared to be a disc shape to the object to which they were presumably attached (based on the alignment of the lights; i could see the same lights curving around each side towards the front of the object as it banked in each direction).  as the object banked, i could not see a solid shape per se, but the space between the lights was solid black.  the object cleared the tree line and disappeared from my sight.  the object made no apparent noise.\r\n\r\ni live under several approach/take-off routes to boston's logan airport, so i am used to seeing several airplanes per night on my walks with my dog.  this did not appear to be within one of those normal flight paths, nor did the lights appear to be aircraft warning lights, as all were very bright white and flashed in sequence around the object.  further, the banking maneuvers to both the left and then the right did not appear to be typical of fixed wing aircraft that i normally observe.\r\n\r\nwhen the object passed from sight, the dogs in the area ceased barking/yelping and my own dog calmed down.  i did not see the object again that night.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

something. the lights scanned the desert floor in random patterns. i slowed to about 10 mph to look for the vehicle that might have brought the persons out to the desert. no vehicle in sight. nothing.

lights. there was no origin of the lights. no people, no flashlights. just the circle of lights on the ground. this happened again about 5 min further down the road. this time the lights were light small led bulbs lit on the desert floor. about 20 yards off the highway. all clustered together in a random pattern. about 10-12 small lights, glowing about 6\" off the ground. i stopped my vehicle

work in mill creek township up from the mall area.\r\n\r\ni was alone, and decided to head on over to an area most of us 3rd shifters go for our breaks. it's near the building etc. anyhow, i kept my

myself that it would probably be too dangerous for one of these usual aircrafts to be flying so close in between these two radio/tv towers like that.\r\n\r\nthis light stayed consistent for a couple more seconds then began to dim down and change to a blueish/white kind of light before going back to a very bright constant type of light. another thing i thought was odd was the fact that this

completely disappear from the night sky.\r\n\r\ni continued to stay there for another ten minutes or so scanning the night sky in that direction to see if this object/light would re-appear closer to

located at 6200 big mount road in the dover township of pennsylvania ��� 17315.  during the week that we spent at the campground, (monday, 08/15/2011 through monday, 08/22/2011), on four separate occasions mysterious items/vehicles were seen to be flying through the sky, over the campground, during the early evening hours, just after dusk.\r\nthese items were observed to be dark in color, ���possibly��� triangular shaped with what appeared to be flames being emitted from the bottom of same.  these flames were not stationary as lights would be, but appeared to flicker, just as the exhaust of a rocket would.  these flames were bright orange in color and are what caught the eye first.  these strange occurrences were observed by ourselves and another couple with whom we were camping.  on the first occasion there were several other campers in the area, who also observed these strange vehicles/craft and commented that et had arrived.  i cannot provide any additional information on these other campers, with the exception of the couple that we were with.  on each of these occasions the strange vehicles were observed be flying slowly at approximately the altitude that a small plane would be at, but appeared to be moving slower than a small plane would fly.  the unknown vehicles/craft did not make any discernible noises, but moved silently across the sky.  during each of the sightings, none of the mysterious craft/vehicles was observed to make any sudden or erratic movements. \r\nduring each occurrence the strange vehicles/craft appeared in the eastern sky without warning and without making any obvious noise or sudden movements.  the following is what was observed by this writer and three others;\r\n\r\n���\tmonday, 08/15/2011 ��� initial observation of the above described vehicle/craft.  two craft were observed.  at approximately 8:40 pm, a single mysterious craft appeared over the tree line, out of the eastern sky and preceded in a westerly direction, when almost over our position on the ground, the craft turned in a southerly direction.  while watching this craft for approximately 1.5 to 2.0 minutes as it was moving away from us, a second unknown craft was observed to come from approximately the same spot in the sky as the first and followed basically the same route as the first in a southerly direction.  both of the unknown craft were observed to simply dissolve or disappear while moving away from the campground.  they did not put on any burst of speed, but simply disappeared at what could have been about ��� to ��� mile away from where we were standing.  this sighting was totally unexpected as we were not expecting anything like this to occur.  we were just sitting outdoors and playing cards at the site picnic table.\r\n���\ttuesday, 08/16/2011 ��� nothing suspicious observed as we were not available to be looking at the sky or expecting a recurrence of the prior evenings sighting.\r\n���\twednesday, 08/17/2011 ��� second sighting of the same type of the above described mysterious vehicle/craft.  two craft were observed this date at approximately 8:45 pm.  the first mysterious craft was observed to be approaching the campground from the eastern sky, in a westerly direction.  this craft was moving silently and smoothly just as the craft of the monday night sightings.  this first craft veered off in a northerly direction and was still in sight when a second craft was observed to materialize from approximately the same area of the sky as the first and then followed the same route that the first vehicle/craft had taken.  in approximately 1 to 2 minutes both of the craft disappeared.  again this appeared to occur without any increase in speed and the point of disappearance was approximately ��� to ��� of a mile distant.  again the four of us were playing cards and not expecting to see anything unusual.\r\n���\tthursday, 08/18/2011 ��� third sighting of the mysterious, above described vehicle/craft at approximately 8:45 pm.  as described above the mysterious craft appeared in the eastern sky, heading in a westerly direction, moving at the same pace and noiselessly as on prior occasions.  the craft turned in a northerly direction and maintained a steady pace until it disappeared in approximately the same position as the previous evening.  there was only one craft observed on this date.  due to the two previous sightings we were looking for a reaccurrence of the sighting.\r\n���\tfriday, 08/19/2011 ��� nothing observed, however, it was well past 9:00 pm by the time we remembered to look for any strange occurrences in the sky.\r\n���\tsaturday, 08/20/2011 ��� fourth sighting of the mysterious, above described vehicle/craft at approximately 8:30 pm.  as previously described the first unknown craft appeared, heading in a westerly direction from out of the eastern sky.  this vehicle/craft turned in a northerly direction and was followed in about one minute by a second vehicle, materializing out of approximately the same position in the eastern sky and followed the route of the 1st craft.  within another minute the 2nd vehicle/craft was followed by a 3rd vehicle/craft which appeared in approximately the same position as the first two, followed the same route and all three vehicles/craft disappeared within approximately three minutes, without any apparent increase in speed.  again we were sitting outdoors, playing cards and not really expecting to see anything.\r\n���\tsunday, 08/21/2011 ��� nothing unusual was observed this date.  we sat outdoors from approximately 8:15 pm through 10:00 pm seeking suspicious occurrences, however, without seeing anything suspicious or unusual.\r\n\r\nit should be noted that during the times of these observations there were quite a few airliners and small planes observed in the area.  engine noises were evident from these normal planes; however, except for the change in course from the first night nothing about the description or actions of the mysterious vehicles/craft deviated in any way, with the exception of the numbers observed daily.  daily, these mysterious vehicles/craft were very distinctive as due to the flames under the craft, they glowed orange and almost appeared to be on fire, except there was no apparent emergency.  these vehicles/craft were distinctly different from the normal airplanes observed.  you will notice that all four of the occurrences described above happened between 8:30 and 9:00 pm nightly, just about when darkness was falling and making it difficult to obtain a really good view of the mysterious craft(s).  the only viewing devices on hand was a pair of 7x35 binoculars which did not provide a good view of these craft.\r\non saturday, 08/20/2011, i contacted john ventre, director for pennsylvania chapter of mufon, (before the saturday sightings), and he requested that i submit this report and advise what we had seen.  i had contacted him in order to determine if anyone else had reported seeing anything similar to what we had seen and he advised that he was not totally up to date on the reports, as he had been out of town for several days.  i had advised john ventre that while we were camping internet access was unavailable and that i would file a sighting report this date after arriving at home and having access to the internet.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

tennessee to see a friend.  i had decided to stay the night because we would be going shopping and golfing the next day.  at 10:05 pm that evening my friend went out to his car to grab a few items so i decided to go out and have a cigarette while he was outside.  the moon was fairly low and bright so i looked up at the sky to stargaze for a bit.  when i looked to my right (nw direction) i saw a very bright white star-like light that was moving very slowly across the sky directly towards me.  i told my friend to take a look and he said he thought it was a plane.  i told him i didn't think so, because it appeared to be flying very low and almost too slow to be an airplane.  the light was nearly as bright as the moon and was steadily burning, with no pulses or flashing of any kind.  the object continued to move towards us and passed almost directly over our position and continued past in at a southeast heading.  there was no sound that i could hear before or after the object passed over us.  after passing overhead i noticed a plane flying at an intersecting angle toward the object, and after their paths crossed, the plane began to turn back toward the object.  two more planes appeared in my peripheral vision, following the path of the object and traveling at a much faster speed, as if they were trying to catch up to it.  as the object moved further away i noticed it began to dim and eventually disappeared in the night sky.  i found this very peculiar as there were no clouds or fog that night and the planes that were following it were still visible at that distance.  after returning to the house i felt very excited because i had never seen something this strange before, and ufo's and extra-terrestrials had always peaked my curiosity.  i didn't know what to do about it until i watched a program about ufo's and heard about mufon, so i decided to share my experience.","distance":"Over One

july 20, 2010.  i was headed south on highway 441 about 9:40 p.M.  as i came upon the exxon station just south of dillsboro, i had a strong feeling i should look up. \r\nas i turned my eyes toward the black night sky, there it was hovering just 50 feet over the highway.   it was a narrow, rectangular ship that appeared to be about 50 to 60 feet wide and 20 feet high.   the ship had dim lights in no particular order.  there were maybe four or five long, vertical lights salmon amber in color.  the ship hovered at a slight angle as though it might be circling or perhaps seeking a place to land or crashing.  i have taken flying lessons and flown over this area so i know the terrain. \r\ni heard a loud, screeching noise behind it ��� like the sound of a jumbo jet about to land.  the thought crossed my mind that military jets might be chasing it.  of course, jets couldn���t fly that low and would have been forced to abruptly regain altitude. \r\nsince there was no place to pull off the highway where i felt comfortable enough to stop at night to observe it, i drove on home.  as i passed under the ship i did look back but couldn���t see a thing. \r\nmy immediate feeling upon seeing the ship was one of wonder.  i felt surprisingly calm and also experienced a light tingling sensation.  reflecting back on the experience, it was an answer to a week-long request to see a ship for myself.  what an honor to actually see one! \r\nbut the story doesn't end there.  for ten (10) consecutive nights i awakened exactly two seconds before 1 a.M. totally refreshed after only sleeping three (3) hours.  i was given a 'knowing' that we must become economically sustainable immediately.  that means we have to live in small communities, eat locally, consume only what we need

was lying in his bed and he has a big window besides his bed he told me he was looking outside when he noticed a bright light due east out over the ocean. he was fascinated by the beautiful colors that were emitting from it. then suddenly it split into two objects then he jumped up and woke me up and we both went out on our back porch and that's when i saw it he was describing to me about how it split in two halves then went back together. i thought he may have just mistakenly thought that part. i got my binoculars  so i could get a better look at it. when i looked at it i just saw multiple colors flashing at a rapid rate. it was the most beautiful thing i've ever seen. i have spent 40 plus years as being a boat captain and spending many hours out there and have seen all kinds of unexplained crafts over the years but this one really got my attention because of the unusually bright colors coming from it. as we watched in awe it split apart again and we started hollering loud because we knew it was something serious. i called my nephew to see if he could see it. he was out on a shrimpboat working and he answered. i asked to look to the east and see if he could see it. i was telling him we were seeing an object out that way. he instantly started shouting  god look at all those colors. he got the crew on board to look too. i could hear them shouting in the background. they saw it and we all were having an adrenaline rush. my son stayed as long as he could before he had to leave for work. he was about to get in his vehicle and started singing a verse from an old stix song. we thought that they were angels but much to my surprise. we climed aboard that spaceship,and headed for the skies.  i sat there for a few more minuates and it finally just disappeared  in thin air. words can't explain the excitement we felt and it was like we all saw something very unique and i know it was a special event and it doesn't matter if people are gonna blow it off and say we saw a planet or a star or swamp gas. we saw it and that's a fact.  the moon was overhead and venus was close to the moon and was clear as a bell. what we saw wasn't any of that. i'm sure!  it was so brilliant and the bright colors around the outer edge were flashing beautiful colors so fast it was unbelievable. after that i came back inside and just thought  wow! that wasn't the first time we've seen ufos and we all know that there's more life in the cosmos than our minds can comprehend. people need to accept that and move on. i wish we could have had all of the skeptics with us this morning and let them tell us it was a weather balloon. haha  what we saw would of sent them to a mental institution. especially when it jumped apart and turned into two objects.

started walking to my front door i noticed a bright light over my woods behind my house.At first i thought it was a helicopter with its search light on pointing in my direction maybe looking for marijuana grows or escaping criminal suspects but that was clearly not the case as it approched my backyard i did not hear any sound what so ever except the occasional bullfrog cherping. now it was very slowly moving towards the roof of my house not to mention it had seem to be about anywhere between 50-80 ft above my roof and between 30-60ft diameter.As it hovered over my directly over my head at that exact moment a 747-777 was flying from the right of the object to the left from my point of view and the plane was with out a doubt anywhere between 13,000-26,000ft with the normal nav lights blinking. but when the plane crossed over it the plane dissapeared behind it for a few moments and reemerged on the other side! after a moment or two the object started to move foward again and then abruptly turned to the left and flew off like a bat out of hell! if i had blinked i would have missed it! now as for what it looked like the best way i can describe it is that it looked like a perfectly round black and greyish marble that had a very bright light surrounding it like a aura around it! i also had time to notice and realize that for as huge,bright and close as it was it did not reflect any light on the ground or tree tops like the moon does when it is out! aslo like to mention even though i think i could be crazy for saying this but when it hovered over me something was telepathically talking to me telling me something will happen very soon and it has been watching me for awhile now and the rest the message is \"classified\"! i'm sorry but i feel to afraid to talk about the rest of the message in fear that \"they\" will stiffle me under the \"patriot act\" if \"they\" were to track this email to my address! also the pictures i submited to mufon show the object taking off in great haste if you know where to look on the pictures!","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional

kansas city, missouri, we were sitting on a set of steps to the south of the festival.  we were up a hill and far away (approximately 200 yards) from the lights that were being emitted from the festival.  this was giving us a good view of kansas city toward the north. upon leaving the steps, in the north sky, we both saw a rather large \"comet-like\" object travelling eastward and horizontal to the horizon.  at first, we both thought it was a meteor (albeit the best and largest one either one of us had ever seen).  this changed when the object broke apart and a section decended 90 degrees vertical toward the horizon.  like the first section, this second section also appeared to be on fire.  this occurrence allowed us to believe that perhaps we had seen two aircraft collide.  the second section travelled toward the ground/horizon at a faster rate that the section travelling eastward.  when this second section reached what appeared to be a few hundred feet above the earth, it stopped and hovered.  at that point, it did not change direction vertically or horizontally.  it simply didn't move at all.  the first section continued to travel toward the east.  approximately one minute from the first part of the sighting, both objects immediately disappeared/vanished. \r\nwe made our way back to the car in dismay to the fact that no one else appeared to have seen the same thing.  with much excitement, we decided to get in the car and head north on us-71 highway toward the area in which the second object appeared to \"hover\".  \r\napproximately 7 or 8 minutes after our first sighting, upon travelling northbound on the highway, we saw a very similar object to the first one we had seen travelling vertically toward the earth.  it appeared to be on fire just as the first two only minutes before had appeared.  a few thousand feet above the earth, it broke apart into five other \"star-like\" shapes and stopped.  these star-like objects appeared to surround or rotate around the initial object.  all objects at that point began to take an eastward route toward independence, missouri.  we observed all of this second sighting while travelling northbound on us-71.  this second sighting lasted approximately two to three minutes.  \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

could make out the outline of the craft by its lights illuminating the object. it seemed to be almost drifting towards the northwest had no sound and was around 150 feet in diameter. after crossing the bridge and wanting another look at this strange object i did a u-turn and crossed the bridge again heading west. the object was moving north at this point and was around a mile away. i know other people must have seen the object as there were others crossing the bridge as well. ive lived here for 3 years and seen thousands of planes fly over the lake. this was not ur typical airplane and
