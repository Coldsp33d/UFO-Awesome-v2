 they rarely, if ever move while i am watching them and are almost always stationed in the same spot.  they are not satellites because there are too many and there are none listed in orbit over roswell.  i am dying to know if anyone else has seen them and/or taken photos of them.\r\n\r\nduring cloudy nights it is difficult to see them but occasional clearing exposes one or two.  the frequency and ability to see them in the sky makes me think that i am not the only one seeing these lights, though i have followed sightings here and on the national ufo sighting website and the only thing close was in january from rio rancho, nm.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Other,Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":31082,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.3998555,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08222011-0005","longitude":-104.5190342,"occurred":1293868800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Mexico","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Fireball,   Sphere,   Star-like,   Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1314010879000,"summary":"Nightly for past six months 3 to 12 mysterious lights in nw, sw, and se sky","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/31082_submitter_file1__UFODrawings.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"88201","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":233,"locationName":"Roswell, New Mexico","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:40771"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"New York City","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"First of all, i apologize for making this report so late. i just found out of the existence of this website. \r\n\r\ni was made aware to the whole \"october 13th\" theory through multiple web source, and obviously, i was skeptical. to keep things short, october 13th came and i realized it would all blow over. \r\n\r\nhowever, as i got on 4chan's paranormal board, i was greeted to thread upon thread of people talking about this streams. so i found a link and hopped in. at first, they seemed like planes, but soon i realized that planes simply wouldn't act like this. planes don't break apart from each other and fly in straight upwards. planes don't stop in mid-flight and drop down 50 feet. \r\n\r\nso, i started snapping screenshots. \r\n\r\nthe ones attached are the best available ones i have. \r\n\r\nthe long picture shows a very bright light we saw at one point move to the left in the frame, then down slightly, then right back out in a matter of 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nsimply unbelievable. \r\n\r\nsoon, all the lights disappeared into the night, and all we were left with was a still-lively new york city. \r\n\r\ni was watching this cam along at least 40-50 other people.

rolls. so i put them in the toaster oven and returned to the couch. then i remember feeling like i was intoxicated and someone had me by the arm escorting me to sit down. please note i was not drinking or intoxicated at this time. as i sat down i heard a voice in my mind say something to me. i cant remember now what it was it said to me, but i remember saying something to me. as i answered it i jumped up off the couch looking for whom i was speaking to. there wasn't anyone there except my girlfriend. then i noticed that the pizza rolls were reduced to ash, they looked like pieces of charcoal. but when i touched them they crumbled. i then looked at the clock and it said 3:20. it had been so long that the burnt smell was not detected by my or my girlfriends noses. i then noticed that i had bruises all over me, and small fine cuts everywhere  that had scabbed up. i was feeling pretty strange and i remember going outdoors and looking at the sky for a little while as i smoked a cigarette. wondering what had just happened. there has been other experiences in my life aswell. my first memory ever in my life was just as strange. also there have been things that have happened to me recently. i moved in with a friend in northern maine. i recall reading a book called american science and invention. i fell asleep while reading this book as i often did, and it usually ended up next to me or on the floor. it was around 2 o\"clock in the morning when i woke up and i was lying on my back looking down at my television. i was floating maybe 4 to 5 feet off my bed. no blanket. i remember saying loudly what the ****! and i slammed into the bed. it freaked me out so bad that i couldn't do anything but notice  it was really bright outside for a few minutes after this and then it was dark again. i couldn't go back to sleep for the life of me. i'm 26 years old and this sort of thing has been going on my entire life. i share the stories with you only wondering if others have experienced happenings like this. its pretty unbelievable but i swear its the truth to my knowledge. there are a lot of other things that have happened but ill save them for another

caught a pretty good day���s work delivering a load of furniture to a house in grass valley. i drove on the way up there so the other driver was driving on our way back. delivering a load of furniture inside a two-story house is hard work. i was totally exhausted. there wasn���t much conversation between me and the other driver. \r\nsoon we were out of sacramento going down i-5. there is not much to see at night there. i could see mount diablo outlined by the last light of the setting sun, or from the lights of oakland. that���s all there was to look at so i looked at it.\r\nas it got darker i noticed small planes flying around mount diablo. i only could tell they were small planes from their navigation lights. at first i only saw one or two but after a few minutes it seemed there were six or more all flying around the mountain. i thought maybe they were having an air race of some sort.\r\nas we got even with the mountain i noticed the planes acting strangely. the planes would circle the mountain until they got to the top then they would fly up over the center of the mountain then they would descend in a straight line towards the bottom to start circling the mountain again.\r\nafter watching for a few minutes as we were directly even with the mountain i noticed what looked like a dark shadow centered over the mountain. this was a huge dark shadow, it covered much more than the base of the mountain. that would make it anywhere from a half mile to five or six miles long. from my angle i couldn't tell if it was disk shaped or cigar shaped it now appeared the planes were flying up to the bottom of the huge dark cloud or shadow and then hurrying back down away from it. this is what really got my attention of the dark shadow up there. the dark shadow was no longer centered over the mountain. the planes were no longer circling the mountain and then flying up over the center of the mountain. the planes were still making wide circles, flying up to the center of the dark shadow and then descending. the dark shadow was in a line directly west of our truck. it stayed in a line directly west of our truck until we were south of stockton and lathrop. as we drove south this huge dark shadow drifted south with us at about the same speed of 60mph. \r\nthe planes kept going up to the center of this dark shadow until it was maybe ten miles south of mount diablo then fewer planes were going up until there were none, just this dark shadow, drifting south at the same speed as the truck. i got excited as we neared the i-205 cut off. we were going to be headed right for this dark shadow and should pass right under it. as we headed for it my elation turned to consternation when i could no longer discern the dark shadow. did it keep on drifting south or was the bottom of it camouflaged to look like the night sky? i can assure you i don���t know. i did know it was strange and going to give me something to think about for a long time.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

orange/red, far away and small.  it looked like the color and brightness of an army flare from a plane or a road flare.  it was wobbling or staggering back and forth, less than a half inch back and forth.  it was heading from the west part of the sky just under the cloud cover, maybe from the bainbridge or nipgen area flying towards our area, which is close to huntington high school. it started out as a small very bright orange/red dot and grew as it came closer.  when it was the size of an asprin, it looked like a fireball. i was trying to figure out my cellphone camera to get a picture.  it wasn't quite over our heads, it paused or seemed to pause in the sky, and then it shot \"straight up\" without warning or sound, like a rocket on the 4th of july up through the clouds.  it was still bright, we could barely see through the greyness of the cloud cover as it climbed higher and higher. the light went out, like it shot out into space or something, and we thought our sighting was over.  it wasn't over.  it appearently, shut off it's light above the clouds and it must have started to decend in a freefall dive very fast because it came out of the clouds, basicly down the same line it orgionally went up, really fast. it was now just a black dot when it came through the grey clouds, no light at all, just a black disk, no wings, not a helicopter. it swooped down just under

to crash on the highway in front of us.  without thinking, i started running towards the back yard to avoid the crash.  lee yelled, \"hold on jeremy, it's leveling out, come back\".  i stopped looked up. it did level out.  we all watched it fly over our heads, traveling an east/northeast straight line towards maple grove road/route 50 area. it was flying as fast as a low flying fighter jet. which we do see and hear alot around here. we watched until it got smaller in the distance. it finally went past the hills out of our view.  it wasn't to far below the clouds when it leveled out. it was the
