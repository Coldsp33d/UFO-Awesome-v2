husband and wife who witnessed this.  their two teenage children saw it too, but i did not speak to them.  the witnesses refused to make their own report on the mufon website and only wanted to talk to me.  they made me promise not to reveal their identity or contact information.  i asked them to make a drawing and send it to me.  \r\n\r\nreport: \r\n\r\n\"we were pulling into our driveway last night when the radio suddenly went to static and would not work on any channel.  we got out of the car and headed for the house when my wife noticed something just above the tree line at the back of our property.  we live in a suburban area but our yards are pretty big - about 200 feet long and we have a double lot that is 100' wide, and we have lots of trees in the back.  anyway, we watched this bright white object that had a diamond shape and what looked like a long antenna in front of it on one point of the diamond.  it was very close to us - less than 150' feet away at the first point where we saw it.  it looked like it measured about 80 feet or so in length, and about 60 feet in width with a slight dome from the edges to the center on the top and bottom.  we saw it from the side at first, and from the bottom later.  the object was a craft of some type that had structure to it, and it was all white, and actually glowing white.  we could hear a low-pitched hum and a higher-pitched overtone coming from it.  my kids and my wife and i were spellbound, and didn't even think to go inside to get a camera!  i am very upset that we didn't get a picture of it. \r\n\r\nmy daughter tried to text her friend but her cell phone went dead as soon as she starged typine.  then my son tried his cell phone and it went dead right after he got his friend on the phone.  they were both fully charged before we left the house earlier.  \r\n\r\nanyway, the object just hovered there for a couple of minutes, then slowly rose up and stopped approximately 100��� feet from the ground.  then two bright white balls of light (or fireballs) shot out from underneath the center of it and went in different directions -one to the northwest, and the other to the southeast.  they moved so fast that they were gone in two seconds!  i don't know where they went and lost sight of them.  then the large object started moving towards the northwest slowly at first, then faster. then the craft turned to the south and stopped and the two balls of light came back and went inside it, or more like joined with it. and instantly the thing just took off at a high rate of speed and went straight up and was gone!  we were in shock - none of us could believe what we saw.  we just kept saying ���oh my god.���  i used to be a skeptic but now am a complete believer that there are other beings in the universe besides man.  this was definitely not a helicopter or plane, or any type of man-made vehicle.\"  we will be watching again tonight to see if it comes back, this time with cameras in hand.

10:50pm or so...  we were talking about random things and one of the things she brought up was how the stars were really hard to see tonight..  i immediatly follwed that out in saprae creek, a rural area 15 or so kilometers outside of town where i grew up, you could see the stars much better and they were much brighter...  \r\n\r\nafter talking some more and right before we went in, actually she was stepping in through the balcony door, i looked up in the sky and seen what looked like a really bright star...  in comparasin to the quite dull stars we see from the balcony, this looked like one from a clear winters night out in saprae...  right after i seen it i looked to tell my girfriend about the bright star and when we looked back to see, it was now moving at what seemed to be a steady pace...  judging from the distance and altitude, i assume the thing was going pretty fast...  sapra creek is maybe 3 or 4 kms from the local air port and the object was far higher in altitude and much faster than anything i ever seen in the sky growing up...  the first thing the popped into my head honestly, was hey ufo, then logical side kicked in and said, hey, satellite...  but then again i seen plenty of sattelites and meteors growing up and this object did not share the same properties...  the object, although at a steady pace, was clearly dissapering into space from some orbital place...  the once bright starlike object moved in a south easternly straight line and got noticably duller the further down the line it got until it was gone...  i did notice the object seemed to have turned red in color just before dissapearing into the night sky...\r\n\r\nduring this time we tried taking a picture of the object with cell phone and it never came out, so my girlfriend ran inside to get her camera so we could record the event...  by the time she got it out the object would have been to far gone to pick up on camera, but it didn't matter because the batteries died in the camera as soon as she turned it on...\r\n\r\nall in all i believe the object was some sort of spacecraft due to the unusually bright light emminating from it and the immence speed in which it departed...  the whole even lasted 2 or 3 minutes and was pret awe inspiring...","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

tallahassee. i was sober and i had my top down and was cruising about 45 miles per hour. i am 60 years old and retired from the us postal service. i have worked on air force bases and am familiar with all types of flying vehicles. it was dark and partly cloudy. i looked up a noticed in front of me to my right a huge triangle in the sky just above the trees. there are a lot of trees along this

little futher it was in a clearing and i could clearly see it wans't a tower. the lights on the ends appeared to be triangular to form the ends and lighted from the inside. what i don't understand is the huge slowly pulsating red domed light in the bottom middle of the craft. it was slowly heading in a southerly direction away from me.\r\nafter i saw it i tried to turn into a street to take a

and me.\r\na couple of days later i inspected my route in the daytime and again at night. i never saw any tower except a radio tower a few miles north. this object was to my immediate right and heading behind me. no sound, no props, no jets, and no descending, just slow and steady movement.\r\ni was bewildered because i have never seen such a thing. i have heard of these sightings and always

it was dusk -still somewhat light. i was facing south-southeasr. i spotted a small\r\nbut bright yellow-orange light slightly above horizon traveling toward the lake. it seemed  flying at a low trajectory and i thought at first that it was a balloon with a light, or a remote controlled airplane with a light. the object was traveling northwest -west and i next thought that the object was reflecting light from the sun which had already set. i grabbed my camera but i could not locate it in the viewfinder and failed to record it.  within a minute, another object appeared in about the same area and seemed to be flying the same path. i did capture it on video tape and it appeared at first as a round yellow-red fireball moving slowly. as i continued to track it, i noticed a black spot\r\nbehind the light. as it continued, the light seemed diminish but the black object seemed to emerge\r\ni believe it was rising and became more illuminated from the sun. finally there was no yellow-red light but a circular round object. my video camera has autofocus - but the object kept going in and out of focus. finally it dissappeared from view. within a minute there was still another yellow-red object originating from about the same area and traveling in the same path. the same thing happened - the object appeared as a yellow-red color firball, then a black object behind the fireball became larger, the yellow-red color rotated and the circular object was apparent. the object eventually disappeared. it was now dark and i anticipated the fireworks were about to happen when still another firball appeared in the same spot. it seemed to travel upward and never crossed the lake but rather continued moving up and disappeared as a small pinpoint of light.\r\n\r\nthere were hundreds of people on the lake that night all watching for the fireworks. my neighboprs saw the fireball but only saw the yellow orange light which faded -they never observed the circular object.\r\n\r\ni captured this on videotape and i am hoping that with better equipment the image can be enhanced and more details can be seen. the digital video clip is too large to email.\r\n

was also way too small to be a blimp. the motion was too steady and regular for a balloon. it could possibly have been a satellite of some sort, but the object seemed to change its shape subtly as i observed it, especially toward the end of the sighting, which lasted about 30 seconds. the object reflected sunlight and appeared metallic.\r\n\r\ni just got off the phone with a guy at the national

i grabbed my binoculars, wallet, and a 9mm pistol i had, not wanting to leave them in the van. i put my pistol in my waist holster, and my coat on to step out in the road to view what i thought was a helicopter about 3/4 to 1 mile away over the dark treeline. as i couldn't quite make out the lights flashing on this object too well, i walked down the road to where it curbs about 70 yards from the van. the road heads out to my left towards the communication tower mentioned earlier, behind me it ends at some rocky bluffs that people like to fish alot from, towards hw 13 out of clinton, mo. when i focused my nikon 8x40 binoculars on the object again, with and without my glasses, i could just make out what appeared to be a dish like form, a red flashing light on the middle top, and what looked like strobe lights flasing in the middle of the object in a circular and uniform manner. i could not hear any sound at that distance, but looking at the object and judging its movement if any against the dark tree line, i came to the conclusion it was hovering and/or stationary. i did think this was odd for a helicopter to be in that area and no sound whatsoever. and in that frame of mind, all i was doing was wondering what could be the purpose. little knowing that my quiet evening was to take a sci-fi turn out of a movie! as i was just standing watching this object, i happened to look to my left, down that section of county road, possibly 1/4 mile in length and was shocked to see a blue like, lazer beam of light come from the sw horizen and make a 90 degree drop straight down to the earth, which seemed to be at the end of the road i was standing on. standing on mind you! i may have not put as much thought into what the disk like object i was looking at seconds ago, to be no more than some sort of man made craft, helicopter, etc, but this lazer light as you can guess made me take a very profound interest in what was happening around me in the star filled, cold, dark heavens! i gazed intently in the direction of that beam of light which made no sound, yet didn't see anything. i then put my binoculars on the disk like object and saw that it was still in the same area and still flashing its lights the same as before. after what seemed like 5 minutes, out of the corner of my left eye, another blueish lazer beam of light appeared from the same area of the horizon from the sw as the 1st beam, and in the blink of an eye it stopped halfway down the road, above the tree line next to the road i was standing in. i can only describe this orb as one might say to be somewhat egg shaped,fuzzy in color, white around the edge, with a pilot flame like bluish tint of color, taking up 80% of the middle diameter. the hair went up on my neck and head as it very slowly, yet quietly seem to be floating down the tree line towards me! i seemed to instantly forget that i had a fully loaded 9mm pistol in the back of my waist! i was very proficient with this firearm, yet the fear that seemed to overcome me made me even lose touch with the very ground i stood on. i was as one might say, revitted in place. i quickly looked back at the disk and it was still there doing the same thing as before. in turning quickly back to watch the orb float towards me down the tree line, i tried to judge its size by taking my hand and encircling it with my fingers, i judged it to be at arms length about the size of a golf ball or slightly larger. in the process of doing this i also judged the height above to treeline to what one might think as 40 ft.Or so. i cannot safely say that this orb was directly over the tree line or just behind it. but it was in full view. after getting this info in my head it had closed the distance to me by more than halfway. by then it looked to be the size of a baseball! to say i was getting worried is an unearthly understatement! then out of the same sw horizon another lazer like beam, and a 2nd orb lines up directly behind the first orb! possibly 100 ft. or so apart. they both are floating along silently still coming towards me. as they near the end of the tree line, the curve i am standing in has a field road cutting into a grown up field that lays across their path, this i am nearly facing, although slightly to the left as i am understandably watching their immenant progress towards me. all of a sudden, in the blink of an eye, the 2nd orb behind the 1st orb, drops down underneath and is directly lined up as if tied together both silently coming on. i cup my ears and hear nothing, no humming, nothing! as they both cross the opening directly across from me, an incredibly bright, neon green, \"v\" shaped light seems to light up the star filled night sky where i had no view of anything but that light in that split second. in that light i just snapped a photo in my minds eye, was what seemed to look like a unbroken smoke ring, much as a feather would look like descending to the ground. how anyone could not possibly see this from hw 13 over the grand river arm of the lake is beyond me. but in that light i did not see either of the orbs. but as soon as the light was gone, what i assumed to be the 1st orb was slowly continuing that same path over the treeline to my right. it started to slightly veer upwards at a 45 degree angle and as it was in the direction as the disk further away, which i had not looked at for obvious reasons, i took a quick look and the disk shaped object was moving away over the far tree line in the general direction of clinton,mo. much the speed as a helicopter would. as i then looked back and up at the orb it was still at a 45 degree angle and all at once, like the starship enterprise of tv fame, it left in the only way i can see and think it! (in warp drive) to infinity and beyond! a blue lazer like tail, with the orb at the front, which move so quickly, that the tail was taken along with it and it looked to take its place in the stars of the universe and become a star! that is the only way i can describe how fast it moved and how long i saw it.\r\n\r\nafter watching and going thru all of this, what seemed to be an afterthought was that next to that 2nd tree line to my right was a parked, datson like truck with a camper shell on it. i never noticed this before or fully forgot about it as the night sky was filled with these happenings! i was hoping someone was there in that area with me and had maybe viewed the same things i had. i was truly hoping that i wasn't by myself out there as i had this feeing after the bright neon green light filled the night sky, something had landed. how far away, i had no idea! maybe someone was sleeping in the truck, in the back of the bed. i told myself to stay calm and go to the truck and look around, and if i saw them in the cab, as i had a small mini-mag light, to light my way to them to show i was there. but what if there was no one there? i eased up to the cab, covered the light just enough to look inside, and saw blaze orange apparel and a hunting rifle. could this person have gone into town with friends? was he sleeping in the back? i took a chance hoping i wouldn't be thought of as someone out to rob them or do some other mischeif, and called out quietly to ask if any one was in the truck! a 2nd time, no response. damn my luck! it was then that i knew i wasn't myself. i did not have control of my emotions. i knew what i had to say, and as i used the light to tap on the bed of the truck, i heard someone stir. then a man asked me what i wanted? i at first tried to tell him that i wasn't drinking, nor smoking weed, but there was something happening out here in the sky and i would like him to look with me to prove to myself that it had happened as i saw it, if it was to keep on happening. i could not talk straight to him. my words came jumbled and run together out of my mouth, i was shaking like a leaf! it was fear! never had i ever experianced that kind of emotion! i can still think of that moment and relive those thoughts today. albeit with less intensity. the man came out, i cannot remember his name, and talked with me and we watched the sky for over an hour, but the lights were gone. it took that long and possibly longer talking with him to feel myself actually touch the ground again. i know not his name, nor ever saw him again, but will always be thankful he was there to calm me down. he mentioned he flew back in the 50's and/or 60's and he and his co-pilot would see things as ufo's but not go thru the trouble of reporting as it would cause them problems with the airline they flew for. and that is the end of my story. i hope it will be usefull to others, and the only thing i would like to see is for someone to put on video what i saw and let others see and/or relive what i or they might have seen also!
