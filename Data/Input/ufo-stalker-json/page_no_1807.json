(balcony is a ground floor patio). the weather tonight was unremarkable. scattered clouds.\r\n\r\nwith me facing directly south, it was south east of my position, moving south east (seemingly towards the south beach area). \r\n\r\nit moved at what seemed to be high speeds, at a height that i can only describe as cloud level. obviously without knowing height and distance traveled, it is difficult to understand its speed. but i do believe that it was moving quickly. if i did not misjudge its altitude, then planes are not uncommon at the altitude i witnessed. i'm going to guess the angle of my view, to the object, was about 70 degrees.\r\n\r\ni lost track of the object due to a tree obstructing my view. i only saw it briefly before it moved behind the tree, from above it. its path was very direct and unchanging in speed, altitude, and trajectory. i do not believe that it was moving downward, as to land. nor do i believe it was rising.\r\n\r\nthe only physical description that i can give is it being a round/circular white light, and possibly fainter at its edges. \r\n\r\nas far as description in what it lacks; there was no silhouette to the object witnessed. in miami's light polluted skies, at night you can easily make out a plane's shape. there was no indication of wings, nor the standard red and blue (green?) wing tip lights on a plane. all that could be witnessed was a bright light. the light was not illuminating in a manner to give hint at the object's shape. i cannot recall if the light flashed or blinked, so i will not say positively that it did or did not. if i had to guess, i would say it did not.\r\n\r\n\r\npersonal input - \r\n\r\ni live within 5 blocks of opa locka airport. there is a consistent amount of traffic to this airport including private pilots, commercial (shipping), and military/us coast guard traffic. \r\n\r\ni completely rule out the airport having anything to do with what i saw, and in counter, believe the airport allows me to strengthen my belief that this was not an airplane. with me witnessing planes throughout all times of the day, in all weather, i feel i have a decent grasp of what an airplane looks like, and at night. not moreso than others, but enough.\r\n\r\nfor this to have been a plane, it had to have an extremely bright light on the rear of the plane. bright enough and large enough to not allow view of the plane's body. \r\n\r\nalso, from the angle witnessed, and the object's path, it almost seems as if the light was facing me. i'm not sure if this might indicate that it was not a fixed light on a craft, as much as it was a source of light that was moving. like a moving light bulb.\r\n\r\ni was definitely excited when i first saw the object, immediately opening the door to the balcony to announce what i just seen to my family inside. after brief moments though, i realized that my excitement did not allow me to think properly about what i had seen. \r\n\r\ni ruled out helicopters. i then ruled out a meteor, as my understanding is that meteors are visually fire engulfed/fireballs. i'm pretty sure i've seen a meteor before, and a large, tail followed fireball is what i saw.\r\n\r\nas time went by, i began to really believe that what i saw was not a normal occurrence. i personally cannot take a guess at what type of craft or meteorological event it could have been, as i can't compare it to anything i know of.\r\n\r\ntomorrow i will submit a second report with a digital photo of my point of view of the event, indicating the object's path.","distance":"Over One

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"As i was driving east on highway 24 leaving fayetteville, north carolina on august 18, 2011 , i was heading home. the time was late after 9:00pm but almost 10:00pm. after i reached the intersection of highway 24 and cedar creek rd, i traveled about a mile on the outskirts of fayetteville, thru 2 intersections. by the time i reached the second intersection, i had passed a large machinery lot with tobaccos and cat ,used in constuction, on my left. and, on my right lots of trees with a break and in the distance you can see a factory like establishment; there were trees also located on the left side of the highway. while i approached the second intersection, it was about 10:00pm, i didn't really have the radio turned up but i was smoking a cigarrette and i noticed a aircraft with 5 round-circular lights shaped in a triangle flying over the trees on the left side of the highway. at first i noticed that it was a large aircraft of some caliber, and paid no attention because i realized the fayetteville airport is located very close by, down highway 301. but, then as it was still on the left side of the highway still with the end of the flying object just coming over the trees, i began to realize that this flying object was in the outline of a geometric triangle with 5 circular-round lights and it was very large. \r\n\r\nmy head exploded with questions, all dealing with airplanes or any type of aircraft that could have been in the sky and at that size and caliber and at that time. this obect was a very large triangle in the sky with 5 lights, what appeared to be located at the bottom. the aircraft seemed to blend into the night sky so it looked dark but still dull at the same time, but i can still clearly see a triangle outline shape with a solid texture of a blackish maybe dark grayish color. this obect looked maybe few hundred feet above the highest trees and it looked about a couple hundred feet for each side. the triangle had 3 equal sides so i believe it to be a equilateral triangle. then the 5 lights on the bottom. you had one light in the corner of the point/vertices of the triangle and that was heading in the direction over the highway left-to-right on the road. three more circular lights were located on the opposite straight-side of the triangle, with gaps between each light. then the 5th circular light was located in the very center under the aircraft triangle. this light also seem to have a larger circumference then the other 4 lights. so, starting from the front bottom of the triangle to the back bottom, the lights seem to line up in a ratio of 1-1-3. these lights were round, circular and bright. they appeared to be a constant whitish glowing color, but they didn't blink, flash, or move side-to-side, but more seemed to have a sight blur on the outline of the circle; like looking at jet boosters and seeing the fumes comeout the exhaust. this flying triangle flew at a constant height above the trees and just casually flew over the highway in my sights. if i had to guess, this flying aircraft was roughly about a thousand feet to a few thousand feet away from me and in the air. i asked myself, \"can it be a regular us airway's or a delta airplane heading toward the airport, but just flying low?\" i answered, \"no, i drive down highway 24 all the time to go home and i see regular airplanes flying to the airport at night. the difference was that those airplanes i see normally were in the distant and looked like little specks of lights, shaped like a bird with a nose, wings, and a tail. i would also notice that those airplanes have a red flashing light under the bottom of the plane. but this flying triangle didnt have a red light, and no blinking lights.\" then i asked myself,\"was it a fighter jet or stealth jet?\" again i answered no because i pointed out the immediate difference. if it was a fighter jet, i understand they fly low at night sometimes, but i noticed that this flying object made no noise at all. i had my radio off and the window halfway down driving down the highway at around 50-55 mph. normally when i see a jet high in the sky and they pass over, they normally have a loud echo in the sky. and for this triangle to be so huge and appear so large at my distant, i would have expected hearing some type of engine or popeller. i discluded in my mind that it was not a figher jet or stealth jet, because it flew at a constant height and it seemed to hover like a helicopter flying at a constant straight path. but again, this flying triangle was still too large from any helicopter i have ever seen, so i dont believe it to be that either, and i do not think a jet or any airplane that large and visible to my eye, can fly that low without making any sound, and by not going that fast. also to mention the large circular lights on the bottom. \r\n\r\nthe flight of motion of the triangle seemed to come from the left side of highway 24 over the highway and onto the right side towards the factory side. i only saw the flying triangle for about 10-15 seconds. as it was flying over the right side, it instantly shocked me, why don't i take a picture. i should have taken a video from the beginning but it didn't click to try and video it. but, i did take a picture. you can see 5 lights in the sky, but since i took it over my dashboard while driving down a highway, the picture is smaller in the distance and set at 1x zoom. you can only see the lights but if you traced a triangle it would be a exact match. i lost the flying triangle after it passed over the right side of the highway.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On the night of november 15th, opening day of deer rifle season, the year 1997, i was camped out in my van about a mile across from the cellular phone tower outside of deep water mo. it had snowed slightly in the early morning hours, barely an inch. the daytime temp. was in the teens. after a fruitless day of hunting i retired to my van to grab a bite to eat and warm myself with some hot coffee. as it gets dark by 5:45pm, i was just sitting in the van in a pull in, facing a growed up field imagining that a big buck would cross into my view. the old boy i was after. as one has nothing much to do but plot out the next days plans, i was just thinking of my game plan. while looking out my side window through leaves near a tree i was parked next to, i noticed some lights in the distant sky shining off and on. and now my story begins in all earnesty. i am i think a man's man. i do not fear much on this earth, yet what i was about to have happen to me, being mentally unprepared, would change my way of thinking and/or life forever! i grabbed my binoculars, wallet, and a 9mm pistol i had, not wanting to leave them in the van. i put my pistol in my waist holster, and my coat on to step out in the road to view what i thought was a helicopter about 3/4 to 1 mile away over the dark treeline. as i couldn't quite make out the lights flashing on this object too well, i walked down the road to where it curbs about 70 yards from the van. the road heads out to my left towards the communication tower mentioned earlier, behind me it ends at some rocky bluffs that people like to fish alot from, towards hw 13 out of clinton, mo. when i focused my nikon 8x40 binoculars on the object again, with and without my glasses, i could just make out what appeared to be a dish like form, a red flashing light on the middle top, and what looked like strobe lights flasing in the middle of the object in a circular and uniform manner. i could not hear any sound at that distance, but looking at the object and judging its movement if any against the dark tree line, i came to the conclusion it was hovering and/or stationary. i did think this was odd for a helicopter to be in that area and no sound whatsoever. and in that frame of mind, all i was doing was wondering what could be the purpose. little knowing that my quiet evening was to take a sci-fi turn out of a movie! as i was just standing watching this object, i happened to look to my left, down that section of county road, possibly 1/4 mile in length and was shocked to see a blue like, lazer beam of light come from the sw horizen and make a 90 degree drop straight down to the earth, which seemed to be at the end of the road i was standing on. standing on mind you! i may have not put as much thought into what the disk like object i was looking at seconds ago, to be no more than some sort of man made craft, helicopter, etc, but this lazer light as you can guess made me take a very profound interest in what was happening around me in the star filled, cold, dark heavens! i gazed intently in the direction of that beam of light which made no sound, yet didn't see anything. i then put my binoculars on the disk like object and saw that it was still in the same area and still flashing its lights the same as before. after what seemed like 5 minutes, out of the corner of my left eye, another blueish lazer beam of light appeared from the same area of the horizon from the sw as the 1st beam, and in the blink of an eye it stopped halfway down the road, above the tree line next to the road i was standing in. i can only describe this orb as one might say to be somewhat egg shaped,fuzzy in color, white around the edge, with a pilot flame like bluish tint of color, taking up 80% of the middle diameter. the hair went up on my neck and head as it very slowly, yet quietly seem to be floating down the tree line towards me! i seemed to instantly forget that i had a fully loaded 9mm pistol in the back of my waist! i was very proficient with this firearm, yet the fear that seemed to overcome me made me even lose touch with the very ground i stood on. i was as one might say, revitted in place. i quickly looked back at the disk and it was still there doing the same thing as before. in turning quickly back to watch the orb float towards me down the tree line, i tried to judge its size by taking my hand and encircling it with my fingers, i judged it to be at arms length about the size of a golf ball or slightly larger. in the process of doing this i also judged the height above to treeline to what one might think as 40 ft.Or so. i cannot safely say that this orb was directly over the tree line or just behind it. but it was in full view. after getting this info in my head it had closed the distance to me by more than halfway. by then it looked to be the size of a baseball! to say i was getting worried is an unearthly understatement! then out of the same sw horizon another lazer like beam, and a 2nd orb lines up directly behind the first orb! possibly 100 ft. or so apart. they both are floating along silently still coming towards me. as they near the end of the tree line, the curve i am standing in has a field road cutting into a grown up field that lays across their path, this i am nearly facing, although slightly to the left as i am understandably watching their immenant progress towards me. all of a sudden, in the blink of an eye, the 2nd orb behind the 1st orb, drops down underneath and is directly lined up as if tied together both silently coming on. i cup my ears and hear nothing, no humming, nothing! as they both cross the opening directly across from me, an incredibly bright, neon green, \"v\" shaped light seems to light up the star filled night sky where i had no view of anything but that light in that split second. in that light i just snapped a photo in my minds eye, was what seemed to look like a unbroken smoke ring, much as a feather would look like descending to the ground. how anyone could not possibly see this from hw 13 over the grand river arm of the lake is beyond me. but in that light i did not see either of the orbs. but as soon as the light was gone, what i assumed to be the 1st orb was slowly continuing that same path over the treeline to my right. it started to slightly veer upwards at a 45 degree angle and as it was in the direction as the disk further away, which i had not looked at for obvious reasons, i took a quick look and the disk shaped object was moving away over the far tree line in the general direction of clinton,mo. much the speed as a helicopter would. as i then looked back and up at the orb it was still at a 45 degree angle and all at once, like the starship enterprise of tv fame, it left in the only way i can see and think it! (in warp drive) to infinity and beyond! a blue lazer like tail, with the orb at the front, which move so quickly, that the tail was taken along with it and it looked to take its place in the stars of the universe and become a star! that is the only way i can describe how fast it moved and how long i saw it.\r\n\r\nafter watching and going thru all of this, what seemed to be an afterthought was that next to that 2nd tree line to my right was a parked, datson like truck with a camper shell on it. i never noticed this before or fully forgot about it as the night sky was filled with these happenings! i was hoping someone was there in that area with me and had maybe viewed the same things i had. i was truly hoping that i wasn't by myself out there as i had this feeing after the bright neon green light filled the night sky, something had landed. how far away, i had no idea! maybe someone was sleeping in the truck, in the back of the bed. i told myself to stay calm and go to the truck and look around, and if i saw them in the cab, as i had a small mini-mag light, to light my way to them to show i was there. but what if there was no one there? i eased up to the cab, covered the light just enough to look inside, and saw blaze orange apparel and a hunting rifle. could this person have gone into town with friends? was he sleeping in the back? i took a chance hoping i wouldn't be thought of as someone out to rob them or do some other mischeif, and called out quietly to ask if any one was in the truck! a 2nd time, no response. damn my luck! it was then that i knew i wasn't myself. i did not have control of my emotions. i knew what i had to say, and as i used the light to tap on the bed of the truck, i heard someone stir. then a man asked me what i wanted? i at first tried to tell him that i wasn't drinking, nor smoking weed, but there was something happening out here in the sky and i would like him to look with me to prove to myself that it had happened as i saw it, if it was to keep on happening. i could not talk straight to him. my words came jumbled and run together out of my mouth, i was shaking like a leaf! it was fear! never had i ever experianced that kind of emotion! i can still think of that moment and relive those thoughts today. albeit with less intensity. the man came out, i cannot remember his name, and talked with me and we watched the sky for over an hour, but the lights were gone. it took that long and possibly longer talking with him to feel myself actually touch the ground again. i know not his name, nor ever saw him again, but will always be thankful he was there to calm me down. he mentioned he flew back in the 50's and/or 60's and he and his co-pilot would see things as ufo's but not go thru the trouble of reporting as it would cause them problems with the airline they flew for. and that is the end of my story. i hope it will be usefull to others, and the only thing i would like to see is for someone to put on video what i saw and let others see and/or relive what i or they might have seen also!

i seemed to instantly forget that i had a fully loaded 9mm pistol in the back of my waist! i was very proficient with this firearm, yet the fear that seemed to overcome me made me even lose touch with the very ground i stood on. i was as one might say, revitted in place. i quickly looked back at the disk and it was still there doing the same thing as before. in turning quickly back to watch the orb float towards me down the tree line, i tried to judge its size by taking my hand and encircling it with my fingers, i judged it to be at arms length about the size of a golf ball or slightly larger. in the process of doing this i also judged the height above to treeline to what one might think as 40 ft.Or so. i cannot safely say that this orb was directly over the tree line or just behind it. but it was in full view. after getting this info in my head it had closed the distance to me by more than halfway. by then it looked to be the size of a baseball! to say i was getting worried is an unearthly understatement! then out of the same sw horizon another lazer like beam, and a 2nd orb lines up directly behind the first orb! possibly 100 ft. or so apart. they both are floating along silently still coming towards me. as they near the end of the tree line, the curve i am standing in has a field road cutting into a grown up field that lays across their path, this i am nearly facing, although slightly to the left as i am understandably watching their immenant progress towards me. all of a sudden, in the blink of an eye, the 2nd orb behind the 1st orb, drops down underneath and is directly lined up as if tied together both silently coming on. i cup my ears and hear nothing, no humming, nothing! as they both cross the opening directly across from me, an incredibly bright, neon green, \"v\" shaped light seems to light up the star filled night sky where i had no view of anything but that light in that split second. in that light i just snapped a photo in my minds eye, was what seemed to look like a unbroken smoke ring, much as a feather would look like descending to the ground. how anyone could not possibly see this from hw 13 over the grand river arm of the lake is beyond me. but in that light i did not see either of the orbs. but as soon as the light was gone, what i assumed to be the 1st orb was slowly continuing that same path over the treeline to my right. it started to slightly veer upwards at a 45 degree angle and as it was in the direction as the disk further away, which i had not looked at for obvious reasons, i took a quick look and the disk shaped object was moving away over the far tree line in the general direction of clinton,mo. much the speed as a helicopter would. as i then looked back and up at the orb it was still at a 45 degree angle and all at once, like the starship enterprise of tv fame, it left in the only way i can see and think it! (in warp drive) to infinity and beyond! a blue lazer like tail, with the orb at the front, which move so quickly, that the tail was taken along with it and it looked to take its place in the stars of the universe and become a star! that is the only way i can describe how fast it moved and how long i saw it.\r\n\r\nafter watching and going thru all of this, what seemed to be an afterthought was that next to that 2nd tree line to my right was a parked, datson like truck with a camper shell on it. i never noticed this before or fully forgot about it as the night sky was filled with these happenings! i was hoping someone was there in that area with me and had maybe viewed the same things i had. i was truly hoping that i wasn't by myself out there as i had this feeing after the bright neon green light filled the night sky, something had landed. how far away, i had no idea! maybe someone was sleeping in the truck, in the back of the bed. i told myself to stay calm and go to the truck and look around, and if i saw them in the cab, as i had a small mini-mag light, to light my way to them to show i was there. but what if there was no one there? i eased up to the cab, covered the light just enough to look inside, and saw blaze orange apparel and a hunting rifle. could this person have gone into town with friends? was he sleeping in the back? i took a chance hoping i wouldn't be thought of as someone out to rob them or do some other mischeif, and called out quietly to ask if any one was in the truck! a 2nd time, no response. damn my luck! it was then that i knew i wasn't myself. i did not have control of my emotions. i knew what i had to say, and as i used the light to tap on the bed of the truck, i heard someone stir. then a man asked me what i wanted? i at first tried to tell him that i wasn't drinking, nor smoking weed, but there was something happening out here in the sky and i would like him to look with me to prove to myself that it had happened as i saw it, if it was to keep on happening. i could not talk straight to him. my words came jumbled and run together out of my mouth, i was shaking like a leaf! it was fear! never had i ever experianced that kind of emotion! i can still think of that moment and relive those thoughts today. albeit with less intensity. the man came out, i cannot remember his name, and talked with me and we watched the sky for over an hour, but the lights were gone. it took that long and possibly longer talking with him to feel myself actually touch the ground again. i know not his name, nor ever saw him again, but will always be thankful he was there to calm me down. he mentioned he flew back in the 50's and/or 60's and he and his co-pilot would see things as ufo's but not go thru the trouble of reporting as it would cause them problems with the airline they flew for. and that is the end of my story. i hope it will be usefull to others, and the only thing i would like to see is for someone to put on video what i saw and let others see and/or relive what i or they might have seen also!

8/17/11 i saw one bright star like object i didn't recognise in that area of the sky at that time of night. on second glance, it moved in a direction toward the center of the sky. the object was over a mile high and blended with the stars. while watching as i move across the sky, it gained speed and left the atmosphere; i know this because it faded off into the distance, tho the distance was the center of the sky and the light got dimmer.I videoed the first sighting, and the camera only recorded blackness.As i gave up on the camera on my phone, i called my mother to tell her, as i did i saw a second one of same hight in a separate part of the sky and it did the same thing in a completely different part of the sky at different angle.I dismissed both events as a result of reading about the new changes of flight options for space and nasa, (being that i've never seen so it could be a what it was) then on second thought today, i decided that their was nothing about these kinds of

load the weapons on just about any military aircraft around, so naturally i have a natural knack to look up at the skies. well recently i have been noticing helicoptor-ish air craft in the air at night, now not all nights but most nights. well i noticed that these certain aircraft would spend long amounts of time just hovering in spot, i noticed they \"flashed in a certain way\" and that there lights would completely change when another aircraft in the sky approached. now where i live i am in quite an active air space as i am not far from a major airport. but it seems odd for these strange aircraft to just \"hang around\". not to mention it costs around $3000 and hour to keep any type of aircraft like that in the air let alone several. so naturally i assumed them to be government aircraft looking for marijuana growers. well one night i was out side around ten o'clock, and i was bringing my dog in of the line. when i stopped and noticed that there where three of these in the air that night. i noticed one beginning to travel to my left having been interested in these for quite some time i made the not so bright decision to flash my green led flashlight at it and quickly vanish from sight. shortly after the other two started to travel in opposite directions. one to the left {almost the same but not quite the same path as the previous} and one to the right. within seconds i could hardly keep my eyes on both without turning my head from side to side. then i began to have an interesting feeling, so i turned around and no more then fifty feet above my house was emerging a strange triangular aircraft. it was dull in color and seemed to have the front wing span flush with the front of the air craft. the wings had a red and blue light on the front outside edges. and in the very front there was a strange faint \"tracing back and forth light\" in the very front right below what would have been the cockpit. all the while it never made a sound. i ran as fast as i could and got under the safety of my front door and out of the view of the strange craft. i immediately began to yell for my wife, who of course at the time heard nothing. after several seconds \"which seemed like eternity\" of me yelling and noticing the craft was just hovering above the house, i made the decision to go get my wife. better to have a witness right. upon getting her to the do the craft had began moving again and was now about 100 feet away and headed out over the field behind our house. shortly after it was joined by the other two and they all sailed out of sight.....   after five years in the military i have worked with all kinds of aircraft and all i can sat is well... lets just say the next day my wife went out and bought a shot gun. they still appear quite regularly, nothing as close though, just waiting... the ball is in there court.\r\n\r\n ","distance":"101-500

(this is the nw blvd/maple-ash neighborhood) when i came out i looked up and seen what i thought was the helicopter. i say to my friend that i don't see its spotlight. she then directs me to the south where the helicopter was when all along i was looking at the bright light \"flying\" around in the northern sky. i am then very excited and tell her to come look at the bright light, explaining to her that its just like what i had seen earlier in the month. we watched it fly around until it faded away completely. we sat outside and started talking about how strange the light was when another one pops up out of nowhere in the northeastern sky. our older kids (10 and 12yrs) come outside wondering why we've been gone so long. so we start explaining to them whats up. when yet again another light pops up in the sky. my best friend goes inside to get her camera so we can try and capture some of this. me and the boys see yet another one moving from west to east, the light got really bright, stopped, then descended to what looks like, from our position, to be about the felts field/valley area. hard to say from our viewpoint exactly. anyways, while it descended, it started pulsating red and orange. we watched it until it slowly drop out of the sky until it was out of our view. by this point we're really tripping out! (we never heard any booms though, always silent) we sat out there and continued to watch the \"lights in the sky\" until about 11:00. there were too many to count. had to be dozens of different lights. some individual and some in groups. some travel in the exact same flight pattern as the one before it, some are completely random. some blink on and off. some are just really dim like the light you'd see when a satellite moves across the sky, and some are extremely bright!\r\n\r\nto me they're ufo's... now that does not mean its aliens but it sure as hell does mean they're unidentified!!! the best way i can describe them is, they look like stars at first, then they get really bright, and travel across the sky in no particular pattern and fade away until you can't see them with your naked eye anymore. they do not fly in straight lines every time either. some do, but others move from left to right then up and down then back to the left again. very strange. going out tonight to try and catch this on video.! really hoping for clear skies tonight!!\r\n\r\nthere were many reports and a lot of talk on our local news stations facebook pages last night, 8/17/2011 and today, 8/18/2011, about a bright light seen over the spokane valley that fell from the sky and a huge boom that shook people out of their homes to the streets to investigate. the light that we seen descending from the sky, pulsating orange and red is approximately the same time as the reports from the valley. coincidence? there is currently no explanation to what these witnesses in the valley experienced.
