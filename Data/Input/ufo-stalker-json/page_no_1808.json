States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"A little after midnight on friday night (aug. 12)/saturday morning, i went out to the beach with a relative to watch the perseids. shortly after we arrived, i looked up to our left and saw a light, that i initially thought was a star, moving slightly over the ocean. at first it seemed like one single yellowish white light, maybe a little brighter than most of the surrounding stars. i watched it for a while to see if it was a plane, but although it was definitely moving, it was neither coming nor going anywhere, just hovering and darting around within the same general space. then i noticed that besides the one constant yellow-white light, there were alternating other lights in red, green, and another pale color, maybe another set of white lights. there may have been other colors, but it was too dark to see, and blue would have been hard to pick out against the dark sky. the one, starlike yellow-white light was constantly on, although it did dim and get brighter. it might not be a correct one, but i got the impression from looking at it that all the lights were, in fact, attached to a single craft. they all stayed in the same position relative to each other even as it moved.\r\n\r\nthe best way i can describe the craft's movements is as hummingbird or bee-like, hovering and darting around, although not so fast that i couldn't trace its path. my relative saw it too and confirmed that there were definitely blinking lights and that it was moving strangely, totally unlike a plane and probably way too high up to be a helicopter. she then spotted another one to our right, also over the water, behaving almost identically, although it was farther away and harder to see, so i remained focused on the craft i initially spotted.\r\n\r\nremembering several accounts i've heard of people being able to psychically communicate with craft, i silently asked that, if it could hear me, to indicate so by moving up and down. it did as i asked. then i asked for it to just move downwards this time, and it also complied. the third time i asked it to move side to side if it could hear me, and it started to do so before i could even finish the question in my head. a few minutes later i started asking those types of \"give me proof that you can hear me\" questions, but it stopped responding, and i got the distinct impression (again, just an impression) that it was fed up with that game.\r\n\r\nwe stayed there on the beach for about forty-five minutes, and both crafts remained for the entire time. they were there before we got there, and they were still there when we left, so i have no idea how long they were camped out over the atlantic. we discussed whether it could have been a weather balloon, but it was not moving like a weather balloon and that explanation doesn't count for the blinking multicolored lights and, well, last time i checked i couldn't psychically communicate with weather balloons. one last thing i should mention is that after my psychic communication, if that's really what it was, my whole skull felt warm, especially in the back. that was definitely a new sensation, and although i knew that logically i should be unnerved, i wasn't.

she said i don't know. i said should we look? she said no and went slient...Again i couldn't move..I wanted to see it but i couldn't move. the hum it made was not like anything i've ever experanced before. the next day a friend of my mothers said she and a friend saw a ufo over our house.\r\nin 1975 i moved back to burbank california. my husband and i were going to the store, as we came to the under pass a large silver shape disc appered in the sky,(we had just gone under the pass when i said to him) did you see that? he said no. i said hurry as i glued myself to the front window,as we came out from under the pass...The bottom of the ship mirrored us looking up at it, i could see us looking up at it...Then it changed to a night sky with stars, it was beautiful...As i was looking at it and as the stars faded i could see like...Well it was wird on the inside...Anyway as we continued on; it shimmered becomming transparent and seemed to be sucked out of the sky. it was not propelled like our airplanes...It was sucked out of the sky and gone. my question is, why didn't my husband see it...Why didn't everyone in burbank see it..This thing was as big as a foot ball feild. is it possable for one person to see them and others don't? do these things or beings have such an ability. i know what i saw and it was real, and nothing we have on earth could do what it did. years later a government program was showing pictures of ufo and i saw the one that i saw in 1975, i called to my husband, \"see that's what i saw\"..Happy that i could prove myself to him and then the gov man said none of these are real...Funny how something that is not real, is what i saw that day....How does that happen. how can they have a picture of what i saw and it's not real. \r\nhow do i feel after seeing something like this? well, how would you feel if what you saw in day light not one other soul saw. how would you feel if everyone you knew thought you were crazy. how would you feel if these things have followed you for your whole life and how would you feel if you didn't understand what was happening to you. my father told me years later that he also had seen a long shape silver object as a boy in washington state where he grew up. it made me feel a bit better, but...Well what can i say this has been my experance with ufo.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":30981,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.7137493,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08182011-0010","longitude":-121.8137543,"occurred":-223660800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,   Cylinder,   Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1313682501000,"summary":"At six years of age i called them stick people. this night, five or six where at the foot of my bed and the first one moved very fast to the side of me in bed and raised a sliver rod that glowed up to my nose or face. i passed out.

pretty small.(maybe between 5-10 feet diameter) then i notice that it was moving in a floating motion very slowly and instantly realized this was something highly out of the ordinary. i muttered ufo

if the ball had slipped into a hole or something. i knew my friends had turned around too lately. i was bummed they didn't see it because i knew they could not believe what i had just witnessed, but i still went on and told them anyways, with lots of excitement. then the friend who was sitting on my trunk (or leaning against it anyways) said he saw it. the whole event of my witnessing it couldn't

late one night in june around midnight we had a couple of horses so i went to check on them and feed them. i was at the barn about 30.In as i walked back towards the house i noticed some lights approaching! they appeared to be landing lights like on an airplane, but i had never seen any aircraft approach from that direction before. i thought that was odd so i stopped about 30 feet from the house and watched as the craft approached as it grew near it got larger and larger until i could tell it was no ordinary aircraft as it made no noise at all. as it came closer i could see details and i realized this was no plane or jet of any known types of the times. the craft came within a quarter mile of me and stopped in mid air hovering in place quietly. the craft was so large i could see it very clear\r\ni could see windows here and there as some were lit from within\r\nit looked like something straight out of star wars. it was approximately 250 ft from nose to tail,  500 ft wide, about 30ft thick at wingtips and the nose\r\nbut at center rear it was maybe 100 ft thick on each rear of each wing it had three large rectangular shaped protrusions that glowed red. i figured that must be exhaust ports\r\nmaybe fusion powered. the red rectangles looked to be about the size of a single mobile home, and as i said it made no noise at all. i observed the craft for maybe 4 or 5mins then it turned as if you grabbed a pole and swung around. at which time it headed away from me just as quietly as it had came and in the direction from which it came. now the approach was n,nw to s,sw.Now where we were was about 17 miles from the air port at willmington.I have always wonderd if any one else ever reported this or saw it aswell? i can't think of much else to say at the moment but i remember the incident well i can still see it in my mind clearly to this day i will never forget that night ever.My only regret is that we had no camera to get a picture i asked my mother for one she asked why i wanted it and i told her never mind you wouldn't believe me any way fearing she would freak and make me come in the house. not wanting to miss the sighting i didn't tell my parents what i was looking at until it was gone.I am sorry i didn't report this then but i'm sure you understand. i know what i saw.I can rough draw it too show what it looked like.

(pst) on wednesday, august 17, 2011; left my bedroom (which is a guest room since the temperature in the summer is cooler than the master bedroom); walked down the dark hallway (faintly illuminated by glow of bug zapper down hall used for killing moths from bird seed); entered master bedroom; shut the door behind me (except for a crack); and i could see motion in the dark hallway that looked as if someone walked up to the door and was peering at me. afraid to face the possibility someone was in the house, and knowing the house was bolted down like a fortress (with deadbolts, \"hotel bolts,\" and shatter-resistant multi-pane windows), i used the restroom without turning on the lights. i then cautiously entered the hall and nobody was there, but down the hall, a bright fuzzy white light shined through cracks in locked room. i thought to myself, could it be the bright white energy saving front porch light that has over 100 watts of output? however, as i stared at the illumination surrounding the door and emitting through its threshold, it quickly faded out, leaving the faint illumination from the porch light as i then recalled was always the case. (the mating of the door and threshold was so tight even the bright white light coming through the threshold was non-existent except in a few places, and the light that did get through was faint.) i immediately realized someone was in that room, shining a bright light that must have been an led or hid light due to its intensity. after pausing for a moment to think, i decided to quickly throw open the door and face whoever was there. when i did, the room was empty. i recall getting waves of goose bumps all over my body because i knew something unexplainable had occurred. whoever was in the hallway was the one who disappeared in that room, i was certain of it. as a little history, my family and i have had ufo visitations my entire life, with unusual activity in the homes where i grew up (i.E. time distortions with clocks off in every room, objects hurling across a room for no apparent cause, and other inexplicable phenomenon beyond the scope of this report). in the mid-1990's in my parents��� home i awoke to see a young man in his 20's wearing military fatigues and a helmet standing at the foot of my bed staring at me. at the blink of an eye he was gone. for some strange reason, my immediate thought when this event occurred was that man was in my hallway, although i cannot explain why i sensed it was him again. as a side note i felt in no danger. my imagination ran wild for a moment in speculating who it was or why they were in my house and how they disappeared; was it a time traveler? an e.T.? i'm afraid if they return and i open the door before they disappear into that white light, what will happen if i confront them? these are my observations to the best of my recollection.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or
