(it may very well be a bird; but, that's why i'm submitting it to you!).\r\n\r\nthe photo i'm submitting along with this report is what i call my \"bird photo\"; however, there was identifying information (address visible) in the original, full photograph so i simply kept the original aspect ratio and cropped the photo so that information was no longer visible. i tried to keep enough of the photograph visible so that some sense of proportion will be preserved.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":85448,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.864872314579635,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07292017-0002","longitude":-84.17183454813056,"occurred":1500236880000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1501288952000,"summary":"Black bird-shape high above horizon","tags":["photo","light"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":1501303850822,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/85448_submitter_file1__Cropped.JPG"],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":28,"maxtempi":83,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":23,"meantempi":73,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":17,"mintempi":63,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":true,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":28,"maxtempi":83,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":23,"meantempi":73,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":17,"mintempi":63,"minvism":16,"minvisi":10,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":true,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"45377","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":12,"locationName":"Vandalia, Ohio","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:4311"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"SeaTac","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On the morning of july 28th, 2017, i witnessed an orb-like object following above and slightly stalking planes landing and taking off from sea-tac intl. airport. it moved in a \"lop-sided figure 8\" type of pattern. it lasted 8-12 seconds and the object jetted into the clouds in the back ground.

and my dad. it’s a 40 mile, 24 hour walk, over the north yorkshire moors (in the uk). starting inland at osmotherley, and ending on the coast at ravenscar.\r\nat some point in the overnight portion of the walk (it was pitch black, but a clear night, so lit by stars and the moon), i would guess in the early hours (we’d been walking for some time, and i remember we finished the walk in the morning of the next day), when i was walking with just my dad, some distance from any other walkers, we saw in the sky a group (or series?) of round, bright light, or lighted objects, moving erratically. it being very dark, and the lights being rather bright, we (or at least i, i haven’t discussed it in detail with my dad) couldn’t make out the size or distance of the lights – they could have been enormous and far away, or smaller and closer. i certainly remember their movements – they would hover, totally still, and then ‘zip’ in straight lines, with some speed, to another spot, hover, and then move again. again, i can’t estimate their speed, as i didn’t have any reference for their size or their distance away (it wasn’t close, and they were certainly high up, so it wasn’t that near to us, which leaves me to believe they moved very quickly). i would guess they were visible for 2/3 minutes, before they moved away again (behind what i would generously call a hill, though ‘rise’ would be a better description).","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None, Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then
