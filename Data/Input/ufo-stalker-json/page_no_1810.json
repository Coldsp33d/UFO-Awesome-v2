States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This series of incidents took place in temecula, ca in late 2004/early 2005.\r\n\r\ni was around 16 years old and attended a local high school, temecula valley high. my family lived in a subdivision across the street from the town's walmart supercenter (classy, i know). it was, i believe, my sophomore year of high school and my parents had recently decided that i was being a little mooch expecting rides to school, and henceforth made me walk the mile and a half uphill to school every morning. in those days i was admittedly a big ufo nerd. i read the cheap \"non-fiction\" paperback books and gobbled up the silly, portentous alien \"documentaries\" on tv. i state this upfront to admit that there was probably a bias at the time to the sightings i am relating here, as i want to be as factual as possible.\r\n\r\ni started walking to school each morning at around 6:30am (it took a good 45 minutes for me to get there, and i was always early). the sun would just be rising up over the hills when i'd get going, and some mornings i would see little lights rise up from behind the hills far in the distance, sometimes two at a time. some mornings i could have sworn i'd seen them flying low over distant parts of the subdivision, but to be honest that was probably me being paranoid and silly, and the lights rising up in the mornings were probably planes or helicopters from a nearby port that my eager little mind wanted to be something more.\r\n\r\nhowever, what i started seeing later was certainly no plane, or probably even an aircraft.\r\n\r\nsome time later in the schoolyear, on my morning walks i would look up at the exact same spot on my route and, for a split second, see a bright light, like a powerful star, hovering at the same spot of sky. as soon as i glimpsed it, it would always \"wink out\" in a matter of moments. this happened nearly every morning, after sunrise with the sun already well up, at more or less the exact same spot on the road behind the town's home depot, adjacent to a baseball field. on google maps, the coordinates for the exact spot are: (coordinates removed to investigator field) cms flg 08/16/11 21:40\r\n\r\nthis was not a streetlight, it was not a case of sun glare, and it was not a reflection off a passing plane--even though i am sure that's what the skeptical explanation would be. the light never moved, it was always perfectly stationary high up against the morning blue sky. the way it winked out was comparable to when one stares up at a spotlight that is abruptly turned off: the light seemed to swiftly implode into itself in a matter of nanoseconds. i was never exactly frightened by this apparition (not until later, anyway), but i did feel a mix of curiosity and anxiety. odd as it sounds, it felt like every morning i was playing hide and seek with this thing--i would round the same bend after dawn and think to myself \"i'm going to see you, i'm going to see you!\" and sure enough, the instant i looked up i would catch a glimpse of it just before it winked out.\r\n\r\ni don't remember how long this went on for--a few weeks, possibly a month. the final appearance of this thing that i distinctly remember was the most dramatic, and which put to rest any doubts that what i had been encountering in the mornings was something genuinely unexplained. i went on my morning walk exactly as i had almost a hundred times before. i rounded the little bend behind the home depot, and looked up expecting to see the thing--but there was nothing there. this was not uncommon, as some mornings it did not appear. i didn't think much of it until i reached the spot where the bend connected to the main highway: i somehow felt that the \"thing\" was near me, watching. i stopped cold on the sidewalk, and looked directly above. it was hovering straight over my head, obscured slightly by a low hanging cloud or fog--a big white sphere of light, perfectly round. i could not judge the distance it was above me because i was *terrified.* as with every time before, i saw it for only a few split seconds, and then it winked out over my head, gone. i ran up the hill about a hundred meters, adrenaline pumping, before i got tired and stopped to gasp for breath. i looked back, but it was gone, of course. the skeptical explanation will be \"it was the sun through the clouds, and you mistook it for something else.\" not so, as at the time the sun was still well in the east, and certainly far from a position directly above where i was standing.\r\n\r\ni do not remember ever seeing it again after that incident, even though i still made the same walk to school every morning (although i did so with a heightened level of nervousness!) oddly enough, after that last sighting i pretty much lost all interest in ufos. i realized that the extraterrestrial hypothesis was ridiculous and made no sense in the context of what i experienced--why would beings from across the galaxy fly all the way to earth to play peek-a-boo with a chubby high school girl?\r\n\r\ni try not to draw any conclusions about what it was. the furthest i will go is saying that i definitely believe that whatever it was, it was intelligent (well, it seemed to be at least) and not of human origin. if i were being fanciful, i might even say that it had a sense of humor, scaring me and all that last time. i do not believe it was any kind of craft or machine--at no time did i see any mechanical body associated with the light. it just seemed to be a huge, white orb. i make no assumptions about its motives, either.\r\n\r\ni have lived around the world since then, and i must say with a tinge of disappointment that i have never seen anything like it again, although i do look up every so often, vainly hoping.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":30945,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.4998891,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08162011-0011","longitude":-117.1441848,"occurred":1107269400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash,

file the report, then went back outside with my husband onto the side porch. this was about 8:15 pm. the sky was still clear and blue, not dark yet at all. an object caught my eye in the sky and i pointed it out to him. we both saw an object that was basically the same as the first one we saw, moving in the exact opposite direction, as if it were the same object we saw earlier returning from wherever it had gone. the object was cigar shaped, about the size of an long ibuprofen pill. it was bright white, as if made of glowing white light, with a dark spot in the center. my husband grabbed the binoculars and we both saw that this time there were not flames coming out of one end, but when we saw it earlier it definately appeared to have flames coming out as if propelled by them. it was moving to the southwest, towards the general area of yale. we watched it for about 4 mins, and it got smaller and smaller as if moving farther away. we lost sight of it once it passed the treeline, by this time it was quite small. my husband and i are both educated, sober, healthy and solid of mind. we know what most \"normal\" things in the sky look like. this had no wings. it was not an airplane. i know it is possible that this object was metallic, and reflecting light from the sun, and that is why it appeared so brightly white. however it did not seem metallic or manmade to me whatsoever,  it seemed to be made of white light. if it was manmade, it was of some material i am not aware of. a few hours ago i was searching youtube for \"cigar shaped ufo's\", and i was surprised to see videos posted that looked exactly like what we saw. i have seen a stealth bomber fly through the sky before, and they appear quite otherworldy and totally silent, eerie. i know that the government and armed forces most likely have/are testing new technologies and crafts that we the public aren't aware of yet. perhaps this cigar shaped thing is one of those? i do not know, but it was most definately

gettig the rest of our things out of the car when something in the night sky caught my attention, i glanced up at the mountains and saw lights in the sky that look unusual.I thought at first it was a blimp or maybe a laser light show or something, but how could they accomplish what i was about to see when i focused in on the ufo. i was astonished what i was looking at, it was the most amazing thing i ever saw. to acually see a ufo sighting so close to view, i was just in aw!\r\nthe ufo look somewhat transparent with small white lights in the center of the ufo that made a circular pattern which looked like one big light and we're the biggest of the lights on the ufo and had many other smaller lights on each side that ran parallel to the ufo, but not in sequence. some white, blue ,orange, green and perhaps other colors i could not determan since i am somewhat color blind. the ufo stayed in one position for quite some time huvering over the san bernardino mountains.\r\n i spent about 20 minutes looking at it until i decided to go inside the house,who would believe me anyways? i asked my son if he remembered that night but does not remember, since he was somewhat intoxicated that night and told me he somewhat recalls seeing something but really to his knowlege he does not remember. unfortunately i did not have my video camera on hand, since it was not charged. i could see the entire ufo in plain sight, i never thought in my whole life i would see something so amazing as that. so the real question is was it a ufo or was it militry or what? but i tell you one thing, i know what i saw and it looked as real as can be and i would be willing to take a lie detector test, because i know for fact it was real and was truely amazing and unexplainable. i only have the memory of what the ufo looked like, i wish i had more evidence but i don't i'm afraid.Do i believe in ufo's yes, but my friends and family think that i am just crazy when i bring the subject up. no i'm not crazy,i do believe they are out there. i'm hoping to see another sighting over the mountains and hopfully i will have my camera in hand next time!","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

people. i was expecting to catch the usual activity thinking a light would turn on or off like usual. instead what happened turned out to be much more interesting. in this clip you'll see what appears to be a plane... watch closely as what we are lead to believe is a front head light or landing light changes from white to red! now it has 2 red lights! i believe this violates faa lighting regulations because there should only be one solid red light on port side (the left wing) and depending on the aircraft maybe a blinking red anti collision light on the fuselage. this is to help other pilots determine who has the right away... you can look up aircraft navigation lighting if you're interested. once it turns the front light red it slowly turns what should be the left wing tip from red to white. this is followed by the entire thing getting extremely bright. i'd love to hear mufons opinion on this one. \r\n\r\ni'm go to link to the youtube video even though i know they'll take it

street at the park. as i almost always do as a sky watcher i happened to look up as i started walking south down my driveway, just to check it out. as i did i instantly noticed a singular, extremely bright, almost auraish, white light moving across the sky in a north, northeasterly direction. not a satellite!!!!! i have seen many, many, of these over the years and this was at airplane level. not anything that i have ever seen bfore. especially considering the brightness, the abrupt flight path change to the east, northeast, absolutely no sound, and the fact that the light did not lose brightness or change as it moved off to the east out of sight.  i almost did this last night just because it`s something i have never seen before, and the boys witnessed it. so again tonight on 8-15-2011 i walked outside to the driveway to have smoke about the same time just to witness the same thing, but a little farther north this time. i did call the same son outside to witness it but he thinks i`m just over reacting to an airplane with landing-gear lights on. landing-gear lights tend to disappear as they move away from you though. anyone else see this and report similar? or any radar reports available for the area that you could check out? i have never seen this flight path in the area ether; i`ve lived here my entire life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! searching for answers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

is in the natomas area where there are a lot of open fields and the variety of birds are very diverse. there were two hawks flying due north overhead singing to each other when their path crossed with another hawk. (i had never seen that many hawks in one place before). they began to dive and sing. it almost looked like they were fighting. as i watched this event, out of the corner of my field of vision i noticed a bright light in the sky. it was very small, like a large, bright star. it was 11:25am so it was warm and bright outside. it was fairly high up, probably about 75 degrees to 80 degrees off the horizon. using the hawks as a measuring point it looked like it was very far off in the distance compared to the birds who were flying at about 100 ft above me and about 50 to sixty feet from my position on the ground. i could not gage its size but it was big enough for me to see it from that apparent great distance. it was bright and shone in the sky like a star, completely silent and white.  as the birds continued to fly away towards the north the object stayed completely stationary. i kept watching it and pulled out my iphone to take a picture. the object did not turn up in the photo. i was watching for about 5 minutes or so while smoking my cigarette. during this time i didn't let it out of my sight. after my cigarette had burned down it remained for a minute or two. then suddenly the star simply vanished. it didn't shoot out into space, it didn't burn out or turn off. it just simply vanished into thin air. i was excited to see it. i looked for it every chance i got to come outside all day, but alas, it was gone for good it seemed. when i walked back inside the building after the incident, i looked at my picture i had taken and it was just of the sky, that was it. nothing. i did see something. i know i saw it. why the camera couldn't see it i don't know. maybe the camera wasn't powerful enough, i had the zoom all the way up and the iphone 3gs has bad resolution at full zoom. i was excited to have seen it, but very disappointed no one else was there to see it as well, and that the picture came out horribly.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":30932,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.62129971661492,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08152011-0024","longitude":-121.49015971360366,"occurred":1313432700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1313472300000,"summary":"Large bright starlike object completely stationary then vanished without a trace.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Sacramento, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:41537"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Croswell","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"7:20 p.M. croswell, michigan. clear blue sky, daylight. i was sitting on my side porch with my husband, looked up and saw strange cigar shaped, ibuprofen shaped object, bright white with dark spot in the middle, at about airplane height. moved at about the same speed an airplane would. no wings. it was not an airplane. it moved in straight path and seemed to be moving farther away (growing slightly smaller). my husband grabbed binoculars and through them we saw flames coming out of one end, as if it was propelled by fire. it looked like, perhaps, a missile, although i have never seen a missile. it also looked like what i would imagine a thruster that falls off a space shuttle might look like. i saw this object in the same area, and moving in the same direction of sky where i have seen the orange yellow orbs, which i have made past reports on.\r\nwe lost sight of object when it moved past the tree line. i included a photo of sketch i made of what we saw through binoculars.

and thought it couldn't hurt to share my story. growing up in fairbanks, ak, especially living by the airport, i'm used to seeing a lot of air traffic. with a major airforce base also nearby, it's common to see and hear interesting things going on overhead. i've also seen a lot of movement late at night that i can't explain, but this particular experience is unlike any other i've ever had and has left me a believer without a shadow of a doubt. it still gives me chills to this day. \r\n       i had just started college at uaf and was living with my mom and dad at our family home on fairchild ave. near the fairbanks international airport. my room was on the second floor. it has a limited view of a few neighborhood houses and then a distant tree line visible. \r\n       i was sleeping sound when all of a sudden i was compelled to sit straight up in my bed, jerk to the left and lift the blinds. i didn't know why i was doing this and didn't even have time to think about what i was doing before i was already up and looking out the window. i was in control of my body, but it was as if someone had a very persuasive influence over me.  then i saw it. it was extremely large and hovering very low over the not so distant tree line. i can't tell exactly how big it was, but i know for sure that it was huge, at least the size of a football field. it was completely still and completely quiet except an indescribable sound that seemed to be buzzing/echoing in my head. i was virtually hypnotized by it. it was a flat metallic grey color with windows and little boxy, structural designs along the sides.  it seemed to be a more flattened triangular or trapezoidal shape, though i can't be sure because i was seeing it mostly from the side. it had little bluish/white lights lining the sides and was visible for about 10 seconds before it took off so fast that it seemed to disappear before my eyes. \r\n       the really chilling part about this whole experience was that while i was seeing it, i had the intense feeling that whatever it was wanted me to see it there. it knew who i was and was \"looking\" at me. this was no top secret military exercise. this thing had a strange, otherworldly type of influence over my mind and body. as soon as it disappeared the air came back into my bedroom. i couldn't go to sleep for a while after that because i was so overwhelmed and curious/concerned as to why it wanted me to see it there. it woke me up to do so. i know for a fact that this was not a dream and i was 100% awake and alert and freaked the hell out. i haven't seen anything like it since. i've only told a few people about this, because unless someone sees it for themselves, they will never truly believe.
