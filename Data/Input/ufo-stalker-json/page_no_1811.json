i dont know much about choppers but i didnt think they had models that were so silent. after seeing the chopper out there we shut the blinds and were scared to death,1 minute later we hear this absolutely odd screeching high pitched drilling sound right outside our house - it sounded like someone was drilling or sawing the side of our house. alright by that time i had it - i went and grabbed by 7.62 russian rifle,my brother was horrified and called the police screaming at the dispatcher to send the police to our house that second and that someones outside our house,my brother an 18 year old adult was crying he was so scared. my grandmother during all this was in her bedroom sleeping,by the time she got up my brother was on the phone with the police and she took the phone from him and talked with the dispatcher,the dispatch told my grandmother - oh it just the military doing maneuvers. so is part of military training sending a chopper out to someones house to hover 25 feet in front and 30 feet above shining a spotlight directly in their window?????? i dont think so. i myself believe somehow they knew we filmed those orbs and seen the video on youtube. i dont know,what i do know is that someone in control of a chopper was sent to scare the hell out of us and they succeeded in their job. the noise.... i'm yet to find out what in the world that was,never before or again have i heard that noise. my grandmother also heard the noise from her bedroom. the call from my brother has to be documented in the police archives here. after it all settled we deleted the video from youtube. it is seen on youtube now however,a while later we got the video uploaded to youtube again and have not had any problems yet. now i did some research online and fellow people here in gaylord also reported seeing these orange orbs the exact same date and exact same time as we did - march 30th 2010 around 8:00 pm. we seen the orbs an additional 2 more times over the past year and my grandmother seen them by herself just a few months ago. i have recently purchased an hd camera in hope of catching these orbs again,there is something very very strange going on in our little city of gaylord. thats my story 110% as it happened with no nonsense attached. i just felt i have to let someone know what happened to us that night,i cant hold it in. and i am scared reporting my story to this website,let me say i'm going to be watching my back after i submit this... thats my event and it changed my life.

surrounded by what appeared to be a cloud.I had seem this cloud for 3 days. it did not move. and it was the only cloud around. the rest of the sky was clear and it was dark in color. \r\nat first i thought it was a storm cloud. but the weatherman never said anything about rain. but it never moved for 3 days. and it stayed in the same spot and height. it has been a while. so i might not remember everything. \r\n    anyway. it was about 9pm. i went outside. and focused on the cloud to see if it was still there. i was outside for about an hour. when i saw a small lighted object appear in he sky. i shined my spotlight at it. after a few minutes maybe 5. i saw theese bright lights  off to the north of me.At first i thought it was a plane or jet. there were what seemed about 6 lights in a vertical row. \r\n    as i watched i saw it start to descend. at first i thought it was going to land at the airport. but it was to big. as i watched it i noticed it was getting closer to where i was. and as it did the lights went from 6-4-2-1. i thought for sure it was going to crash. then fear set in. i hid behind my car. \r\n    my son was with me now.I would peek over the top of the car as it kept getting closer. then i told my son i think were in trouble. next thing i know,i saw it pass slowly by me and my son. and now it was hovering just above the treetops. no more then 12ft. from us. or at least 10-12steps away. \r\n    as it hovered i tried to move to a better spot to see if i could see anything on top. and i saw what might have been a dome. anyway it was between 10:15 10:30pm by now. my son was knelt down by the car. i was able to get to a spot from a short distance. i could see part of it. the other was hid by the trees and the roof of my house. anyway, i told my son. i am going to walk over to it,and stand underneath it. \r\n    as i approached my fear was gone. i was now standing under it. and i could feel an energy beam around me. and a slight humming noise. i could also see a light surrounding me. i was looking at my son and i was talking to him, but he couldn't hear me. and it was like i was talking into a fan. i could see fear in his eyes. then i looked at my watch it was abt 1030 or so as i stood underneath it. \r\n   when i looked at my watch again, an hour had passed , i noticed as we walkedf away. i don't remember if my son stood underneath it with me or not. i tried to talk him into it. but just can't remember if he did or not. then we walked away from it, as i turned i saw it take off. i don't remember what happened after that. i go some stories i could tell. btw, i been trying to talk to someone from mufon or any place that deals with ufo's. but no one has come around. just to let you know.  \r\ni can spot them at night, if i want to as long as the sky are clear. and its good and dark. oh before i forget i want you to know i have other wittnesses from other sightings who were with me when i saw other crafts. i am sorry i don't have any

(shower).  had been out there about 1-1/2 hours, saw about 10 meteors. not a great showing with the full moon.  we were just about to give up for the night; i stood up still staring at the sky hoping to see a straggler meteor. then saw an orange-yellow light.... like a very very bright star. i told the others. at this time one of the six people had returned to the house, but there were still two adults, two 17 year old kids and one 12 year old. at first i thought it was a plane but the light never blinked. we all saw the object, i thought it was slightly oval, my brother thought it was a round light; my son thought it was slightly oval.  my nephew (the 12 year old)  thought he saw the actual lights, he described it as having yellow light bulbs hanging from the bottom��� no one else thought that, maybe he has the best eye sight, or the best imagination. it slowly descended behind some trees, not straight up and down, but at a (maybe) 15-20 degree angle��� again, very slow. we could see it behind the trees here and there, for about one minute, and then it was so low we finally lost sight. we waited for about a half hour, to see if it ever ascended (it never did).  it was due north; there are no airports anywhere near then��� nothing but the small town of farmington.  my brother estimates it was about a mile and half away.  i have no idea, i���m not a good judge of distance when i have no idea how big the objects was��� to us, it appeared about the size of a pea.\r\n   we are about 30 minutes from the pease international trade port (previously the pease af base. there was an air show during the afternoon (and again this afternoon) but the airport is in the complete opposite direction.  there were planes out and about, but they were very clearly airplanes��� blinking lights, and most were close enough to hear the engines.  this would appear to have been closer, but no sound what-so-ever. \r\n\r\nearlier when still watching for meteors, we saw about 5 other unidentified objects slowly moving across the sky. these were all like tiny distant stars, that were moving across the sky. all different directions, opposite of the meteors, some even appeared to be coming straight down.  i have seen satellites through binoculars before, they were similar but the light was random as the sun caught them��� these objects didn���t seem to blink or dim (until they were lost in the light of the moon).  these were like tiny stars, even appeared to be as far away  as the stars but we know they could not have been.  i really would have thought them to be satellites if they appeared to be tumbling but they were not. \r\n\r\nplease let me know if you have any questions.   \r\ntake care\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

of the black hills of south dakota. i awoke around 4am and went outside of our cabin (for some unknown reason) to  have a look at the night sky, since i am an avid skywatcher. there from the porch i looked to the west when i saw an extremely bright light flying at approximately 1000 feet towards the south. this object flew at about the same velocity of a private airplane and was pulsating the same as an arc welder would (with the same light intensity) with intermitant flashings of faint red and  blue lights... red on the left side and blue on the right side of the object. this sighting lasted several minutes when i noticed a 2nd identical object about to cross its path traveling from east to west. this scenario played out for sveral more minutes until the objects crossed paths about 3 0r 4 miles away from me. the object then faded from my view. this is not the first sighting of this kind i have had in fact, this is the 4th time i have awakened at this time of night, for the same inexplicable reason. it seems that i am being awakend from my sleep just to observe these kinds of objects. at first i thought it was wonderful but now i am concerned as to what reason this has been
