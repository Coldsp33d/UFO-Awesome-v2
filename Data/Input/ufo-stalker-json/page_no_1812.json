garage.It was around midnight and under two 150 watt floodlights. i had that odd feeling of being watched and looked toward my neighbors homes. i assumed that they were not happy with me making noise outside at midnight. understandable of course. i looked at the one story building across the ditch at the end of my backyard and something caught my eye. an object seemed to be over the building about 200 feet above it. a moon-less night made the glare of the flood lights rather intense so i walked up the steps and turned off the lights in no hurry. i turned the lights off to appease my neighbors and not because i really thought that something was hovering over a building behind my house at midnight. that idea seemed pretty unlikely to me. but it was there. it remained motionless long enough for my eyes to adjust to the dark and to see it reasonably well from the lights in the parking lot of the g.E.S.Store. the object was approximately 65 feet long and 15 feet thick and shaped like a pressed medicine capsule with a flat ridge around the circumferance. after about a minute of observation the object rose vertically to an altitude of 500 feet and made a random series of right angle turns. imagine a school bus that is 700 feet from you, going 100 miles per hour and making right angle turns. i am not a physicist but i do know that making right angle turns at 100 mph(several turns were much faster and 180 degrees) is not possible. it was as surreal as watching a disney cartoon. at that point i had that strange taste in my mouth of being utterly helpless. the object left at an oblique angle and rapidly disappeared into the night sky. my outlook of what is and is not was forever changed. i saw an object, in the air, executing directional changes that are absolutely impossible. the vehicle would fly apart and any occupants would immediately be crushed. the instantaneous g loads would be beyond astronomical. i was then, and remain, very skeptical. impossible- but i saw it.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

specked out.  what i though was interesting was the fact that as it took off, a skunk walked out of the bushes on the side of the road and walked along side of me all the way to my house and kept going.  like it was more afraid of the object in the sky than it was of me.  i've never been so happy to see a skunk.  i saw the object again when i arrived at my house, now at 12:35am.  it seemed to

overhead regularly and it was much larger and higher altitude. i brought it to my brother and friend's attention and we began watching it closely. it seemed to drift and then hover and then pulse. when it was obvious that it wasn't a plane or a planet(i used my skyview iphone application to debunk any planets around or visible... there weren't any visible in that area) we went and got our binoculars and realized it had a specific shape. a triangular shape with at least 3-5 distinct circular orb like shapes at each point with what looked like electrical current running between all the points. i began taking zoomed in pictures with my iphone and then grabbed my expensive zoom lens canon camera and rapidly took about 302 photographs. for some reason my cell phone battery went from 88% to 18% within a matter of 15 minutes. this also affected my friend's cell phone battery power as well. it increased in size and rapidly pulsed and while i was watching it thru the binoculars it seemed like 3 other craft split from the center leaving the original object less pulsating and only white light... the other three objects had the spectrum of light in a pattern and were darting to various points and hovering with the colored lights pulsating in a pattered around each craft. the shape of the original object seemed to change as well and become more of a disk like shape. the other 3 objects with colored lights were boomerang shaped. we drove at least 20 miles east to rockwall, texas's lake ray hubbard. we parked and continued to watch the objects but they decreased in size and weren't pulsating as much as before. by5:30am they seemed to be gone.

out at my request at a point between blackhead and roundtop mountains so i could hunt bobcat.  where they let me out i marked the side of the road with a pile of stones and proceeded into the woods heading into an area called devils canyon.  i only went approx. 100 yards toward the canyon when i came to a clearing.  when i was at the edge of the clearing i saw a large object in the center.  i asked myself why would anybody put a building in and isolated place like this?  i crouched down at the edge of the clearing and checked out this (building).  upon further examination i evaulated what i saw.  what i saw was a landed flying saucer the bottom of which was mostly flat only curving up thward the outer edges.  it was about 8 feet over the ground, i could only observe 2 landing legs, the thlird one had to be on the other side. i then saw 2 very tall what appeared to be olmost stick figures who were communicating with each other. i could not hear what they were saying nor did i see any facial details. they were at the far end of the craft.  this craft had a band of dull lights about 12\" high and each color segment was about 24\" wide the colors blended into each other, violet, orange, blue, green and all colors that may come out of a prism.  there was a low but audable humm coming from the ship. the top half of the craft had a small dome about 2' high x 3' wide, what strucck me as odd was that it was not centered on top but toward one end. the entire craft was about 12' top to bottom.  i spent about 15 to 20 min. taking all this in.  i then heard a click and saw what was a walkway coming out of the center of the ship, it stopped and a third figure came down to the ground and walked over to the other 2 figures, the 3 communicatd and the one that come down pointed right at me where i was hidind at the edge of the clearing. one stood there one went left and one went right.  they were in the process of surrounding me.  i decided it was time to go. i had an 8mm mauser with me, put it on 1/2 safe and backed up the way i came in. i hid in the culvert in the side of the road.","distance":"20 Feet or

rotate and switch positions while in this spot in the sky. the lights were larger than the stars, but i could see the night sky through and around the lights.  the fact that there was no structure to be seen was really curious. the lights never blinked and did not move across the sky like the stars do. the most remarkable aspect of this was seeing the lights rotate and switch positions so fast and high up in the sky. i witnessed this for three nights in a row, and then one night they were not there. however they returned the night after.  i called my mom in to take a look. i remember it scared her and she closed the blind to my window, but she does not recall this memory.  what is even more curious, is that nearly 20 years later a friend of mine i had met while living in delaware told of a

than burning out or flicker out. the timeframe from the point it caught my eye to its disappearance was maybe 2 seconds no longer. also the sighting was above the treeline and no building or object

looking at the sky (out in rural ohio, you can see every star) to see if there were any meteor showers. in the corner of my eye, a small red and white flashing light caught my attention. it appeared to be small, so i thought it could have been a helicopter. as i stared at it, i noticed it was hovering slightly, so i discounted it as a helicopter. i then continued to look at. then, my dogs began barking for no apparent reason, and i noticed the flashing light was actually moving towards my house. i hid on the side of the house, out of the object's view. when i looked again, the light was hovering about ten feet away from over the driveway, and about 20 feet in the air. i was paralyzed with adrenaline and fear as it started slowly ascending back into the sky to the position it began in. i did not want to try and take a picture with my cell phone, fearing it would light up my face and the object would see me. i went inside to retrieve my sister so she could see the object in its original position. we brought the binoculars, and looked at the object. it appeared blurry, but still flashing. then we noticed there were two other small and white flashing lights located in a line formation across the street from us in a field. those too were also hovering and appeared high up in the sky. we have seen these three blinking lights in the summertime for the past 5 years, but never has one come over to our house. the next night we went out to see them, and they were not present. on august 10, 2011, we were able to see the flashing lights over the field again.
