and noticed 3 lights in a triangle pattern in the sky. they didn't seem very high in the sky, maybe 200 ft or so. they kinda hovered and moved slowly and changed direction a couple of times but when it did it was slow in doing so. at the time i really didn't think too much of it but watched it for approx 4 to 5 minutes because i thought it was odd with absolutely no sound at all and no airports anywhere near the area i lived in. i did not think at all to document it since i at the time i just wrote it off that it had to be something that would be explained easily, i did live approx 15 miles from pratt & whitney in palm beach gardens. i lost sight of it when i got in my car to go to work. it was still moving slowly hovering kind of but now moving away from me.\r\n\r\ni am reporting it now for documentation purposes to see if maybe someone else may have seen it as well.\r\n\r\ni was watching a program about a year ago and saw what i saw and realized i should have watched it longer and tried to at least shine my light on it. i had a very powerful flood light in my car but obviously didn't want to get in trouble for shining it at an aircraft.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

approximated, however i am certain of what i saw and many of the details are still with me in my memory.\r\n\r\nabout four years ago and during the middle of the afternoon i left my house and began driving on a road just around the corner.  i reached the first stop sign, no more than a minute away from my house, and saw something above me in the sky.  now i don't know if it was shock, or panic, or disbelief, but i was in such a frantic hurry to step out of my car and get a better look that the second my hand found the door handle i literally fell out of the side of my car and onto the road.  i stood up and watched as an enormous black triangle moved away from me, traveling in the opposite direction that my car was facing.  i remember it as being very low to the ground, and surprisingly silent.  it was moving so slowly that i couldn't believe it to be any sort of conventional aircraft.  down the bottom of each side were (maybe four?) round lights.  i stood and watched as it moved slowly away from me, at which point my memory of the sighting is finished.  i cannot recall if i watched it travel out of sight, or if it simply disappeared as it does as i try to relive the experience in my head today.  i remember being in such a state of shock throughout the event that any notion of taking a picture with my cell phone never occurred to me.  immediately afterwards, however, i saved whatever details i could into my cell phone as a draft to the person i had been texting with most recently.  this was because i was so hurried in preserving what i could that i simply opened the fastest medium on which i could record.  the words i saved read something like \"low, silent, black triangle, lights down each side.\"  i then returned to my car, turned around, and drove straight back home.  any intentions of continuing to wherever i was heading were completely forgotten.  i told a few people, namely my parents and a couple of friends, what i had seen, but i was just met with skepticism and a condescending disbelief.  i haven't talked about it much since then, however i have seen remarkably similar images portrayed on various ufo sighting tv shows.  in fact, i just finished watching one which put the incident back into the front of my mind, and now i feel so compelled to share the encounter with someone who might put the information to use that it has been driving me crazy for the past hour or so.  if i find the cell phone on which i saved the draft, i will also find the specific date and time of the incident.  i haven't even tried searching since i am currently so obsessed with getting this out.  i hope my description helps, and i would appreciate it if anybody with additional or relevant information might contact me.

other witnesses.  the object was closer to my location than the day before or a little north and a little closer west.  there were a few more clouds on tuesday but passed in front of the object.  again it was very high up.  since then i've seen airplanes flying very high and from my perspective, they looked to be about 1/4\" in length whereas this object was even much higher than the highest flying planes i've seen and both objects appeared very similar in size and compared to the high flying planes was only half the size of them.  i had to go back into work at 5:15pm and the object was still stationary as i walked through the door.  this makes 2 days in a row, in slightly different locations but at the exact same times.  i obviously had my eyes to the sky yesterday, but didn't see a thing and watched at 5, then again at 7 for half an hour and again at 9:30pm for 15 minutes and didn't see anything.  i'm not there tonight but i damn sure will be tomorrow night.  again this sighting included 4 of us and i don't think any of the other witnesses would mind giving their personal info if necessary.  i would have thought if it were a planet or star, the object would be visible for a few days in a row but not being an astronomer, it would only be speculation.  tell you what though, i haven't been this excited in a long time and hope i have many more reports to make to

pointed out the three bright lights, they looked liked street lights. one light vanished within 5 seconds, the other two dropped straight down about two inches in the sky, then also vanished. amazed we werent able to peel our eyes from the sky. we then noticed 2 flashing red lights travleing away from eachother, one to the north and other to the south. the light travleing to the north was keeping a steady pace when without any manuvering it did a 180 degree direction change in the blink of an eye and was now travleing south. as we kept watching it came to a complete stop in the sky then dropped maybe 3 or 4 inches in the sky to come to another complete stop. at this stime we noticed the other red light doing circles, 90 degree turns, up, down, left, right. they both lloked like a fly buzzing around in the sky. these two red lights never vanished, but kept flying around. a little while later we saw what we thought was two fighter jets head southwest, we watched them fly out of sight and display no odd flight patterns. within a couple minutes we saw what we thought again was 2 fighter jets headed due south now, as i kept watching one drifted off from the other now headed west, as i kept watching the othere headed due south i witnessed the same odd flight patterns as earlier, a fly in the sky. after that we all went to bed. \r\ni get home real early in the morning on monday the 8th to find another real bright light in the sky just like the first ones we saw on thursday the 4th. as soon as i saw it displaying the odd flight patterns from the other night, i ran and got our telescope. throught the scope i was able to clearly make out a perfectly cicrcular object. the surface looked like that of a basketball at first, kinda rough with dark lines and black spots on it. i could look away long enough to blink a couple times and the surface would appear completely different then before. while i was watching it all of a sudden it went all dark, invisible to the human eye, but was still able to make out its perimeter through the scope. not even a minute goes by and the object lights back up. i was able to see that same one until sun up that morning, even after the sun was up a little bit i could still see the reflection off of the object. that same night i witnessed over 30 of those red blinking lights from thursday the 4th. looking through the scope i could identify them as all looking the exact same, all of them were circular or sphere shape, all of them had the same changing surface, and all of them had some internal light source, their surface looked transparent. i could see a rainbow of colors insdide each one. this is now thursday the 11th and i have sat out the last three nights and observed the same objects with the same flight patterns. one night there was one bright enough that i could see it through my little digital camera, i have over a minute of video displaying the odd flight patterns, buzzing around like a fly in the sky. after i took the video i counted the individual red flashing lights that i dentified to be all the same, i counted 57 of them. i dont want to look up anymore ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

looking for my arrived at final destination,when i started having a difficult time with the address i needed to find.As i was driving on w park ave west bound heading towards hwy 81.I was driving fairly slow,may be 10mph..When i noticed a pulsing bright sphere coming towards my direction.At first i thought it was a helicopter in the nightsky,but very soon i found out the light source was acting very abnormal for it to be a helicopter or a flying low craft airplane.The bright circle of light it had stoped and started pulsating and dimming its own glow,it remind me of a flash light in the dark running out of battery,pulsating on and off but in slow motion.Thats when i decided to stop the truck and turn on my flashing hazard lights.There was no traffic out in any direction so i stayed calmed and knowing that i could of   grabbed  my camara,it was one of those moments when you feel.. if you do! ,,you will miss out on what you are witnessing. i kept staring at it when its started moving slow towards me on the large 18wheeler rig.The glowing sphere got above the left side of the driver side, around 800 to 1000 ft in the sky.I noticed that it had descend from where it previously was , about 2miles down. as it paused above i was able to identify a much closer description of what i was witnessing.The sphere was a mass of yelloish glow with a clearish bubble form.The edge was pulsating a dim glow of soft yellowish gold light and the internal mass ,was a solid moving blur of some alive energy radiant glow of yellow light with some sort of blurry motion .It stayed above my left side ,which was south for around 3 to 4 seconds,there was a guy walking a large pitbull dog, not even aware of what was taking place above nor the dog.In a matter of 3 to 4 seconds the object retrieved back to where it was at first,at a tremendous speed. i felt almost like if it knew someone was paying attention to it,or the blinking lights of the truck had it come down to check on me.For a few seconds it  stayed put pulsating on and off... a few more seconds when slowly came back again ,very slow hovering by passing me. the lightsource was floating in a wabbling path motion,it also looked bubble like, clear and jellyish shape by then  it continued east with out any noise this whole time.I had my door window down, when i looked out still following it with a firm stare and saw that it had stoped above the information towers about a mile behind me,on the south east side of norfolk.The sphere hover above the towers in the center at an altitude around 100ft above the towers.By then i stare for another 20seconds and notice a redish glow appearing on the bottom of the object,like if it was copying the flashing red lights of the towers or becoming red to fit around the nightsky enviroment. thats when i decided to leave and felt i had seen enough.I end up driving away and finding my dropped place.The next day ,i had to drive south on hwy 81 ,i had to pass right by norfolk airport and did see a military army green truck there and a soldier dressed army cammo.I cant say for sure if that army staff at the airport had anything to do with, what i had seen the previous hrs.The one thing left me thinking was how the glowish sphere came close to were i was , once i had turn on my flashing hazards lights?..And i also noticed on my gps,that the place were the  ufo could had come from at first was by the far west of norfolk,which is nebraska national forest and reservoir.This west massive area of land is so large that its spreads out meeting with the unhabit lands of the state of wyoming and the south national grasslands of south dakota.After having this experience, i was left with a need of an explanation ,may be someone else in the area did witness the

acting very abnormal for it to be a helicopter or a flying low craft airplane.The bright circle of light it had stoped and started pulsating and dimming its own glow,it remind me of a flash light in the dark running out of battery,pulsating on and off but in slow motion.Thats when i decided to stop the truck and turn on my flashing hazard lights.There was no traffic out in any direction so i stayed calmed and knowing that i could of   grabbed  my camara,it was one of those moments when you feel.. if you do! ,,you will miss out on what you are witnessing. i kept staring at it when its started moving slow towards me on the large 18wheeler rig.The glowing sphere got above the left side of the driver side, around 800 to 1000 ft in the sky.I noticed that it had descend from where it previously was , about 2miles down. as it paused above i was able to identify a much closer description of what i was witnessing.The sphere was a mass of yelloish glow with a clearish bubble form.The edge was pulsating a dim glow of soft yellowish gold light and the internal mass ,was a solid moving blur of some alive energy radiant glow of yellow light with some sort of blurry motion .It stayed above my left side ,which was south for around 3 to 4 seconds,there was a guy walking a large pitbull dog, not even aware of what was taking place above nor the dog.In a matter of 3 to 4 seconds the object retrieved back to where it was at first,at a tremendous speed. i felt almost like if it knew someone was paying attention to it,or the blinking lights of the truck had it come down to check on me.For a few seconds it  stayed put pulsating on and off... a few more seconds when slowly came back again ,very slow hovering by passing me. the lightsource was floating in a wabbling path motion,it also looked bubble like, clear and jellyish shape by then  it continued east with out any noise this whole time.I had my door window down, when i looked out still following it with a firm stare and saw that it had stoped above the information towers about a mile behind me,on the south east side of norfolk.The sphere hover above the towers in the center at an altitude around 100ft above the

followed, by the same distance, by a pair of 2 orange globes perpendicular/side by side, to the path the first 5 were following. the original 5 slowly faded, but the 2 following behind split into different directions, separating by about 45 degrees and stayed until the others had disappeared. checked 'heavens-above' and the nasa web site for orbital satellite info, because that was our first tought. they were probably com satellites in a procession. no information about satellites in our region at that time.    \r\n\r\nthis is the second time we've seen these over this area. \r\nthe previous time, september 15, 2010, they were much lower, around 10k feet, and there were only 3 fireballs. we could make out an actual globe as the middle one, which seemingly was on fire on the front

when these things are seen to see if it is a flare from a known satellite or re-entering space junk? \r\n\r\nand i don't know about affecting me psychologically but my husband sat up all night. it was really disturbing and not easily explained. i know there have been a rash of these \"orange fireballs\" lately, but they aren't planes. no landing lights (my husband used to work at an airline and can

goofin off when i spotted a light comming thru the trees....We were at a green surrounded by high trees so u couldnt see far off in the distance as the light got brighter we were fixated on it as it came closer and it came to a hover right over the treeline above our heads the craft was so close i could have thrown a rock and hit it it made no noises at all u could hear crickets and nothing else it scared me so bad i took off running down the fairway to get out from underneath it i didnt know if it would fall on us but they stayed underneath the object bout 75 yds out i turned back to look and everything was weird kinda like time stopped or something i stood there frozen thinking we were gonna get beamed up or something and the craft sat there motionless without any noise whatsoever it looked to have sum kind of running lights but the bright light i had org saw had gone off .....Well like i said there was no noise at all and in the distance u could hear apache helicopters from the local airport/armybase and within about a minute of hearing the helis the craft slowly receeded back into the trees and we couldnt see it anymore and the apaches were straffing the area low level flying they were very loud u could hear em from way off but u couldnt hear the craft maybe 50 ft above us i cant tell u how big it was only tht when it came over us i had to run to get out from underneath it i dont know how to explain this i have felt crazy for a longtime and would think i was crazy if my cousin and friend werent there i dont tell people about this and we dont talk about it

pace at about 70-80 miles per hour at about 1/4 to 1/2 mile up. it was very clearly a triangle shape and had very define points to it. we were both very baffled as to how something that shape could be flying in the night sky. the sky was free from and clouds and it was very clear out. as it passed by it blocked the view of the stars so we knew we were looking as a solid object. it was a very surreal feeling to be looking at this object. it kind of scared me a bit as well. being a very logical person i was going through things it might be in my head as i was analyzing it as it flew over. there was nothing that i could logically say it resembled that i have ever seen and i have seen many tv programs in military aircrafts and prototypes and this looked nothing like anything i have ever seen in my life. i would say the size would be in proportion with a 747 jet. it had 3 very dim square light at each triangle point. the lights were a white glow similar to a florescent bulb and they were casting a glow in between each light showing the triangle shape. as it flew over we noticed that there was no sound what so ever and as it passed us we could see the back of it as it glided over us. it was perfectly flying it a straight line and parallel to the sky. it never pivoted of veered off course. after it passed by we got a very good view of the back of the craft. it was a flat dark surface about 15 to 20 ft high. we continued to watch it until it was out of sight. i have to say that was a very eerie feeling and i will never forget what i saw that night.","distance":"101-500

i saw a huge disc shaped dull gray metallic object hovering at what looked like the north half of downtown kansas city directly to my west and slightly north.  you can see the kc skyline clearly from the high hill i was driving on.  as a ufo investigator, i shouldn't be shocked by anything, but in this case, i was very surprised by what i saw, especially since i had received a report earlier in the day from a witness who described a similar very large craft in south kansas city.  \r\nthe object did not move and i saw it clearly for two to three seconds, which was long enough to know i saw something. it was a disk shape, with flat sides, and a domed top.  i could not see any details or lights.  i estimate the size to be 5 miles wide.  i immediately called several people i knew and other mufon field investigators to see if they could see anything from their vantage point.  \r\nafter i arrived home, i found that i had left my good cameras at the office and only had my cell phone camera (it figures).  so i went outside and started taking random photos of the sky.  just as i turned the camera off i noticed what looked like a commercial jet flying at high speed and low (maybe 5,000 ft or less) and almost completely sideways with both wings clearly visible!  it was banking hard to the left heading from northeast to southwest. that type of manuever is usually reserved for smaller craft and fighter jets, not a commercial airliner.  the jet was a silver and peach color - the peach may have been a reflection of the sun. i tried to get the camera ready again but was not fast enough. total time in view was approximately six seconds. right after the jet was out of sight, a large round white object the size of a dinner plate at arm's length with a hole in the center appeared and disappeared in the exact same location as where i first saw the jet appear, or when i first noticed it.\r\ni then posted a message to the missouri mufon chat list about what was going on and after receiving some other messages put together a timeline of events. \r\n-12:15 pm - a witness called to report a giant ufo over south kansas city (see other report filed)\r\n-1:30 - 3:00 pm a ufo spotter and photographer in topeka, kansas (72 miles from kc) photographs multiple ufos in \"battle mode.\"  he has been able to capture ufos on film using a special method and ab uv sunglasses. \r\n-2:00 pm - a kc mufon member reported a large number of uh-60 helicopters flying very low at treetop level at 125th and state line in south kansas city.  this is definitely not a normal occurrence for that area.\r\n- 4:20 pm - i saw the large disc over downtown kc, then the plane and white disc. \r\n- 5:20 pm - a mufon field investigator saw a strange cloud with structure north of latan, mo from his vantage point across the river in kansas. \r\n- 10:30 pm - my daughter called, she was watching the skies and saw a black helicopter with no markings flying very low at tree top level in independence, mo, just a few blocks from my house. \r\n- 3:00 am sunday - st. louis, mo- a mufon field investigator and her entire neighborhood were awakened by a very loud strange banging and humming noise along with what sounded like gunfire, that lasted for several minutes. the vibration seemed to be coming from a spot in the sky. they have not identified the source yet. \r\n\r\nnote: i don't know if this is related, but since it is also strange i thought i'd mention it. the next day (sunday) a big storm came in very quickly with high winds that caused a large number of power outages throughout the city and took our power out for 7 hours.  just prior to the storm, i took my nikon camera outside to take some pictures as it came in. i had the camera set at 1/200 sec without flash and multi-shot mode.  i took 6 pictures in a row, then analyzed them.  in one shot out of the series there are multiple orbs in my yard, and in subsequent photos there are tiny red and blue lights that can't be explained. no rain was falling at that point.  after taking the photos, i went inside and the lights flickered on and off six times.  i then took a nap (which is unusual for me) and was unaware that the power had gone completely off.  i was in a dead sleep, and was awakened by a loud static noise with lots of voices talking at the same time coming from the radio.  i sat up and looked at the radio, but the power was out so it should have been impossible for that to happen.  \r\n\r\non monday, we had two guests and a guest speaker from st. louis mufon attend our monthly meeting. after it was over we were standing outside talking and i saw a bullet-shaped white line, then a white crescent shaped object appear and dissapear very quickly. these were west of our location in westport in kansas city.  no one else saw anything. i am surmising that some of these objects are things that come into view for a short period of time, and are noticed by clairvoyants like me, but not by others. perhaps they are entering or exiting wormholes, or are cloaked somehow and uncloak accidentially for a few seconds.
