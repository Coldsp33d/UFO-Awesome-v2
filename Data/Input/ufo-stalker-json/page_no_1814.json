the front porch when i see an object which my first thought was a shooting star.  the area i am in when this event took place has many shooting stars every night and immediately realize it wasn't. i point and say oh s*** and the two people im with turn and look the whole time my focus remains on the object. i noticed it because i was staring right where it seems to appear out of thin air.  it was a ball of light that resembled an egg/oval/missile leaving a pretty large trail that glowed just as bright behind it.  we watched it cross the sky for about 3-5 seconds when it accelerated and the object itself expanded or glowed brighter and disappeared. the way i felt during the sighting was complete shock and awe because i thought i was witnessing an awesome shooting star and instantly realized it wasn't at the point i knew it wasn't a shooting star i knew immediately it was a ufo not a doubt in my mind.  after the sighting my adrenaline was rushing and was also a little bit freaked out.  to be honest i believe in et, aliens, other intelligent life but when i witnessed this event it put to rest any doubt there may have been.  and niether myself nor the two other persons i was with were under the influence of any type of drugs or alcohol which would be further proof that what we saw was really there.  after the whole even i did notice a plane flying in the area the object was seen, but there is a flight path to hilo international and may have been a commercial flight.  to add to the previous sentance the object seen was flying across the flight path and did not resemble anything close to an airplane-at least not one that exists on this planet that i know of.  also there was a cruise ship clearly visible at sea with all its lights on-im assuming it was a cruise ship but am more then certain since i have seen them pass by before.","distance":"20 Feet or

airplanes or flying vehicles, i don't know flew all straight west. there were/was around 15-20 aerial crafts that flew all straight west....All had lights...Nothing way crazy but a large amount of traffic that i've never witnessed before and like i said i come out and watch the sky every evening and see typical airline traffic coming in and out. never have i seen this high of volume go straight west towards those object. then the most notable craft i saw was in teh shape of triangle....Orangish red lighted ends and and orange light in the middle. it flew very slow over my neighborhood and seemed at an altitude of a recent airplane take-off. it flew west and then started to turn vertical and seemed to go more southwards. \r\n\r\nwhen i first saw that object i then began to feel overwhelmed. it was like something was going on...Like \"are we under attack by the chinese or something?\" it was a very unusually high amount of traffic plus didn't hear any rumbling or engine....Lights were solid where airplanes usually have some blinking light.\r\n\r\nduring the incident i immediately called my uncle and talked to him while it was happening after the one noticeable aircraft flew over me. the objects kept heading west till i couldn't seem over the horizon.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

vcr player. unfortunately i didnt have a tape inserted. the camera is located approximatively 10 feet east from my bedroom window. the camera is partially hidden by a tomato plant that i have planted in a pot on the edge of my driveway. at 2:30am i was sitting in bed surfing the web on my home pc. i glanced up at the tv which is attached to my wireless inferred security camera. i saw an object hovering directly in front of my camera. the object was rectangular with a definite outline all the way around. there were 2 diamond shaped in the middle of this rectangular bar. the diamonds were spaced evenly apart and evenly from each edge on all sides. it was directly in front of the camera and appeared to be investigating the small red inferred lights that make a circle around the lens. these lights are fairly bright and can be seen from a distance away. the object would hover towards the lights directly in-front of them than back up aways. it moved sided to side, up and down, towards the inferred lights and than away from the lights. each time coming back and looking directly into the lens as trying to figure out what it was. the movements were fast and sometimes appeared jerky.  the further away it went each time the fuzzier the object became. when it was directly in front of the lights hovering, the object had perfect shape and the diamonds were very visible and each diamond the same size. the further the object darted outward the less the diamonds were visible. the further out it went the fuzzier it became. i could see there was something dark in the center of the rectangle but couldn't make out the diamonds until it zoomed closer to the red inferred circle of lights as if almost touching it but never doing so.  \r\nwhen i noticed this object on my tv i immediately stood up between my bed and the window that the object was at. i than dropped to the floor fearing the unknown. i slowly stood back up and turned off all lites to the room. i peaked out the side of the curtain and saw my camera but nothing else. i looked back into the tv and the object was still there and very visible. darting up and down, back and forth, and side to side. fast movements. i turned on the outside light that is approximatively 15 feet from my camera and the object. i returned to my bedroom with the outside light still on. the object was the same with no change from the light being on. i couldnt see anything thru my window only on my tv. the outside light glowed on my camera to give me some vision. i still saw nothing thru my window. after 40 from first seeing this object it disappeard. poof...Gone!\r\nthis same scenario happened 2 nights in a row at the exact time of night.  on the third nite i noticed a limb from the tomato plant was broken and blocking any vision in front of the camera. the broken limb of the plant is directly above the camera about 1 inch. that third nite i turned off the camera being the broken limb was obstructing all vision in front of the camera. it was late and very dark so i didnt venture outside to move the limb. i live in a small community outside the city rochester minnesota a fairly large city. there is lots of wooded area where i live. my car was parked inside the garage and there is no street lights where i live. there was nothing in the driveway but my camera and tomato plant...And this object. i have a new pc and for some reason it wont allow me to use my scanner, download or upload. i cant seem to take over ownership from microsoft. which leaves me with read and write privileges only. im

(lexington, ky) it was approximately 6:30 pm and the sun was still very bright in the sky. it was a cloudy day with large billowing clouds. temperature was warm to hot. while sitting at the stop light i looked to my left (i was the driver of vehicle) and i noticed an amazingly beautiful cloud formation. it looked almost like a hand holding a ball of energy... which of course, was the sun. there were beams of light beaming all across the sky. i immediately grabbed my iphone and told my husband to look at the clouds. he glanced at it, but i told him... \"no, seriously, look! its gorgeous!\" at that moment, i started saying out loud to myself, \"please dont turn green. please don't turn green. (speaking of the stoplight.)\" i grabbed my iphone and i took a series of 9 photographs of the cloud from out of the rolled down window of the car. these photographs were taken very fast. i believe all were taken in a matter of seconds because the camera on the iphone is rather fast. this proves to be very important since the photos show the object in question moving in different directions. something i believe may be worth mentioning is that we believe the light skipped us... in other words, it did not turn green for us when it should have. my husband made mention of this because he was frustrated and making a joke that if i hadn't \"begged\" for the light to not turn green, that we could have already made it across the street. this is ironic, simply because if the light had turned green when it should have, i never would have captured the picture, and i especially would not have had those extra seconds to take more than one photo of the cloud. so, not another thing was said or remembered about the cloud until i went to bed that night about 2 hours later. i laid down and remembered the photos and i wanted to pick the best one i took and post it on facebook. when i went to look through the photos, i did not immediately notice the object in the picture. then suddenly, i saw it. i thought, oh, thats probably just a cloud, moon, speck, whatever. but then it was in the next picture, then the next, then the next. and if you flip though the photos very fast, it appears to be moving at a very high rate of speed in different directions. and since i took the photos in under 8-10 seconds, i know there is nothing i know of that looks like that or can fly that fast. the object appears to be an orb or sphere. it is glowing white with dark shadows within the orb. it appears in the second photo suddenly. seeming to move toward the camera. then it glows with a aura of pink surrounding it almost in a saucer shape. this could be a glare from the bright sun though. it then shoots straight up very fast. im definately not a scientist, but i don't know of anything that could move that fast. also, in one photo, after close observation, not only does the orb appear in the photo, another 3 \"white dots\" appear to the center right. my guess is it is another orb that i caught in the photo that was moving so very fast that it left tracers behind it. again, i did not see this with my naked eye. neither did my husband. this all appeared in the photos. after realizing what we had possibly photographed. i had no clue what to do. after internet searches i was able to find the mufon site and the name and number of the former ky mufon director. i called him and spoke with him for a good hour or so. i emailed him the photos and he said he would forward it to the new director. i have not heard back as of yet. as far as my opinion goes, i may not be an educated researcher on things like this, but common sense and deduction and research go a long way. the biggest top 2 possibilities in my mind were that the image could be the moon. except its moving and after finding out where the moon was located, which was in the east, i ruled that out, since the photo is taken toward the west and we were facing north. the other thought was that it could have been a planet, but the size and the fact that it was broad daylight eliminates that. as well as the fact that it moved very fast. in retrospect, and to this moment, i am forever changed. i truly believe that what i saw was a true ufo. no question in my mind, yet i am anxious and willing to do whatever it takes to investigate this occurance, nothing like this has ever happened to me, and although i have always been very openminded to the possibility, i never truly had faith in something like this until now. i have this feeling that no one will believe me. but frankly, i could care less. i know myself, my friends and family know me, and i know that i'm not lying or pulling a prank or trying to gain recognition etc. these photos are as real as they come and i encourage and truly plead with those in the position to investigate and who have researched these events, to please call me, contact me, etc., and i will do anything and everything to help you. i want to know what i saw. please please contact me or send me info on someone else i can contact. i don't want a huge amount of time to go by before this is researched and analyzed. mainly because i want to be of the greatest assistance, and i'd like everything to be fresh in my mind as well as the photos. please note, i have 9 pictures in sequence, and i could not upload them all. in the first picture you will see the pink glow around the orb, this was taken a few pictures into the series. the next photo shows the orb moving a great distance upward. also, on the center right hand side, there are the 3 bright dots. it may not come across as clear uploaded from my computer as it does on my iphone. and the third shows it even higher in the sky.

got to redstone, nm in the gila national forest headed south on highway 15, i was looking out the rear left passenger window around 10:10 pm trying to identify the constellations i was seeing when suddenly a lighted object came flying towards our car at tremendous speed, i tried to alert the other people in the car but could not speak - they said i exhaled roughly and made an uff! sound.  they turned down the audio book we were listening to and asked what was wrong and i told them about seeing the ufo.  no one else was looking out at the sky at the time.  my first thought was that is not an airplane or anything we could make it flew way too fast.  it was saucer shaped - entire bottom was lit - but the top was dark. from the direction we were travelling it would have come from the southeast headed northwest.  at first it looked to me like it was headed straight for the car and it passed relatively low - much less than the height of a regular airplane - from far away it was just a very bright light but it grew bigger as it approached - by the time it crossed out of my sight over the car it was the size of just larger than a golf ball.  the sight of it took my breath away and that's why i couldn't yell - hey - its a ufo - besides - it was flying so fast - u would only see it if u were looking right at it at the time.  afterwards, everyone else was staring out the window to see if it would come back - while i was praying in the back seat that it would not - i was afraid.  we had no cell service and we were in the middle of nowhere...","distance":"501 Feet - 1

flight patterns. the object decended and then vanished into the air. then, i saw another one. i ran inside to get my wife and she came out into the driveway. we saw several star like objects moving in the sky over about 1/2 an hour. one decended at a rate that is impossible. i would estimate about 20,000 ft in less than 2 seconds. we then tracked one along and it completely vanished right in front of our eyes. we saw another one that moved across the sky and then stopped. less than a second later it took off at a speed that is absolutely impossible. i would estimate that it went from 0 to 5,000 mph or more instantaneously. we saw another one fly directly into a cloud that had lightning flashing. \r\n\r\ni have been out there every morning since that first experience and i have seen them every single day. at least 4 or 5 per night. they look like flying stars. i started taking my binoculars out with me and this is what i saw this morning.\r\n\r\n2 of them flew right over my backyard. about 10 minutes apart....On the exact same flight path. i was standing behind my truck when the first one came by. i got my binoculars on it and i rested my elbows on the tailgate to keep the binoculars steady.\r\n\r\ni saw a jellyfish type looking creature that appeared to be a living creature. it was oval shaped and had a black center. in fact, it much resembled a human blood cell. it had a glow in the dark type appearance that was blue. it appeared almost to be a blue glowing gelatin like substance surrounding some type of nucleus. it had a bulb type bottom and top and had like two bumps on either side that made it sort of look like a stretched out flying gelatin blue jellyfish saturn. sounds strange...But that is exactly what i saw and i saw it quite clearly. semi transparent. it's almost like you can see right inside it.\r\n\r\ni have no idea what it could have been....My final best description is.... it was a blue, semi transparent, jellyfish like, dark nucleus in center, it appeared to be living, glowing, saturn type look to it. i ran inside to tell my wife, my adrenaline was pumping and my hands and voice were shaking. i simply could not believe i actually saw one close enough to see what it is. i tracked it for as long as i could and it vanished in the distance. another one came by about 10 minutes later but i could not get a look at it like the first one. i know what i saw. i never really believed before but i know....There are unknown things flying in the sky. no one can ever convince me that there is not something out there because i clearly saw it. truly unbelievable.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Straight-line
