noticed a point of light moving thru the sky. i thought\"a satelite\" or something like that. i laid myself down on the front step to watch it.There was \"some\" cloud cover moving slowly over head (west to east). i was watching this point of light moving south to north, when i noticed what looked like maybe 10 or 15 points of light, moving together from south to north. i  then realized that it wasn't just 10...It was 30, then 50, then a 100. i realized i was looking at hundreds...Like maybe 3 to 5 hundred points of light. i stood up. i couldn't believe what i was seeing. it was as if the stars were all moving!!!!! i watched the event for maybe 3 minutes or so. then they were gone. out of sight. but wait,...Now there are more of them. only, this group is going east to west. i thought maybe this was some kind of illusion created by the cloud cover moving overhead. so,...I held my cigarette pack up against the sky..To provide a \"stationary object\" to use as a guideline. yes, they were indeed moving past my cigarette pack...Rather quickly!!! i still didn't believe it. so,...I got a pole out of the garage, and steadied it on the driveway. yes,..They were moving. all of them at the same speed(no particular formation) it took about five to seven minutes for this east to west group to go from horizon to horizon(that's fast). they had the appearance of \"stars in the sky\".Very high up in the air,...Maybe outside the earths atmosphere...I don't know,... because i don't know how big they actually are. i've seen alot of weird stuff in the night sky,...Never anything like this

be \"seeing a steadily increasing amount of activity\" in our night sky. particularly in the north, and west, and straight up overhead.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

for about 10 days since having seen the glowing orbs from afar. every night i have been outside around 10-11pm and have mostly seen star like objects that move, pulsate in color lights (mostly red to

into my view after it cleared the neighbors tree. it was at the level of a low plane. the light was very bright and at first i took it as an airplane but it was not so. it appeared to have windows (?) where i saw only white light. i did not see any wings attached. i detected no sound as i watched it pass over the downtown crossroads arts district and toward liberty memorial. i was excited to see what i believe is a true ufo, at a safe distance. i have been wondering if maybe if they know i am watching them and for a moment i looked down and refused to look at it. i guess i am frightened by them but also fascinated and so i can't help myself with looking.  \r\n\r\nthere were 3 tail lights (?)in the rear and the light flashes alternated at a steady pace. there was a low cloud, patchy cloud that it flew into and that was the last time i saw it. my husband watched saw it for about 30 seconds, analyzing it's pattern. anyhow, after we thought it was gone and all was done...We saw a red light flash that reflected into the clouds that the object entered. we both saw 3 streaks of red light on the clouds. weird. my husband said that the object was most definatley gone after that.

brighter, surpassing the brilliance of the first by a small margin. unlike iridium satellites, these two objects remained at peak illumination for maybe 5 to 10 seconds before fading. my impression is that the objects were self-illuminated and not reflecting the sun. both objects seemed to veer slightly to the northwest as they passed overhead. both objects faded out one after the other and could

movement. the lights were very very dim, you could actually see them better if you didn't look directly at them. they were a reddish color. we saw several \"sets\" of 5 or 7 lights fly over us (don't remember what direction they were coming or going) over the course of 15 or 20 minutes. there was maybe 1-3 minutes between one set of lights and the next. the lights were always in the same

went directly over us and continued on in a straight line distance. there was no sound.\r\nthe lights did not waver, blink, or change color.\r\ni hadn't thought about this event in years until i saw something on tv about the phoenix lights. what people saw in az was exactly what i saw in ks. except that they were smaller. if i were to stretch out my arm full lenth, the width of the formations we saw would probably be about the length of my hand. and the lights were much dimmer. the average person walking down the street that night would have noticed because the lights were so dim. to see this, somebody would have had to been looking closely at the sky to begin with. the 2 friends that were with me didn't see them at first

a better look.  my wife grabbed our sony 8mm camcorder and began filming while we were trying to keep an eye on all the weird orbs.  \r\nthe orbs came from the direction many airplanes travel, however, these were neither airplanes nor helicopters and we began questioning what these objects could possibly be.  there was no noise and they flew in a distinct formation and path for their exit.  the orbs were slowly hovering while moving in a directional path.  the orbs were a red that is somewhat hard to this day describe with certainty.  the orbs traveled from the ssw to the north and then flew west and then the red orbs faded out in order they arrived at a certain spot we noticed. \r\n one of our children ran to our neighbor���s home right next to us so they could see and witness what we were clearly witnessing.  the neighbors daughters boyfriend answered the door, stepped out to look and immediately ran into the house uttering ���oh my gosh���.  the daughter came out and witness

of here). i observed it, without any mention to the other guard, for just 10 seconds or so, when suddenly it appeared to move south very fast,at that very moment it disappeared, going from extremely bright to absolutely nothing.    my first reaction was \"what the hell is that?\" though i said nothing then or after to the other guard. i have an avid interest in astronomy, and can say beyond doubt this was not any meteorite, planet, etc. it was much too bright,and much larger,and did not appear to be moving until it suddenly accelerated south very rapidly,and then nothing. not like any aircraft, i see planes all the time when i'm working, this was not a plane. i am a senior guard at this business, well respected and trustworthy, like i say i am always looking to the sky, and this was unlike anything i've ever seen before. please contact me if you please, though there's not much else i can really add. thankyou!

the road and i was facing east. i saw 4 strange lights in a weird pattern i decided that something was not right so i knew the road i was on went out into the desert so i went about 5 miles out of town and now there was 8 lights in the sky in different patterns from horizontal lines to rectangles to circles. as soon as i got to the desert there was another car already out there and one soon showed up and then a few minutes later there was 4-5 cars including mine. having a truck and it being the desert i went out as far as i could and i go to i would say about 2 miles away. i was standing lights of and i knew they were not airplanes because they were just sitting there but being so close i also didn���������t hear any helicopter noises  i took a bunch of pictures and the last one was when they were in a rectangle and then they started to circle the city it seemed and then they all started going towards the ground and where most of them flew i knew there was departments so i decided to head out that way and i think i saw one on the ground but as soon as i parked my car a cop seemed to appear out of nowhere and he asked me if i had a problem i responded if i was trespassing and he said i wasn���������t and so i started to tell him about the lights and showed him the pictures. he then proceeded to tell me that there are new aircraft that hover and don���������t make noise but i haven���������t heard of anything like that. i said i should go and he goes good idea and as i was turning my car around he turned left to go where the lights had seemed to land. the whole cop thing seemed rather suspicious and it just didn���������t feel right i was out in the middle of nowhere and i didn���������t even see him coming but take that for what it is worth. i then went home and looked up the number to call and report i tried calling a couple of times and it was busy and then i started to see the lights again this time they were heading south and they were in a horizontal formation i went had gotten gas and that���������s when i tried take more pictures and only one came out and it seems really weird. when i was looking at the lights i was able to get through and the person told me to try and get as many people to look and report. i got in my car and started to head south but they just seemed to disappear rather quickly i saw them and then i didn���������t see them i tried waiting around but then i had to be somewhere at midnight that is why i am writing the report so late. i will include pics in the email and try and describe them. the lights every time i saw them where just white and they did blink but only sometimes and i didn���������t see any other color. also no noise at all and moved methodically \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. i was in my car driving east but the picture is sorta north  bad pic \r\n2. weird s shape  i am about 4-8 miles away first sighting facing east\r\n3.After they started circling one was left faceing east\r\n4. the red thing is what i saw on ground only pic i was able to take before cop showed up and i had my phone zoomed all the way in.\r\n5. one of 2 pics of second sighting.\r\n\r\n6. second sighting facing south i am in the ditch and i took this and i was looking at it closer this looked really weird so i pinch zoomed in on my phone and the zoom is photo 7 i am

said that there were no aircraft from kingman in the sky that night. so i decided to call the 3 closest millitary bases and the marine air base and nellis said that they had no aircraft over kingman that night. i then called luke air force base and the person told me that they were probably just flares set off by a 10 warthogs which is the same reason they gave for the 1997 phoenix lights case. i am trying to make this go viral but these circumstances and getting weird.

and looked up over the trees in the back yard. just over lake sherwood. and a disk shaped object was hovering up and down and left to right. i could see it as it tilted and it would reflect a round shape. then it would be vertical as too see it directly the side side veiw which then it appeared very clear with the night vision. i thought i could stand to see it but it would become invisible. so i sat back down. then i could watch it as it hovered, shifting around but only moving witht the scope just a few inches from side to side and up and down. it was mostly visible as it seemed to try and vanish. but it couldnt. i couldnt beleive what i was seeing only throught the night vision so i had my girlfriend look from where i was sitting. she said she could see it as she watched it for about a min. she was very frieghtned and wanted to go inside. you could not see this with your own eyes at all. as i stayed and watched it for a bit longer. i thought it could be a reflection from some where. but after staying and watching it , it finnally moved to the west ins a sudden movement about 6 or 7 inches to the right.Then stopped. it hovered then slowly moved behind the east tree. it came back out horizontally and hovered went back behind tree came back out same way . went back in and came back out vertical and side veiw so it was clear to me and took off and dissapeared in one second. i would not have been able to wittness this event if it wasnt for night vision. a week ago we both had an event of a 70's vw wagon sive floresant looking light about 1,000 feet in the air pass over our home very steady and slow. about 20 mph with no noise to it. maybe a slight electrical like humming, very faint sound. i feel like they know i am looking at them. i am a bit scared now, but i have seen many things over the years. as if i know when they are around. but these 2 events have really shakin me up ! god bless ! i am not making it up as god as my wittness, so help me god we both

just moved, not turned, unlike an airplane would turn with its head in the direction of where it's going, the triagnle didn't turn, just shifted from left to right and then out of my sight (because my rooftop blocked my vision).\r\nit was a sunday, and i'm pretty sure malaysians do not have fighter jets or would fly anything on a sunday especially during fasting month.\r\ni live in an area where

nor does it fit the pattern of satellite trajectories.  two other sitings i should mention were when i was out with my telescope doing astrophotography.  the first, several years ago, involved a very bright object, moving at a tremendous speed, from west to east across the lake, essentially going from horizon to horizon in seconds.  no sound heard.  no colored lights.  the second was in late summer of 2009.  i was up on a ridge behind our camp with the telescope.  while doing a bright star alignment, i noted a bright, disc-shaped object suddernly becoming visible over the western drop-off.  because of the elevation, i thought at first that i was seeing a plane with its landing lights on.  however, this object stayed in the same position for several minutes then just winked out.

walked out to the curb and noticed a large well lit object coming across the sky.  i decided to watch it to see what it was. i have a large pine tree in my front yard with a wide umbrella of branches.  i thought it wise to stay in the shadows of the branches as the object approached. it flew directly over my house. it was not moving fast, like an airplane would.  as it crossed above me i stepped out from under the branches to get a better look at it, the sky was very dark, i could barely make out the shape against the stars.  i heard a humming sound as if it had fans running. the object had eight very bright lights, which made it obvious that it was not an airplane, it was not flying in the direction an airplane would.  reno is to the north of where i live, that is the only airport in my area that would accommodate an aircraft of that size. it appeared to be about 100' above the trees. it was flying from east to west towards lake tahoe across the carson valley. there were no lights on the rear of the object. i was wearing black pajamas and felt reasonably certain i would not be seen. i did not feel i was in any danger, i was curious as to what the object was.  later i had seen a clip on the news of two young fellows who had video taped with their cell phone an object that looked exactly like the object that i had seen. it took several minutes for it to cross the sky.  also, i
