110 freeway heading north. while driving i saw bright lights behind a large building and half of an object hovering. intrigued, i watched it while trying to drive safe until i drove far enough to see the entire ufo. it was disk shaped with white lights circling a disk shaped object and a light in the top, center of it. it could not have been a plane or blimp because it was extremely low and close to one of the large downtown buildings and it made no noise. i was able to keep an eye on and follow the object for about a full minute or 2 (it's hard to recall time during such a shocking experence but i had a good clear look for a well amount of time). i think it was approximately the size of a massive airplane, the kind that can hold hundreds of passengers. as i drove along it flew in a pretty solid path into the distance, away from the downtown area. unfortunately, i lost sight of it while going under tunnels merging onto the 5 n freeway. by the time i lost sight of it by changing freeways, it had made its way pretty far off into the distance in a short amount of time, basically it had to have been moving really fast. this was a pretty intense experience. i was in shock, questioning my sanity and sight, trying to rule out what it could have been, shaking like a leaf, sweaty, and pretty much in pure shock/excitement while trying not to crash on such a hectic freeway. i'm sure hundreds of other people had to have witnessed it and i can not wait to hear of another witnesses experience that validates mine. i'm still pretty shaken up and keep replaying the experience in my head. because i had a great view of it for so long i kept thinking about trying to take a picture, but because i was driving, scrambling through my purse in a shocked state did not seem like a good idea.","distance":"101-500 Feet, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

notice the star is indeed swaying toward and away from the wall very strange like. therefore, i decide to capture this moment with my hand held camcorder when i notice a whole new perspective. viewing this object through my camera, it appears to be moving much more dramatic and forming different colors (such as the red/blue shift). at first, i thought it was my shaky hand causing the erratic motions.  however, the next day i look more closely at the footage and notice when the object stops moving erratically three balls of light form revolving very tightly in a sphere pattern then back into a single ball of light. my first impression was that these balls of light was trying to communicate in some foreign language by displaying these foreign characters resembling that of our own arabic language. or perhaps it was simply my shaky shooting that caused all these interesting character looking shapes. \r\n    several months pass and nobody else has seen this swaying star in the sky, not even the astronomers to my knowledge. however, july 4th 2010, a young boy sitting just behind me with his father awaiting the fireworks says these words...\"daddy, that star is moving..\" i immediately turn around and say \"finally! someone else is witnessing what i have seen.\" goosebumps on my arms appear as i locate the same \"star\" this little boy saw and now i'm starting to think something is not right. now i feel obligated to share this with people other than my family, so i call in to bobby bones show 96.7 fm a local morning show days later and reveal to them what i have on tape. however, they did not seem to be thrilled about it at all. moreover, in my opinion, my footage wasn't/isn't convincing enough to get too excited about. which is why i am here contacting you guys

(too powerful in this case.) it was somewhere around 8 pm to 10 pm.  the sky was very clear.  i was facing east/north east holding my binoculars.  i noticed movement to my right.  i looked over to my right to see what i at first thought was a jet, not oncommon around selfridge airforce base, but uncommon in the direction it was going which was almost exactly from west to east.  but there were no lights on it at all. it was dull grey.  the size would have been correct for the jets we usually see going in a different direction to selfridge before landing. then i noticed that there was no noise for what appeared to be a big jet. so looking more closely, i was surprised that i could see spaces between 5 objects, possibly egg or oval shaped in a v formation.  then my first thought was i was watching canada geese, which i quickly found out was incorrect - because there was no flapping or wing movement which i would have seen from the size of the objects. the movement was absolutely smooth and quiet. at the same time, i was shocked to see some reflections going past the underside of these dark objects. now i'm excited because this is something totally unknown to my senses.  i'm holding 20 power binoculars in my hand, and the objects are now over the lake and getting darker since there are no lights over the lake.  (if you've ever had 20 power binoculars, you know that you are looking into a very narrow field of view.  if i want to see a jet airliner in the sky without a contrail, it's close to impossible to hone in on it with hand held 20 power binocs, if you can, it will take a lot of time, and holding still is impossible.) so i remember thinking to myself, they're going out of sight soon, i have to either keep looking with my eyes, or try to get lucky with the binocs.  with the binocs, i would see exactly what at least one of them was.  i went for it, lifting the binoculars frantically trying to find waht was up there - to no avail!  i took a chance, and lost.  they were out of sight, over the lake.  this whole scenario took probably less than 20 seconds.  the next day, i thought of calling the radar station at the detroit airport, but decided not to.  i figured from what i have heard, selfridge wouldn't report anything anyways.  i'm sure this is a usless bit of info here, but if you do have time, let me know if anyone else has ever reporte anything remotely like this.   thanks for your time.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":30708,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.48478835319719,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08062011-0069","longitude":-82.88325665540133,"occurred":783666000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1312677012000,"summary":"Thought at 1st it was a low jet, then noticed spaces between parts, then thought  geese, but no flapping","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"48081","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":6122,"locationName":"St Clair Shores, Michigan","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:43231"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Antelope","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Its may 25th 2011, my schools graduation im a senior in highschool and i have just graduated my last year as a highschool student, im excited for our sober grad night and i am waiting in our schools cafeteria. the people in the cafeteria had told me i didnt need to be back for the bus for sober grad night until 10:45 so i decided to call my mom to pick me up as im walking out to meet her at the front gate my cousin,(anonymous) sees me ands like hey dude congrats wanna go get a starbucks or something? i said sure man lets go lemme just go tell my mom, so my mom gets here and i go tell her hey sorry for making you drive here(we live around the corner from the schoolish area) and i say im going with lets call him jim, i said me and jim are gonna go get coffee, she said alright and i get in the car with jim and his friend shes a girl well call her michelle, michelle is driving id say about a 2000 camry with a sunroof, nothing special just a typical average car, we start driving to starbucks which is about a half mile away from the school walking distance easily. as we pull out of the parking lot and get on the main road which is located directly next to the side of the school thats when me and jim see it, michelle driving and paying attention to the road and singing to the radio did not see the ufo unfortunately, but anyways so were on the road and what i see next has affected me to this day, i see this teal donut disc shaped object about id say 200-300feet in the air and about 50-100 feet infront of us, i was sitting in the back seat and i happened to lean forward and when i leaned forward i looked through the sunroof and it was at the exact instant that i looked up that i saw the object come from what appeared to be a wall in the middle of the sky, meaning it had a 90degree straight edge behind it, i dunno how to explain it but it looked as if it just came from behind a black sheet or from what i still fail to admit but another dimension is what it looked like, the object came into full view about id say a half second later it appeared like it came from behind whatever a lil slower than shot out like a speeding bullet traveling as fast as the black jets i see everywhere, its going at a slightly diagonal angle and is moving extremely fast next thing i know its gets to the tops of these houses on the other side of the road and than it picks up speed astonishingly fast, and i mean it was to a point that the whole thing had brought tears to my eyes about how unreal it was, i couldnt believe what i had just witnissed me and jim were both shaking and yelling what in the fuck was that? over nd over again, when it had picked up speed however to what i swear on my life had to be lightspeed, because it had left a 15-20 foot lightstreak behind it that was very bright and disipated out of the air rather quickly, all i know is that the fact that it came from behind the wall has affected me greatly since, i remember feeling as if when i was staring at it in the beginning when it was coming from the wall that it was communicating with me, because since that day ive gotten this strange veryyyy strange deja vu that baffles me to a point of depression,you know how normal deja vu hits ya and its like woah deja vu, mine was like woah deja vu at first but than it stayed, and would last up to a an hour and i felt like in a way i had seen all of what was goin on already or before i guess, its hard to say that with out sounding crazy i know but i mean im a health 18 year old kid who played football for to years, taken photography classes my whole life and extremely passionate about not lying, its the worse thing anyone can do especially about a subject like this is lie about an experience, so when i tell you this deja vu is still occurring on a daily basis, its by far the weirdest thing ive ever experienced, on another note id also like to say that before this i was skeptical but open minded about ufos i was in the mindset of yeh they prolly exist but all the youtube videos of ufos are basically all the same sketchy footage blurry shaky and bad quality, than i thought after months of trying to look up anything similar to what i saw with no luck that 90% of the videos are fakes, cause at this point after researching so many videos and information about it, its to a point where if i would have gotten this on tape it would be on world news right now. end of story. i know for a fact that this object a lone on film would have had to make the president make a public adress about some bullshit about what it is or to just tell the truth cause what i saw, there is not a single possibility it was from this earth. period i will stick to that statement until i die, i can account for strange happenings besides the deja vu as well after the incident has occured i have no idea if it indeed has any relation to the ufo but 3 days after the event me and a couple friends decide to go see hangover 2 this is the first time i can account for the deja vu,during the movie i got a weird stomach ache and kept telling them i wanted to leave because i had felt like i had already seen it, all the scenes playing were like i had already seen them heard the lines everything it was paranormal in  a way , i tough it out and sit through the movie emotionless because i cant even enjoy the movie the deja vu is so bad, when we leave im sitting in the back seat and its my friend and his brother up front, were driving back to his house and we go under this underpass sorta deal its like a railroad bridge and abut 40 feet after that theres a sign, as were approaching the sign i see this white figure flying on the ground like 1-2 ft off the ground it goes across the road and lands on top of the sign and right as it lands we get next to the sign i look to the side and its a white owl staring directly at me and i mean it wasnt just facing my direction its head was looking at me, and as were driving past it i turn fast to look out the back and its head is following like me i guess thats what it felt like, so weird and so hard to explain this i dunno how open minded people are on this website, but its almost as if something has changed in me i see the world completely differently than i used to, its a very negative feeling and i have this anxious feeling that im waiting for something, i remember getting the same creepy feeling from the owl as i did from the teal disc. i know this is long but its cause this is the only time ive been able to express this to the public in a way that i actually feel can shed some light, the second part to this and the second ufo is not seen by me at all but by my cousin jims sister on the same night that we saw ours about 10 minutes after we see ours i called my sister to tell her about what i just witnissed and he called his when he calls his he starts freaking out and im like what? what??? and hes like she saw a fuckin ufo too and im like no she saw the disc thing? ask her and she said no but what she did see was what she thought was a shooting star but when she looked closer she said it wasnt going away and than she said thats not a star shape at all thats a triangle she said it kinda looked like the end of the pointer on the computer mouse thing just fly by than do the same type of dissapearing thing speeding up and just fading away into a wall type thing, i hadnt spoken with her for about a month and she posted something on facebook she said i cant shake this feeling i dunno what it is but i hate it, and i commented saying hey you alright? she replied saying yeh just have this anxious feeling and i said really? thats weird ive been feeling that too i said what do you think its from and she said i dunno i dont wanna say. and i said we need to talk now. so i called her up and said hey you home she said no ill be home in 10 come over tho so i came to her house, btw she's 20 and going to law school,ill call her jamie, i go to her house and she in her room with her brother and i come in and i havent told anyone about the deja vu ive been having yet except for my two friends i went to the hangover with, so were in her room and i said so like you got this feeling too? nd she said yeh its weird its like that feeling when your waiting for something in the mail and i said omg yehhhhhhhhhh me too like i m waiting for something special and she says yeh exactly and than i was like why didnt you wanna say nd shes like cause i dont want to buy in to believing it and actually thinking thats why, and i was like trust me you can tell me i need to know cause some weird shit has been happening to me lately, nd she says okay so she starts off and right away i get chills down my spine when shes says \" so i keep getting this weird deja vu feeling\" i stop her nd say wtf, explain it nowwwwww im gettin demanding now and she and i both can tell that we are now realizing that something weird is happening to us, it was like a connection nd she says yeh like i was with my friends the other night and they said something and i was all like woah deja vu hahah and she laughed and they laughed and than she looked with like a puzzled face and was like and than i was like wait stop talking and her friends got serious and was like what?

north eastern horizon that was moving oddly.  the object gave off light, that changed color from white, blue to green, randomly.  it was close enough that i at first thought it was a helicopter - but a helicopter does not hover in that kind of pattern.  it was small enought to appear as a far away helicopter, but appeared to be hovering around the area of manton - about 30 miles to the north-north east, a little town in the foothills of the sierra nevadas.  we stood and watched the light for about 20 minutes.  it moved within an airspace about the size of a 50 cent piece from my vantage point.  it moved oddly, moving up rapidly, then slowly sinking down in an oval arc, would move up halfway of this path, then move to the left, to the right, quickly, or slowly, up, down, circular path, cross type path.  it hovered there, in this random pattern for the entire time we remained outside.  we also observed other points of light in the eastern and norther horizon that seemed to be doing the same things, about 5 other points of light, but these other points were so far away that it was difficult to determine how far they were, they seemed to be very high in the atmosphere.  the main point that caught my attention was obviously within the atmostphere, i'd estimate about 5,000 feet above the ground.  we watched and discussed ufo activity in the area, with curiosity, until i thoroughly had the creeps and went back inside.   \r\n\r\nthe next night, i returned at the same time with my boyfriend and my 13 year old daughter.  we all saw the same object, in the exact same space.  but this night the entire eastern horizon lit up randomly with a flash/strobe type light in about 3-5 minute intervals.  the light source seemed to be coming from the ground, and lit the sky up at horizon level.  we also noticed shooting star type streaks of light, but they were not moving downward as a meteor does, they moved parallel to the earths surface, very high up, outer atmosphere level.  we all felt very uneasy and returned inside, forgoing our planned walk. \r\n\r\nit should be mentioned that my daughter pointed out that, that sighting was in an area that would be normally traversed by commerical aircraft.  most evenings we watch multiple commerical flights passing in this space north - south, on the eastern horizon, about 50 miles east of i-5.  sometimes so many flights are moving at once that planes move at different altitudes from eachother to share the same air space.  we noted on the second night the commerical air traffic had moved to about 100 miles due west, about 30 miles west of i-5, we had to do a 180 from our normal plane viewing position to watch the flights travel.  we only saw one plane moving in the normal air traffic conduit, on the eastern horizon, a jet plane moving at high speeds from the south to the north.  it was obviously not a commercial craft - we watch them all the time, they do not move at that speed.  this was lit up like a jet and moved as fast as a jet.
