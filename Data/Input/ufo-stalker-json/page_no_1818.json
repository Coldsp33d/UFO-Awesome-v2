from 30 to 70 feet above ground. as soon as the silent object flew north into the thick tree line, a police officer pulled up. we described what we just saw, and the officer has seen the same exact

sync, they would alternatly speed up and slow down but maintain elevation. their movements were very fluid and smooth. there was no noise what so ever. then one at a time they zoomed off and disappeared. we stopped recording and started discussing what we had just saw. very frusterated that all these cars were just driving right past, no one was stopping to watch. then to our surprise we looked back to the nw wherethe objects had come from and there were 3 more of the same objects heading in the same direction. we fumbled around trying to find the camera in the car and when i started the second video i was recording from behind the wind sheild i handed off the camera to my boyfriend who then record from outside the car. right after he gets focused on the lights you can see one of them move very quickly away from the other and then move slightly back towards it. unfortunately we were not able to catch most of the second wave on camera. it was a very strange event espesially

clearly visable on top. it appeared with no movement hovered and simply blinked out. my wife and son and i all then looked at each other and said, what the hell was that?, i have seen many airplanes from orlando international in the past and an aviation buff, flight simulator etc. and know that this was not an airplane. my son to confirm this thought that may be it was an airplane that cut through the clouds, he went out in the yard and there were no clouds, i have seen thousands of flights incoming over many years and know of all the required faa lights that are required, this object had no blinking lights and they were to bright and of the wrong color to match any conventional lights as i stated i have ever seen. in addition, you can easily hear cessna 172 type airplanes that i have seen from here from further distances.\r\n  the sighting was due west between poinciana and haines city, florida.\r\ni believe it was over the lake marion area next to much rural wild life

could spot another satellite for my son and spent probably 30 minutes starring at the zenith of the sky with no success. it was very clear with a cloud now and again floating by. suddenly from my left (the west south west) i saw a large, quick moving object shaped like a chevron, making absolutely no sound, fly right across my direct vision, blocking the star light as it passed, and having what i think were maybe 5 or 6 white lights that were not blinking and ran along the bottom of the object. i immediately jumped to my feet, pointed at it and started to yell to everybody to take notice... it

i noticed something in the corner of my eye which immediately caught my attention. the houses on my street are detached and the one which the object came over was a bungalow on the other side of the road. the object itself caught my attention because it was huge there is no word to describe the size of the object it was probably around 50 metres above the house across the road. \r\nthe moment i saw the object i felt a chill run down my spine and almost felt inferior in some way, i had felt fine all day but all of a sudden i felt sick and scared and was sick due to this object. the object itself was a really strange shape is was the shape of a dohnut or as mathematics call it a \"torus\". the object itself seemed to be a silvery/greyish colour and fully resemble an object which is constructed out of a very shiny reflective metal. \r\nas i started to video the object after i had ran for my camera the object seemed to be spinning vertically and horizontally but also seemed to change direction to the opposite of what it was o-ready doing which baffled me the most. then the object appeared to be vibrating and shaking but at the same time slightly swirling on a rotation of the y axis but as the object rotated it seemed to have an indent/piece chipped away at one. the object at times was affected by other objects which were surrounding it as these smaller objects would speed up causing the bigger object to react by doing the same. then the object appeared to just casually fly away until it just literally vanished without a trace.\r\nat the time of the sighting i felt extremely scared(the most i've ever been) and also got an adrenaline rush like the worst i have ever had one. i noticed that the moment i saw the object that i went very cold and began to feel sick/ill and later on i was actually sick i also kept feeling chills going up my spine. after the sighting i was so mesmerized that the sighting is literally burnt into my memory i saw this 2 years ago but can remember like it was yesterday i also noticed that i was having an hard time sleeping due to this object and it seemed to have really caused some harm to me psychologically as it was constantly on my mind and if i went out with my friends i couldn't really get into the conversation this object was all i could think of.\r\ni first lost sight of the object just after i stopped videoing as the object was too far away for my camera zoom, i noticed that the object just more or less vanished out of sight.\r\n\r\ni would be very great full if you read all this and could give me some info on what this object really was. oh sorry for changing the audio on my video as it was just me breathing heavily i just thought a peaceful song would make it look better.\r\n","distance":"20

of the ones that apear starlike but pulsate several colors though they stay realtively stationary. monday i woke up around 12 and to see if there was anything going on. i went outside and found several of the starlike ones, but much closer and brighter and moving, when i first got out there there were probably 5- 10 that i could see in the sky overall. i watched them and then an extremely bright light illumitaded the entire tree line and slowly rose out never ceasing its light. its movements were very deliberate and remained. it appeared blimp shaped and it did seem to make a slight steady hum. it rose to about 5 feet over the trees would slowly come towards me and then move back, but not side to side. it shon the light only on the trees, never directly at me. after about fifteen minutes of this its light was turned off and within seconds a cross shaped object flashing everycolor very brightly and moving fast in all directions inclueing cirular replaced it. it came closer to me but mainly just hovered above the treeline. it was joined after about half an hour by another one, slightly smaller and though flashing maintained a prodominatly orange color, also crossshaped. after a period of time i looked around the rest of the sky and realized that about fifteen to twenty of the starlike ones were present, all with the flashing lights of many colors but could pass as one if not being looked for. there was also a larger one and i dont really know what shape it was, it was farther away, higher in the sky. though staying in a general direction it moved about in all direction, though remained stedy, not irratic as the crossshaped ones had, orwith the wobble/slight wander of the starlike ones. it appeared as though a helichopter approached it at one point but the larger object came at it. it may not have been a helichopter at all as it may have docked on it but it was the approximate size of one with a light such as one may have. i turned my attention back to the crosslike ones. the brighter bigger one wass still above the treeline, slightly less active. the orangish one had moved away from it but was still very noticeable. i watched them for awhile, then turned back ot the one that had docked/absorbed the item, which was still there. there was now another much larger one, i think its lights were red, but it had a bluish color. this one, maybe three time, shot down blue spheres, which i never saw return to it. finally i decided to try to get some sleep, so i went in. i was excited though so i went back out after about thirty minutes. there was a massive amount of the starlike ones throughout the sky, the crosslike ones were still there, and several sphers had joined them. but something i had never seen were two things that appeared to be only foggy light. the one near the treeline was largeish and possibly triangular, more blue than green. the other one, huge was possibly an entity, as it appeared to walk up steps at one point but maintained no shape. when i went in there were up to at least 30, varying in size and shape. i am rushed for time now but i feel it is very important to state that this is the army of the lord, and very very soon everyone will know they are here. i will add more later if i can edit it.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

line when i was watching a ufo, well, about a week and a half later i was standing 15 yards from that property line facing the other direction when me and my friend, a wall sitting skeptic, saw a star, slightly lower and brighter than other the other stars, that was flickering and changing colors dramatically in the tree line, we could see it between the green of some trees but it's background was still the night sky.  i had recently downloaded skyview, the app that let's you hold up your phone and look up specific stars, planets, and satellites, but it wouldn't calibrate and i couldn't use it. the light on the \"thing\" was flickering, seemingly randomly, in different colors; white, red, and a blueish-green-turquoise color. i took the case off of my iphone and tried skyview again and it worked perfectly.  it was sitting right where scorpio's head is, but i couldn't see any other star of scorpio and i was still suspicious. it was blinking so fast it was hard to tell anything about it.  after a little bit of time it started to move calmly but violently in different directions (up, down, slinging from point to point very quickly in a small area, but kept a base in the spot).  my friend and i got into his car, which we were standing very close to already, and drove up the street about 80 yards (towards the light, though, it was out of sight) where the road turns right.  we went up the road about another 30 yards and took a left.  went another 20 yards or so and pulled into a public parking lot.  we got out and tried to find but couldn't at first.  i walked around in the lot trying to get a glimpse when i spotted it way closer to the ground than either of us had thought. it was over a clearing with a few small houses and a close to dried up creek, probably 20 yards from that first right turn we made.  we drove back to my house and had to stand further back than we did earlier to see it, as it had either dropped or moved away. we lost track of it soon after, we couldn't see it at all.\r\n\r\ni submit these reports because i've had 2 different experiences very close to me in less than 2 weeks.  i've had 2 other instances in the last last 7-8 months, but

clock in my car on the way home and seeing 4:00 exactly, so it was probably 4:08 when i first noticed it.  when i pulled onto my street an extremely bright star caught my eye over the tree line somewhere behind the end of my street, a dead end- at my neighbors house.  i didn't bring it up to my friends because they get tired of me talking about the sky, and i know that and didn't think too much of this star, anyway. though, by the time i parked i though it may of been venus.  i pulled into our car port (perpendicular to, and facing away from the street- for detail) but i was still looking at the thing, that had apparently moved behind us, still over the tree line, but really bright. i told my friends i was gonna stay out here and they should too, but when i turned to look at them, they were already inside.  so i walked onto the street, right on the property line between me and my neighbor and that's when i realized that i couldn't see any other stars anywhere near it because it was below the clouds and way bigger than a star.  the moon was behind the clouds at this time of night and was illuminating them tremendously. i remember seeing the clouds moving surprisingly fast, as it was very still that night. the big sphere of light started to pulsate very slowly but on a big scale. at it's dimmest i could clearly make out 3 lights in an equilateral triangle on the bottom of something, but i couldn't completely distinguish the craft. it was either round or possibly a circle that was slimmed down to a more triangular shape but kept the rounded edges. it's still hard to tell how far away it was, but the more i think about and stand in the same spot i realize that it had to have been closer than i initially thought. anyway, at it's brightest it was completely engulfed by and centered in what looked like a perfect sphere of light. it hovered and went through a full cycle starting at it's brightest and ending at it's brightest. i was facing northeast and after 1 cycle it moved left to right fairly slowly but very smoothly, while keeping the brightest on, stopped again and made 2 cycles and stopped at it's brightest.  i called my friend inside that does believe in et's, ufo's, and such (as do i), but he either didn't hear or understand me because he never came outside.  the ufo moved slightly to the right again, stopped, and made one more cycle. after that cycle it moved slowly behind the trees to the right and i couldn't get another view of it.  the clouds were moving really fast against the ufo's path the entire time.  \r\n\r\nat the time i knew the camera lens on my iphone 4 is very scratched up and wouldn't have gotten anything that looked like anything, and the reverse camera would've meant looking away from the ufo for longer than i wanted too.  my actual camera was in my room dead, the battery charger was stolen from a hotel room. so i tried to get a witness but both candidates were too tired.  i thought this was a really cool sighting, being someone who believes in and studies these things, but i decided to report it when 1 1/2 weeks later, while standing about 20 yards from the other sighting and facing the other direction almost 180 degrees, me and the more skeptical friend of the 2 in the other sighting (the one i didn't call), saw something else in the sky that was completely different and cured his skepticism.  i will detail this sighting in a second report soon.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

a while. one of the stars was located above the fall river area & the other in north tiverton on the opposite side of the expressway or in relation to the braga bridge on the right. all of a sudden, as i was passing through somerset, the star spurted directly over to the northern section of fall river with acceleration faster than any jet iv'e ever seen. next i thought maybe i am hallucinating. to myself, i indicated, if the object shoots back across the highway again its got to be a ufo! sure enough two or three seconds later it went to the opposite side. i was absolutely overwhelmed!\r\n\r\n  then i noticed the spacecraft, glowing like a star, continue in a north east direction over the braga bridge. i prepared to exit 14s heading for tiverton on route 24, looked up and could see the ufo on my left heading for tiverton. then i noticed it cross over route 24 to the opposite side of the highway on my right, it seem to hover there for a short time. after about 5 minutes i could see the craft on my left just before exiting route 24 and on to route 138 main road.\r\n\r\n  upon entering the parking lot at the coachman i decided to park as close as possible to the entrace due to the extremely inclement weather. i parked about 25 feet from the entrance in the direction of the restaurant.\r\n\r\n  i opened the door, looked at my watch which indicated 6:20 p.M. stept out and looked up-to my astonishment there before my eyes at a distance of\r\n\r\n  i had this tremendous feeling of being at peace with myself for some unknown reason.\r\n\r\n  a couple of minutes later my guest drove into the parking lot. i ran to her door, opened it and told her to look up and she said, what a bright star! i said, this is a ufo. we watched for another minute but because it was so cold outside we ran to the entrance.\r\n\r\n  our table was situated in the back of the dining room facing the bay with a direct view of bristol, looking southwest i could see the lighted mt. hope bridge. we looked up and we could see the object, it was in constant observation throughout the diner meal. at approximately 7:45 p.M. the craft moved about 100 feet, both of us witnessed this activity and and of course i stated, do you believe in ufo's now? she answered rather abruptly, i always thought this was possible but firmly believe now. at about 8:10 p.M. the ufo maneuvered itself straight across to bristol, disapeared, reappeared and stopped in the center of the bay for ten minutes, then finally left our view at 8:20 p.M. in the direction of bristol.\r\n\r\n  we departed from the coachman at 8:45 p.M., my guest left in the opposite direction and i proceeded to an appointment on the main road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nufo experience (phenomena)\r\n\r\nwednesday january 19, 1977\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  decided wednesday night i would attempt a repeat performance of tuesday night by driving to tiverton then to my sister's home in portsmouth. with camera & binoculars i left my parents home for tiverton at 6:40 p.M.\r\n\r\n  while driving on 195 east to route 24 south at approximately 7:00 p.M., the ufo was now travelling on my left and traversing back & forth over the highway. i did not exit the coachman route 138 but instead continued to portsmouth and lost all activity at this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthursday january 20, 1977\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  at 8:15 a.M. while waiting for a bus to providence i felt a sharp pain on the right side of my forehead. this condition continued until lunchtime at 12:00 p.M. when i felt nauseated and delayed my lunch for forty minutes until it subsided. went to lunch at 12:40 feeling a little dizzy, this persisted until 2:30 p.M. that day.\r\n\r\n  i understand after close contact or exposure this reaction can occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfriday january 21, 1977\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  it was a very cloudy night and at 6:25 p.M. on route 24 south to portsmouth, i noticed in north tiverton, on my right above the clouds, this bright light moving across the highway to the opposite side and hovered there. i continued to portsmouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntuesday january 25, 1977\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  this was a clear night at 7:35 p.M. on route 24 south to main road tiverton for an appointment, my father & i noticed at a distance of about 1500 feet in the sky, a bright star (ufo) hovering for a few seconds then it completely vanished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  this summerizes my ufo experiences for the past two weeks. in every sighting indicated within this report i never saw the metallic portion of the ufo, the craft was always engulfed completely with a white glow\r\n\r\n  i must say that it has been a fantastic experience and of course i look foward to the future with great anticipation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tsincerely yours,\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, Over 1

facing due south and i was looking ahead through the front windshield while having my conversation. at around 1:45am, approximately, i saw what i initially thought to be a bright meteor pass by low on the horizon, just below the treetops in the foreground at the edge of my yard from my viewpoint. at first i assumed the object had burnt up in the same second that i noticed it, because my view of it was obstructed by the thick woods. there is however a break in the woods where the privite road that i live on comes down to my driveway from 17 highway, which provides a clear due south view placing the apparent horizon from where i was sitting at least a mile away, on the other side of highway 17. after noticing and losing sight of the object behind the foreground trees the first time, it re-emerged a couple of seconds later as it passed through this clearing over the private road. i was able to track the object with my eyes as it continued moving from west to east, and i lost it behind the other patch of woods on the far side of the private road, continuing to catch glimpses of it between the folliage. the object was unusual because it moved with the speed of a meteor and looked like one, but did not lose altidude or burn up for the whole 5-8 seconds that it took for it to pass accross my field of view. i would compare the exact look and apparent size of this object to that of a bright star or planet on an exceptionally clear night. i have no way of telling how far away the object was but i assume it passed over arkansas somewhere, because my residence is only a few miles from the arkansas-missouri border. another note: this may be unrelated, but a large jet with three lights on the bottom (i assume a commercial jet) passed directly over me within a couple of minutes of my sighting, and it was headed southeast, so i know the pilots had to have seen what i saw. also, highway 17 has a four or five mile straight stretch facing directly south with open fields on both sides before you get to my house, so if anyone was traveling south on that highway around that time, they had to have seen the object. i was unable to find any other reports of this from anyone else, so i decided to be the first to file it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:08","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
