returned my disabled son home to the bay area and his mother.Return flight flew over ?Albaquercie? new mexico (northwest airlines...Maybe southwest airlines from oakland ca to hobby airport in houston tx). i know this because the pilot announced the altitude and location moments before the sighting.The girls (2) in the seats in front of me were napping having \"partied\" in california.And the flight was not a full flight.I had tried to sleep....But usually cant sleep well on flights.After the pilot made his announcement , i raised up from a laying position having taken up at least 2 seats....More than likely 3..........And i was now sitting in the window seat and looking out of the window (window faced north). it was very pretty and it was before sunset........As the plane flew.......Minutes passed......When i observed in detail a large silver sphere hovering stationary at about 35 thousand feet approximately. well....Obviously lower because we flew at 35k feet.Id say it was the size of a small office building. maybe a ten story building.....In diameter if one can describe a sphere in that fashion.I witnessed this thru my window and the window in the seat behind me as i instinctively jumped up to follow it in my line of sight.It was not a plane. not a balloon.Not any publically know aircraft. it was very large though. after seeing this....I questioned my sanity for a brief moment. i thought about questioning the pilot upon departing the plane....But i knew better.(there is no way they could have not seen it on a radar......Or thru their main window....It was too large to miss.) knowing the truth will come out eventually.I distinctly observed \"panelling\" on the surface of the sphere. large panels.....Not like those on a plane, etc.We had to be flying at several hundred miles an hour......But i did see it for enough of a time to discern details.Um...What was it? i have no damn idea.But.....It was not something one sees in a typical lifetime. this i know for sure.Hope it helps and sorry i couldnt spell the name of the city.However, i think you can decipher the name.Thanks for your time.True story.No deception.Not misleading.","distance":"501 Feet

stationed at malmstrom afb, montana as an a1c in security police and working as security escort on a targeting mission with 1 lieutenant, 1 captain, 1 tsgt., 1 ssgt., and myself. we had just finished our mission at echo-4 and were heading home and in good spirits as the mission was successful. we were about 18 miles from base and the weather was sunny, with blue skies and clouds all around. everything appeared normal.\r\n\r\nall of a sudden, the engine of our truck(an af 6 pack targeting vehicle), began to sputter and then stop in the middle of the highway. the driver, a ssgt in maintenance, tried to restart the engine with no success. the driver then noticed that we had no power; when he turned the key, there was no turning of the engine, no crackle, no whirrring , no clicking. he then tried the vehicle's radio to notify base that we were having problems and to contact vehicle maintenance for help. but the radio was not working, not even squelch...The capt. asked me to use my walkie talkie and contact csc(central security control)which i attempted; but also could not raise anyone. i checked my watch and noticed it was about 3 p.M in the afternoon and the sun was very high in the sky. we all decided to get out of the vehicle and check the engine to see what could be done..\r\n\r\nonce out of the vehicle i went to the rear to set up a security zone for us.\r\ni tried my radio once again with no success. as i attempted to check the squelch, i happened to look toward the east and tilted my head upward to what appeared to be a very thick white cloud, approx. 100-150 feet above me, that seemed to come out of nowhere. i wouldn't have taken a second look if it wasn't for the very bright silvery craft that came out of the cloud. it made no noise except for a slight humming sound. i stood there staring, and called out to my team to come to me. as they approached me, they saw me staring and looked up and saw what i was seeing. the craft was huge! it was approx. 30 to 40 feet high and was the size of 2-3 football fields! it was triangular and square in shape. bright silver, almost as bright as the sun! we all had to shield our eyes as it hovered and moved slowly toward the north. it moved very slowly(about 1 mph) to come out of the clouds; and when it finally did; it took off toward the northern sky in a flash! as it hovered over us, i had the feeling that it was observing us, and so did the captain. he reminded me to not take any offensive posture with my weapon. i agreed. once the vehicle disappeared, we looked at each other and wondered what we had just seen.\r\n\r\nwe had all agreed to report this as soon as we got back to base. it was then that i heard my radio squelch and asked the captain if he wanted me to report on the air. he said no, just to make a security check with csc. \r\nthe driver got back into the cab of the truck and turned the key..It immediately started as if nothing had happened. we all got in the vehicle and started for base.\r\n\r\nwhen we arrived on base, the capt. and lt. had to go to their targeting hqtrs in order for them to relinquish their targeting codes. once there, we all started getting out of the truck to got with him to brief on what happened. the capt. told us no. that he and the lt. would do the reporting and if we were needed, he would come and get us. about an hour later, the captain returned and told us the following quote..\"if you value your careers, you will not talk about this incident ever again. that is an order\"\r\n\r\ni have kept my silence for over 38 years. i wish i had more to tell you as i do not remember their names. hopefully. they have spoken and told their stories and we may get to the bottom of this. i see this incident almost every day in my mind's eye and wonder to this day what it was. perhaps someday i will know...\r\n\r\ndaniel j. harvey","distance":"101-500

the most. one light would move horizontally and stop then the other one would move near it. they also did this in a vertical manner. the movement was very fast and they did not slow down to stop, they just stopped in the sky. they made absolutely no noise. we were a little shaken by this activity so we got to the vehicle and headed s. towards holdenville. we had gone about a mile and a half when i looked out the rear window and saw one of the lights move, what i would guess to 40 to 50 yards,above us. we stopped the vehicle in the middle of the gravel road and both of us exited the vehicle. the object, bright light, lit up everything around us for about two or three seconds. i remember seeing cattle standing in the pasture and feeling like something had just taken a picture of me with a giant flashbulb. after the bright light went out, the object sped up into the sky, at what appeared to be somewhere around the speed of light, and disappeared into the star lit sky. there was no sound and we never spotted the other bright light again. we reported this to the local police in holdenville and asked them if they had had any other reports. they thought we were either drunk or crazy so we just kept it to ourselves for years. i must admits that i spent several sleepless nights trying to rationize what i had seen. today, i am just thinkful that i was there to have this

outside of austin. i believe that i witnessed either an astrological event or a ufo on august 2, 2011. the following is what i saw. on august 1, 2011 i decided to stay up past midnight, thus becoming august 2nd. at about 3:45 am i decided to let the dogs out for the night, and usually i enjoy looking up at the night sky and seeing the stars since it's very dark out in the country. well, as i was about to go in i noticed a very brilliant white light. at first, i thought it was just a star, but as i looked closer, this star was very bright. it was so bright it even appeared to have tails coming from it. in all the times i've been outside and looked up at the night sky, i've never seen such a sight. something was strange about this light. it didn't move. it was just stationary. so, i decided to go in and grab my video camera and start recording. unfortunely, what i recorded isn't exactly what i saw with my own eyes. please let me explain what i saw with my own eyes and binoculars. with my eyes, it was this intense bright white light and on the left side of it had a tail or point (like a comet). the tail went went from a soft blue to a white. sometimes it even seemed to have tails on both sides of the object. then after a minute or two, the white light would reduce and change into two separate colors green & red, and then aftera minute the light grew in size back into white. i know what you're probably thinking. airplane. where i live, there are always airplanes flying over. the airplanes always moved across the sky and keep going. i stayed out in the back yard and looked at this object from 3:45 am to 5 am. it never moved. not one bit. also, i looked with my binoclulars, which are a little crappy, but i still used them. with the binoculars this object was definitely changing colors and even changing shapes. i even did my own testing the following night at about 12:30 am to see if i could see it again because at first, i thought it was a comet, but it never moved like a comet. also, i tried to film other stars with the video camera but never showed up on the video. does this mean that it wasn't a star? i honestly don't. i was hoping that you could investigate this. i  just wondering if this was just acommon astrological event, or star that i've never seen, or something else. within this email are some attachment of concept painting i did. i did this in photoshop. the night sky was just a picture reference used to depict the night. i painted in the object i saw. there were about 3 stages it went through, and after the 3rd stage it would revert back to the first. also, here is the youtube link to my video. in advance, i'm sorry about the shakyness of the camera. to get a good shot, i had to hold it over my head which caused my arms to sway a little, and also i kind of run at the mouth about the decription. i just wanted to give as much information as possible, to whoever was watching the video. thank you for your time & attention.\r\n\r\nhere's the youtube video\r\n(link moved to fi box)  cms 10/10/11 06:35 cst

creek, which is about 5 miles n. of holdenville,oklahoma. at around one in the morning we both noticed what appeared to be two bright stars moving strangely in the sky ne of us. we climbed up the creek bank so we could see the lights better. i would guess these light to be about a half mile away at this time, but they were coming our way. the movement of the lights was what had our attention the most. one light would move horizontally and stop then the other one would move near it. they also did this in a vertical manner. the movement was very fast and they did not slow down to stop, they just stopped in the sky. they made absolutely no noise. we were a little shaken by this activity so we got to the vehicle and headed s. towards holdenville. we had gone about a mile and a half when i looked out the rear window and saw one of the lights move, what i would guess to 40 to 50 yards,above us. we stopped the vehicle in the middle of the gravel road and both of us exited the vehicle. the object, bright light, lit up everything around us for about two or three seconds. i remember seeing cattle standing in the pasture and feeling like something had just taken a picture of me with a giant flashbulb. after the bright light went out, the object sped up into the sky, at what appeared to be somewhere around the speed of light, and disappeared into the star lit sky. there was no sound and we never spotted the other bright light again. we reported this to the local police in holdenville and asked them if they had had any other reports. they thought we were either drunk or crazy so we just kept it to ourselves for years. i must admits that i spent several sleepless nights trying to rationize what i had seen. today, i am just thinkful that i was there to have this experience.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with
