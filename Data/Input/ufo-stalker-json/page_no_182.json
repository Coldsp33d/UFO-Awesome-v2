there when suddenly, the object going north came to a stop and seemed to hesitate in one spot for a few seconds.  i thought that was pretty strange as i have seen countless satellites over the years and i know they don't do that.  the object then reversed course 180 degrees without making a regular turn and it went from being a faint white to an almost eye hurting brilliant white/silver.  it was getting larger very quickly and changed to a brilliant gold.  when i last looked, it was about the size of a 81mg. low dose aspirin.  i had the distinct feeling that i was being targeted, almost as though my thoughts about ufos were being read. it appeared to be coming straight for me.  i grabbed my dog, ran into the cottage and locked the doors.  that is the most afraid i have been in the last 50 years. i got the distinct impression that i was being targeted.  my wife doesn't have much belief in ufos but she has never seen me so frightened in all our marriage.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

wrightstown, which is right between brown and outagamie counties. at approximately 7:08, i noticed a silver, very bright, oval shaped object suddenly appear to the right of the hwy.  somewhat like a disc. i would guess it was less than a mile away.  it was fairly low, but higher than treetops, power lines, overpasses.  it appeared to be reflecting the sunlight.  it seemed to appear out of nowhere, and was a very bright flash in the daylight, so it caught my eye.  it hovered for a few seconds, moved slightly to my right, then slightly left again, then disappeared.  i blinked several times, somewhat in disbelief, and thought it was odd the way it appeared, then disappeared.  i kept leaning down to look out my windshield, thinking maybe it was at a different angle, and wasn't so bright without the sun reflecting, but could see nothing.  not even a speck.  the sky was fairly clear.  there were clouds at higher altitude, but at the elevation it was seen, there was clear, blue sky.  not even a speck.  a few seconds later, it reappeared, just as bright as before, but slightly closer.  it's  difficult to judge the distance it may have moved, because i was also driving toward it, and with it disappearing, i didn't witness the movement.  it seemed to hover again for a few seconds, and disappeared again.  i wasn't able to see it after that.  i was driving at approximately 75mph, and it happened so quickly, that i wasn't able to get a photo or video.  green bay is austin straubel int'l airport (grb), so i thought \"it was probably a plane ascending\", but i see planes on a daily basis, at different times of the day, and i've never seen them that bright, nor disappear then reappear.  when you see a plane ascending during daylight, it generally isn't reflecting light, you can generally see the clear shape of a plane, and see it the entire time, heading in one direction at a steady pace until it moves out of sight.  i found it striking enough, that when i got to work about 20 minutes later, i checked grb's flight schedule.  there was a delta flight that took off at 7:06, which i did rationalize in my head as being the right time to be the object, but had that nagging thought of \"delta's planes are white (i fly delta), and wouldn't flash that brightly\".  this appeared to be thicker, taller, have more mass, and far more surface reflection than a plane.  i decided to text my husband mike, because he was probably .5-1 mile ahead of me, as we left for work at the same time, and travel the same hwy for our commute.  \r\n\r\nhere is our conversation:  \r\n\r\nme:  \"did you see a plane this morning?  i swore it looked like a ufo.\"  \r\n \r\nmike: \"i was thinking the same thing! i saw a bright ball of light, then it was gone, then i saw it again, then it was gone.  really weird!  one thing to keep in mind is that there's an r/c air field right there for really big r/c planes.  i've seen some bigger than my car flying over the hwy.\"  ok, that's a viable possibility, in addition to the official austin straubel airport. \r\n\r\nme:  \"yep.  me too.  i did see a flight took off at 706, but it was delta, and delta is white and not real reflective.  this looked more like a fat, silver disc.  if the sun catches a plane, you should still be able to see it when it changes angle.  it shouldn't have disappeared.\"\r\n\r\nmike:  \"the headlights on that thing were different than big planes.  it was coming toward me and that was the only light i could see.  i didn't see colored warning lights.\"\r\n\r\nme:  \"i thought it was just shiny.  couldn't tell it was lighted.  we should call mufon.\"  i was joking, but clearly...After thinking more about it, i find it to be serious enough to actually fill out this report.\r\n\r\nmike:  \"that's all i could see was the light.  funny that we both saw it and questioned what it was.\"\r\n\r\nme:  \"what was weird was the way it moved and that it disappeared and reappeared.  otherwise, i wouldn't have questioned it much.\"\r\n\r\nmike:  \"the disappearing thing caught me searching around too.  if i didn't have to get to work i would've pulled over & investigated.\"\r\n\r\ni've seen countless objects and lights moving in the sky, and occasionally ask myself \"could that have been?\", but never have i thought it was valid or strange enough to tell anybody about it, and certainly not fill out a report.\r\n\r\nnote:  i'm listing one witness below, in addition to me, as my husband was driving the same hwy and saw it, but there were hundreds of cars in traveling the same hwy, so i'm sure others saw it as well.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

through the clouds. they were as big as the moon, but i could not see any objects because they were shining behind clouds. they were spaced equally, one object being able to fill the gap between the other. i figured they were spotlights from disney, but i realized disney was behind me and there was nothing else that would shine spotlights at 2 am. i kept an eye on them, but they suddenly zoomed out as fast as a meteorite travels across the sky. i couldn't see where they went the first time as i was driving.\r\n\r\na few moments later they zoomed back to their original formation. i put my hazards on and pulled off the road. i tried getting it on video, but it was too dark. they traveled in a straight line, but in slightly different angles so they were spaced evenly, but farther separated from each other when i looked behind me. i sat there watching them for about 10 minutes, but they finally zoomed out of view and never came back. they zoomed out and in probably 2 times in a span of 5 minutes. they mostly hovered. they disappeared for about a few minutes, but they came back and zoomed in and out for maybe another 2 or 3 times in a period of 5 minutes. i ruled out spotlights since they flew out of range that a spotlight has. it was apparent that they were behind the clouds, and not light being projected onto them.\r\n\r\nmy first reaction was curiosity. i thought they were spotlights until they moved at an incredible rate. as soon as that happened i felt an adrenaline rush. i've been interested in ufos since i was a kid. it started with an experience

in blasdell ny. it was at this time i witnessed a ufo. i was in the passenger seat of a sedan being driven by a co-worker when i noticed something out of the periphery on my right side. i saw that it was a glowing, reddish-orangish-yellowish, teardrop shaped object. i was not able to make out any other details such as material or markings. it appeared almost as if it were on fire but without the flames. the vehicle i was in was headed north and the ufo appeared to be heading south, which initially gave the appearance that ufo was flying parallel and this caused me to lose sight of the ufo within approximately 2 to 3 seconds. i asked my co-worker if she thought that was a plane and she said in her opinion there was no way that it could be. neither of us noticed or were able to hear any type of sound coming from the ufo. we did have both of the front windows down in the vehicle. i then asked her to pull into the parking lot of a retirement home so we could circle behind the ufo. once we entered the parking lot we quickly regained a visual of the ufo and i began fumbling for my phone to capture a video. by the time i was able to get the video started the ufo was much farther away and it had completely changed its flight path to what appeared to be 90°. again, still no noise. my co-worker and i just sat and watched as it slowly faded out of eyesight.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

perfect circular aura rainbow when i also watched teardrop shapes form within the aura. at first glance, i figured it was natural but the shapes appeared to slightly change form and position. the weather that day was not out of the ordinary, maybe humid. since it was an interesting scene, i decided to take photos thinking that i was getting an unusual demonstration from the sun and atmosphere. the interior \"teardrop\" forms appeared to roll slightly when observed by eye. i was disappointed in my first shot (taken by a cell phone) so i took a couple more photos. these pictures are from the front yard of the property but the expanse of the subject is very large. i have two very clear pictures of this object. it is not the object itrised me. there is another \"white orb\" object that has moved in direction within the frames and a clear change in the larger object in shape and color in this time frame. (a smaller object moving within the expanse of the larger one.) this is all very bizarre to me. my other witness was my fiance that seemed very unimpressed with the event. however, the photos exhibit the object and at least one other inclusion to be considered; aside from the obvious changes is the larger object in response to the other in the images. i'm hoping this can be explained as a light refraction phenomenon but it's too interesting to dismiss. i have sat on these pictures for a long time, too embarrassed to share them but id rather be wrong than right. -jde     if you wish to take

moving, but then realized it was far too high to be moving that fast. it was round and smooth, no edges or wings sticking out.The clouds were thick and tall, like mountains in the sky. this object was a little above the base of the clouds. it's speed was similar to if you held up a 12 inch ruler at arms length and took 2 seconds to move your finger from one end of the ruler to the other. the object was about the size of a circle, 5 millimeters tall, at arms length.  it was white, the color of the clouds exactly, except it was round, i could tell because it was slightly shaded, with the shadow of a curvature on it. it was moving in a straight path for about 5-10 seconds. i'm not good with time, so it could have been shorter or longer, i really don't know. it then changed direction, about 40 degrees, moving west to south west. it then went behind/into the large clouds and out of my sight.\r\nthe reason i’m reporting it as a ufo is because it was clearly round, no wings, or small wings or angles or edge large enough to see, it was moving at a steady rate, not up, like a balloon, but in an undistrubed forward path/motion, not being blown around, and then made an immidiate and abrupt
