 she came over and looked, and here it came around again.  it must have circled over us towards bellevue, to autumn, to one of the side streets off overton park, then headed back west towards us again.  my girlfriend saw it, but was too tired to stand and watch with me so she went back to bed (unbelievably).  well, i was on fire and needed someone to talk to immediately!  i was losing it seeing this.  it flew that exact same flight pattern several times.  the 3rd or 4th time i saw it, i grabbed a notebook and a pen and began trying to draw what i had seen.  about that time, it came back around and this time began flying directly towards me.  i had the balcony door open and was looking directly up at it as it was flying over the 3-story house right next door.  this object was very low and very close.  it was probably no more than 15 feet above me.  seeing it from this angle though, it looked fatter around than it had from the side, like a canister or soda can.  cylindrical.  i drew pictures.  this object sounded like a helicopter.  i have to also mention how we were sort of expecting or looking out for something this evening: last night around 1:20am or so, we were watching tv and there was a sudden bang! boom boom, then steady rumble for a few seconds.  it was not lightning.  it sounded like it was right outside our window.  it scared the living daylights out of us, but more so my girlfriend because last week, she was sleeping and i was up watching tv around 1 am and there was a loud bang! like something exploded, busted, or went off like a shotgun (but not a shotgun, as i am familiar with guns) and i also noticed a flash of light through the window.  it scared me so bad, i jumped and my heart sank.  i didn't know how to explain that sound.  the light is unexplainable.  the sound is unexplainable.  i described it to my girlfriend the next day so when it happened last night again, it scared the crap out of her, but she knew immediately what i was talking about from before.  since then, we looked outside and there is no explanation whatsoever for that sound, but also there was a rumble afterwards, but it wasn't like it was coming from the sky.  it was like it was coming from right outside our window.  so, this evening i was sort of anticipating that sound may be occurring again so maybe we could come up with an explanation for it and well, this is what happened instead... the unknown object that sounds similiar to a helicopter in volume and feeling, but the chopping sound of the helicopter blades isn't there and is more of a working-motor sound, like buzzing.  imagine a weedeater at the volume of a helicopter.  that's what it sounded like.  one could have easily mistaken it for a helicopter.

and it is very country and rural with just a few houses. we were traveling on bellview road going towards cedartown from rockmart. i wasn't paying much attention at the time and he asked me if i had seen a bright light in the air pass in front of us while we were on the road, and i hadn't seen it at the time. he said it was too low to the ground to be an airplane and it had different color bright lights. well, i thought he was just joking around with me so i kind of blew it off, but i could tell he kept looking up in the sky looking for something. about 5 minutes down the road something caught my eye to the left of the car, and we both saw it this time. to the left of the car on the driver's side there was an empty pasture, i dont know if it was part of someone's property or just a random pasture, but there was a triangular shaped craft hovering just a few feet above the treeline. it was dark so we couldn't see the whole craft, but it had one light at each point of the triangle, so there were three different color lights. the lights were red, green, and yellowish-white. we could see the outline of the craft and we could tell it was a triangular shape, but we couldn't see details of the craft besides the lights and the shape. it was angled in a position as if the triangle was lying down, like it was horizontal instead of vertical. it wasn't very big but it wasn't small, maybe the size of a short school bus. it was a few feet above the treeline in the air and it was hovering over the pasture slightly moving forward and backwards. all we could do was sit there and stare at it. we were afraid to look away from it because we were afraid it would disappear. i pulled out my camera to get a picture and video tape of it, and my boyfriend was turning the car around. we started heading back towards the craft, but for a split second the trees blocked our view and when we got back out in the open it was gone. just in about 3 seconds it was gone, disappeared. we looked everywhere in the sky for it, but it was nowhere. i don't know of any aircraft that is that fast to disappear in just a few seconds. it left no reflection or no shadow. it was just gone. we didn't get out of the car to investigate because we were a little frightened. we didn't hear the craft make a noise, and it didn't leave any trace of being there, that we know of, because like i said we were a little too frightened to investigate it. i didn't get a chance to take a picture of it which is unfortunate because without proof not many people will believe us. my boyfriend and i both saw it so it wasn't just our imagination. we weren't drunk or high. we were completely sober. we know what we saw..","distance":"21-100

was focused on my car because it was running poorly, and i was afraid i would break down.My eyes were looking straight ahead,and we were in the middle of a conversation, when my eyes looked ahead but to the left .There were building close to the road,so at first i thought i was looking at a building,but wondered why only the top  lights were all on, and none at the bottom .I wondered if they were having a party up there or something.Then i realized there was no bottom half to this \"building\".I was looking under the \"building.\"i asked my daughter to look at it, and tell me what that is.She screamed and almost started to cry when she looked at it.I needed her to calm down, plus i never believed in ufo's, but i was looking right at one.I could not understand why cars and semi's  were not pulling over, they had to see it too. it was as close to the building before it, as it could be, and the top of it was about as high as the building next to it.I called my husband in colorado on my cell phone.When he answered, i said \"i am looking at a ufo right now.\" i described it to him. it was grey,shinny like metal, it was flat on bottom,and slight dome shape on top,it had low beam lights all around the bottom edges.It had small windows ,close to the bottom edge.I could see clearly one whole side,bottom and top side. i thought to myself, when it lands, how does it keep from landing on those lights and breaking them.It hovered ,it stayed right beside that building,at the edge of the highway.I thought about calling 911, but they would think i was crazy.I thought\" let some one else call\". i thought if cars start to pull over, then i will too, but i could not understand why cars were just going by as usual.Then i thought oprah doesn't live that far away, maybe she has some luxury hover craft to take her sight seeing at night,but why so close to a building, and  i have never heard of such a thing.My mind tried everything it could to find logic.My husband got on the internet while we were still on the phone.He said there is a air force base near where i was at, he said they have a new hover craft. i said ok, i feel stupid now, and i am glad i did not call 911, and make a fool of myself, and that must be why people are just driving on,because they are used to it.I am from the country, and figured i must have a lot to learn about life in the city.I hung up the phone, and continued driving. i noticed that it seemed to stay up ahead on my left for several minutes, which did not make sense.Then i passed it on the highway, getting a good look.I thought about pulling over again,and getting a better look, but with my car acting up, and 2 females along the road at night,i figured i should just keep going, i like to make good time, and get there in 24 hours.When i noticed it was now behind me,it seemed like now it was not on the side of the road,it was hovering right over top the road, and i was afraid it was following me.I was getting paranoid.I now questioned the air force hover craft idea.And remembered old ufo movies, where if you pull over or stop, they take you with them.I did not want that to happen, i did not want us to become missing persons.Every time i looked in my rear view mirror,it was the same distance behind me. i needed my daughter to stay calm,so i decided to stop looking back and drive.Besides this could not be happening, it could not be real.My husband had told me it was the air force, and that was that. until last year.\r\nlast year i was watching tv , and something came on about ufo's. i was back home at ohio.The program said the air force says they do not have hover crafts! i then knew i had seen a real ufo, and up close.Most the the pictures they were showing on the program of ufo sightings , were small specks way up in the sky.I could have counted the lights if i would of pulled over that night.There was no squinting of eyes , or trying to make something out of a cloud, it was as real and as close as the buildings on the road. it makes no sense to me that it was that low, that close to a building, in a city, and right near a busy 4 lane. it makes no sense cars did not pull over, or go off the road to look at it.But i knew at that moment that ufo's are real,unless we have hover crafts the size of a building, and it is kept secret.I tell people now, that i saw a ufo once.They smile , or turn their head and laugh. nobody asks what i saw, or where i saw it , or when or anything.But i saw it, just as plain as i saw the arch, and any other building, or vehicle.I just could not believe what i was seeing at the time.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

me caught my attention. it was momentarily very bright then less so. when it was very bright it almost looked like it was reflecting the sun, but if so it had to be very high at 9:45. \r\n\r\nit was on a north-south trajectory, and i see a lot of satellites on this path. my eyesight has been tested at 20/10 and i can see even the small ones on a night like this. however, this was larger or lower than any satellite. i wondered if it could have been the space station, and at first that's what i thought. when it was overhead, though, it started a tight arc to the west and i watched it move west until about 45% overhead when it just faded out. that was also strange, as it would seem that moving west it would get brighter as it caught more of the setting sun over the horizon. this almost seemed like it was moving away or farther out into space instead. \r\n\r\ni have never reported a ufo before. i've seen some odd things now and then, but nothing that was like this. it was clearly much higher than the commercial aircraft that fly over the house. i would estimate it was at 90-100k, but maybe higher if it was really large. as it flew over it stopped looking like it had a reflection and looked more like it had two lights on it. they were not flashing. this was not a plane. \r\n\r\ncould it have been military? maybe. there was no noise, though and the way it appeared and then disappeared was really odd. if was as high as i think it was, it was moving very rapidly, like a satellite. i think i observed the entire thing in a little less than a minute. \r\n\r\nanyway,

the wife and i saw it, she first noticed it as i was driving, when we first seen it the entire bottom was lit up in white light.It was high up, but when i got out of the car, i could see it was triangle shape on bottom, due to the light pattern that gave some dimension, the color appeared to be a charcoal brown, but as far as size. if i had to guess with distance and size in our view, i would guess it to be at-least 500 foot from one light to the other to the next, it was much closer than the 747's fly in the area, and i could see more detail on it than the planes that fly around

happened to look up in the sky, and saw a white or silver cigar shaped object, which looked to be atleast 100+ feet long, at an altitude of atleast 30,000 ft , heading from the north towards the south , on what would be the eastern edge of lexington, ky. this object was quite high up in the air , and i saw no wings, no smoke or vapor emission trail behind it, and no lights blinking, and no noise. i watched this object, until i lost sight of it, after about a minute of observation. then, about 30 seconds later, i looked back up at the area of the sky where i last saw the object, and this same shaped object had turned around, and was now heading back in the direction it came from ( now going south to north ). at one point, the sunlight reflected very brightly off of the object, for just a few seconds. the object then left my line of sight again, heading north, towards or over the downtown lexington area, but at the altitude the object was flying at, this could have been miles away from lexington. that type of altitude and distance is a bit hard to visually estimate. the object seemed to travel on a level course, and did appear to me, to travel a slight bit faster, than the usual high flying jet planes that i observe, from time to time.  i have to admit that this is the very first object that i have ever seen in the sky, that i had no answer for. i do live near an airport, and we have planes fly over all the time ( both low and very high ). but, even when the planes fly over real high, i have always been able to either see wings, a vapor trail, and/or a delayed engine noise, etc. this object had absolutely none of these things at all. and, i have seen meteors, comets, even the space station fly over, and this object was definately not any of those objects.  * maybe someone who has connnections with norad or a radar station near the lexington, ky area, can check with them, and see if they can advise if anything showed up on their radar around the time of day i have indicated, altitude, direction of travel, etc. tuesday, august 2 , 2011, at approx 1620 hrs ( 4:20 pm ). thank you, karl hiten .","distance":"Over One

green light and a red light, one at the end of each tip of this boomerang-ish craft....The closer she got, she realized it was a craft/ship of some type....It hovered at about the same height as the light poles on i-275 south (the road she was traveling).....She drove almost right under it, and said she almost pulled over to look at it (which is very uncharacteristic of her, as she is scared of her own shadow) but it vanished.....No trail, emissions ect, just poof! gone.....She told me about this weird feeling she got as she approached it....The hair on her arms stood up and i asked her if it was a feeling of fear, but she said not really, more uneasy...There were no other cars around at the time on 275 as she told me she was swerving due to her looking up at it the whole time..I arrived home about 15 mins after her and got a pen and paper and had her draw this thing and i asked her as many questions about it as i could before she told me she just wanted to go to bed and not think about it anymore....I reported this to the livonia police department and they told me they'd had no reports of anything of that nature, but the officer told me he'd check with surrounding departments and took my name/number ad would contact me with any details...The officer also informed me he had seen a ufo when he was a teenager and didnt think i was crazy at all....I don't really know what to think at this point or if i should leave me email or some contact info in case anyone else saw the same thing she did, but i will continue to research this....I dont have a scanner, but i do have her sketch that she did for me about 30 mins after witnessing this.","distance":"101-500

cigarette and noticed the starry night we have tonight, with light clouds rolling through occasionally. as i observed the sky above, (my body was facing towards the east)i took notice to this object that appeared to be gliding across at a somewhat high rate of speed.(sort of how satellites appear when moving at a low but rapid speed.) at first i thought it was a satellite just very low in the sky, but then i noticed that the color of it was due to the reflection of the city lights which i then realised was way lower than a satellite should be. it was dim but had a reddish/amberish glow(the same sort of color/glow you see on clouds when they're generally passing over a city that contrasts a lot of light.) it almost appeared as if it were gliding across the sky heading towards the south-west. as it moved further away, the reddish/amberish glow of the object became more dim which i assume is from it moving away from the city and as it kept gliding along, the dim faded out completely and i lost site of it. the object appeared to be moving at a set speed, faster than an airplane or helicopter, therefore i couldn't \"identify\" what it was, also as it moved along in a sw direction, it seemed to start heading in more of a western direction before the dim glow of it faded out. after that, i looked around the sky to see if i could spot any other odd things but decided to head back inside after spending another 5 or 10 minutes obvserving. it was very odd and sort of caught me off guard especially being outside with no lights on and put me in an eery mood. it seems i always spot these weird occurences around this time of year and of course i am never close to a camera or video camera to catch it! if anybody in cheyenne or wyoming has spotted anything strange in the sky, report it! we want to hear about it!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with

could locate the big dipper. as i knew where it was, we were scanning the sky directly above us. one of the brighter stars suddenly moved quickly from one point to another and stopped(moved about four fingers distance at arms length). then after about 15 or 20 seconds, it changed direction again, quickly moved snd stopped again in a second direction. after a short time it changed direction again to form a path of somewhat of a triangle. then it seemed to gradually drift(no more than that four finger length), and stayed stationary for as long as we kept our eyes on it. i pondered with my son what that could have been, and we came to the conclusion that there was nothing on earth that we know of that could have moved like that.(even though it looked the same as any other star, only a little brighter) coincidently, during the same timeframe we did see a shooting star going from the east to the west (superfast) that left a trail, not related to what we were looking at. the star or object we observed did not move again. it did not leave a trail and did not move as quickly as a shooting star. it did distinctly quickly  change direction each time after stopping all three times. it seemed as if once we were pointing at it stopped moving completely as if it saw we had seen it and it wanted to blend in. we decided to go inside to call a family member to see if maybe we we should call somebody about our sighting. they suggested the police but we felt a little silly. then we came across this website when trying to find somebody to report to. my son was a little worried because we both did witness this together and his imagination was working overtime. myself, now i have no doubt that there are things going on out there where i was always skeptial before. when we went back outside, i thought i had a refrence point as to where it was at, but we could not locate it again.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

parked on the side of a country road at night, so we could sleep in the car and get an early start with hunting. i was asleep in the rear seat of the car, and awoke around 3:00 am, to the sound of loud buzzing, going up and down in volume, and a humming noise similar to a generator. i looked through the car's rear window and saw a large round object hovering approx. 50-100 ft. above a nearby ridge, n/e of our position.The object was shaped like a huge shower head with small openings all over the surface that was facing me. it was turned slightly to the s/e. my first reaction was that i thought it was a military flare of some type because of the bright white light, as well as the fact that it moved slightly side to side. but as i watched it longer, i realized that it was way too big to be a type of flare, although i did observe it was dripping bright white material from the openings that were all over the surface of the craft.There didn't seem to be any set pattern for the \"drippings,\" as they came from different ports randomly.I don't know how long i watched the object but eventually i just went back to sleep. my companion did not wake up  during my encounter, and i asked him later if he heard or saw anything unusual during the night, and he said he didn't recall anything. because of the bizarre appearance of the object, i didn't want to tell him or anyone about it. later,i couldn't understand why i didn't get out of the car to get a better look at the object, since i am normally very curious about such things. in the morning, i didn't observe any damage to the ground underneath the approximate location of the craft.\r\nover the years, i read hundreds of descriptions of ufo sightings and noticed that none of them described a craft similar to the one i saw in hemet that night. in 2005, a famous psychic told me that i had an encounter with a alien ufo in the desert, before i could even finish my question. he said that the occupants of the craft were aware of my presence that night.\r\nthen, on march 3,2009, a long beach pd helicopter obtained video of a ufo flying over the city of long beach that was exactly like the ufo i observed in hemet, ca in 1962, but smaller in size. the video on youtube shows the white craft emitting white phosphorus-like drippings from openings on the front surface, just like i saw in 1962. it is a little unsettling to see the same type of craft, after all this time, flying around so close to where i live. i have become aware that i am thinking about the encounter quite a bit, which bothers me, too.
