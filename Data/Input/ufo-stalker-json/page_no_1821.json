could locate the big dipper. as i knew where it was, we were scanning the sky directly above us. one of the brighter stars suddenly moved quickly from one point to another and stopped(moved about four fingers distance at arms length). then after about 15 or 20 seconds, it changed direction again, quickly moved snd stopped again in a second direction. after a short time it changed direction again to form a path of somewhat of a triangle. then it seemed to gradually drift(no more than that four finger length), and stayed stationary for as long as we kept our eyes on it. i pondered with my son what that could have been, and we came to the conclusion that there was nothing on earth that we know of that could have moved like that.(even though it looked the same as any other star, only a little brighter) coincidently, during the same timeframe we did see a shooting star going from the east to the west (superfast) that left a trail, not related to what we were looking at. the star or object we observed did not move again. it did not leave a trail and did not move as quickly as a shooting star. it did distinctly quickly  change direction each time after stopping all three times. it seemed as if once we were pointing at it stopped moving completely as if it saw we had seen it and it wanted to blend in. we decided to go inside to call a family member to see if maybe we we should call somebody about our sighting. they suggested the police but we felt a little silly. then we came across this website when trying to find somebody to report to. my son was a little worried because we both did witness this together and his imagination was working overtime. myself, now i have no doubt that there are things going on out there where i was always skeptial before. when we went back outside, i thought i had a refrence point as to where it was at, but we could not locate it again.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

talk.  the night was clear and full of stars; we were far from any major city.  after watching planes coming in from the east, i saw a tiny white light flying along the path of the milky way, which was horizontal.  myself and about three other family members were facing east. i said, \"oh, look at the tiny white star dot going across the sky\".  i thought it looked odd, but thought maybe somebody else who grew up here might have an explanation.  the tiny dot didn't blink and seemed very far away.  someone said it could be a satellite.  i watched it go from the northeast to the southeast.  then, it veered slightly up and disappeared. i said a small silent prayer and continued to enjoy the beautiful night sky.  then, i saw another one traveling the same similar direction and it, too, veered and disappeared.  then shortly afterward another went southeast going northeast.  since i didn't grow up in the area, i thought maybe these were all satellites and they must orbit going opposite directions.  then, out of nowhere, we all saw a flash of light about pennysize in comparison to the other stars, which were like sharpened pencil dots.  it flashed out of nowhere into this white circle of light, stayed large, then shrunk to a smaller size and...Well...Flew away as if into the night.  in other words, the light got small and disappeared as if it was flying away from earth.  i don't know how else to explain it.  a couple of us said, \"whoa!  what was that?\"  the next day, on sunday, my husband heard a helicopter in our area around 11am.  might have been a regular

101n oakland, high above in the very clear blue sky was what looked like a very bright fireball which at first i thought was a blimp so i watched it...I remember the freeway at this point was clear the car in front of me was about 100 ft in front of me and another just ahead of that, the highway was pretty much straight and i was able to get a really good look at this object which was the apparent size of an aspirin in perspective of distance..It was pretty high up around the same altitude as a plane or blimp would be, which is why i kept looking to see if there were any airplane lights or a slow moving blimp, it seemed to be totally stationary neither coming or going just hovering and then what looked to me to change shape from cigar to perfect circle, then cigar, blimp, and some other shape i can't describe other than an arm reaching out of an oval, all this time it was very bright and looked to be very hot in temperature, a lot like molten lava, i was asking myself over and over of course \"what is that\" it's gotta be a blimp, a plane right? then it seemed to warble like a planet then it looked like it started to dim away or fade out. then i thought i could see through it, when it appeared transparent there was no color visable, the object seemed to look like a cloud or water vapor, at this time i still could dismiss it as a blimp but not an airplane as there were no other lights blinking or flashing, there also at the time seemed to be no other planes in the sky possibly only because i wouldnt have even noticed due to how bright this object was, it continued to appear to fad out only showing just the tiniest wispy, white, cloudy, semi circle, then it seemed to turn and get bright again, and then it just dissapeared, like someone turned off a light switch, no fade, but more like a flickering candle going out. i was scratching my head and just kept saying \"where did it go\" i looked around on the freeway again to see if i was close enough to other cars to see if maybe they were as flabbergasted as i was, i also was thinking...Those people ahead of me had to see that!!! i really seemed to be the only thing in the sky at that time...The bright fireball against a bright blue sky is hard to miss, i'm feeling very strange processing the emotional questions that keep coming up like \"am i crazy?\" did i see that? who do i tell,how do i report it, how do i find out if it was a weather balloon or a laser beam, i'm feeling like i'm in shock and having a hard time focusing on mundane chores.\r\ni noted the time to be between 2:45 to 2:55pm pacific standard, i'm really interested to know if someone else saw this too and if it was a blimp....How could it disappear? i just don't get it. would be nice to put my head to rest one way

just looking at the stars, constelations, looking for satalites and planes, ect. we noticed there was a lot of aitplane traffic. we thought it was unusal because we are in a small town and don't ever notice many planes flying. looking souteast we saw a thick trail about and inch long from our view. it appeared quickly in a flash, dimmed, then flashed another trail traveling horazontally to its left. we kept our eye in that area and saw a hovering craft where the trail had ended. it had multi-colred lights rotating and plusating. it hovered there for about 2 minutes. at this time it was the size of an asprin in the distance. it accended about an inch up, then begang to slowly move twords us. it traveled over our heads and continuted northwest untill it was out of our sight. as it was over our heads it was about the size of a soft ball. we don't know exactly how high it was. it was hard to referance because it was s dark, but we esstimate it was lower than a plane. it made no noise. we watched it fly over head slowly, it took about 10 minutes to fly over us. we could now see it better. it was dark and disc shaped. it had about 3 different colored lights pulsating, and a band of white lights spinning. it is hard to describe. we jumped to our feet, trying to come up with explainations and look closly to try to figure out what it was. my fiance started to look for our cell phone to take a video. it was too dark to see anything and we couldnt take out eyes off it. there is a minute video, but it is just black with audio of us freaking out. it was nothing either of us had ever seen. it seemed to at first make its entrance traveling at lightning speed, then hover for a few minutes, then slowly fly overhead. we kept staring at the skies and notced a plane came in from a new direction than anything else that night and seemed to be going the same direction as the ufo. within a minute there were two more following it. all three planes flew in that direction somehwhat close together. we saw at least 12 planes in the hour or so we were watching the skies before an after we saw the ufo. it was so big and low flying we found it hard to belive no one else saw

(as i write this the morning dawns on my shock, & i'm doing my very best to document this. i can say i felt a definite contact, a connection with something i do not know.  i must say also how very far away it was, i really thought it was a star way up there, until it moved.)\r\ni watched it dance, return to it's original position, brighten, dim, and disappear 4 times.  the 4th, and final time it disappeared, it did not return.  for a moment at least.  my rational mind cannot explain this thing i saw. so, i looked around again, and felt like my feet had softly landed back on terra firma.  a strange feeling, and my heart pounding fast, i went into the store... because now i really needed a soda... maybe two.\r\nthe guy remarked that i was wandering a bit around the store, and i couldn't help but tell him, \"sorry, but i think i just saw a real ufo out there.\"  he giggled, and asked me where.  i showed him where i saw it, paid, and left.  \r\nwhen i went back outside, it was solid bright, pulsing, stationary in the sky, and very obvious to anyone who could look, though no one was out.  i realized it probably wasn't a good idea for a girl to be outside at 4am, unarmed, alone, looking at the sky with a bag of goodies in hand.  i also realized i couldn't explain this, and couldn't look at it anymore.\r\nstars and planets brighten and flicker, but they don't dance around like that.  planes go in straight lines across the sky.  i do not know what this was, but it must have been huge to be seen from such a distance.\r\ni am descending into a daze, and i feel a little nauseous.  maybe alot nauseous.  my brain tries to make sense of it, and ties in a knot.  but i felt... intelligence!  i felt conciousness from that 'star'.  that's what it was!\r\ni have never looked for such things, and never even thought they were real since all my life i have looked at the night sky for so many hours, watching the stars, and they have never moved before.  there's got to be some high-powered telescope out there that saw this as well, it was unmistakeably something huge moving among the stars.  it's light was substantial.\r\nthis has changed me now forever.  thank you for reading my report.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":30523,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.3234255,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08092011-0111","longitude":-120.4865412,"occurred":1312196520000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1312932456000,"summary":"The first real ufo i have ever seen with my own eyes","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"95348","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":8,"locationName":"Merced, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:44331"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Bethlehem","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We saw a flattened oval arrangement of lights go from west to east along the top of south mountain toward the area of homer research labs. we tried to follow it by car but were unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nthis was told to mufon f.I. 11726 on sunday, july 31, 2011.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":30521,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.6354916,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08052011-0047","longitude":-75.3669079,"occurred":110271600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1312569218000,"summary":"Witness saw odd arrangement of white lights pass overhead.","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":13915,"locationName":"Bethlehem, Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:44332"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Laguna Beach","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Working security at laguna beach, ca., new housing development, midnight, very dark.  my co-worker and i saw a bright light in the sky moving from west to east.  the light stopped right above our heads.  it was glowing orange flames.  i was sure that it was a rocket from vandenberg afb just up the coast.  the object sat in the night sky for about a minute before disappearing.  my co-worker and i both agreed that the object seemed to \"go up\" in to space.  one minute later, two flashing red lights flying in formation appeared and stopped in the sky at the same location where the object ascended.  seconds later we heard a loud chopping sound coming down the california coastline.  we both ran toward the beach and saw a big black military helicopter with one flashing red light flying low down the coastline.  our cell phones and walkie talkie radios started ringing with everyone wanting to know what's going on.  my bosses made a big deal out of the incident.  they even checked with vandenberg afb.  nothing was ever resolved.

quickly. i noticed the object about 25-30 degrees to my left, starting from maybe 40 degrees above the horizon and fell below the tree-line. although i assume this was probably a meteorite, which could have been dozens of miles away, i felt i should report it anyway in case it wasn't. judging its motion while driving was a little difficult, besides the obvious nearly strait down descent. it appeared to possibly decelerate slightly, and may have maneuvered slightly as well, but this could have been due to my movement on the highway going 70mph. the object was star-like, about as bright as a very bright star. i just felt it was odd when i noticed its rapid descent, yet slow enough that it didn't streak like a common meteor. i've seen something like it once before around fort dodge, iowa about 6 years ago, but this one was much higher or closer. because of the tree-line, i was unable to see if it made contact with the ground, but it appeared it would have. the tree-line was quite some

went outside to cut some chives for the sandwich, walked out onto my side porch and around to the nearby garden bed on side of house. halfway there, i looked suddenly up at the sky and there was an aspirin sized object moving quickly in a straight path. not fast, but quickly. it was yellow in color, slightly orangish. it was too low to be a star. i turned my head towards the window and called my boyfriend to come and see, and turned back to look at it and there was no sign of it whatsoever. at the speed it was moving, and in the split second i turned my head away and then back, it did not have time to leave the large patch of sky that was visible. it was in the same patch of sky where i saw the last one, and moving in the same direction.
