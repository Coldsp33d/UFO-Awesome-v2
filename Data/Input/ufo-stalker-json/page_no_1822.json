car for my break. it was approximately 7:00pm est. by 7pm in early march in michigan, it is usually very dark already. as i walked to my car, i suddenly felt compelled to look up. when i looked up i saw a white starlike object appear. it didn't just appear all of a sudden; it seemed as if it was already flying fast then it slowed down to a halt and \"turned on\" sort of starlike aura around it. in other words, when i first saw it, it looked like it \"jumped out of hyperspace\". it floated slowly forward for several seconds then seemed to \"take off\". as it \"took off\", the starlike aura disappeared and it was gone. it flew low compared to most planes, but it was still high enough where i couldn't see any details of it other than a starlike appearance. the whole thing didn't last more than 5 seconds. it seemed to me that under the starlike aura there was some sort of craft, but it can turn off and on the aura which makes it look vaguely like a shooting star. i know it wasn't a shooting star though cause as the starlike appearance disappeared, i vaguely remember seeing the silhouette of the body of some sort of craft flying off very quickly. it was as if it turned off the starlike aura in order to fly off stealthily. from what i could tell, it wasn't huge, but it was maybe about the size of a large fighter jet. after i saw it, i wasn't sure how to feel. my first instinct was to be afraid, but as my adrenaline kicked in i began to tell myself \"wow, that was really amazing!\". i kept quiet about the sighting for several days, then i shared my experience with close friends. i was never one to believe in ufo's, but after seeing this, i know don't find people who talk about them to be crazy like i used to.\r\n\r\nabout two more times i have seen things in the sky similar to this sighting. i only see this when i am in the davison area where i first saw it. the second time i saw it, i was driving home from a movie with a friend in the car, and we both saw the same thing happen just over the treeline on the road. i cannot recall in detail the other time i saw it, but i definitely know i saw it at least one more time after my second sighting. i know that i am not crazy, because my friend was able to recount to me exactly the same thing i saw when i questioned him about what we saw in the car.\r\n\r\nall three times, the sightings happened exactly the same. all three times, it happened in the area of davison, mi. i even have a friend who was there for one of the sightings and saw exactly what i did.\r\n\r\ni don't know what it was, but it was definitely not something you see every day. whatever/whoever was the cause of this strange thing i saw; all i can tell you is that it happened, and i saw it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

because it was in my line of sight.  i couldn't see any wings, and so continued to watch it, waiting to see if it was jet plane, or a propeller plane, whatever... just idle curiosity.  \r\n\r\nso i watch this thing get closer to me, which remained completely silent by the way, and notice that there's no wings, no tail, no nothing.  it looked like a long white tylenol gelcap, complete with a black seam around the middle of it. i stop walking completely by this time, this thing has my full attention. it moved at a slight diagonal, passing in front of me, coming from my left to my right, moving from east-by-southeast to north-by-northwest, moving at a pretty good clip, not making any turns...Steady course, speed and altitude...And completely silent. it finally disappeared behind some trees.  somewhere within that 4-5 minutes while i was watching it, and the perspective changed as it moved, i should have seen wings or a tail, or a cockpit or windows, if it were, in fact, a plane. \r\n\r\ni saw the front of it as it was heading towards me, the side of it as it passed in front of me and the back end of it as it continued on. i would have been able to see wings or a tail from at least one of the perspectives. but there weren't any to see.\r\n\r\nit was a solid white capsule with a black ring around the middle of it. a flying headache capsule! i realize i should have taken a picture with my cell phone, but i kept thinking it was a plane. by the time my brain kicked in, telling me, okay kiddo, this is no airplane, it was already over the trees to my west and it was too late. \r\n\r\nafter thinking about it for a few days, and not being able to come up with any logical conclusion, i googled \"capsule ufo\" to see if maybe it was some new aircraft.  i found, on google images, the exact thing i saw. this is it, exactly.   http://lightsinthetexassky.Blogspot.Com/2010/07/navy-veteran-witnesses-cylinder-shaped.Html.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

morning (midnight hour) 7/31/11 in the eastern sky. first noticed by my sister in the backseat about a mile away from our farm. stopping in the road to get a better look. noticing that it seemed to expell something from the bottom. another smaller sphere 2 or three times.  this was a very bright sphere in the low in the sky. pulsating bright white light , growing dim then black (dark) then super bright. sphere seemed to move in all directions back forth up and down. there were at least 2 planes that were flying past very close to the sphere. i commented to my sister \"do you think they see it too?\" thinking they are in the sky and have a way better close up look? \r\ni got back in our car and we drove up to our farm. while my husband was taking in our groceries. my sister and i were watching for about an hour. \r\n\r\n\r\nmostly just filling out this report to ask did anyone else see what we were seeing this morning?\r\n\r\n did not loose sight , just went inside. i've seen many unexplainable things in the n.D. skies at night.  last year(summer)i was looking out my back door , saw a small red sphere moving around a field in my back yard. no more than 150 yards away. all of my sightings are always at night. and in the summer/ but that red sphere was so close to my backyard and maybe six feet off the ground. the only sighting that ever spooked me good. this is the first time i have ever reported anything . just thinking people will not take it serious. i will start filming proof of what i have been seeing for the last ten years.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

or so a object appears in the sky that looked like it was spinning but the main thing i know was it was metallic i might try to capture it again the thing is i kind believed but did not until i seen it in the sky and screamed to my girl to look and she also seen it then i was look around for other people to call attention to it but no one was around i started even scream look at some people who was a little far away across the street from the park i wanted other people to see it! as i kept looking at it it shinned at me i'm not sure if it was the surface or what not it also then started moving slowly and then just disappeared in front of my eye! this is no shit hook me and people have taken pictures of the same exact kind i have seen they are round and metallic looking and at night they glow i thought i seen on high in the sky along time ago but i had to look straight up in the air to see it. but this was their! i started saying what the hell was that we just seen a ufo it was wierd i just got done arguing with people who said they where snatched by aliens, i even apologized. i was part believer but a skeptic on alien abductions i now say nothing against believes as i now fully believe\r\n\r\nwell let me stop here because this did not end their i seen a lady in the park who just walk up just a few after it disappeared in thin air! she said she did not see it but she has seen them allot and she said she believed me i told her to keep a look out i wished i had a camera so bad! anyways i said maybe it was bag but i know what not a bag i know what they look like and it was real plus bags don't reappear. so how did it disappear for about 35 mins i did not see the lady but the object reappeared in the air and i was like hollyshit its back screaming at my girl to look and i looked for the lady but she was just gone i did not see her so she could have seen it if she was some where else else in the parkhell we joked it was as if she disappeared but hell some one else besides me had to see it, it was reflective when the sun hit it or it was flashing at me one of the two. this time it start to glide a little quicker and approaching our area a little and then it disappeared in front of my eyes again a few minutes later. i have a feeling that thing is still around this are and i want to know more its frustrating i wish i knew this site when it first happened but i can tell you it was not from this world nothing made of metal and that large can disappeared! matter of fact i don't know anything shinny that can disappeared entirely!\r\n\r\ni just needed to tell you guys so maby some one could use the info, i told my whole family the day i seen it they all knew i was 100% for real, especially how existed i was about it. you know i would have never thought i see something like that so it was like me finding a treasure but i have no way to prove it and now i'm like people there is some crazy shit going on this was in a city! thanks for reading and i'm sorry for those i did not keep a open mind to, because normally i do i just dont know why they would just choose one person out just to do test, i wonder if their from with in our own planet! that missile footage i think most people know about where the ship moves makes me think their are multiple and they don't get quite along with each other just an idea! \r\n\r\nthanks for letting me tell story finaly and i can release it! i don't care what anyone says i know what i seen i and i will take a polygraph to prove it so did my fiance!","distance":"Over One

i stopped just before the hwy and got on top of my car and watched the object. i looked like is was above and following hwy 98 to the west real slow. all of a sudden it took off and went completely out of site in a straight line to west in like a 1001 1000 count. it did not loose altitude, it was a clear cool night and it was very fast. to this day i get goose bumps when i think about it. we dont have anything then or now that can move that fast. it made no sound. i would be willing to take a lie detector test. i have never seen anything like that again. there are other folks that have

miles per hour, very slow, i ran outside to see that and saw it moving toward me. i ran inside the house and got my camera and by that time it was beside my rooftop, it's bottom almost touched my roof.\r\ntoke a picture and the flash popped up.\r\ni ran beside my wall and i saw the diamond shape and the colors.\r\nas the light moved along towards the sunrise i took a second picture that i have saved. that picture was taken at 25 to 30 feet above ground and all you see is a little speck with 3 different lights like a picture of something 3 miles away.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less,
