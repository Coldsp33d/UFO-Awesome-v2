concord lane going toward nashville. first we saw approximately 25 to 30 cars pulled over on the side of the interstate. they were in groups as if in a caravan that was stopped. it was at this time my wife saw the lights on my side of the car in the sky. we live in this area so we knew there should not be any lights there. we were planning on getting off exit 71 anyway to go home however this time i took the opposite way heading toward the lights that appeared to be over the brentwood baptist church . the sky was relatively cloud free in this area. as we got closer to the church the lights started to disappear. they then vanished completely from view and was replaced by an odd cloud formation. on the way to the church parking lot after getting off the interstate numerous other vehicles were stopped and people were going in and turning around in the parking lot. numerous people were stopped in the parking lot and outside of their vehicles.  we talked to at least 3 different people who said they also saw the lights. i saw about 4 or 5 lights and my wife said she saw about 8 or 9. she reported that the formation looked like an arrow. i saw more of a triangle shape. to make it clear i was driving so it was hard for me to focus to get a good steady view. the best view i got was sitting at the stop light waiting to turn into the church parking lot and that was more of it going away. my wife said that the arrow shape appeared more as we got closer and that her first view was in the tree line from the interstate. the lights were yellowish orange and looked uniform in size and color to me.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":30471,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.0350764,"location":null,"logNumber":"","longitude":-86.7758072,"occurred":1312085700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Tennessee","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle,

(i regret not having \r\nnoted the date at the time).\r\ni pulled in to the parking lot of the riviera restaurant located on rt. 272 near reamstown, pa. (lancaster county)\r\ngetting out of the car, i noted to myself how amazingly clear and crisp the weather had become after a day of hazy and cloudy skies.\r\n\r\ncoming out of the restaurant around 9:30 pm, i sat down behind the wheel of my car and looked straight out of my windshield onto a single clumping of white, solid-looking cumulus-like clouds hovering at what seemed to be an unusually low altitude. my car was oriented facing the south east.\r\n\r\nthe entire formation was about the size of my fist \r\nheld at arms' length. i can only guess it was between 5 and 10 miles in the distance.\r\nit was 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon with an absolutely clear sky \r\neverywhere else.\r\nlightning bolts were wrapping themselves around the cloud and through the \r\ncloud, with occasional bolts directed downward to the ground.\r\ni was transfixed by this strange sight.  bolts of lightening almost every \r\nsecond, some of them illuminating the cloud from behind, and some directly visible as forked powerful bolts of lightning. it was like i was sitting at a drive-in movie.\r\n\r\ni remember thinking to myself, \"good lord, the people living underneath that cloud must be thinking it's the end of the world\".\r\ni observed this for over 20 minutes... hundreds of lightning bolts, sometimes two or three at a time. at least one every second or so. no sound.  where was the thunder?\r\n\r\nat the time i had a pilot weather application for my cell phone which had a lightning 'mode' whereby one could see lightning strikes in a storm shown as individual yellow 'x's on the map of an area .  i enlarged the map area to include a hundred mile radius from my location. not one single lightning strike appeared in the entire area except for a huge ball of yellow directly over where i estimated the cloud to be located, se of reamstown.\r\nso many lightning strikes that individual x's merged into a ball of yellow.\r\n\r\nas there was no sign of this phenomenon letting up, and being tired after a full work-day, i headed home towards reading but kept an eye on the cloud in my rear-view mirrors for several miles until the road led me over a hill and i lost sight of it.\r\n\r\nrecently, i decided to google earth the location, and discovered that within 5 - 7 miles (correction, google map says 10 miles) in the line of sight from my car and the estimated location of \r\nthe cloud, there exists a quarry (silver hill quarry, narvon, pa) as well as further on the highest point for many miles, a pinnacle about 600 in altitude (state game lands #52)  this area seems to be the \r\nleast inhabited of this local part of the county.\r\n\r\nwas this a cloud-wrapped ufo \"recharging\" using the water and/or minerals in the quarry?","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

the northern horizon.  this object proceeded on a southerly course and flew directly over top of me.  altitude was approximately 2-3,000 feet.  the object had a very bright red light that appeared to be at the front portion of the rotating craft.  this first object, after passing over me, vanished.  \r\n\r\ni then noticed a second object, exact same characteristics, once again appear on the northern horizon.  at this point i asked my wife and daughter to come out and look at the object.  my wife brought her dslr 14mp camera.  once again, the object was a rotating circular orb with an extremely bright red light.  it followed the exact same course/heading as the first craft (north to south ... straight line).  altitude was approximately 2-3,000 feet and speed was similar to that of a commercial jet flying at the altitude.  \r\n\r\nthis time, my wife was able to take two pictures of the object.  they are attached.  more importantly, i grabbed a 15 million candlepower spotlight and began to shine it directly on the object at its closest approach to us (nearly overhead).  after 4-5 bursts of the spotlight, the bright red light on the object immediately ceased.  i continued to shine the light on the object and was able to observe the following:\r\n\r\n> the object appeared solid.\r\n> the object had a round, circular shape.\r\n> the object was clearly rotating or spinning.\r\n> the object appeared to be 1/3 the size of a commercial airliner at that altitude.\r\n> the object had a dull gray or dull silver color that reflected the spotlight beam.\r\n> the object continued on a southerly course, with no visible light, until we could no longer see it.\r\n\r\ni am an avid amateur astronomer with many years of experience.  i also am very well versed in meteorology.  i know what commercial and military aircraft look like, as we are in the flight path of commercial and military airports.  i also know that the atmosphere was clear and stable at the time of the sighting.  i know what most objects are in the sky... such as planets, stars, constellations, satellites etc.  i firmly believe that the object that was witnessed by my wife, daughter and me was not something that i have ever seen before.  it was certainly extraordinary.  i think i am most puzzled by the way the object immediately cut out its light when i focused a spotlight on it.  it certainly took my breath away to see the shape and color of the solid object.  \r\n\r\nplease feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss this further.\r\n\r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

was to the east. it looked like it was toward the gorge and maybe ne of mt hood. i stood on my balcony for a half an hour watching the light and it did not move- it did not get closer, it did not get farther- and it did not move in any direction- it just sat there. it looked like a star and just pulsated lights that sometimes changed colors from a purplish to a white and sometimes it even dimmed to a real dim pin dot light before illuminating again in to a pulsating hanging star...\r\n while watching the light i saw many airplanes come over the horizon and their lights would noticably move as they came closer- they would pass over head and then proceed west to the airport. during this time the light over the east horizon did not move or appear to be getting closer at any time- for almost 2 hours i watched the light and it stayed the same.\r\n also- i actually took a video of the object- and as i was doing so my fiance was telling me from inside the house to just leave it alone and don't take any pictures- when i rewatched the video immediately after the incident i noticed three lights appear in the video which were not visible with the naked eye during the incident- the three lights appeared in the left side of the camera view and did not appear to come from any source at the time- as the location of these lights was on the side of the building where there are no lighting or way for these lights to appear. they were in ascending order and appeared to get closer to the location of where i was standing with each light.- almost like if i was being tracked or pinpointed.\r\n the next day when i was going to upload the video i found that the charging port on my phone had been burned out and the phone is inoperable ( though i still have it) \r\n\r\n\r\ni have continued to see

what we thought was a helocopter hovering above adams farm.  we were in the area of athol historical society, heading up main street.  by the time we reached the old steak house (some 110 yards away), this craft was hovering over my house on grove street, like 100 to 200 feet above the house.  i rolled down my window to get a better look and to listen to it.  it was completely silent.  while above my house, it slowly turned to the left and slowly followed the line of houses up grove street, paused at the turn, turned right onto summer street, continued to follow the house line to main street, where it paused again, turned slight right to point at the quabbin reservoir, then took off at a high rate of speed in that direction.  both my friend and i were in awe.  it did not resemble any aircraft known to me.\r\n\r\nthe craft was black or dark in color, triangular in shape, and had white lights around it's perimeter.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

first when it was desending i thought it was a meteor, then it turned, i knew then it was not a meteor! it happened really fast. it looked like the ball of light that decended over the wailing wall in
