one that was unusual.  at first i thought it might be a planet within sight, although i don't really keep track of planetary movement, i know that sometimes mars and venus are visible, and can appear red and blue.  this starlike object seemed to be rapidly pulsing or strobing, mostly white, but i also noticed very distinct pulses of red and blue.  it was happening extremely fast, the distinction of colors was very difficult if you weren't watching intensely but the strobing effect was very obvious in general when compared to visible stars in other directions.  we came back in and started googling, searching for similar reports or an explantion.  after about an hour or two, we went out to see if it was still there.  in the same direction, we noticed more of these \"stars\" blinking in the same fashion.  it seemed like there were anywhere from 7-10 + of them of varying brightness, although they all displayed the same strobing characteristics.  my gf noted that some of them seemed to move, even if only slightly.  i can't say for sure that i noticed this, but i can definitely not say for sure that they didn't.  i can't say that there was any more significant movement than the normal slow path of celestial objects during the course of the evening.  it was difficult at times to see all of them with them being faint, and some streetlight interference.  being the skeptic that i am, i can only assume that it may have something to do with smog and general air pollution in the air over atlanta (south of my location) causing a visual effect.  i naturally want to find a scientific explanation here but until i do, i thought this was significant enough to post.  most noteworthy for me, was the brilliant color.  the red and blue were exactly the \"red\" and \"blue\" from a crayola crayon box.  i am 100% sure that these were not planes.  living near several airports over the last years, i have seen more than my fair share of planes, helicopters, and even military aircraft.  as of the time of report.  the objects have not disappeared.  i will continue to look for them on clear evenings in the same direction(south of marietta /

 there were other clouds and some light haze, the usual color of that dirty brownish-pink/purple/orange of nighttime city clouds.  but there were two large, softly rounded clouds that were a bright silvery-whitish blue--they appeared almost to be lit from within.  then we saw this brilliant burst---not a flash, a burst--of lighting.  it reminded me of the lighting seen in this video on youtube of a pyramid ufo and crazy lightning in the sky over taiwan!  we walked out to this gravel pit near our apartment complex (which is out in the country sort of...We get lots of skywatching in, as light pollution isn't so bad out here).  when we got there, there was another burst of lightning in the glowing blue clouds.  we had a completely un-obstructed view of the sky a-la planetarium style.  the clouds were in the wnw.  as we looked around, watching about 5-6 different \"stars\" that were flashing rainbow colors very brightly and very rapidly, we both witnessed a brilliantly bright white starlike object form.  it grew brighter and larger, then began to move towards the blue-glowing clouds in the wnw.  as it moved, the starlike object got smaller and faded--this was very rapid (in a matter of maybe 10 seconds,it had moved maybe 90 degrees across the sky).  we looked back towards the clouds, and saw the rainbow sparkling objects were seeming to almost exchange places, revolving around some unseen center point, they circled one higher, one lower--they had previously been almost in a horizontally level line with each other.  another of the rainbow flashers started moving off across the sky to nw.  we saw some blinking flying objects that might have been airplanes except that they weren't properly lit for navigation identification purposes and they were totally silent.  one airplane did pass overhead at the end of the event--proper navigation lighting (red light on the left wing, green on the right, white in the center and the tail) and the doppler effect soundwaves  properly matched the airplane's movement/distances.  during this event, there were strong, cooling breezes around me and my fiance, but only trees in our immediate vicinity were affected--trees that were only 30-50 feet away were completely still.  this \"wind\" seemed to move diagonally towards us from the direction of the sky.  we were both psychologically washed with a sense of gratitude, awe, wonder, and many other such gentle feelings.  it was very beautiful and we both felt like we'd been targeted to have this experience shared with us!  it felt like whatever it was, it was intelligent, benevolent, comforting and friendly. i had tried to use my digital camera to record some of this event, but it's a piece of crap and so i got darkness and me and my fiance talking. but we'll never forget what we saw!

see alot of military flying over this area all the time. military jets are always flying over almost daily. at first i thought it was flares that they shoot. i have seen flares shot on a regular basis and know them when i see them. there was a lighting storm moving from the southwest to the northeast last night over the butler valley. the lighting was fair sense i got phx lighting the clouds up. the ceiling was very high last night. these lights were well below the clouds. as i sat there and watched i noticed how the lights would turn on then off in a instant. when they turned back on they were in a different spot. i watched for 5 minutes about then they stopped. the lights were there for the whole 5 minutes. butler valley gets all sorts of military activity because no one hardly is out there. it is also the sight of the old camp bouse used during ww2. i've spotted a-10,c-130 black heli's and numerous figher jets in that area as i explore it. it is got a aura to it out there where i

a small flashing light that i didnt notice at first it seems to fly to the craft then comes out other side.I have my big screen tv as the monitor on my computer which seems to work better than a

pool in the back yard with the pool lights on. i snapped a photo of the flower opening up. the yard was about a quarter acre. each home surrounding mine was a ranch style. from the west, over the house behind mine, their backyard facing mine. for some reason i turned around facing the pool and neighbors back yard and watched this totally black craft fly over my neighbor house and veer to the right. it stopped between the two houses on the right side of mine.\r\ni was stunned. it appeared bigger than 3 football fields. the reflection from the pool lit the underside of the craft. there was a circular dome at each corner and one in the center. i could see what appeared to be hydraulic gears or something to that effect near the circles.\r\nthe moon was rising to the east barely over the house across the street.\r\nnext thing i knew i was taking pictures of a cactus.\r\nthe object began to move towards the east. i looked at my watch. it was aroound 11:00pm. i yelled for my roomate to come see it. by the time he got out the back door, it was so small and had travelled such a grest distance that all you could see is a black horizontal line in the night sky.\r\nadded note. the craft was not much higher than the pine trees whcih grow in that part of the state. maybe  a little more than 50 ft above th tree line. the points of the craft appeared to be rounded.

cigarette before i went to bed.I went out the front door and headed to my car to sit on the trunk parked in the drive way.That's when i lit my cigarette.As i was sitting there i always like to observe the stars in the sky. except it was windy and cloudy and couldn't really see anything.That's when i got this eerie feeling that something was behind me.So i turned around to see what was there.As i was looking in the sky behind me above the house just below the clouds a black shape starts to form.At first i thought it was a flock of birds but that is when it started to get bigger and wider.That is when it caught my attention that these are not birds or anything of that nature.It slowly moved over my house and that  is when i got a good look in shock.A perfect triangle pitch black with no lights and no sound.It was about two football fields long,one football field wide.I saw the object for a good minute or two as it slowly flew over me just below the clouds.I followed it to the street from my drive way.That is when it slowly went up into the clouds and was not visible.I could not believe my eyes.It was like winning the lotto seeing what i saw for the first time up close and personal.It still give me chills.But wait there's more.As i started to head back to the house to tell my wife what i saw i noticed a bright glowing ball in the direction in which the mother ship came from.(and i do stress the word mother ship) the glowing ball was like no other light i have seen before.It was moving fast ,just below the clouds,no noise in a up and down motion.For sure not a plane.Saw for a good 20 sec before it went up into the clouds as the mother ship.That was the icing on the cake.Rushing inside to tell my wife the news i hear growling in the bushes next to my car in the driveway.Scared shit less already i am wondering what the hell.Next thing u know the bush is shaking and sounds like two cats fighting tearing each other up.I panic and run inside to grab something to defend my self.My wife in shock sees me run inside like a mad man zoom past her to grab a broom.Trying to explain what happened my adrealine was going so fast i couldnt talk.Finally calm my self down and tell her what had happened,we both in shock.She asks why i did not go get her to witness this.I told her i did not want to miss this once in a life time chance to see a real u.F.O. /mother ship.Then again i wished i did get her so i wont look so crazy.But i know what i saw and people we are not alone.No plane i know that huge and so low with no sound no lights can exsist. it was meant to be and a sign for things to come.Couldn't sleep for nights. just for record i live by the coast and these objects came from the direction of the water by a navel air station.Reported to them about my situation.They asked me questions and couldnt tell me if planes were in my area but told me its a possibility i saw something.Damm straight i did. thanks for viewing and be happy to answer

met each other coming in opposite directions on a hill on ross glen trail near the ross creek. we we're on top of an escarpment sitting on a bench looking out at a bend in the creek. the railway ran between us and the creek but below the escarpment. we spotted what we thought was a plane up high but wasn't making any noise or blinking. i joked that it was a ufo and we dismissed it not really believing.    i had the pipe out and was about to light it when i saw something my mind could not rationalize. i at first thought it was a giant hawk carrying a red light gliding down beside to our right at approximately 30 feet out and 15 feet above the ground. it was roughly 110cm long 75cm deep and 60cm wide.The top of the craft had a dome shape to it that hung over top of an under belly that was more square. being that it was dusk (about 10pm) the color was hard to distinguish; id say a slate grey/blue. it had a red light in the middle on what i would call the front, or side facing us, about 10cm across. this light was not solid but more of a soft glow a bit like an ember but mostly red.Its appearance and movements reminded me of the floating robot (343 guilty spark) from halo but with a red light. the craft descended at maybe a bit above jogging speed from our right periphery down and over the escarpment in front of us. it pivoted left and right while it silently descended in a smooth glide.T. and i knew this was out of the ordinary and followed it, but it had ducked out of view below us. we were stunned but excited. t.J. may have filmed it on his iphone but it was quit dark out with the sun behind us. we couldn't spot the craft on his phone but the ufo was below the horizon and blended in well. we had to go around the escarpment to see where we thought it landed. as we were looking for a way down we noticed a woman walking her dog and asked her if she saw anything and she said \"you mean that ballon?\" i scoffed and said it was a ufo. we biked to the next dip in the path and left the bikes to get down on the railroad tracks for a better look. we we're somewhat nervous about doing this as it was dark out and had a poor light, but felt we must to settle it for us.  t. had his headlamp on at this point since we couldn't see the cacti very well. we finally got around to where we thought it must have gone since it wasn't seen leaving the blind spot below the escarpment. nothing was found out of the ordinary. we are going to return in the daylight to see if we can find anything that resembled what we saw. as the experience set in, we both argeed it was probably the same thing way up in the sky maybe 2 minutes before. we dismissed it as an airplane though i subconsciously thought it was strange that it wasn't blinking or making any noise. i try not to be too paranoid so i never thought twice about it.
