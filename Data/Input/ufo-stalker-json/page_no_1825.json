within seconds the object was already passing directly over his position, and he reports that it appeared quite huge, at least 20 acres in size, covering most of his field of view as it passed over. my brother then came outside the building and saw the object and stopped and watched it with my dad until it was over the east horizon and out of sight, all of which only took a few minutes from when it was first spotted.\r\n\r\nthey both report that it has multiple light sources, and appeared to be made of many long rectangular sections of a dark colored material all linked together, and parallel, but offset from each other. \r\nthe entire craft as a whole gave off a bright glow of amber light, but they could see many other colors from the stationary lights attached.\r\n\r\nafter the object passed and went out of sight, they looked at each other and shrugged their shoulders and went home. they experienced a very long period of disinterest (since event date) in the event as if it was nothing special or important, and only recently are remembering that the attitude they had finally seems unreasonable..They feel now that the object may have affected their minds in a very subtle way to disinterest them from their sighting. my dad says the object moved so fast, that it seemed to be travelling a few or more thousand miles per hour. \r\n\r\nno one can remember the actual date of

the local boy scouts and i went into dahlonega to pick him up, about 10 pm. we left town down a long straight\r\nroad. we saw a round light just above the tree line at the end of the road\r\n(it was a dead end). when we turned right, the light began to follow us,\r\nmatching our speed and every turn. we lived on a dirt road, which we had\r\nto take a left turn to reach. i stopped before our road, pulled off the\r\nside of the asphalt road and stopped. my son and i (he was 14) got out of\r\nthe car to look at the light. it stopped when we did. it stayed stationary\r\nfor about 30 seconds, then very slowly, seemed to 'float', directly over\r\nmy car, about 30 feet above us. it made no noise, and all we could see was\r\nthe round light, about 6 feet across. we watched it go over us into a\r\nfield behind where we were stopped. the light disappeared, and i had the\r\ndistinct feeling that it had gone behind a mountain. i don't know why, \r\nbecause this was a cow pasture which i had seen many times. we got back\r\ninto the car and pulled into our dirt road. as i had been drinking coffee\r\nfor several hours, i drove into a short pull-off and we got out of the car\r\nto relieve ourselves. at the same time, we both felt the need to look up.\r\nthe light was hovering directly above us, again just above the tree line.\r\nafter about 30 seconds, it again 'floated' the 20 feet over to our dirt\r\nroad. it then accelerated down the road, from a stopped position to moving\r\nso quickly that it left a light 'trail'. i've never before or since seen anything move like that. for some reason, my son and i looked at each other and said 'mom'. my wife was at home by her self. i drove down the dirt road as quickly as i ever have. when we pulled into our driveway, we could see nothing. we decided we wouldn't tell my wife about this.\r\nwhen we went inside the house my wife was sitting in a corner of the kitchen, holding our chihuahua and my shotgun. we calmed her down and she\r\ntold us that just before we came in, she and the dog had been out own our\r\nback deck. she said the dog had started barking, and then the whole yard was 'lit up' by something she couldn't see. she went into the house, and hid. about two months later, we heard odd noises in the back, i went out and saw a large owl. related? i only told one person at work, i thought a friend. he looked at me like i was crazy, and didn't want to be around me anymore. i didn't tell anyone else. what i still wonder is: was it waiting for the first car to come by, was it waiting for me or my son, or my wife. i read ufo books a lot, but have never seen anyone else telling\r\na similar story. i would love to hear from someone with that story, and maybe determine if there was a reason for this.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

and happens to go around a flight strip where planes land near my home.  that area is particularly dark as there are no artificial lights in the immediate area so you can see all the stars.  sometimes i would even park my car and star gaze some nights but this particular night i was just driving home, it was past 1am im sure and having grown up in this area im familiar with the lights/buildings in the area.  as i was driving down that long dark winding growdon rd near kelly usa - port san antonio (formerly kelly afb)i saw a tower of lights in the distance.. and i wondered to myself when they had built that tower because i had never seen a string of lights before in that area in the distance. (from where it was i imagined it was past kelly afb which is a considerable distance and maybe on the other side of it near old pearsall rd.) so i kept driving but then i noticed a second set of lights turn on above that tall tower... so it looked like the tower was actually much taller with a string of lights running along it down to the ground. so at this point i began to slow down because i hadnt noticed this tower of light before and i noticed my radio began to static so i turned it off.  and slowed down and continued to watch the \"tower of lights\" when a third set of lights turned on which made the tower even taller, now it was a size that i had never seen a tower which was built by man, at this point it even appeared as if the lights extended off into the sky, into clouds that had overcast the night.  at this point i literally had to stretch my neck towards my dash board to see how far the lights were going up in to the sky, so i pulled over and got off the car.  and watched as these lights started to ascend upwards in a pulsating sequential order, i imagined maybe it was like a tube that connected to the ground and extended off into space... although im not really sure what it was.  i noticed further down the road at this point a car was also pulled over because i could see their red tail lights on in the distance.  and stood their in wonderment for at least ten minutes im thinking because i didnt know what it was and the lights kept blinking upwards until it all just shut off and went dark and then it appeared as if the tower was gone.  i got back in my car and drove towards the other car that was parked and saw a man standing outside of his car just looking in that direction, it was really dark outside and late so although i wanted to stop and ask him if he had seen it i was too shook up from the whole experience and i got paranoid thinking maybe he knew what it was and i didnt want him to know i had seen it too.  funny enough the next day i drove down that road again to see if there was in fact a tower or something off in the distance, but there wasnt.  and strangely enough not long after this the govt had this road closed and now no one can actually drive through it, i found that expecially creepy. they called it flight line and people used to always come here to watch the air shows or even randon planes land. i still live in the neighborhood near there and i still wonder what it was that i saw...

a in a mood to write this all over again.  \r\n\r\nto:  \r\n\r\nfrom:  senna\r\n\r\n \r\nfirst of all i would like to greet you and say a little something about myself. i am from bosnia and herzegovina, from the city of mostar, 36, still live wit my parents due to our economic situation and virtually non-functioning legal state. i have associate���������s degree in business management and pursuing bachelor���������s degree, for what unfortunately for the time being i have ran out of funds. i speak two foreign languages, english and german, from sports i love races, from music i adore linkin park, like alternative music, electronic, jazz��������� right at this moment i am trying to fix my life. that means that i am trying to go abroad and find myself some work and have a life. i have even planned to go to live permanently in australia and to come back in my country in a couple of years just to end my studies. i love science in general, astrophysics and from time to time astronomy. i am from time to time a sci fi fan. i am an amateur photographer. what i am trying to tell you is that i am just a regular guy fighting his way through this rough life. \r\n\r\ni like to think a lot. to think about life, forms of existence, i like theravada buddhism, i like to think about the latest discoveries in science in general and physics. honestly i figured out alone with just a couple of information how gps really works. it took me two days of non stop pondering. i did not want to read about it. i simply wanted to check if i am smart enough to figure it out alone. some of the most difficult concepts from physics i understand without any problems. i know that i have something in my head definitely.       \r\n\r\ni also love watching phoenix, n-tv, discovery and nat geo. that is basically all i watch. i am a little bit geeky. \r\n\r\nwhat i really wanted to write to you are occurrences in my life that have started happening a year ago. i have even photos as a proof. i honestly think that i am going to shoot more of them in the coming months. i can see them and they can see me. i communicate with them and communicate with me. they communicate with me on the basic primitive level that i can understand, with lights and appearances. i communicate with them on the way that when my energy is good i can literally call them to see them. but only when my energy is good. please do not stop reading this right now. i will try to explain this as briefly as i can. \r\n\r\nthe beings i am telling you about are those balls of light, serpents in the sky as you call it and cigarette shaped ufos. please keep on reading this, i am not crazy. \r\n\r\ni saw a ufo for the first time in 1988-1989. i was camping with my family and their friends in peljesac. peljesac is a place near dubrovnik in croatia. my family and their friends all had camping trailers. camping trailer is an old passion of my father. it was around 10-12 in the night and we were standing on a concrete playground when we, maybe 10 kilometers in distance, started seeing a string of ball lights, different color each. in front of us in a distance there were two peaks of hills, maybe 3-4 kilometers distant one from another, and the string of balls of light was slowly gliding from one peak to another. to cover that distance from one peak to another it took it maybe half an hour and it would shoot back in a fragment of a second to its starting position. it lasted for 3-4 hours and whole camp, including my parents, was watching it amazed. later that night a friend of mine, he was one of sons of the family that we went together on vacation, went to do some night fishing in small fishing boats with locals who were our friends. i wanted to go also but did not let me since i was too young. when he came back in the morning i saw him pale and shivering. and he was like that all day long. that night he told us what was the problem. they are fishing and all of the sudden that string of lights appeared above them and started descending. while descending the lights rolled into a strudel. there was a rotating light in the middle. the lights were so strong that, although the see was at least 50 meters deep, they could see all the way to the bottom. women who were on those boats started screaming that the wholly mother mary has come for them and started jumping into the see. when the object was maybe 20-30 meters above them they heard a jet plain (most probably military), the object straightened itself again and shot into the sky. \r\nonly later i understood completely what i saw. if that object in 0,1 second has covered a distance of 3000-4000 meters, that on the persons inside must have acted forces of 3000-4000 gs. that means that they could not survive that at all. neither they nor some russian or american experimental machines.   \r\n\r\ni witnessed the second strange appearance in the sky 6-7 years ago. it was middle of the day. i live on the 12-th floor of 13 floor building. it was warm outside, i went, bought myself a couple of beers and went to the terrace of my building to drink it, watch the city and just be alone. in front of me, maybe 300-400 meters in a distance in the sky, appeared a translucent white object slowly gliding through the air in a straight line. it was little bit shaped as a ball and then a little bit as a donut. i started thinking that it could be just a plastic bag carried by the wind. but there was no wind, the object was going in a straight line, with a constant speed and height and in regular periods changed its form. i started laughing and watched it glide to the south. \r\n\r\ni am a bit loner. in the last 2-3 years i have had a habit to sit alone between 10 and 11 in the night on a balcony, drink beer and think about life, science, my job, education and people in general. regularly one time a month a could see a ball of light slowly gliding through the air above the city, sometimes going in the straight line and sometimes changing direction. it was much bigger than the other stars on the sky, it did not flicker at all so it could not be a satellite and it was neither airplane nor a helicopter. they always have small, rotating strobe lights on the lover part of their hulls and almost every time you can hear its engines. they simply looked to me like plain balls of light. just to say that bosnia and herzegovina is economically destroyed country. we had a war here. we have absolutely no military airplanes and only some russian helicopters. we still have here international troops but they also have only a small number of helicopters. mostar, my city, has a small airport. airplanes are easy to spot in the night sky here. there are not so many and they always have those strobes on and you can hear its engines. i see plains doing fly-overs, going to dubrovnik or split airport. this was simply not it. at the begging of that all i was scared and then i stopped. \r\n\r\nthis what i am to tell you about started a year ago, last summer. i am here practically a dissident. we have one of the most corrupt states in europe, with a relic social system old maybe 500 years. i did not even care until they started harassing me. i said something wrong about these powerful people here and they were all over me mentally and physically. most of the people here do not care. they simply try to keep they jobs, if they have them and all, and most of them are simply scared. i am not. i started regularly barking on our corruption, criminal, governments and on our everyday situation we live in. even right now when i am writing this to you i am still in troubles up to my throat and i am trying to go to live and work in australia. here it has become unbearable for me. just to mention that i am not the only one here who is fed up with all of the situation here. we have a journalist in sarajevo who has a tv show called 60 minutes and he also gives all in the faces to those bullies in control. he is a real journalist and gives to the public nothing but hard facts. he is constantly under police watch. they threaten him non-stop with his life.  \r\n\r\nok. last summer i was sitting alone on a field outside mostar, all stressed up. i was working as a security guard and doing shift that nigh in some dilapidated, closed, old and small industrial complex. on those shifts that i had to do there i had nothing else to do but to watch into the stars. there was no electricity, i had only a radio on my mobile which i could listen maybe a 2-3 hours every night before it gets boring to me. every second or third shift i saw stars going over the sky, maybe in 20 minutes distance one from another, at some point lighting up and shining really bright. they were always going from the south to the north at the same speed, at the same patch of the sky, with the same brightness. not all of them. only those stars that i am talking about. i know about earth satellites and its flayers. i felt that that what i saw simply could not be it. not these particular lights that i am telling you about anyway. one day i started thinking and decided to check in some way what they really were. i got an idea for a flash light. it was more a fun for me since i had nothing else to do there all nights long and i could not sleep due to my service. it was simply just something to do. for every shift i carried with me a strong flash light. i had to. i started flashing on those satellites. the signal was 3 times switched on and off, pause of 1-2 seconds and then the same signal again, then again pause of 2-3 seconds and then that 3 by 3 signal repeated for one more time. it was some sort of a fun code. nothing happened for a while. than those lights started appearing at least 3-4 times more often during the night. i felt them there ��������� this is the simplest explanation. i do not care how insane this sounds. they always flew from the south to the north, they were visible almost always for about a minute, with flayers at beginning, in the middle or in the end. i knew that those were the rounded ones, how i call them. \r\n\r\nfor the above mentioned reason, my countering our everyday state of our society in this country, i lost that job. for the above mentioned reason right now i simply have here very little friends. people do not want problems and they avoid me most of the time. i have no money to go to the city in caf��������� bars and discos. the last half of this year i have been spending chatting over facebook with people all over the world. regular topics. i have on that web site people who i have known for a long time and who went abroad due to the war, along with some new friends. in the last half of a year i go outside alone. most of the time i sit alone and drink beer. not too much. maybe 4-5 beers daily. i need something to keep me sane. i am basically here in isolation. they threat me daily, and i also do not give up. i can not. they simply do not want to come off my back. and i even do not care about their money and this state. i just want to have a normal life. the last half of a year i have been spending also looking for a job on sea rigs, in iraq, afghanistan, australia, wherever only that i do not stay here. i selected these places and jobs because i think that for me the easiest it would be to find a job from which other people simply run away.  since i have a lot of extra time i also learned to speak german. not as good as english, but for the time being good enough. if the things here get too much for me to handle i was thinking to simply buy a buss ticket, go to germany and ask for a political asylum.\r\n\r\nnow i will tell you what i have been seeing for the last half a year, a month or two more to be precise. i am sitting on a stairs in font of building and drinking beer alone. i look into the sky. it is cloudy. just above my building there is a shining white light, looks like a ball, like a star, it is really big and it does not flicker. no other stars, only that one. and the whole sky is covered with clouds. i am sitting in front of the river, it is a sunset and fishermen are all around me. i look into the sky and see a regular formation of three stars. they are visible here every night during summer. i look again and see 4. then i look again surprised and there are again only 3. i am sitting and drinking beer on the same staircase and i am looking in the sky. there is one star right above me. i look for the second time there are two. then again, again only one. i start asking myself if i am going crazy. i know that i can see them. regularly in the night sky i see two stars switching on and off, getting brighter than all other stars, switching on and off for just one time. those are no meteors. i see them also gliding without flickering, brighter than all other stars around them, always in twos. again i think if i am getting crazy and again i come to the same answer, i can feel them. i ask them to see them. and i see them. i like them because i know what they present. \r\n\r\nfor the last moth the occurrences went to a completely different level. all what i am now going to tell you happened only in the last moth. that is when those photos were taken. it is middle of a day, i sit isolated in the middle of the city, drink bear and from time to time look into the clouds. i see something long, looks like a hot dog and shiny. it is made of metal. it looks like it has no wings. whenever i see an airplane i can see wings on them. it does not fly too high. it looks like i can see passenger windows and again they look simply something like a regular (i mean every single one of those stripes looked exactly the same and it was at the same distance one from another) tiger stripes. it goes through a cloud. i watch and see no regular swirling turbulences in the cloud made from its wings and engines. i hear no sound. i can only see that it looks like it has some form of energy cover around itself, reaching maybe ten meters or so around its body, and the cloud does not touch its body while passing through it. the cloud does not get dispersed or disturbed in any way. i am baffled. i watched your serpents in the sky, i watched the cigar shaped ufos people shooting while passing through clouds, i watched nasa footages and other. cigar shaped ufos and your serpents are the same. they are polymorphs. they manipulate with shape, light and colors. i call them the long ones or the big ones. the second time i see them it is again sunset. a long object glides through the air. again it has no wings. it is shining too much in white color. it cannot be only due to the sun. it has its own energy. no engines heard again and i see no wings. it turns slowly its hull towards the sky and its rear end turns into a metal dot. funny, airplanes do not fly that way. i see it for the third time in the sky. it looks like an airplane. it is very low and drags behind some strange vapor trail which dissipates in only a couple of seconds. i know that it is not an airplane. again it has no wings. one day i will simply take my camera and go to shoot them. the reason i have not done it yet is that i do not want that people see me sitting alone in a park or on some stairs with a camera in my hands. they may think that i got crazy. that is what scares me, but i will do it anyway.     \r\n\r\nok. one night i saw a full night sky, 3 exactly, of those shiny balls, the rounded as i call them. they fly around. not too much but they visibly fly around. the whole night later there were two international military helicopters flying over a part of the city. i even called my mother that night by my mobile to go to balcony and see something strange in the night sky. she did it. \r\n\r\njust to say that they are regularly in my field of vision. i can feel them.\r\n\r\ni would like now to explain how i shot those photos. just first to mention that i was yesterday looking for vcrs and checking its prices. they are simply too expensive for me. i have nikon d40 and i bought it because i was trying to start a private business. the business was destroyed by the above mentioned idiots, but at least i found out that i like photography from time to time and that i am good at it. the business was www.Turisticki-kompas.Com. please check it. all the work, except programming i did myself. the domain is mine and i have access codes to do administration on that web site. i had to quit that start up because i was constantly threatened.  \r\n\r\nthe first set of photos i got early in the morning. if you download view nx from nikon company from the internet you will see the exact time, date and all other information about those photos. you will also see that the photos were not manipulated. i will save the memory card from my camera as a proof. i woke up all stressed-up after a short sleep. i looked at the balcony and there was some strange and sweet bird on my satellite dish. and then i noticed a metal ball gliding over the hill in a far distance, in front of me behind the dish. the hill is called hum. i have problems with lenses which i have on my camera so you cannot see the whole shape of this object. it was a metallic sphere. there was something strange about the way that the sphere was reflecting sun light. i can not remember exactly what. at that point i was simply too excited. i think that the reflection was on the opposite side from where it should have been. i started laughing and taking photos. for the first time i knew that i was right and that i have a proof that i am not crazy. if you carefully check photos you will see that the being is moving. the east is on the left of those photos. it is going from the west to east. i felt unbelievable joy while taking those photos. this is how they affect me. i knew that they did it for me so that i be sure.  \r\n\r\nafter that i started seeing them regularly on the night sky, but i mean really regularly. once again i started thinking maybe i was insane and i was not even sure about those photos. i mean i knew the truth, but i was not sure. doubts started piling up. last week in afternoon hours, it was a very hot summer day, i looked over my balcony. i did not try to see anything in particular. i just went on the balcony from a habit. i saw a glitter in the distance. i started watching it more carefully. it was an orb, this time black, gliding through the air. i have to mention that they always move at the same speed, always. i started laughing. it was just above the city. i took my camera and started taking photos. i briefly stopped, ran out of my room and called my brother to see it himself. i told to a couple of people here that i can see them. they consider me to be crazy. it took him a bit to come. he does not think that i tell the truth. by the time he came the orb was maybe 60-70 meters away from us, maybe 20-30 meters in air, almost standing still above one restaurant. without camera the orb looked more bright, again problems with my lenses. the reason i did not take more photos was my trying to persuade my brother to come at all. ok. he came and i told him ��������� look for yourself, who is crazy now. he said ��������� where, where. i told him ��������� i am taking right now pictures of them, come on look a bit better, just in front of us. and i looked also and it was gone. i downloaded the photos immediately and showed it to him. he said ��������� aaaaa that. and that was all he said.  \r\n\r\nthat evening i spent thinking about them, all in good mood. about what they really are and everything else. i will explain it you a bit more detailed later. next morning i woke up again very early all hyped up. just to mention that i had sent those photos already to some friends of mine, and they laughed at me. ok, i spent those early morning hours sitting in a park next to my building and thinking that they cannot be nothing else but good, what i felt in them, higher intelligence that came to wake us up. if they wanted to conquer us, like in some bad sf movies, they could do it without any problems. i will later tell you the exact reason. i was happy that morning. i knew that i was completely sane. then i started again thinking about the black orb, maybe i had seen a balloon. if that was a balloon why it did not move in irregular path and heights, carried by the wind. i could see that the orb was flying by its own energy, completely straight, at the same speed as always, just slightly loosing altitude by the changes in elevation of surroundings, going for 2-3 kilometers. it could not be a balloon. if that was a balloon it simply had to have an engine. black color was so that my friend does not be noticed. people could get really scared. if it was a metal ball my friend would be easier to spot. \r\n\r\nthat evening, after finishing my job search on the internet, i went out and sat in front of one building in a block not so far away from mine. i am sitting and i see an older guy walking his dog. it is around 7 in the evening, pure daylight here. i am watching in front of me. there is a big slice of a sky. no clouds. and all of a sudden i see one orb flashing white, but really flashing like a disco light. then i saw second just next to it doing the same. i watch. and then they both start getting wild on the sky. the left one jumping diagonally right towards down, unbelievably fast. the right one jumping diagonally to the left down, high speed. at that point i jump up, start laughing and screaming to them ��������� yeeeeeeeees, you are so crazy. i start recording them with my mobile. i hear people, young guys, from the building next to me also laughing and screaming. they see it also. the balls start swirling one around the other and flying in the sky. at that point i know they are doing it for me. i stop and look into the guy with the dog. his mouth is wide opened and his eyes are stuck to the sky. i look up and they are gone. i sit there for a couple of minutes more. the guy went maybe 20 meters walking with his dog, now he is back, he looks pale and utterly surprised. he is passing by me and all scared again looks into the sky. it is embarrassing for me. just a couple a minutes ago i was screaming there like mad. i get up and go away. they did it for me. i simply wanted them to do something wild in the sky. i did. it was the only way they could communicate with my lower intelligence to confirm their presence. and i really liked it. i checked yesterday my mobile. i have a piece of junk mobile but it seems that it is possible to see them on my recording. you can hear me anyway screaming my guts out. in the next couple of days i will go to check how i can transfer the footage from my mobile on my computer. \r\n\r\njust to tell you something more about what has also been happening to me in the last couple of months. one day i went to balcony to eat. it was killing hot. i sit on the floor. i notice water dripping at me. i know it is from the air conditioner above. i look up. on the sky i see a sphere. it is gliding slowly. it looks like a basketball ball. literally. with black and red stripes. i look again and it is still there gliding through the air. i look again it is gone. \r\n\r\ni go at the balcony and look in the sky. it is mid day, no clouds. in front of me up, in the sky in a distance, i see an orange sphere. i laugh. \r\n\r\ni sit in a park. that whole day i am thinking how much i would love to see them. i am all lonely and stressed-up. they threaten to me again. i am thinking ��������� although they are from the outer space, at least they are my friends. in front of me in the air i see three. for the first i think those are just birds playing in the air. but i notice their metal form. they swirl through the air, appear and disappear. i am not sure what i am seeing.                       \r\n\r\nin the night i sit outside and drink beer, all alone. there had been some people earlier with me, we had had a brief conversation but they went away. i see a yellow orb in the sky. i tell it, speaking not loud but to myself, if those are you my friends just switch off the light. and the light is gone. i am amazed. \r\n\r\njust to say that a year ago, at the very beginning of this all, i got so scared that i had nightmares from this all. \r\n\r\nthey manipulate the light. that is what i know for sure. both, the rounded and the big ones. they present themselves in the colors in which they like, this also includes infra-red and ultra violet spectrum in which we cannot see them. those are no ufos, those are sentient and alive beings. i can feel it. i feel them. i am a bit strange myself. i consider myself to be simply a bit more evolved. everybody can evolve. this is the essence of life if you ask. everybody can become something better than what he or she is. as much as i am concerned there are no gods and life is something completely different.   \r\n\r\ni communicate with them. there is no telepathy involved. when i want to see them they are there. i communicate with them by energy. 5-6 years ago i started thinking about the most perfect way how two beings can communicate with each other. i came to the conclusion that it would be by simply completely understanding each other without speaking any words. that would be a complete fusion of emotion, thought and intellect. communication by the all-encompassing energy. it happened to you, to me and to everybody many times during our lives. it is that instance when you look your friend, your wife, your boss ��������� just look each other and both know without speaking what is on each other���������s mind. that type of communication ��������� simple understanding. this is just an intellectual concept ��������� i have to say.       \r\n\r\nother things that happened to me in the last couple of months. i go to a shop to buy something for my mother. i count the money in front of the shop. i know what i am counting. this is not what my mother gave to me. there is a little bit more money. just a bit. i count it several times. i pay in the shop and have only so much what my mother gave to me. i think strange but my mistake. in a couple of days the same thing. i wander if am crazy. maybe it is about the heat. what if they can manipulate with matter. that must be it. and then it all stops. after that i always have exact amount as i counted before. \r\n\r\ntwo months ago my computer is all screwed up. one night i leave it on stand by. updates are blocking my machine, they cannot properly install. the computer attempted to install them that week for the 20 times in a row. the last time it happened to me the whole system went down since the hard disc got plugged up, and i had to take it to a shop to fix it. i had to pay for it. i have problems with sleeping that week and i am thinking if i wake up in the middle of the night i will try fix it myself, if i can at all. at 3 in the morning the computer turns on by itself. i have external modem which is at that time switched off. it had nothing to do with the internet. it turns on and the system massage basically says that the updates were successfully installed. which computer can fix itself?\r\n\r\ni have a bank account. that is a left over from my last job. on that account there are basically only 3 bosnian marks. it is a euro and half. last moth i received information from the bank that on my account i have a bit more than 90 euros. i was planning to escape if necessary to germany. i wanted to save that money. that is exactly how much i needed for my trip. nobody knew. but to save it, it was more or less impossible for me. i am all hyped up. finally i have something from my life. some sort of solution if the things here go that far. but how can i have that money at all. i know that there is nobody generous in the place where i live that will simply help me in that way. most of them would like simply to drink my blood and the others do not care. next morning i go to the bank and ask a teller who made a deposit on my behalf. the teller is killing herself trying to find the data in the system. at the end she tells me that the whole system was changed in april and that she does not know what happened with the data. i am pretty sure what happened. this is hypo alpe adria bank, german bank, there is not a chance that they can just like that loose track of their records. you know how the germans are. i take the money and bring it home. i tell my mother that i saved it. i lie. i feel for the first time in a half a year like a human being. \r\n\r\ni think that they can manipulate with matter. i do not even care how this sounds. you know about the bible stories. if you check old pictures, on many of them you can see stars gliding through air. a couple of days ago a friend of mine asks me on one web site what i think of them. he says that he thinks that those are the beings who were earlier considered to be angels. i tell him he has an interesting point of view. he also saw them. i will tell you what i honestly think of them. there are no gods and no prophets. moses, jesus, muhammad ��������� they are all product of extraterrestrial intelligence and matter manipulation. which god would kill and burn so many persons just because they worshiped golden cow? it happened after moses came from that hill with those commandments. which god would allow muhammad to wage wars just because some people did not want to believe in islam? i think that jesus was directly influenced by those beings that i am telling you about. all other were influenced by some other form of extraterrestrial intelligence, which used them for its own benefit. jesus was the only one who, from all of those prophets, was good. then came muhammad and in koran it was simply written that there will be no more prophets after him. and he was also a conqueror and killer for the name of some distant faith. and his followers continued doing it so after him. no higher and good intelligence would allow it. i think that there are several types of those beings and all of them are not good. the big ones and the rounded are good, they are our friends. i consider them to be my friends. i think that in the coming months they are going to protect us. i think that the cataclysm is coming on us. i also think that they have bigger powers than that they show. they are honestly anyway funny to me with way they behave. they sometimes seem to me to be a bit confused themselves.    \r\n\r\ni used to go to mosque before. not too much but from time to time. i believed in god. the moment when i stopped believing was when i started thinking a bit deeper about that all. the koran is the book which has never been overwritten, not a single paragraph from it has been changed through centuries. it was forbidden and the very book says that the one who does is doomed to the eternal damnation in hell. that book is taken as the ultimate truth, absolutely no doubts about it. and i have found the proof that the whole book is wrong. in the very same book it says that every living human being will one time in his or her life have one wholly book in his or her hands and it will be up to him or her if he or she will believe or not. wrong. books about which koran speaks are the two bibles and the koran itself. they are all included as the sacred books in muslim religion. if you look african and some other world tribes who live totally cut from modern civilization, live as they have lived for millenniums, those tribes have never seen any of those books. what are than people from those tribes ��������� just plain animals? what about china, japan, buddhism, shinto religion? what about many more? what about them? is this perfect god than simply going to destine them all to the eternal damnation? i think that at least half of those people have never had any of those books in their hands nor they have heard the word. they know nothing about our abrahamistic way of reasoning the life. that is why i simply stopped believing. buddhism i really like. it includes no believing ��������� just personal thinking. i now simply do not believe into anything. i think that this life is not the end. if this life was the only one life before the eternal heaven or hell than the whole universe and the whole creation would be just one empty misfit. you go to church after raping 10 and killing 20, you confess and god forgives you. you do the same thing and simply start going to mosque 5 times a day, become a real muslim and god forgives you. that kind of a god would be just a stupid sadist. lower intelligence. what if some of those persons that you killed were also supposed to get really religious, but you did not give them time to better themselves and so they just simply were thrown in to the eternal hell? ridiculous. how just a human being can me resolve me from my sins after hurting so many people?  \r\n\r\ni can see them when i want, more or less, the rounded. they are no dogs but my friends. they communicate with me in this way which i can understand. a couple of nights ago i again amazed persons sitting around me. there were two super bright lights on the sky. i wanted to see them. i was again all stressed up and threatened. people were again watching it all surprised. i was again laughing. i knew what it was. i know also that i am different from the others. not too much anyway.     \r\n\r\ni will tell you also about number two and amicable numbers. while studying at my university i had to pass mathematics. we had a professor who waned to be paid 1000 euros by students just to pass his exam. he did it openly. his assistant would simply tell us to quit the school and that is it. his exams were set in the way that not even professors of mathematics could pass them. i know personally couple of professors and they told me that even they in such short time could not get a passing mark which such difficult equations. it made me mad. i am really good with mathematics and enjoy solving complicated mat. problems. i started learning mathematics. i basically wanted just from the spite to learn the whole business mathematics and to pass without paying. our assistant used to give us very difficult homework. i loosed every single one of those tasks and he even laughed at me once when i solved something that nobody had managed to do before. i made a report against that ass, the professor, in the police. nobody had guts to do it before me. and police did nothing. while learning mathematics constantly for 2 years i started liking number 2. i am an introvert person and i basically needed at that time a girl to be in par with me. still do, nothing extraordinary. i said to a couple of guys in my city that my favorite number is number 2 and that i only like amicables. they laughed. those above mentioned idiots and bullies from my city later used even that to harass me, but really to harass me. like i am crazy for such a small thing. and those numbers to me are in fact just numbers. that is how i see all types of numbers. but i still love number 2. you can connect this to the rest of this story and made your own conclusions, but i see the rounded in the night sky mostly in pairs. they communicate with me as they can. we, human beings, we are not very developed.             \r\n\r\ni will tell you now what i think about those beings, what i feel. first of all they are our friends. they are my friends definitely. what if they really can fix my computer, that one instance that i mentioned was not the only time that my computer was acting strange. especially in the last month. what if the really manipulate with matter. it means that they can conquer us with no problems. they can just switch off all our military installations and that would be it. they can switch off our industry, our communications. \r\n\r\nthey are higher intelligence and i can feel goodness and great knowledge in them. i can. they float in the vacuum feeding on 0 point energy. they are above us because the life they can feel beneath pleases them and they feel comfortable. from where they have come and how long they have been here i do not know  \r\n\r\nyou know about the story from seti. its members said that those three ufos will be visible by optical telescopes when they reach the orbit of mars in september. you know the stories that the spheres of pure light make crop circles and that one of those circles had an imprinted binary code which was later deciphered in pure ascii code. it says that we do not believe to their gifts and false promises and that there is good out there. with the picture of that being that looks like gray next to it. when i here earlier said that the cataclysm is coming i meant on those ufos which are approaching us. the long ones and the rounded are good. i read on youtube that that was not the only message in the crop circles that was deciphered. there was a second which basically says that the beings that i see are here to protect us. maybe i am wrong ��������� we will see. about my friends i can not be wrong. \r\n\r\none more thing ��������� every single time when i was earlier seeing these rounded lights in the sky i simply knew that those were the rounded. i did. only later i saw a couple of footages on youtube about these spheres of light. i am not lying. i basically knew even before i had seen those footages how they look. i have a strong analytical mind. why did not i think that those were maybe some other forms of ufos or just plain satellites. some of those lights were definitely satellites but not the ones that i felt.   \r\n\r\nat the end all i have to say is that i do not even care if you believe me or not. i think that the great period of changes is in front of us ��������� i mean really, really near. \r\n\r\nmaybe even you can see them, the rounded and the big ones. i can not be the only one in this whole world who does.  \r\n\r\nany feedback from your side is more than welcomed. even if you do not believe the single word i said it is not a problem for me. i had to tell this to somebody. i could not keep it longer in me. there is not a single person in this city that i can talk to about this. they would simply say that i am crazy. i think that on this way i also influence our global consciousness in every single aspect. i have to. they want me to do it and it simply has to be done. we, humans, simply have to finally wake up from our ignorance. you, people who seriously approach to this topic, you also influence our global consciousness. we all have to wake up. i know that you are very educated person and a high achiever. otherwise i would not tell this part of my life to you at all. \r\n\r\ni kept the original memory card from my camera so that i can prove that those photos are no fakes. analyze them and you will see that they are real.  \r\n\r\nif we ever start fighting against the ones who are coming i will be the first charging. and maybe i am simply wrong about those ones who are right now visible by the radio telescopes, what i do not think so. maybe they just simply go away. \r\n\r\nwish you all the best in your career and life.\r\n\r\nhope getting some answer from you. \r\n\r\n\r\nsincerely \r\n\r\nsenna \r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

what that thing is, but if you have some idea, i would like the information.   thanks!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,

formation of lights.  my husband was the first to see it and it interrupted his talking when he looked at it and said \"that looks like a really weird plane\".   i looked at it and it appeared to have 4 or 5 very bright lights in a straight row and we couldn't hear anything.  it seemed to be headed directly for us and i stood up and walked out of the cabana to get a more unobstructed view.  when i walked out it was coming much closer, then slowed down in speed, passed right over me and then banked off to it's right, my left and that is when i saw the bottom of it.  and realized that there was no way it was a plane because it was circular in shape and the lights were much brighter than i've ever seen on a plane in addition to how low it was flying which appeared to be only 100 feet or less.  as it got closer to me i started hearing a hum with some vibration but no engine, propellers or the chopping sound a helicopter makes.  since we live fairly close to an airport and used to live near a military airbase we are pretty familiar with what personal, commercial and military crafts look like, even at night and this was nothing we've ever seen before.   as i saw the bottom of the craft i felt excited because i was pretty certain what i had seen.  it was too late for me to call my contact who is a pilot and was in the military for decades.  when i talked to him this evening and described the event he explained to me that even if it were a plane the light formation, number of lights and altitude were all against faa regulations and wouldn't have been allowed.  so to clarify, the lights went all the way around the edge in almost an octagonal or circular pattern and then a cross of 9 lights with one in the center and then two going each direction (up, down, right and left respectively).  i turned to my husband as it was passing over me and said that is not a plane and he looked shocked and confused. but afterwards when it went away and we were both just sort of stunned, i guess i could only say that we accepted it and then went on with our night since this isn't our first sighting.   unfortunately, neither of us had our cell phones or a camera outside with us and it happened so fast we wouldn't have had time to get them and turn them on, etc. anyway but i've included a picture (i'm not an artist but it's a fair representation) of what i remember seeing which is pretty clear in my memory because it was so exciting and so different than anything i've ever seen before.","distance":"21-100

usually see, and was moving. i felt kind of excited about it thinking that i was seeing a meteor at first, but as i watched it i realized that it wasn't like the meteors we were watching last night during the meteor shower.  it maintained a steady light for the distance over one of the town-homes, then began to blink steadily as it kept moving from our left to right (southwest to northeast) it continued blinking until it went out of sight over the tree line. i don't have a video camera and didn't want to hunt for my phone, but now i really wish that i had since i only just found this
