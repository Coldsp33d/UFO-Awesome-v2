is a report about something i could not identify in the sky.  all times are in local edt.\r\n\r\ni have been increasingly interested in this epidemic as of late.  i have also been sending out thoughts and hopes of contact more and more, as i have been moving more towards love.  last night (26jul11), just before midnight i was with 2 friends, at buttonville airport in markham. one of my friends noticed a satellite moving west though the big dipper, and tried to point it out, saying that as she did, she lost it.  i noted that i had never seen a satellite in that much light pollution, and she agreed it was very rare and difficult.  i thought i saw a flash for a moment as i was looking for it, but dismissed it. \r\n\r\nabout 1/2 hour later i was in the office doing paperwork (working overnight ground crew for buttonville airport), and took a moment to send out some positive vibes, and hope.  as i did, i noticed that there was a plane taxiing in, and my co-worker (friend #2 from before) was working on the ramp.  i considered that if my \"call\" had been \"heard\", witnesses would decrease probability of any possible response, and the thought came to me, that the cessna might, but my somewhat like-minded colleague and friend might not, as much.\r\n\r\nat just after 0200, now 27jul11, we put the movie, falling down, on and watched it to completion (it was a slow night). afterwards we went out for a cigarette at 0440.  we were just finishing our smokes, when my friend asked if the bright star in the east, near the moon was venus, i shared how someone had actually told me it was jupiter, during last year's august meteor shower, when i saw a shooting star go just above that \"star\", from south to north.  i verbalized my experience, as my friend said \"what's that?\"  i started about the shooting star, and he said, \"no that's not a shooting star, it's blinking!  look!\".  he was looking at another spot, further south, by maybe 2 feet at arms length in the night sky.  i looked and saw a blinking, clear white light.  we immediately thought it was no airplane as we are used to looking into the night sky for inbound aircraft, and the time between flashes was maybe triple what we would expect from any aircraft, and the blink lasted too long, fading in and out, too slowly as well (maybe 3 seconds between flashes lasting 1/4-1/2 second each).  it was moving in a southerly direction, sort of up and to the right away from \"the bright star\" in the east.  i looked back to the bright star describing my shooting star effect, and he said he saw that it was a bug, moving in the airport beacon.  as this exchange took place, the flashing stopped.  \r\n\r\nwe went to perform some of our duties, to prepare for morning, and i thought to the cosmos that i would try again, when i am in new brunswick, soon, and hoped what i might have seen, would appear again.  as i was fueling a plane, a few minutes later, which was from 0404-0422, 3/4 done, or so, i stopped for one last look into the sky.  i was facing east again.  i looked at the bright star, and then was drawn to another one to the right.  when i looked what i seem to remember is a light that was slightly taller than it was wide (1:2), about 1cm long at arms length, which extinguished in about 1/8 of a second, immediately as i looked towards it from the outside in (top/bottom to center), as if moving very rapidly, directly away from me, as i personally analyse, now.  this was comparable to watching a light bulb filament swith off.  perhaps an optical illusion after being fixed on the other star, but didn't \"feel\" like it, and i couldn't \"see\" it when i closed my eyes.  i chuckled and said, out loud, \"now you're just [playing] with me\".  i have been in a state of excited joy ever since.\r\n\r\ni met back up with my friend, and asked him what he thought that first light was, not sharing the second, so we analysed.  in addition to the blink pattern, he, who watched it longer than i, said that it seemed to move faster with the light off, than on, as we could see aircraft like movement in the light, but it seemed to move too far for that speed, before blinking again.  we think that may be an illusion based on the pattern itself (our eyes are trained to look for the next flash of an aircraft at a certain relative point).  we ruled out civil aircraft, as it stopped blinking, essentially disappearing on such a clear night.  i asked him about what shape he saw, or multiples, and he remembered a typical flashing bulb as did i, but something told me it was more of a hollow circle.  we thought of military aircraft, but the light seemed to be very bright, and clear, suggesting it would be close, and any military aircraft we know of, we presumed we would hear, at the distance that that would suggest (maybe 20000 feet at 20 miles?  we heard nothing).  we looked up the location of the space station, and noticed it might have been in the vicinity, but was moving in the wrong trajectory (what i found online, might have just been the nearest satellite at the time, com to think of it).  we also noted that we wouldn't expect flashing lights, like those, from that, or any other kind of satellite.  we tried to think of other explanations, but came up empty.\r\n\r\nthis is going to bother me.  if nothing else, i hope someone can convince me of what it was i saw.  \"normal\", or not.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path then

k-mart about 7:20 p.M.  i usually take my time leaving the house, making certain i have everything i need because i live quite far out in the country.  in hindsight, on that particular night i left the house very quickly - almost bolting out of the house; and i have no idea why i did that because i was only returning a pair of underwear to the store.  if i had left 20 seconds later i would have missed what i was about to see.  i was in my pickup truck, pulled out of the driveway heading west.  in the western horizon i saw a very bright yellow light appeared; then two and three and so on until there were eight. my first quick  thought was that they were landing lights from a plane until i started seeing more and realized how big these lights were.  i immediately pulled off to the side of the road, turned off my radio, and stuck my head out the window. there were large orbs about the color of the moon.  at first count there were seven; but after recounting i���m positive there were eight orbs.  as fast as i counted the eight orbs, they had traveled across the sky in 20-30 seconds until they disappeared.  the eight orbs took up almost ��� of the entire sky as they traveled.  they were in-line and did not change their positions but weren���t spaced evenly apart.  there were 2 - then a gap, then 3 - then a gap then 2 - another gap, then 1. the last orb was a little higher than all the others. as they passed over the field, they were approx. 300 yards away and 300-500 ft in altitude.\r\n\r\nmy first solid impression was that this was a controlled flight and not anything man-made.  there was no propulsion sound or sonic boom which i thought there would have been for something traveling as fast as they did.  immediately after they disappeared from sight i turned my truck around and followed where i thought they may have crashed; expecting to see a police road block or flames.  after seeing nothing for a few miles, i decided to go to my friends��� house to tell them what had just happened.  when i arrived jim and laura were reading.  they knew something was wrong as soon as they saw me.  i told them what happened and talked jim into coming with me to investigate where these orbs may have gone.  we went back to my house where i had first seen them in the sky - then drove east about 5 miles and didn���t see any sign of a crash.  i took jim back to his house and talked for awhile; then proceeded to k-mart.  i felt as though the cashier must have known something was wrong because i must have been very wide-eyed after seeing such an unusual thing.  when i returned home i called channel 4 news to ask if anyone else had reported anything strange in the sky.  the answer was no.  i went on-line and reported it on the ufo alert website.  while searching that website i found an astronomy student at the university of toronto.  i contacted him through his e-mail and he told me he had seen 7 orbs at the same time and place in the sky - he described them just as i had seen them.  we wrote back and forth a few times but then lost touch.  i no longer know how to contact him.  the next night i went bowling with my friend ken.  when i told him this story his jaw dropped because ken told me that earlier that day one of his employees sat him down and told him the exact same story i just told him. this employee lived in akron, n.Y.   the only difference was that his employee only saw 3-4 orbs.  ken gave me his employee���s phone number and we talked on the phone a few times.  i no longer have his correct phone number but will contact ken and ask him to try and get in touch with this man to see if he would be willing to talk to mufon field investigators about his sighting.\r\nthis was all i thought about for weeks afterwards; and since that time i have read numerous books on ufo���s and related topics.  i keep an extensive dream journal; and have had lucid dreams in the past.  on march 22, 1997 i had two out-of-body experiences.  i don���t know where i went but it was extraordinary and amazing.  i haven���t been able to repeat them since that time.

started getting a creepy feeling about being in the ocean with sharks and stuff at night and was trying to figure out if they would be more active at night. after a lot of deliberation i decided to get out and go sit with the other people i went to the beach with. i was with my sister rachel, her friend kenley, and someone that was a friend of a friend named jess who lived an hour from this spot. all of us saw this. after i sat down with them, my sister started freaking out because a huge roach was running all over her legs. we were all laughing at here and i looked out over the ocean as we had been doing prior to that and noticed what at first appeared to be a lantern. it was a distant bright orange light that was pretty far off in the distance over the ocean. i thought it was some boat that was coming up closer to shore because a storm had just went through. i said out loud to everyone else, \"what the hell is that?\" and everyone just sat there staring at it. it slowly moved across the ocean and lined up straight with us which would have made this thing if floating on the ocean go against the current. it wasn't bobbing so it would had to have been a massive boat. but someone said something about how bright it was and almost as if on cue it seemed to get brighter. it started getting bigger and by the end of this part of the sighting it almost looked like the moon fell and started floating on the ocean. it was crescent shaped and had another piece right above it and looked like something was in front of it but it was fairly bright outside for it to be as late as it was and i didn't see anything near this thing. i attempted to take a picture of it but this thing wasn't picking up on my camera. it sat in front of us for quite some time before it started to lift in the air very slowly. when it lifted (about an inch from my perspective) off the water line it started shrinking rapidly and ended up the size of a star that you would normally see on a clear night. then in the blink of an eye it shot up into the sky. by the end of all this i was so overwhelmed that my eyes started watering and i couldn't say anything but, \"what the hell was that!\". all the ladies i was with started screaming and were as excited as me.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":30363,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.2183747,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08042011-0069","longitude":-81.0149331,"occurred":1311588000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

in the sky over the building, to our west. we watched it for a minute as we walked to our car. the kids got into the car and i stood watching this object advance towards us, going due east, at a steady speed. the object came into view as a metallic elongated shape, like a stick or a cigar or a rectangle. it was slender. it continued coming directly over us. size would be approximate, as i extend my arm fully, with my thumb and forefinger separated about 3/8th inch. i kept thinking it would blink like an airplane or would have some identifiable markings but i couldn't make them out like a regular aircraft. we see quite a few aircraft from milwaukee and chicago and minneapolis so we're familiar with the flight patterns. this object seemed to sail across the sky, at times glinting in the setting sun, and then we watched it disappear into the east-southeast towards lake michigan. \r\n\r\nabout halfway through the sighting, directly above us, i was able to discern what looked like two wings out either side, like a double-wing or bi-plane aircraft. but this was bigger than any double-wing aircraft i had ever seen, and higher in sky than they would normally fly. this was confirmed by my 7-year-old son who also saw the craft. i asked him to draw what he saw and he showed a cross-type object, and then said, \"but there was another part on top of it that i didn't know how to draw, like another wing.\" i thought, aha! yes, he saw that too.\r\n\r\nmy two daughters had similar experience. the 9-year-old saw it as a whitish-yellowish rectangular-type object, or rather two ends to the object, with a space in the center. one object held together by something in the center. my 16-year-old saw a rectangular object, two objects flying front to back, with a space in the center where the wings would be if it were an aircraft (only she didn't see wings), and she said both sections were lit up like incandenscent lights (yellowish). my 7-year-old son and i both saw this cross-type object, rectangular, with the two pieces, but we could see faint \"wings\" on it, like a bi-wing plane. it would be a safe guess to say the object was segmented.\r\n\r\nothers who came out of the building at the same time were also looking at this object as it moved. i made my kids get back out of the car to witness this object. at that point, a very large commercial-type jet (i'm conjecturing here since i'm not an expert in aircraft) appeared just to our southeast. the object continued to sail along in the sky and this jet seemed to bank away from it, to the southeast, like they were pretty close together in the sky. the object appeared to be above the jet but it seemed very close, like the jet was avoiding the larger, slender object. another mother said, \"that's too close for my comfort,\" or something to that effect. that's when i realized there were others watching the object. the jet appeared as if out of nowhere and i was surprised it was so close to the ground, much closer than they usually get. but we have a fly-in locally this week so there may be a good explanation for why it was so close.\r\n\r\nwe continued watching the long object as it continued east, heading a bit southeast as it went. the jet had suddenly appeared and afterwards, nobody remembers seeing the jet leave the area, just that it appeared almost overhead, making noise, and then it was gone. my 9-year-old daughter said she heard the original object making a humming noise but i don't have the best hearing so i can't discount that. it was pretty high up there. \r\n\r\nwe lost sight of the object about 8:13 pm cdt as it continued its steady path east-southeast. there appeared to be a small contrail in the area where we last saw the object.\r\n\r\ni was initially not surprised to see an odd object in the sky due to the eaa (experimental aircraft association) fly-in at oshkosh this week, approximately 25 miles northeast from our location. i thought it was a glider but realized it was too high up to be a glider. then i thought it could be a satellite, but it was close enough to see: every satellite i've ever seen has been a bright dot in the sky at night but not during the day or even the brighter evening light. the cross-shape was interesting but the cross-wings were pretty hard to see and they didn't seem to be there the entire time, if that makes sense. it definitely was no plane. and the jet that showed up all of a sudden and then nobody remembered watching it fly away is troubling too. the long, slender object was not heading in the direction of the fly-in. \r\n\r\nthis is a true and accurate account that my 3 children and i saw this evening. in addition, at least three others in the parking lot with us witnessed this object.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings,  Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

the stars. just after sunset i was killing time by looking for familiar constellations and stars - i was lucky enough to see a satellite in a south to north orbit.  the north star was clearly visible and the big dipper was setting while cassiopeia was rising.  my wife and i had set out some lawn chairs to watch stars before going to bed.  the temperature was cool enough wear a light jacket.  about 10pm we were located in an area of trees that did limit our view somewhat but the view to the north was open so we placed our chairs in that direction.  after talking about the possibility of ufos for a while we were greeted by a flying star.  a few minutes later we both saw something very unusual.  four faint objects moving in a straight line appeared.  we both agreed that there was four faint objects - very much like faint stars flying in formation from east to west.  the formation was a line where three were exactly spaced while the forth was some distance away as if it was the fifth and the forth not visible (*space*space*spacespace*).  the formation appeared as i was scanning the sky - that is to say i did not see it move from the east but my eyes just noticed the movement about due north as i was scanning.  my wife saw the same objects at the same time - we both watched them move from east to west for several seconds - we lost sight of the objects the same way we found them.  the speed of the objects was much faster than the satellite i saw earlier in the evening - maybe three or four time as fast.  the speed and direction was very deliberate, consistent and did not waiver.  i did not notice any deviation of the background star field as the objects flew thought the night sky.  i heard no sonic booms or any other sound that could be attributed to the objects.  i could not calculate the size of any object nor if they were connected.  but, i can say, they fly formation  better than anything else i have ever seen!  they were headed somewhere for reason.  that night i expected dreams of ufos and aliens but i did no have any.  i felt no concern about the objects at any time.  i have a degree in astronomy and a former military pilot with extensive night experience.  i would have dismissed this occurrence as 'day dreaming' if i was the only one to see the objects.  but, my wife saw the exact same objects at the exact same time.  the objects that my wife and i saw have no corresponding relevance to anything we have ever seen - either man, bird or beast.

came a plane from the north, and i was just waiting to see what was going to happend, the plane seem to fly under the first object and nothing happend the plane didn't make any funny moves it just keep on it's course, and the 2 objects didn't change color or become dimmer or brighter and keep moving north west, i would have to say towards turlock ca. i could hear the plane it was very loud and the 2 objects i couldn't hear anything. the plane had all it's lights on blinking but the 2 objects didn't have any blinking lights and again looked like rice, white. i was pretty sure i had just seen 2 ufo's and with the time of the plane going under the first object 10:38, maybe you could find out if they saw the 2 objects. the plane didn't go under the second object, and just kept on it's

the white orbs. the black ones were obvious. one of the pics came out dark, but i lightened it up as it was a pic of one of the osprey planes coming over and i really saw a lot of white orbs in the

in the sky. i like to check the stars and see how many i can see so i always look up. i got about half way down the drive i saw a bright red light. it was not flashing but moving in the exact direction i was walking above me. i did not hear anyting and the in the direction it was moving it was going rather quickly.\r\n\r\n it did not appear to be an airplane, but could of been,  and as it moved , from north to south, i lost view of it through some trees. normal navigation lights on most aircraft can be seen as blinking. some blue and some red or both. this red light was seemingly the entire craft and it was very bright red.With smaller aircraft you can hear them and with larger ones , the sound seems to follow shortly after you see them as they are so high up that it takes time for the sound to catch up.There was no sound with this. this is what prompted me to make this post.It was super quiet and fast.\r\n\r\nprior to going out to my car i was inside watching a film. not doing anything else. i went to retrieve a bag of chips . i have seen strange things before and have even made a post here before. as it turned out the post i made prior , others had seen a similar object in the state to the north and south of me. both had similar discriptions of what i also saw. i do see the importance of making such posts as it can validate others possible sightings as well.
