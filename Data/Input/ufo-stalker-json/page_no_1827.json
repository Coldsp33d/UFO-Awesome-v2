the speed of this vehicle defied aerodynamic law for a vehicle that would have been under conventional propulsion means as we know them to be, with regard to aircraft such as fixed wing prop, or jets. it moved so damned slow. how can it be there?! the time of length of my sighting was roughly 5-7 minutes, before disappearing beyond mountains that obscured further observation.\r\n i can estimate the altitude of flight because it was higher than the cirrus clouds. enough light was present from the still fading sun to observe cloud cover and the black coloration of the craft, and was coming back into view from behind (or above) clouds at times that were in the sky. the clouds were sparse and not very many were present.\r\n i think you will love to know, that 2 others were able to observe this ufo with me. my mother and father. when i initially saw this thing, i ran into the house and alerted my parents to the presence of this craft. they followed me to the balcony and stood in utter shock as we observed it together. my mother noticed something that gave her a point of reference to the scale of this thing. she pointed out that a passenger aircraft was flying literally under it! we all watched it pass under the triangle because the jet was visible with the triangle behind or above it in the background. this was possibly a 747 jet aircraft (we saw the jet had 4 wing mounted engines). it was massive. \"holy cow!...That jet could land on it mom!\", i exclaimed. the size of the jet was like that of a tic-tac in the sky, the v shaped craft was bigger than her fist when she held her hand in front of her and tried to cover it.\r\n my father later made the comment, \"i was on a big ship in the navy. that thing was bigger than an aircraft carrier, and it was in the damned sky\"! seeing this thing has changed us. we now know that there are things in this world that are not of this world. i seriously question that this vehicle was of our own design. whether it be that of extra-terrestrials would be in itself a miracle! our family is mormon. we have not been negatively affected in our belief in christ and our heavenly father by this event. it actually strengthens our faith if anything, that god in his infinite wisdom, saw fit to create other worlds and give life to them among the stars.

reconnaissance unit.  one of my duties in the military was to observe and be able to identify aircraft from many countries, primarily those from the united states and the former soviet union.  i am also a huge fan of helicopter aviation.\r\n\ti was working patrol on the night of 7/16/11 on the 2230 ��� 0630 shift.  i was in uniform and in a marked patrol car.  while patrolling on a main street in town, i was driving southeast away from the lake and toward the downtown area.  at approximately 2352 hrs., i noticed a single, white light in the sky moving northwest.  the light appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 1,000-2,000 feet over the downtown area.  i first thought the object was a helicopter.  just up the street from me was a large hospital which averages probably 4-5 medical helicopter transports a week.  i am very familiar with the medical helicopters which frequent my area, and after a few seconds i realized that what i was seeing was not a helicopter.  \r\n\tas the light came toward me, i realized that it had no navigational or hazard lights (the green and red lights which flash on an aircraft).  it had a single, white light.  it was very bright at first.  as it got closer to being directly overhead, i noticed that the light appeared to be cigar shaped.  but as it got even closer to being overhead, the light seemed to dim.  by the time it was overhead (approximately one minute since i first saw it), it was as dim as most of the stars in the sky.  in fact, if it hadn't been moving, i probably would have thought that it was a star.\r\n\ti actually stopped my patrol car in the middle of the street and had to stick my head out of my driver's side window to look up at the object because it was directly overhead.  the object continued to move northwest, but it was dim and appeared to be much higher than when i first saw it.  in fact, it appeared then that it was 10,000 feet or higher.  \r\n\tthen i was amazed when the object stopped dead in it's tracks and began to zig and zag, back and forth!  it went in all directions.  i would estimate that if it was 10,000 high it was probably moving maybe 200 feet in each direction around the point where it had stopped.\r\n\tit became difficult for me to watch the object with my head sticking out the car window and looking over the roof of the car to my west, so i made a u-turn and parked along the curb.  i could now see the object by looking out of my window toward the west.  shortly after i parked, i phoned my wife to tell her what i was seeing.  my cell phone indicated that i called my wife at 2353 hrs. on 7/16/11.\r\n\tjust after i started talking to my wife, the object stopped zigging and zagging and it began to move toward the east.  just then, another police unit with two officers pulled up and asked what i was doing.  i ended the phone call with my wife and i informed the officers about the object that i was watching.  we then exited our respective vehicles while we watched the object.  both officers saw what i was seeing.  one of them believed it to be an aircraft.  the other officer said she wasn't sure what it was.\r\n\tas we watched the object continue east, we noticed an aircraft far out in front of it, also flying east.  the object and the aircraft appeared to be around the same altitude, but the object had become so dim that it was hard to determine how high it was.  in fact, several times the object's light appeared to fade out completely and then quickly fade back in.  however, at no time did the light of the object appear to flash or blink.\r\n\tall three of us watched the object move east and, once again, it stopped in mid flight and began to zig and zag around the point it stopped.  the one officer continued to believe that the object was an aircraft, and the other officer said she didn't know what it was.  then the other officers had to move their vehicle because they had stopped in the travel lane and they were blocking traffic.  i got back into my vehicle and drove east and parked in a parking lot one block east of my original location where i continued to watch the object.  it continued east and its light faded in and out a few more times.  i lost track of where the aircraft, which i had seen in front of it, had flown.  then i received a call for service from my dispatcher and i had to leave the area.  the total time i watched the object was approximately 15 minutes.\r\n\tlater that night i looked to the sky in the direction i last saw the object but i didn't see it again.  through the course of the night i did see two meteorites, one to the north of town over the lake and one to the south.  however, i am familiar with what meteorites look like and the object i watched was not a meteorite.\r\n\tlater in my shift i tried to call the local international airport to see if they had any aircraft or any other contacts on radar at that time.  but i only got an automated system and was never able to get through to anyone there.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path

we had just watched some small fireworks from people about 100 yards up the beach and remained lying on our blanket to look at the stars. it was a clear night. we were facing the ocean and stayed there gazing and talking about the stars and the beach. a few people passed by walking but eventually we were alone in our area. after about 30 minutes (now close to 9:00 pm) i decided it was time to return to the beach house. my son sat up first and when he turned around he exclaimed immediately about what he saw in the sky behind and to the left of us. i sat up, turned and gasped because it was a large orange glowing orb (far larger than any aircraft)which appeared to be moving toward us but was actually moving away (north) from us. it was over land not ocean and we watched it move slowly and smoothly across the sky for close to 2 minutes then disappear into isolated cloud cover or maybe the haze of myrtle beach lighted sky. my son was a little worried but i remained calm and explained what \"ufo\" and \"unidentified\" actually meant. about another minute later i turned around and it was there again but directly behind us. we both saw it. it was clearly visible and seemingly a brightly glowing gaseous or firery orange orb with red outer tinge (with outstretched arms if you encircled it with hands-about the size of a grapefruit or large apple). my little boy said \"it looks like fire and gas\". it was unlike anything i'd ever seen in the sky before. this time i was uneasy because it was quite ominous and eerie so when my little boy said \"i think we should get out of here...Mom,lets go\" i stood up grabbed our blanket without shaking it off and we left, still watching it as we walked up and over the boardwalk. on the golf cart ride back to the beach house i said that no one was going to believe us. we returned to the beach house and told all of the family about it. my son described it the same as i would have as \"orange and round and on top what looked like a red cap\". it was a little hard falling asleep just thinking about it.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

with an illumines bottom side come in from the left slowly parking itself about few hundred yards south of the santa monica pier and about at the end of the pier out in the water. about a 1/4 mile away. we have routine noisy police helicopters but after about 3 minutes of silence with it flickering these colorful soft lights i decided i needed to capture what clearly was a disc shaped ufo on my nikon d90 slr 12.3mp camera. it did change shape and look roundish and phase out a few times in this encounter. the lights were not like police warning lights. almost like the skin of the craft was shimmering these soft lights in different places. i had a better zoom lens but i wanted to get it captured as fast as possible and the sigma 50mm lens was on it so i went with that. took a few shots and looked and camera was on daytime settings. just mostly black so i adjusted but went too far opening f-stop. readjusted again constantly looking up to see if it was gone. it wasn't to my amazement. this is a large tourist area and it was just parked there. i took a few shots and liked what i saw and snapped a few more then had to go for video. 8 pictures came out well. the nikon d90 has 24p so i recorded about 30 seconds of very interesting footage that needs to be analyzed in a computer or avid bay. not too much ufo footage is shot in this high-res format. it shows the craft flickering its lights and phases in and out of the air. i needed my glasses to see the back led which you use on the nikon for video only but the reading glasses weren't near so i thought i lost the space craft so i stopped the recording (kicking myself) but after i'd saved the file which i did in a nervous i know i have something manner. i looked up to start to capture more but didn't have time. was in awe as it float up like a fast balloon over the santa monica mountains and up to a extremely high altitude til it was gone.\r\n\r\n the same craft can be seen in a later video on youtube. search \"ufo sighting in santa monica\". youtube user bluntrolledtight. \r\n also search \"santa monica silver surfer ufo on nbc la\" to see the same ufo parked in the same position many months later. \r\n\r\ndoubt our military is dumb enough to do that. looks like either they want contact or they like the giant ferris wheel at the end of the pier that emits a similar light pattern. i kept this not telling a soul. no need to. i knew what was it was and was blessed to have a very close look at an extraterrestrial space vehicle. i have recently decided to share the experience with others who care to know more or are looking for an answer. the rest of the public, i'm not interested

minutes that i watched, another dozen or so followed. they appeared to be below the cloud cover. \r\n\r\nwe live in the flight paths of both logan airport in boston, and tf green airport in providence, as well as multiple smaller private airports. the lights did not appear to be airplanes. they did not have green and red wing lights, nor the amber tail and head lights. they did not flash at all. multiple planes flew over head during the event. these planes produced the only sound. the orange objects observed did not create any sound. the orange objects also did not fly in any of the observed flight paths. planes bound for logan tend to travel over head from the west and to east, and then turn north. these objects were moving from the west towards the east.\r\n\r\nthe objects were observed through binoculars. they appeared to be from a single object, and with the binoculars, no flashing was apparent.\r\n\r\nthe were only visible as they passed from the west behind tree cover,

trees.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":30317,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.9633657,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07232011-0011","longitude":-70.6607121,"occurred":1311478200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1311482941000,"summary":"Orange

times by myself and 1-2 other individuals at the same time.  these events were witnessed during the years of 2001-2002 and again in 2008-2009.  under no circumstances were the individuals involved under the influence of any substance.  the following sightings were observed by multiple individuals without the influence of suggestion, or ���wishful thinking���.  each of these incidents was exactly alike in nature.   \r\nat the time of my first sighting i was in my mid to late teens.  it was sometime in the summer months at around 10:00 p.M. to 12:00 midnight, as me and a friend of mine were awaiting his car ride home.  we had been waiting outside in the drive way under what was a perfectly clear night sky, for about forty-five minutes to an hour when something caught my eye.  \r\n    i have always been a bit of a ���star gazer���, that is, i enjoy the beauty and awe of a well star-lit night.  so naturally, my eyes are often glancing to the stars, but this particular night i noticed what appeared to be a star in motion.  the object, from my point of view, appeared no different than the stars in the night sky: it twinkled exactly like a star and was the same size of a star from a ground-level perspective.\r\nusing my best judgments, the object seemed to be at a very high altitude- almost right outside of the earth���s atmosphere.  it was moving on a steady path at what would have been a high rate of speed in regards to how high it seemed to be traveling- much like how a plane seems to be moving slow when viewed from ground, but its actual speed is about 400 mph.  \r\ni watched this strange object make its way across the sky with such curiosity and confusion in my mind regarding its identity.   during this point in my observation, i didn���t direct my friend���s attention to it because it was happening relatively fast and i was trying to process what exactly was going on.  it traveled this path for about 20 seconds from the time i noticed it until it did something that made my heart sink into my stomach.  \r\n    the object suddenly came to a complete and abrupt stop in mid-air, made a wide-angle turn at what looked like 4x its original speed, shot across the sky at an even higher rate of speed (without the characteristic ���tail��� associated with shooting stars) into the direction from which it came, and literally vanished into the night sky.\r\nin response to this, i naturally started screaming in disbelief at what i had just seen.  my friend laughed and attempted to offer suggestions as to what it could have been (a plane, satellite, comet, etc.) but i knew better.  in an attempt to explain what i had seen to my friend, i pointed to the sky and used my finger to describe the path the object had taken.  within minutes i noticed the same object a second time, taking a similar path as the first sighting.  this time both me and my friend were observing the object repeat this similar course of travel, redirection and departure.  needless to say, we were both baffled and i had gained another reason to watch the skies. \r\n    several years later on a similar summer night, i was standing outside in my father���s backyard beside a small bonfire talking with my brother and father.  looking toward the stars, i noticed the same object making its course across the sky.  this time i made no hesitation to direct my company���s attention to the object.  once again, the strange oddity followed the exact same course flight, redirection and departure.  all of us who were present saw the same events at the same time.\r\ni have no knowledge of any natural phenomenon that could occur as i have described.  there is no technology that i am aware of that could perform the way this object did.  i have no desire to create such stories for attention or for personal thrills.  i am in no way assuming that this/these object(s) are of any particular origin, be it human or ���extra-terrestrial���- i simply do not have enough evidence or knowledge of the subjects to support either theory.  the only facts that i can absolutely be certain of are: 1) the events occurred exactly as described above; and 2) the object does exist.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional

bigtime...They don't have the experiance i do in flying a ufo...I distinctly remember flying in a simulator..Because who would give an unexperianced person a 300 million dollar spacesaucer..? with mean's to have an alternate power source ellimant 115..Which can't be duplicated...Because we don't have this ellement on earth..I am an industrial wiring tecnition in high voltage lead's and wiring up power of\r\n600 amperes and up..I have been dropped into the bed 6 inches one morning and knew i was abducted because when i landed on the bed , i woke up..And my child angel broke a wing after being on my headboard for year's with out an incident ever...And after i was dropped into my bed...I could hear a humming sound like cintrifical force of some kind..And maybe metal whisleing..Slight weezing..And it wasn't snoring..I was awake when i heard it...I blog my photo's and will blog them untill other's know that the government has agreed to assist the alien grey's..And other's..There are several other alien's here..But all humanoid ofcourse...Seem's that all \"intelligent life\", have two arm's and leg's..A mind and a soul..Not just us on earth..I have seen 12-14 ufo's here in durham,nc. near 85hwy and duke st. near the mall area..I have even seen a ufo abducting a person or scanning that person...I noticed it after watching the ufo for an hour..Move across the sky slowly..All the edges were or had a star like light that they could manipulate and make smaller and larger....I believe they ahve light's that,********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

for the rntire usa..I am proud to be taught by the best and study on my own know enventing alternate power sources...I have tried all kind's but photon's converted into energy is the most effecient and the least cost werthy...I will be studying and trying to perfect this are of protese. and will keep other's and you updated...I would have told you how it work's but it would start to be a case of national security and i would rather come up with it myself instead of having it stollen or torched.I have to look out for the ones that are here with me..Other's ...They are smaller and more dense than us...And they are all collor's according to where in the universe you are in ..Blue,red,white, sun's depect what kind of skin you end up with..And how your pigment react's to this kind of sun...? we could go to a planet with a blue sun and it could mess with our skin and eye's and maybe even our mind..The government has to take step's and don't want to have to explain there selfes..Because it isn't effecient..For us to do so...And it is very secure that way..I want to let other's know that this is real and that these thing's are not fake and the government can't stop them becasue they can't let other's know that they have such a devise or saucer ship flying in our sollar system..These thing's are real and not in 2012...They are here and now !!! if you don't believe me then take a digital camera outside at night and look for any star's that seem to twinkle and glitter, while moving slowly..Usually mean's that is a ufo studying you..They are all over the world and if you don't believe in ufo's .You will after this experiment...And they usually apear after 1:00am and untill 6:00am. planes don't count..And it is back to work after saying a few word's....Then go and see the
