county, virginia. our home at the time was a two story house at a subdivision in a wooded (but still quite populated) area. \r\n\r\nsometime in the late evening i was walking along the upstairs hallway when i saw a white light streaming in through the window blinds in the bedroom directly across from me. the light was coming in from the upper edges of the window and was quite intense, almost as if a large lamp was hung from the edge of the roof directly above the window. however, as i began to approach it, the light suddenly disappeared. although what i had seen struck me as odd, it lasted only for a few seconds and i did not dwell much upon it at the time. \r\n\r\nthe second incident happened several weeks later. i was in the process of tucking into bed after watching the tv in my bedroom, most likely sometime after midnight. the bed was pushed up against the wall under a window, which meant i was able to see the sky outside between the gaps in the blinds as i lay in my bed. as i settled in and shifted closer to the window, i suddenly saw a ball of light, perhaps a bit larger than a basketball (although this is only in relation to my field of view without knowledge of how far the object was from me). unlike the previous incident, light was not streaming in through the blinds, and so i was unaware of it until i lay down on my bed. the object seemed to be hovering in the air adjacent to the house, where it lasted for a few seconds before suddenly disappearing as before. once it was gone, i also noticed that a humming sound that was previously present was also gone, much in the same way that a person notices the silence after a background noise, such as ventilation, disappears.\r\n\r\nps: several years later, an acquaintance also told me of a similar incident in which his wife saw an orb of light, similar to what i described, over the driveway of their house.

south. at 11:30pm a strange low light caught my eye.The light was a yellow to kind of orange color.I pointed at it and shouted to my friend to look. as soon as he looked in that direction the thing disappeard.He said he didnt see it.We looked over in that direction(south) for a couple seconds but saw nothing. i then turned my  head to the right side to talk to him. as soon as i did that he shouted look ohh thats weird.I turned and looked back to the south direction. i saw one of those strange lights that was just a little over tree top level.Just as i started to get a good look at it another one showed up that was closer to us and a little east to the first one. the second one that showed up was really low ( under tree top level).The color of these lights seemed to look white then  yellow and orange like it was constantly changing colors but not like blinking changing.Now it got even more strange.The second one was moving higher up and moving in the direction of the first one. the second one then either had another one right beside it or it simply split into two. now there are three of these things.My friend was getting really excited and screamed at me to get the camcorder. i had the camcorder with us . i then hurried to get the cam out and get it set up.Right before i opened the lcd screen on the cam to record the things.They all vanished.I know all this that i wrote here seems like there was alot of time but this all happened really fast.What i wrote here is what i saw .When i was getting the camera out messing with it my friend said that they were

in western kentucky. we were riding north on highway 51 late at night listening to the am radio when we heard a news report of ufo���s seen in western kentucky and western tennessee. i looked out the back window at the stars above stating that i wish i could see a ufo. it wasn���t two weeks later i had my wish. i was back at home in memphis when my mother asked me to take out the garbage at 10pm  sunday 15 november 1964. i went out back and i looked up and saw a white full moon above then i looked around and to the east i saw a full orange full moon rising. i looked back above and noticed the white full moon again for a few minutes until it ascended in the sky looking like a bright star at high altitude. i believe this phenomenon was outside of my head and it was fantastic.\r\n\r\nat 10pm sunday 15 november of 1964 in memphis tennessee (usa), i was asked by my mother to take out the garbage. i went out back and i noticed a bright white full moon above. i looked closer and i noticed it had uniform whiteness with well define circular outline but i was not able to see the shades of white or grey that made the man in the moon face. it was equally as bright as the real full moon, bright enough to create a moon shadow. i looked around and i noticed another moon that was bright orange. this other moon was rising over our neighbor's house to the east, as i looked through the side yard from the back yard to the front. it had the features that created the man in the moon, so i believed that it was the real moon. i looked above and stared again at the white full moon for a few minutes, then it made a rapid ascend in the sky. i estimate the ascend speed between 180 to 300 knots.  as it rose, it became a smaller and smaller moon until it appeared to looked like a bright star, then a dim star, then disappeared into space. it reminded me of the star of bethlehem when it was at high altitude.  the event occurred within a mile of the area 51 of tennessee, that is near highway 51 in the frayser neighborhood of memphis, tennessee and  the event lasted about fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\ni was only seven when i witnessed this ufo that i now call the \"moon of memphis\". i had a good memory of the event so that when i was trained in the air force as a navigator, i was able to analyze the event better with my aviation experience. i estimate that the \"moon of memphis\" was at twenty thousand feet and was about ten acres in size. i developed this information from watching the ascend of the \"moon of memphis\" through some high cirrus clouds that i estimate was at sixty thousand feet. at twenty thousand feet it would have taken four 747 aircraft parked in a circle to cover the area of the \"moon of memphis\" ufo, thus creating a ten acre size estimate. when it hovered above me, it was exactly the size and shape of the real moon when seen high in the sky.  most observers probably could not tell the difference beteen the \"moon of memphis\" ufo and the real lunar moon when it's hovering above.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

from the k.C. area & have had multiple sighting there since april,one as close as 25' from me,orange orb,beachball size-looked like an eye closing when it blinked out.Anyway enjoy the pics!!  oh-forgot to mention the birdlike ufo-call me on that one.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":30297,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.6202922,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07222011-0009","longitude":-98.6567371,"occurred":1310774400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nebraska","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1311383440000,"summary":"Storm

my front porch and looking eastward (clear weather, no light pollution there) i and my wife saw this bright glow that remained stationery for about 35 minutes. around 20 min into this, the glow flickered for a moment, almost appeared as dim blue, then went to bright whitish again. so i managed to grab the closest camera, a kodak c-310 model, had to quickly install batteries, and managed to grab these 2 photos. i am not much on photography, mostly my wife took family photos and events.  although i am disabled, i worked as a contract airline refueler and certified contract trainer for several major airlines and also provided military contract services, and am familiar with most military aircraft also. i am comfortable with my knowledge and experience of how objects appear in the night sky. i also have dabbled with backyard astronomy over the years. even from lyndhurst i could spot a satellite in orbit with the naked eye on occasion, and the wisp band of the milky way. am also famaliar with aircraft routes as viewed from ground. well we had other things going on at the time, and this event faded. in jan of 2011 we had to move to williamsburg, and just in the last week i found the camera i thought was lost. i uploaded all the photos and discovered these two were still on the card. now my curiosity is building. this object or whatever it is did not appear to move in the least bit, seemed positioned with the stars. i do not claim this is a ufo or anything, but it was a fascinating event. these images (1 full shot, 1 zoomed) are all i have. the light faded out, and i waited another hour or so, it never reappeared. mabye your staff can test these out, and i would greatly appreciate a reply with your opinion of what this may be. i know this was not the moon, venus, any aircraft i can identify, or swamp gas.Thank you.","distance":"Over One

park here in logrono, basking in the sunlight. the air was clear; it was not too hot. not a cloud in sight. for a while i lay with my eyers closed. around 19.00 i opened my eyes and looked up in the sky. i looked at all the birds flying above me, the dust particles drifting around, the passenger airplanes passing to and from bilbao and simply enjoyed myself. the sun was shining directly on my head; i didn't see the sun when gazing straight upwards, it was just above my eyes. in other words, my view of the sky was as perfect as it gets that time of day here in logrono. then, a thought of ufos passed my mind, and in that second, a white dot materialized above me, far far up in the sky. it travelled in a straight line very very fast, but not too fast for my eyes too follow. it travelled in a straight line from north to south. since my sight had already been calibrated by the birds at different altitudes, airplanes and dust particles of different kinds, i could clearly see that it was not any of those things, that is birds, airplanes or dust particles. i could also clearly see that it was very high up in the sky, higher up than passenger airplanes travel. it also moved much faster than an average passenger airplane. in some seconds, it was gone on the southern horizon, due to the air getting 'thicker' towards the horizon. i was very calm, but i understood what i had just seen, even if it was hard to believe. some minutes passed, and i started to doubt my own perception and my interpretation of it, thinking it was probably just a bird or something. as soon as i had thought this, a new one appeared, at the same spot, travelling in the same direction at the same speed. now i noticed, while i was watching it, that as long as i was was actually observing it, there was no doubt whatsoever that this was not a bird, airplane or dust particle. also, i noticed that i was fully alert, registering as much as i possibly could, and not in any way 'shaken' by the sight. then it was gone. and then, in some minutes, came the doubt as to what i had seen. maybe it was a low flying satelite, reflecting the sun? again i was 'in limbo' concerning what i'd just seen. some minutes later, and a third one 'materialized' just above me, like the other two, travelling at the same speed (tremendous), altitude and trajectory. before it disappeared from sight, i thought 'why don't you make a turn, so i'll know you're not a satelite?' and at that very moment, it made a turn (to the west)!!! then it was out of sight. then a cessna plane or something of that kind came flying low over me, followed by a fourth ufo, same as the ones before. but before this one vanished over the horizon, a passenger airplane came along. their trajectories crossed, and now it was plain to see that the ufo was flying much higher, and much much faster than the passenger airplane. btw, the ufos were white dots, very small, yet very visible, but only for those looking intently up at the sky at the very place where they were flying. i would say they were circular, but that's hard to tell at such distance. they were, or seemed at any rate, very solid, white things, with no discernible shape. again, the ufo disappeared, and again the doubt came sneeking up on me. and then came another, and then another, until the doubt seemed more like vanity than anything scientifically substantial. all in all, i saw ten such ufos in the span of half an hour. i never saw two at the same time, but at one time a new one appeared immediately after the last one disappeared over the horizon, so i guess it must have been at least two, but probably ten, unless the same ufo flew over me until out of sight, and then teleported back to just above me, doing this ten times. one of the ufos had more of a west/east trajectory, the others more or less in a straight north/south trajectory.\r\nafter the ufos had passed, i noticed a small cloud, of the cummulus kind, with lots of creases and shapes, the type of cloud you see faces and stuff in, moving towards me from the south-east towards north-west. i was baffled by the speed at which it 'unfolded'; in a minute or two it had tripled or quadrupled it's size. it looked, visually that is, far more astonishing than the ufos. as it had dramatically increased it's size, it turned into a uniform foggy patch in a matter of seconds. it went from being your average type of cartoon-cummulus to an elongated circular patch of uniform 'fog' in probably no more than two minutes, expanding it's area by probably 600-1000% in that time span. the transformation happened just above me, where i'd seen the ufos 'materialize' earlier, but at much lower altitude, maybe a fifth of the altitude of the ufos, although that is only a guesstimation.\r\ni believe i've answered point 1-3 above.\r\n4: white dots, most probably circular. moved in straight trajectories from north to south at very high speeds, took maybe 10 seconds to cross the sky. one ufo made a turn towards the west, one ufo had a west-east trajectory. uniform speed, many times greater than an average passenger airplane.\r\n5: calm, observing and accepting during observation, followed by disbelief, this was repeated ten times until it was no longer followed by disbelief. it seemed ordinary in a strange way.\r\n6: i loosed sight of the objects as they moved closer to the horizon, where they disappeared in the more white light towards the horizon. i would say they disappeared from sight due to the angle through the atmosphere i was seeing them; as they got closer to the horizon they were obscured by the increasing amount of air/humidity/pollution through which i saw them.\r\n\r\ni did not have a camera with me, and i would have needed some really expensive gear for the pictures to have been interesting at any rate, due to the speed and altitude at which they were flying.","distance":"Over One

sky was that pretty orangey pink and muted blue. i had looked up just to take it in before i went back inside and just as i was about to turn to do so.. it caught my eye.. it was a little.. out of place shimmer that i honestly thought was a star.. which is why i turned.. i thought it was funny that a star would be popping up so early. when i finally caught sight of it again though.. i noticed that the reason it was so difficult for me to find again was because it wasn't stationary. i kept my eyes fixed on it and started to pick out the few details that i could. the object was completely lit up.. white and some hints of a brilliant electric blue that would filter off and on. it was spherical from what i could tell. what made me realize for certain that this was no star or satellite was the movements that it would make.. it would move forward then hover.. rise or fall in altitude.. then move backwads. it repeated these movements as if it were observing. when it made one of its passes underneath a large cloud.. i noticed another craft (a bit smaller in size but about the same otherwise) hovering just above the same cloud. then the other object became visible again and both objects were in my field of view for five or so more minutes while they moved in the strangest ways. the smaller light almost tagging along with the bigger light. i felt anxious watching it (anxious but not particularly afraid).. even my dogs were acting strange.. though there was no sound that i could pick up on. (maybe they were picking up my anxiety?) i watched these objects for over 20 minutes when they both finally gained massive altitude.. and from what i could tell  were also heading north-west and then both disappeared quickly in the distance and altitude. i wasn't able to get photo or video.. as the objects were very small looking from where i was.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":30293,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.3118779,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07222011-0005","longitude":-118.4475474,"occurred":1304299800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1311328134000,"summary":"Standing in our back yard i sa what i thought to be a star/satellite.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":81,"locationName":"Los Angeles, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:46364"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Kansas City","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Driving from independence to olathe on 4-35 west in (kansas city). had friends in car with me. we all saw it. i was the driver and looked up and said \"that is the strangest moon i have ever seen\". of course it really did not look like the moon but i had no other explanation. it was in 3 sections and i thought the clouds were covering the moon in two places, thus making it appear as 3 parts. it was so orange and was so bright. my rational mind could not make sense of what i was seeing. we were silent as we continued to stare at this. it separated into 2 separate squares or rectangles. then only 1 was visible and was in a rectangular shape. it was large and i could not figure out what it was. first time for me ever seeing a ufo. then it just disappeared, just like that which really made no sense. there all big and orange one second and then vanished the next.I told several people about this and i knew without a doubt that it was a ufo. i never thought i would ever see such a thing as i am not really big on ufo stuff.  it wasnt until last night that i was informed that kansas city has been a hot place for sightings lately. i got on the internet and began reading and was amazed that so many people are seeing the orange glow in the sky. i was not scared but transfixed as once i saw it, i could not take my eyes off of it even though i was driving down the highway. it was late and very little traffic.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":30292,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.1663401,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08022011-0042","longitude":-94.6072143,"occurred":1310021400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,   Rectagular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1312334270000,"summary":"Bright orange, first in 3 sections, then in 2 sections, then 1","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":26,"locationName":"Kansas City, Kansas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:46365"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Arlington","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Our dad told my sister and i to go take the dog outside my sister and me thought it was like a plane or hellacopter,i was gana wave at it but i relized it was not like a plane or any thing like that!

on beach ave. with a view of the sea. \r\n\r\ni was asleep when i was awakened by something. i opened my eyes and saw two beings standing at the foot of the bed. it was dark, but there was adequate light coming in from the street for me to see them very clearly. i estimate that they were between 4.5-5 feet tall because i could only see them from the waist up. they were identical in every way. they were wearing black or dark green, form-fitting outfits that resembled scuba diving dry suits. these included snug hoods that extended from the back of their necks over top of their skulls. on their upper chests was a rectangular, gold or bronze colored plate about 6x4 inches with two rows of inscribed symbols or buttons on them. it resembled an instrument touchpad of some sort.\r\n\r\nthey were no more than six feet from my face and they were both staring right at me. it was a cool, appraising look. it's the look a cat might give you.\r\n\r\ntheir crania were very large, perhaps twice as large as a man's. but it was their faces that really got me. they had huge, wraparound, black eyes set above high cheekbones. their skin appeared coppery or orange in color. i couldn't detect a well defined mouth or nose, but along the rim of their jaws and down to their chins were some kind of organ-like structures. gills? mandibles? not sure. i couldn't see their hands, so i can't say how many digits they had.\r\n\r\nas i say, i had a very clear view of them. when i realized that this was not a dream i propped myself up on my elbows to get a better view. strange, but i felt no fear. i was about to say something, when i got this very clear thought, \"something is wrong. he sees us.\" i suddenly became extremely sleepy. i tried to fight the urge to lie back down, but it was no use. i felt my eyes closing and that was it. the next thing i knew it was morning and i was awakened by the sunlight streaming in through the balcony door. once she was awake i asked my wife how she had slept and she said it was the best night���������s sleep she���������d had in a while. no dreams.\r\n\r\nthis isn't the first time in my life that i've had what could be called nocturnal visitations. as a child and teenager they were very frequent. and often terrifying. as an adult they tapered off to the point where i chalked up my youthful experiences to dreams, hormones, flights of fancy, etc. i had even stopped thinking about them. but this is the first time as an adult that i had such a clear and unambiguous sighting of these creatures. \r\n\r\nif one thing stands out, it's the sense of almost military precision and discipline that i got from them. it's hard to explain, but i got the feeling that these were no-nonsense 'men' who had a job to do and followed orders to the letter. they were not there to be my friend or to tell me any of the universe's secrets. they were under orders and would no sooner go against them than would one of our navy seals. and one last thing, they were supremely confident and felt not the slightest fear towards me. i am absolutely sure of that.

decided to walk out and sit on the steps of my backdoor to see how light it was outside. it was still pretty dark but i could barely see it begin to brighten. while i was looking up at the stars i noticed a star-like object moving east. at first i thought it was a shooting star because of the hieght. it was really high up there. but was no shooting star. was clearly not a plane and im pretty sure it wasn't a satellite. it was moving at a good rate but not too fast. i watched it move east untill it just dimmed out of view. it appeared to kinda dim untill i could almost not see anything, than it reapear to normal. and again, very star-like. i watched it for about mabey a minute and was thinking ''no way'' the whole time. because it was so far up there, and the rate it was moving, it could have been traveling at 800 to 900 mph. thats my geuss. and yes i did try to wave at it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":30279,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.6422018,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07212011-0005","longitude":-96.6003105,"occurred":1311250800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1311260376000,"summary":"Small

porch smoking a cigarette. i heard a very loud roaring noise that had me confused at first. i began to hear what sounded like prop noise from a large turbo-prop transport. i have seen military transports fly over in the middle of the night at low altitude before. considering how loud it was, i was certain this was what i was hearing. everytime i see these planes they come from the southwest and fly directly over my house heading north-northeast towards ft. campbell. i looked to that direction but couldn't see anything in the sky. as it started getting louder the \"prop noise\" disappeared and i could only hear the loud jet-like roar. it was then that i started to scan the sky and when i finally spotted the source of the noise, it was directly overhead. it was heading almost due west. i often see commercial aircraft flying in the same area of the sky on about the same heading. but this aircraft was slightly faster than what i usually see and was at a lower, but still fairly high, altitude. even when you consider the lower altitude it was still proportionately faster than what i usually see in the sky. it had three dully lit red lights in a tight triangle formation. no blinking lights of any kind. only the three continuously lit red lights. i watched it for about 10 long seconds. at first i thought maybe it was a fighter jet. but judging by the lights, it was a long slender craft. my next guess was maybe it was one of those supersonic jets which are notorious for their noise and are long and slender, but there were no blinking lights and i dont even think any of them are in commission anymore because of their noise emissions. it was then that i realized this was no normal aircraft. military maybe, but definitely out of the ordinary. i constantly watch the sky at night studying the blinking lights that cross the sky but this is a first for me.  it flew straight and at a constant speed and continued to do so until i lost sight of it in the tree tops. the roar dissipated as i lost sight of the aircraft.
