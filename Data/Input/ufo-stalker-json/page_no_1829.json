turning onto my street, i slowed down and looked out my window to the east.  i saw that there were now three lights in total.  they were not blinking in unison.  as i watched the lights, they began to move together into the shape of a triangle.  they kept moving at each other until it appears as though they met and spun around as one unit then dashed away from the point of rotation.  i called the friend, whose house i had just left to see if he could see  said objects.  after describing where they were he could see the two that i could also see.  one went off to the east and i lost sight of it in a minute or two.  the second two were off to the west well over minnesota (extremely close to the boarder), and one was towards the south end of town.  i watched them until they dipped behind my

while i was taking pictures of the sun, i noticed a small object to my left, that was flying around erratically, very unlike an airplane. it also moved very quickly. darting about this way and that. even though i first spotted the object to my left, it seemed that the object was moving more or less in the vicinity of the sun. i didn't think that i would be able to capture a picture of it since it was moving around so fast, but decided to continue taking pictures in the general direction of the area in which the object was moving, which was the vicinity of the sun. i don't have any kind of fast-picture taking ability with this camera and was not optimistic that i would actually be able to capture the object, however, after downloading my pictures i noticed that the object does appear in one of the pictures that i took. looking at the object in the picture, zooming in a little on it, i can see that very distinctive, almost clich���d saucer shape, the same shape that i recognized when i saw the object in real time. i again, did not think it was airplane. i also didn't think it was a bird not only because of its very distinctive saucer shape, but it also appears to be metallic and it was moving around in a very erratic and very high rate of speed. while i was observing the craft, i could also make out that the craft was rotating (i believe counter-clockwise) and i don't know if its my imagination but i think the rotation can actually be discerned from the photograph. maybe it only seems that way to me since i actually saw the craft rotating in real time. i wish i had had my camera set to a higher resolution. the picture was taken with an olympus fe 14 mega-pixel camera. it was set to auto shutter-speed and auto aperture. i didn't have the camera set on 14 mega-pixels, but approximately 8 mega pixels, so that i could use the fine zoom on the camera which is an optical zoom only and does not use a digital zoom. this produces less artifacts in the photograph, which suited my purpose for taking photographs of the sun. at the time that i observed the object i was quite excited, since it appeared to be a flying saucer, it was quite exciting. i only hoped i would be able to get a picture of it, which i wasn't too optimistic. i lost sight of the object after about two minutes when it went zipping away, at a very high rate of speed. i tried to attach the picture and it said it was infected with a virus. that's impossible. i went right from my camera on to my computer. i used photo editor to crop the photo, and will try again to attach the

gigantic, triangular craft gently, quietly floated over our car while we were driving on i-10.  and it wasn't super high in the sky either -- maybe 100 yards (although i'm bad at estimating distances).  my husband was driving west on i-10, naturally looking straight ahead.  i had turned my body around sideways facing him so i could speak to him and also speak with the two people in the back seat.  then i saw a huge triangular ufo slowly glide over the car, and when i turned to look out my side window i saw it glide down behind a small hill on my side of the car.  it had a light on each of it's three points.  it was such an amazing experience that i never even mentioned it to anyone in the car until 3 months later, as i felt that it was meant for me alone to see.  also, since no one else saw it and there would be no proof, i didn't see the point in reporting it.  this took place in, i think, september of 1994.  i guess it made me feel special to have witnessed the craft when

them at about 30��� of altitude. i asked him if his head was tilted up a little bit like maybe 30��� and he said that that sounds good. he said the lights were proceeding west. he said they were going rapidly. he went through his garage to look through the west window and the lights were gone. he stated that he was carrying some firewood when he saw the lights. he also stated that he has a friend who was driving somewhere and saw an orange ball of light descend into the woods. he said his friend noticed that other cars were pulled over and the occupants were looking at the orange light. i asked walter to see if his friend would also make a report. walter seemed very nervous when he talked and mentioned that his wife was concerned about getting phone calls from screwballs. i assured him

around.

and workout. i have a membership at the local 24hr fitness center. as i locked my front door and walked to my car, which was parked on the street and not in my drive way this day, a object in the sky caught my attention. it was, in the best way to describe it, looked like an ordinary star at first glance. there were a lot of stars out in the night sky this night, but the thing that stood out was that this star like object was moving across the sky and made no noise. then, that's when i noticed the second star like object, which was exactly the same size as the first object, same brightness and made no sound , but moving in a south- east direction. the first object that i saw was moving towards me in a northeast direction. i got the feeling that these two objects must have been flying close together and then split into different flight directions.Now i do want to point out that there are many commericial craft, private planes, and military craft that fly across the sky over my city. the thing is that, when they do, you can see a fixed wing object flying across the sky with sound following behind it. at night, when you see these man made craft, all their lights are visible. not to mention that i worked at an airport for a period of 4 years and have seen just about every plane, helicopter and experimental aircraft out there. also, living in san diego all my life, which has the navy, marines and national guard based in our city, you see f-16 and f-18 and just about every known military aircraft out there flying across the sky on a daily basis. going back to the two objects that i saw. these star like objects were moving at a steady speed, but not very fast. they were not shooting across the sky, but rather like coasting across the sky. i would say that they were about 5,000 to 8,000 ft in the sky. i tried to stay watching both of these objects, but the one moving southeast was getting to far away for me to stay watching it, so i focused on the first one that i saw. it was directly above me for about a few seconds. this might sound weird, but i got the feeling as if what or whoever was flying this craft, knew i was watching it. then, the object slowed down, almost like it was not moving and begun to flicker. it got bright and then dim. it did this for about 3 or 4 seconds, then stopped flickering and begun to speed up again. it kept moving in a northeast direction. i tried to glance at the second object to see if it was still visible in the sky, but it was long gone or just faded out of view. by the time i looked back in the first objects direction, it was gone and i could not see it anymore. this is not the first time i have seen similar objects. i have seen these same star like objects about 5 times in the last 8-9 months. i have never see two of these objects at once though. i am not a person that is trying to get attention. i am just an average 28 year old man who likes his sports and hanging out with my friends. i believe what i am seeing is not any know man made aircraft in the sky. again, the best way to describe these objects, is to go outside and pick one of the brightness stars in the sky. same size as a star would look, and the same altitude a star would appear to be to the naked eye, and picture that star moving across the sky at a steady speed. this is the best description i can give about what i am seeing. i observed these two star like objects for about 50 to 70 seconds.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with

live in the country so sky watching is just something we like to do. while waiting i noticed a silvery light moving fast across the east horizon line. the speed of it caught my attention. i pointed it out to my wife  and then we notice 3 more as we began to look around. they were almost directly above us. the 3 were moving towards each other when we noticed them. one was moving some what straight from a southernly direction to a northern direction. one that looked like it was coming from the northern direction was moving erratically (like jumping from spot to spot. it was also more bright than the others) but mostly head southernly towards the one coming from the south. the third just kind of appeared out out no where and seemed to be coming from the west. all 3 looked like they were going to collide. my wife got excited because she thought they were going to crash! but it looked more like they passed right through each other. after crossing paths or whatever they did, the one headed more northernly seem to pick up speed very fast and quickly disappeared into the north direction. the brighter one from the north was still headed southernly but slowed and stopped for about 1 min. the one that came in from the west instantly turned 90 degrees northernly (but was more n/w in direction) at the point of meeting for the three. it kept the same speed the entire time. it wasn't fast, but it wasn't slow! we watched it till it faded off into the sky. the brighter one that stopped, just disappeared where it was. it looked bigger too compared to the other ones and most of the stars that are in the sky. the other two seemed to be about the same size and brightness. i would size them comparable with the majority of the small stars in the sky. big enough to see, but too small to see any detail. not like you would see if it were an airplane, you can see it's flashing lights. can only say they looked like white lights just like most stars look like, other than they were moving.

sky is unbelievably clear. i have seen explainable things in the sky every night for almost 2 and a half months. my first sighting was over an onion field at around 9:30pm so the sun had set but the sky was still in a twilight state and i saw a bright white light hovering which seemed to be hovering about 300ft off the ground. as i was staring at it it blinked twice and then went out completely and just vanished. i heard no noise. the whole sighting lasted about 30 seconds from the time i noticed the light from the time it disappeared. i started watching the sky at night since then and ive seen bizarre things every night and not just one sighting a night multiple sightings of different kings of objects and different colors. last week i saw a formation 3 bright red flashing lights that were silent and only red no other exterior lights and they went one by one in the same direction fallowing the first. one would almost disappear from view then the next would appear. the same night i saw 4 orange solid lights blink into existence over a different area and disappear within a 10 minute period. they flew over a hazelnut orchard and looked like they would speed up then slow down then speed up again and they flew like that till they disappeared. i could go on and on. the most frequent craft i see are amber colored and seem to flash hints of other colors like blue and white almost as if it were like a ball of fire and i can see them hover for hours and the whole time they bob up and down and sway back and forth ascending and descending as they very very slowly make their way across the sky almost as if it was observing the ground. im not sure why im not hearing anything about ufo sightings in salem oregon but i suggest someone looks into it because the amount of activity here is phenomenal i am trying desperately to get my hands on a good video camera to get some footage. maybe some investigators should look into making a trip to see some oregon lights it would be so

putting it in gear and holding the brakes.  while my wife was in the car she was looking at the sky and started to see a black sphere and called me to come from in front of the car and to look up,  when i looked up i see a black sphere and i'm telling my son to go and get his binoculars and when he came back he said he can't find them so he brought his sister's i-pod touch and i started to take pictures.   i then started to take video but i was having trouble seeing the sphere on the i-pod so i pointed the i-pod to were it was the last time i saw it and started to record.  we saw the black sphere for about seven to nine minutes it moved sideways, up, down, and would also stay in place for a minute and take off.  after it disappeared we heard in the back round military jets going to were the black sphere were. i came inside my house and started to see the pictures and the videos put the screen was to small to see anything so i downloaded it to my computer and started to darken the color of the pictures to see it better and i started to see white spheres on the pictures so i started to see the videos that i took and the same thing the white spheres were there too.  then i converted the three minute video to one hour and twenty minutes and also adjusted the lighting and when i played it back it shocked me and scared me because the white spheres where going in and out of the clouds and some even left a trail when they came out from the clouds.    they are different sizes and they are more than thirty or forty spheres and they move so fast and if you go frame by frame you can see them going in and out and some stop and you can see that they are white round spheres. i was in shock how many they are and how fast they move and also how they used the cloud to hide and to me they manipulated the clouds shape so they could move to another place.  since that day i feel confused and also have a hard time concentrating or focusing on things i feel lost and the more i see the videos the more start to wonder why so many of them? and what were they doing or looking for?  i wish i could talk to some one about it but i'm scared i don't want to talk to just anyone.  if you would be interested on the videos i have it on my computer and still have the originals on the i-pod and if you would like to get a hold of me write me an e-mail and give me a number were i can call, because i really want to talk to some one who has experience on this type of sightings. i sent you the original video and the one in slow motion.  this happened in san jacinto california.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:09:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

frequent as he gets older. i waited a few minutes to see if he'd simply go back to sleep on his own but he continued to call out my name calmly. before going in his room i went out to living room of our apartment to fold out the futon couch for us to rest on. i set up a few pillows and blankets but before going back to his room i decided to open the sliding glass door a bit to let the cool night air in. while i was doing this i also decided to look up at the night sky. i was facing due east when i noticed just above the next apartment roof-line a normal sized looking star. it was stationary and i made the guess that it was a star or an airplane heading toward my direction (westward). after 5-10 seconds of a stationary position it slowly started to move straight up. i then ruled out it being a star and settled on it being a plane. it moved up approximately 5-10 degrees then completely stopped. remained stationary for approximately 3-5 seconds then descended back down toward the horizon but not in a straight line. it was wiggling down or following a curving \"s\" shape path down until it was out of view because of the facing apartment building roof top. the color of the light appeared to be a dull red.\r\n\r\nadditionally, later that morning when i was walking out the door i kissed my wife goodbye and my son. he looked up at me and said, ���orion see big spaceship in the sky. big spaceship in sky���. our jaws dropped. the last time he woke up in the middle of the night (approx late june), and coincidentally it was the same time 3:45 am. the next morning he said the same thing to my wife careen, ���orion see spaceship high in the sky���. in my report here, i���m paraphrasing but careen wrote down what he said that morning for a more precise reference to his own words.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional

other adults visiting the liberty memorialin kansas city, missouri on saturday night july 16.  as we were walking down the steps to leave, i noticed a strange gold ball of light flying n.W. to s.E.  the size of it was smaller than the full moon.  it was a bright gold color and was perfectly round. the light did not pulse or waver, and there were no blinking lights on it like you would expect from a conventional aircraft.  the helicopter made circles around the object it as it moved along.  the object moved at different hights and inconsistent speeds, and we thought it was going to crash due to the angle it was headed down (45 degrees) but it did not.  it changed size, probably based on moving further away and closer to us. it turned completely white then just dissapeared in front of our eyes. we heard the helicopter noise but nothing else, as if there was no other craft in the area. after the object dissapeared a plane came in the area, but we did not pay much attention to it so i don't know what type of plane it was.  one of the men with us got some pictures of the object and helicopter. i would like to know if anyone else saw this object.  \r\n\r\nnote from fi: i am
