probably a plane\" which i explained there werent wings or noise, and at the elevation it was those would be visible, they then said it was probably a helicopter, and i said it couldn't be because we

along from the south, houston, heading north at approximately 25 degrees above the horizon.  i was utterly dumbfounded.  i have star gazed my whole life and been to every air show for the last twenty years.  i have never seen anything like it.  it had a translucent appearance with some variance in the surface color.  i immediately tried to discern if it was manmade.  it was so plainly visible i could not see anything to make me think it was manmade.  there was no sound and it just floated along with slight up and down movements.  i moved around the trees and kept in view for approximately forty five seconds.  i yelled for my friend to come out, but by the time he made it out and looked it went behind the trees to the north.  the most amazing thing i have ever seen.  it was surreal.

be in our atmosphere, but it was pretty high up. i'd imagine it was far too high up to be a drone, and it traveled quite far to be a drone. drones are also banned in the park and it was dark, so i think that rules it out as a hobby drone. perhaps the military has something else. \r\n\r\nand it wasn't coming in for a landing, but staying at its altitude and slowly faded away as it moved to the

high-powered binoculars.  as it was dusk, i started to look for stars/planets, first finding jupiter (to my west-southwest).  in fact, jupiter was the only space object i had seen so far today.  continuing to scan the skies, i turned about 360 degrees to see what i could see.  i spotted with my naked eye what appeared to me to be a brighter-than-jupiter object, and so i took a look through my binoculars.  focusing on the object as best i could, i reckoned it to be a planet, and was going inside to check my astronomy software to try and determine what it was i was observing.  but before i could do that, i saw that the object \"separated,\" for lack of a better word.  the best way i can describe it was that it was a balloon of some type and a portion of it -- like a gondola -- dropped away from the balloon.\r\n\r\nthis object i witnessed falling was leaving a trail of, presumably, smoke and whatnot.  also, the falling object was lit up, so much so that it appeared to me to be of the same brightness that i had observed when i first spotted the object.\r\n\r\nat some point while the object was falling, my attention was drawn away to what appeared to be two aircraft flying almost within the field of view; that is, i could almost see both the airplanes and the falling object through my binoculars (they are a non-zoom type).\r\n\r\nthe airplanes looked to me like b-52 stratofortresses...Perfectly lined up so that it looked like one plane with two sets of wings.  these airplanes were headed east-northeast.\r\n\r\nreturning my visual focus to the object i originally observed, well...I didn't see it.  i looked through my binoculars and with my naked eyes: nothing.  and now the airplanes were out of view.\r\n\r\nregarding the airplanes, my best guess on their altitude would be less than 10,000 feet.  i say this because i think i recall hearing the airplanes (which is why my attention was diverted to them).  and given the airplane-gazing i had been doing just before, i know what an airplane at, say, 30,000-40,000 feet looks like...And they are nowhere near that large.\r\n\r\nas far as the other object is concerned, i estimate its altitude to be in the same range.  i say that partly because of how \"quickly the one object was falling.  my considered opinion is that the object would not have appeared to me to be moving so quickly had it been a a much-higher altitude.\r\n\r\nfollowing my failed effort to visually reacquire the falling object and the \"parent\" object, i looked to see if i could spot the airplanes.  i could not.  they had become blocked by a building.\r\n\r\nthank you.","distance":"Over One

 yes.  we moved effortlessly,  slowly down the long side porch, me hearing their communication all the while.  we stopped.  i was hovering above the ground.  i was asked to look forward as far as i could see.\r\nfar from our house, in the middle of our 87 acre hay field was a ship.  it hovered above the ground.  more beings stood in hover formation as we glided toward the craft.  it was pleasant and familiar, as though i were once again with tony smithenhouser.\r\ni remember nothing after this except waking up in my bed, in my clothing and muddy shoes under the covers at 3:33am hearing that musical notes blaring in my ears.  i felt panic and breathless.  what happened?
