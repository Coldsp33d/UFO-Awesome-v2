(i've had sightings before where i found blinking to be a problem in tracking the ufo, so now, i just try not to blink!);) literally, one second it was there and the next it was gone. there was no streak of light or any kind of trail. we watched the sky for a while after, seeing if it would appear again, but it didn't. \r\n\r\na neighbor, across the street came bursting out his front door with his dog, looked up at the sky, and ran back inside. i'm pretty sure he saw the light from the back of his house, and came out front when he lost it. no one takes their dog out for a 3 second walk. if i talk to him tomorrow i will urge him to make his own report.\r\n\r\nas far as how i (and my mother) felt, i can only say that it was the same as our previous sightings. that is to say that we both had the feeling of it noticing that we noticed it. this time, it seemed like our seeing it made it flee, like it didn't want to be seen. this frustrates me, though, because i've seen \"lights\" through the course of my life. now, i want to see a whole ship! i guess i kinda feel like, if i don't see the outline of a ship, i can't be absolutely certain of what i saw. i know there are probably a million explanations for what i saw tonight that i haven't already thought of, but it was weird. and after hearing of other people's sightings, i feel kinda cheated that all i get to see are lights! that's how i feel, anyway. my mom described the whole thing as \"high strangeness.\"","distance":"101-500

cousin's home.  suddenly, i became aware of an object flying from west to east in front of me, about a mile or so away.  it was above tree level. the bottom of the left side of the object seemed to be reflecting light, (which made me notice it). i thought the reflection was from sunlight, but the top part didn't seem to have the same reflection. my first thought was that the object was a plane, but the front right end of it was round, so i was unsure of what i was seeing.  my far vision isn't as clear as my close up sight.  i took a photo with my canon digital camera, and continued to watch it fly to the east until it was out of sight.\r\n\r\nit never occurred to me that i might be seeing a ufo. even though i have watched many ufo programs, my mind set was not on that thought, or i would have taken many photos. rather, i was simply taking photos of the clouds for the purpose of doing a painting, since i am an artist.\r\nthe object did not change its direction or move up, down or diagonally.  it just flew straight across the sky, horizontally, till out of sight.  it flew at the normal rate of speed of one of our airplanes. i did not see any additional lights flashing or reflecting, once i had taken the photo.  it showed no reflection as it flew east, away from me. \r\n\r\nit was only when i finally had time to look at my photos from my trip, that i came across the picture i had taken and was shocked at what i saw. when i had first seen the object it, there were lighter clouds behind it, which made it more difficult to be seen. in my photo, by the time i had raised my camera to take the picture, the object had moved to an area with a darker cloud behind it, so it could be seen well. from what i recall, as the object continued to move east, the sky behind it was a light shade of blue; i did not see its total shape at all.  i don't know whether the object moved somewhat higher or lower to make that occur, or whether the clouds shifted.\r\n\r\nas i went back into the house, i felt uncomfortable. i think i realized that i had seen something that was unusual and didn't know how to process that thought. no one was in the room for a while when i entered

when i told her what i was seeing she just told me to go away i am resting.It took 15 mins of pleating with her befor she got up and came outside.Now when everyone was outside nieghbors included,ipointed in the direction of the strange lights but nothing was happening.As we looked around the sky we saw nothing.All i remember is all of us looked back were i frist saw the shooting lights and every thing went black our front porch lights the street light,when i turned around i saw a huge disk shaped object 6 or 7 storys high and as big as a football feild with no noise.It had different colored lights in the middle changing every few seconds....This thing came out of nowhere because i just looked in that direction no less than 1/2 second ago!...As we watched the ufo in darkness it slowly followed the hwy rt 62 in northcollins ny.Go along the road at the same speed about 5 mph.Soon it went over tall trees a1/2 mile away and it was gone.Soon after the street light came on and did our front lights.   my mother went in the house and called the police.It took the police about 45 mins to arrive and take statements.Now as we are all there we see from the southwest 3 bright lightscomming at us fast with a lot of noise. as it got closer it flew directly over our heads it was so low,as low as the ufo we saw earlier, on the bottom of the aircraft were the letters u s a f in black lettering. the cop and the rest of us dident know what to make of it.I have told this story to my friends who say ya ok what were you smoking i was a 13 yr old country boy at the time for gods sake.  some of the wittness are no longer with us but there are 4 or 5 still out there and saw exactly what i told you. iam not making this up,i have been waiting years to tell my story to a

less.\r\ni then uploaded the pictures and video into my camera. the majority of what i got was the same as the man's in question... light reflections from my camera lens around the sun in pentagon and hexagon shapes, various colors, beautiful but nothing unusual. \r\nafter taking a second look at my own pictures, i noticed something out of the normal, something to the middle left of the sun. it was (compared to the sun) small, but in reality was the size of our moon at least, maybe the size of the earth. it was gray, round very noticeable. \r\ni then went back into my camera, cropped the photo

something in the sky was on fire.  very serious tone in her voice.  i got up and went to the back guest room window, looked out but did not see anything.  i could hear the neighbor saying to her father , to the right, look to the right.  i then looked to the right still did not see anything.\r\n \r\nkept looking and then saw a large orange oval/orb like object moving from east to west comming towards my position.  i could see it through the tree branches, and it eventually was able to be seen in full view.  the object was large orange oval/orb like in structure.  the color was extreamly bright/vibrant.  the object moved very slowly, no sound could be heard.  i estimate it was about as high as a hillicopter would fly, but lower than commercial planes would fly. i remember planes flying at a higher altitude.  \r\n\r\nthe object moved in a northwesterly direction, then stopped.  it then reversed direction, and hovered for a few seconds and then headed northward in a slow manner.  my vision was then obscurred by the trees.I went to get my wife to have her see it as well, but when we both got back, the object was no longer there.\r\n\r\ni have never seen anything like this before, it manuvered unlike any conventional craft i have seen.  it was not a hot air baloon or any home made prank, it was real.  as i viewed the object, i kept thinking this is strange very unusual, i was a little firghtened, but needed to view the object as i probably not see anything like this for the rest of my life.  my wife said when i came into the room to get her, that i was all keyed up/emotional.  she knew i had seen something strange.  \r\n\r\nthinking back after the sighting, i believe what i saw was a ufo.  i'm glad i had the opportunity to witness this object.  i'm

atlanta, ga. and chattanooga, tn. i observed a white cigar shaped object at an approx altitude of 2,000 ft and a quarter mile in front of my vehicle. i estimate the object to have been approx 100-150 ft long, no markings, windows, wings, vertical stabilizer or any type of trail left behind it. the object was rounded off the same on both ends, not tapered as the nose on an aircraft would be. i am a pilot and very familiar with all types of aircraft. the object travelled from as far as i could see to my right (possibly 10 miles) to as far as i could see to my left (possibly 5 miles) in 3-5 seconds. the object was travelling on a straight trajectory and was going east to west. the speed of this object well exceeded the normal operating speeds of jet aircraft that you normally see in the sky.\r\n\r\nthere was no haze in the sky so i did get a very good look at the object in the short time i had. my first thought was of u.S. ships launching cruise missiles during the gulf war. the object looked similar to the cruise missiles as they were cruising over the ground enroute to their targets.

for the incident is 24571 from what was witnessed one year ago.  this seems to be more than a coincidence and i would like to share this information with any investigator that may help explain or look further into this matter.  thank you and i hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\n[name and email removed/cms/tg]","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":30209,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.3495316,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08072011-0089","longitude":-84.4078283,"occurred":1310791200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1312767582000,"summary":"Three fiery trails followed by dancing balls of light that formed a diagonal formation.  the lights blinked on and off then quickly headed in a northwest direction.","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":22,"locationName":"West Chester, Ohio","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:46770"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"St Lucie","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On my way home, back from work. i was heading west on becker rd and made a right going north on darwing blvd. on this street i noticed this oval shaped orange light. at first i didn't think it was anything other than a far away street orange light. then it blinked 2 times, that caught my attention. at that moment it started moving to my right(east) very slowly, then it stopped for about 3 seconds and started going up slowly. 15 seconds later they light was off or it disappeared. i would like to mention that the skies were very clear and we had a full moon. the light re appeared not far away from where last seen and it kept going up, when it finish going up, it started heading east. i notice it had  like an orange tail of light almost like a rocket. no blinking lights seen anywhere like any airplane or helicopter would have, but  just a big bright orange light. i got out of my vehicle and did not hear any sound at all. this light went from my 10 o'clock to my 4 o'clock. light just disappeared at that time.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":30208,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.4936111,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07162011-0011","longitude":-80.3422222,"occurred":1310808000000,"potentialRelations":[30194],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Egg,   Oval,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1310821395000,"summary":"Orange light","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"St Lucie, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:46771"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82758,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1830}
