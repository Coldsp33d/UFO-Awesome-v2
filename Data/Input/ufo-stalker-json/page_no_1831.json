stepping outside (front door of house)to check something on my car and immediately saw a large orange light in the black sky. i was stunned! there was a normal star to the left of it about the same height. but this thing was at least 3 times bigger than the star. it was an orange light, and to its far left side we could see a \"smoke trail\" lingering from the bottom of the ground all the way up to its height. yet this trail was not under the orange light itself, so i don't know if this orange light caused it at some point or not. \r\n\r\ni called my daughter to see this for herself, she ran out, we then both watched it together. initially it was moving toward our house, but when my daughter joined it stopped moving and hovered silently at one spot. we could see 2 or three tiny little orange lights beneath it pulsating, then this also stopped.\r\n\r\nwe were commenting on the little lights, and while commenting and watching, we could clearly see how the large orange light began shrinking gradually, now taking on the size of the star to its left, and it continued shrinking, now becoming smaller than the star to its left, until it shrank to a single tiny point, whereof it disappeared from view, on the spot! we were commenting, \"it must be cloaking itself.\"\r\n\r\ni had the feeling it knew it was being observed, and that it then cloaked itself because it did not want to be seen. \r\n\r\ni did not feel any physical change happening in my body. we were not afraid, just utterly stunned at this blunt display of this vehicle's capabilities! \r\n\r\nwe were also commenting on this technology: silently moving, displaying little lights behind/below it, stops moving and hovers, gradually shrinking, then become a tiny light and finally out of view... this is not a conventional craft, obviously.\r\n\r\ni don't believe this craft has left because it wasn't traveling when it disappeared itself.\r\n\r\nthe entire episode lasted about 2-3 minutes, or so, maybe a minute more.\r\n\r\nstunning!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":30207,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.6668074,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07162011-0010","longitude":-81.5061535,"occurred":1310809560000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like,

with the traffic, this object appeared ahead of me, that had red lights at each corner and was banking to to the right at about a 45 degree angle over the horizon, which appeared to about or less than a few miles(maybe 5). my thought process was, that appeared to be the kind of ufo that seen in paris in 2008, though that one had green lights, it appeared the same shape and design. zipping down the highway and getting on to i-75 south, i visually lost it for a moment, because of trees, then out ahead of me, and there were a few cars nearby, i pointed at it, like i was looking at it from behind it suddenly turned to the right and all the red lights at the corners were visible with a white light in the center and it leveled off and banked to the left and i saw a thin band of red lights that appeared to encase the outline around the vehicle and it appeared to be going away from my line of sight, even though i was traveling at almost 80 mph, ( i was excited), this is really cool. i thought for a moment, isn't anyone else seeing what i'm seeing?As i gained control of my destination down 75 south, i caught sight of it again, and it was banking to to the right and leveled off again. the full moon was just appearing in the east out of a cloud bank and with a glimsp of the vehicle it shot to the east, like a bottle rocket , leaving a tail of light. as i exited south 75 at exit 38, a traingular object was just hovering in the sky, near this exit, that had a white light that appeared to be surveying the area and it appeared there for almost a minute. whence i came off the highway, down the ramp and stopped at the ramp, with a few cars/trucks ahead of me at the red light, i got out of my car and looked around, nothing. rats.But what i saw was, not of this world, not man made and i hope we can invite to live with us, because i believe we are not alone. \"the truth is out there\" and i would love to meet someone from another world, that my god created.","distance":"Over One

had been flying quite fast and didn/t slow down on the descent. also, it's front didn't tip down. it stayed horizontal. at first i thought it might be headed for the airport, but it didn���t go that far south and was farther west. after looking at a map it might have landed in sentinel peak area.It looked very much like the craft i saw in this area back in may, which i also reported.My reaction was \"it is broad daylight and there are a ton of cars around, is anyone else seeing this? it looks like the craft i saw before- but if it were a ufo wouldn't that be odd? there must be an

images.\r\n\r\n i have used a photo processing application to rule out anything close, as under magnification the image pixels are quite distinct and clean.. not something close and blurred. looking closely you can see the angle of the shadow of the oncoming vehicle matches that of the \"disc\".\r\n\r\nas for its actions and motions...  i never saw it.\r\n\r\nfeelings.. none, i was taking a route pic.\r\n\r\ni never saw the object to lose sight of it.\r\n\r\n so.. there it is. i will attach a copy of the image and you can tear it apart any way you would like.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1
