50 ft up. i looked around for someone with one of those remote controllers, for i thought it was some sort of remote controlled toy. there was nobody with one & this craft was a little too big for

diameter and just sort of hung over the road it made no sound at all. as we approached it rose up into the air only about 50 feet or so. as we passed under it the inside the car turned blue and my girlfriend freaked out on me....I slowed to 10 mph...As we moved the object stayed right over us...The whoile inside of the car lite up....I rolled down my window and looked up...It was round and had bright lights...The lights seemed to change some how...As i calmed down my girlfriend and assured her we were not going to die, i got her to grab my camera and snap off a few shots of the object. as i continued to drive the cars behind me all stopped...The object stayed right on top of us as we drove along. when i turned it turned...I noticed that the on coming traffic did not move either...Traffic was light at this time....After about 15 minutes the object shot straight up at a high speed and then just went off at an angle into the darkness......We drove back to cary and went to see my girlfriends next door neighbor....He had worked on project blue book...So he seemed like the right person to talk to...He wanted my film bad...But i would not give it to him.....He left the room and i could hear him make a few calls....We left....I took the film to the drug store for processing...When i got it back...All the negatives of the object where gone...The pictures i took before the encounter and after all came out fine, but i was short by 5 negatives..Not even blanks were in the pack...I went home after leaving my girlfriends and told my dad about it...He thought i was nuts....But i he was in the air force too...And i am not sure...But i do think he worked on blue book also....I did not tell him about the pictures i had taken.....A few years ago around 2000, when i was home for a visit, my dad made a point of telling me that my experience had been report a few weeks ago in the local paper as a squad of helicopters...Now mind you...This is some 18 years after the actual event.....I know that at the time there was a small article in the paper...And some 300 people reported the sighting.....Well...That is my story...I dont tell people about

fireworks we were walking to the parking lot\r\nat end of garfield ave and burger st. as i was approaching my jeep i was\r\nimmediately struck by something bright red and traveling almost over our heads. my first thought was: \"more fireworks\" but there was no sound.\r\ntypical of a ufo and those i'd seen over orwigsburg on 9/11 2003. my camcorder did not reveal any details as it was hard to keep steady \r\nwithout a tripod. freeze frame reveals an oval bright object. i watched it\r\nfor about 10 minutes and noticed that it was not heading towards the horizon as aircraft do but like a rocket would do it heading for outer space. let me be specific! this object accelerated from 1 mile up to\r\ninvisible in 20 seconds. \r\n\r\n        it shot right out of our atmosphere. i have to laugh at this one. was it the fireworks that attracted these ships? were they also watching them from a distance. whatever direction this came from i did not see it walking back (probably cause i just wasn't looking up). judging from the direction it came when i saw it it was coming in the direction of feeser's\r\ncement company.Also amusing is the fact that there were groups of people standing in the parking lot by their cars had no idea this thing was\r\neven there till i yelled \"hey thats a ufo up there\". then they looked up and because it made no noise two of them said: \"what is that thing\"\r\nfrom time to time i have seen objects that you would swear were ufo's but\r\nafter waiting for the object to get close or using binoculars you clearly\r\nsee blinking navigation lights and a sound. this object had a red glow and no navigation lights or sound. the only thing we have that goes straight up and out of the atmosphere are rockets. the behaviour of this\r\nobject does not qualify as anything manmade and i have little reason to think that it is secret government technology either.

doing some things on the computer and went to go to bed. coming out of the room where the computer was located, you crossed a small area before going into the bedroom. it was there that i felt a little something in the air (best way to describe it) i was very familiar with this feeling and kinda knew what the deal was...\r\n\r\ni felt threatened... i knew something was up, or something was outside, so i walked out to the kitchen area and kinda talked to myself or it - saying \"alright - you better bounce.... i'm not going for this tonight.\" \r\n\r\ni felt like there was something outside waiting for me to go to sleep. \r\n\r\nso i was getting tired and thought it was just the feeling. so i go to bed, my wife had a little night light on for the baby just in case she had to get up. \r\n\r\nnow my son really didn't wake us up much, which was good.\r\n\r\n\r\nso i'm laying there - i look at the clock - it was 11:50ish - i start the fade to sleep and the whole room seems to dim a bit. i could remember feeling a paralyzed feeling over my body. and was scared straight. \r\n\r\ni felt as though someone walked in from behind me through the door. so i'm laying there and felt this feeling - i moved my fingers a little and was surprised that i could move them - i've been paralyzed in bed before, but it noticed i could move my arm a little. i reach behind my back slowly and grabbed what felt like a skinny, long-fingered, child's hand.\r\n\r\nno joke!\r\n\r\nas soon as i grabbed it - it started pulling away like a child would - i let go of that hand so fast!!!

i was on my way home from a friends house when i spotted something odd. i was driving east down 40th avenue and i spotted a light. this was like no man made light, it did not give off any sort of glow and was very bright. as i turned onto 240th street heading north i tried to get a better look at the light, but i kept losing it in the trees and houses to the east. but then came a clearing to the east where i could truly see this was not man made. i made a right onto robertson crescent heading east again. that's when it really hit me, this..Thing..Was much closer than i expected. as i neared it, i could really see all the lights that were a part of this object. i'm not saying this object was a triangle shape, but the lights on the bottom made it look like a triangle. a very bright light on each corner. as i neared even closer i realized it wasn't moving what-so-ever and was completely silent. this was no helicopter. i was about to go directly underneath the object. when i did, i decreased my speed to a crawl, looked up and seen a flurry in the middle of the craft. a flurry which consisted of about 6 very bright different colored lights. as i passed it, and came to the stop sign at robertson & 248th street, i looked behind me and did not see it. i thought it was gone and would not see it again. as i headed north up 248th, i looked to the west and seen it about a kilometer away moving decently slow heading north. i couldn't take my eyes off of it. then it really spooked me, it started making very erratic movements. dashing from spot to spot in the sky. as i continued up 248th, i tried looking, but there was way too many trees to see. i stopped looking and headed home. i was in too much shock to go on. it was hard even to think about it. it was unlike anything i have ever experienced. the experience gave me a very gross feeling, like nothing matters in this world. we know nothing of the world out there. our planet is a very small peice of the

ground near an outdoor festival just outside of veneta, oregon. having watched the firedancing events of the evening up until their very end at approximately 2am, i decided to take a walk through the dark, quiet camp ground before heading to bed. many other campers were still awake at this time, partying and such, and i wandered for quite some time, mostly in nearly pitch black conditions. as i crossed an open field i spotted a small cluster of people ahead of me in the dark, all of whom appeared to be huddled together and pointing to something in the sky through a gap in the trees. as i came closer i could hear them asking one another, \"what is that?\" \"is it a meteor?\" \"haha, is it a sign of the end times?\" one of them beckoned to me, saying \"come see the ufo!\" as i approached i was able to see through the same gap in the treeline which they were looking through. the sky was uniformly overcast, with thick grey clouds hanging low and glowing a dim amber colour due to night time light pollution from the nearby city of eugene. hanging there beneath the clouds, at least forty-five degrees above the horizon, brighter by far than any of the faint air traffic which i could just barely see near the horizon, was a single brilliant point of amber-coloured light. it made no sound, had none of the external flashing lights required by the faa, and was most certainly not a star, as no others were visible anywhere in the observable sky at the time. though it did eventually move, it appeared to be still for the majority of the time. it appeared, at its maximum luminosity, to be about the size of a penny held at arm's length. having observed meteors, fireballs and other atmospheric events as an amateur astronomer, as well as many different types of aircraft and flares as an avid aviation, maritime and military enthusiast, i could say with certainty at the time that what we saw did not fit within the normal frame of reference concerning what \"should\" be in the sky. its brightness was a shocking contrast to the dim, cloudy sky surrounding it. as we stood together observing and contemplating what the strange, floating light source could be, it began to drift very subtly from north to south, first dimming slightly, then glowing even brighter than before. this was vociferously observed by those of us on the ground. about sixty seconds or so later, it dimmed once more, glowed again, and them shrank into a single dim white point which quickly vanished, leaving only a smooth and unblemished cloud cover behind. shocked, we continued to look for the object for a few more minutes, but it seemed that the light wasn't going to come back, and some of the other observers were quite shaken by the event. having never seen a ufo before and suddenly being confronted with the idea that extra-terrestrials might be real, several of them revealed through conversation feelings of deep vulnerability and fear. others seemed intrigued. having seen unexplainable things in the sky before, i felt excited and somewhat intrigued by the reactions of my newfound companions. the punchline: i had a camera phone in my pocket and plenty of time to use it, but between my excitement and my strong desire to observe and remember every relevant detail i possibly could, i totally forgot it was there, and did not snap a photo/video of the object.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

as i was going it was moving it was low from my viewpoint,and on my way we were getting closer to each other.\r\nat one point i was maybe 4 miles from it and thought it was a single light\r\nbut getting closer i could see two lights side by side and by then i had driven probably 11 or 12 miles and was going around a bend in the road and there was a hill on my left,and there were trees blocking my view,i knew i was going to turn left at the next turn coming up,but as i was getting ready to turn i started to scan the sky and looked out and up,and by this time it was about dusk dark,and seen something that had ab absolutely no busyness being there,against the sky i could see all it's features,it was enormous \r\nand had to have weighed a million tons triangular in shape,it was as high off the ground as it was long,i guess it was about 375 to 400 feet long by about\r\n275 to 350 wide.\r\nit had what i would say was a portal in the middle,surrounded by clear domes\r\nseven or eight and looked like they were about nine or ten inches thick,the \r\nportal was big enough to accept a 1600 sq,ft,brick rancher style house with a carport on the end.\r\ni knocked the three speed on the tree,out of gear and locked on the emergency brake,and was on the ground on my feet in a second or two,it was parallel to\r\nmy truck and going in the opposite direction about one hundred and twenty or one hundred and fifty feet from my side.\r\ni tried to pop my ears,by opening my mouth,like going over a mountain or like on a plane to try to hear any sound and all i could hear was the noise from my truck ,muffled exhaust,fan,and a loose hydrolic lifter.\r\nfrom the 1971 ford,300 straight six cylinder motor,pretty quite.\r\neven went ten or twelve feet away from the truck,to better distinguish the\r\nthe noise level,no difference.\r\nthis thing owned the sky, it went about as fast as a bicycle,and didn't seem to care if anyone saw it or not,i thought it was the end of the world.\r\nmy brain was racing,what about my family,was this the only one,were there more,what should i do,it was getting away,i took off after it,i wanted for any one else to see it,blowing my horn and flashing my lights.And it was gone.\r\nnext thing i know,i am sliding into my driveway.\r\nran into the house,i was babbling like a fool,i was going to show my wife.\r\nyeah right,there was nothing to show her except the heat gauge on my truck\r\nand some long weeds hanging from my back bumper.\r\nit's been a long while back,but everything looks different from then till now,and i know i will never be the same.\r\n ","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

trick-or-treating. clear sky.\r\n\r\nhappened to look up and noticed venus high in the sky. then something else caught my eye. it was a pill-capsule shaped, luminous object that was moving from south to north. estimated altitude about 2000-3000 feet (best guess). the ufo was \"staggering\" across the sky as it traveled. it was traveling at maybe about 100 knots (estimated, based on the rates of travel of some light aircraft i also observed in the viscinity), and it was changing course as it moved. it did not appear to change altitude, only course. the changes appeared random, and did not seem to involve changes to airspeed. the best way i can think of to describe its motion was that it was flying as if it was drunk -- following the same general path, but with many course corrections. i was able to track it for a few minutes before it passed beyond the horizon. one other witness also saw it, and in fact asked, seriously, \"are you watching the ufo?\"\r\n\r\nat first, i thought it might have been something else until i realized that it looked exactly like one i had previously reported to mufon a couple years ago that i saw in august of 1976 over henry country, georgia. it was reported via this same form (although the other form had more options), under the same name and email, so it should be in the records, although i do not know the case number.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
