called for me to come outside to observe some strange phenomina located just a few degrees east of the 3/4 wanning moon. it appeared to be some sort of chemtrail or other bizzare cloud formation coming from the south and trailing to the north.\r\n\r\ni told them my thoughts on this being that i have studied astronomy and have made a hobby of telescope observations for some 25 yrs. i also have 20 yrs in law enforcement and security training. we watched the hot summer skies for a few moments and then we all returned inside, as i was heading in, my wife said \"don't forget the trash\", as all wifes are good at... \r\n\r\nat approximately 10:45 p.M. i had gathered the trash and was heading out the front door which faces due east. as i approached the trash can by the road i noticed a bright reddish light coming through the trees accross the street. i first thought that it was various electric pole lights shining through. i noticed that it seemed to be moving at a fairly slow speed, that of a helicopter, we live close to the hospital and always see and hear lifeflight choppers coming in to the hospital. this was different, it had no sound which i was listening for and was a fireball, twice the size of antares the red star of scorpio. i would estimate 25 feet in diameter. i paused a few seconds waiting as usual to see it desentigrate, it continued on its flight path from beyound the tree in the east heading at a slow pace toward the northwest. i then realized this was something unusual, dropped the trash and ran in the house, i told my son who was at the computer to get his mom (she was in bed)and hurry to come outside. i then returned after 5 seconds or so expecting the object to be gone, i noticed that it was still heading in the same direction only slightly dimmer. my wife and son and i watched as it vanished into the northwest horizon, my wife and i were saying that it appeared to be a plane or some object on fire? but \"no sound\"? my wife then said this has been a weird night which my son and i agreed. we then observed in the same location to the east another fireball object from behind the same tree heading in the same flight path 'no sound;. as i was explaining to my wife the events, we all three noticed another silvery object shoot by from east to west at the blink of an eye. my wife and i have spent numoruos nights observing the leoniods meteor showers and others throughout the years and have never seen these events.\r\nwe all felt excited and in ahh to have witnessed this event.\r\nthese events are as accurate and honost to the best of my

and have a base near by and this light did not seem to be any plane i had been familiar with.  it was going faster than i thought it should.  it was really high so i was also trying to tell if i could see if this yellowish white orb light was pulsating like a strobe light or if there was a red and green light near for the wings.  there was not.  then the light vanished completely and suddenly while i was watching it.  now there was no clouds in the sky and i had visible stars in the vicinity of the disappearance.  for reference i was staring at the northeast sky.\r\n\r\nthen out of the corner of my eye to the east i see a flash and turn to see if i can see it clearly but it is not there.  within 10 seconds a very bright light in a sort of orb shape lights up it jumps a short distance very fast and disappears.  this orb like light is way bigger than the one i first saw but it is also lower in the sky.  it also appears white whereas the first looked dim and yellow.\r\n\r\ni stayed

the evening sky, to the western horizon, presumed them to be helicopters, as we've seen a helicopter convoy through that area once before. a few miles further on i had been watching this current convoy as far as we could before the terrain blocked them out.  as we got off at the first lasalle exit, heading north, i looked to the skies towards where the convoy would have been, and then an odd lighted object; higher, slightly closer, i had my camera, and took a picture (picture 1) before loosing sight of it as we descended into the valley.  did not see it anytime beyond that point in the daylight.\r\n\r\na couple hours later we are heading south on i39 heading home, as we approached the tonica exit, i looked to the west and the activity was still in progress, i took a photo of the object, even closer at this point, still a couple miles out.  the \"helicopters\" if that is what they were, were much closer, half mile or less, and seemed to be lifting off from the fields. surrounding the object in the sky, the object had a large whitish rhomboid light, (looks rather greenish on film), with depth to it, like a large chamber, and a red light to either side and slightly behind, the whitish light. it was slowely weaving back and forth so sometimes both red lights were visible other times only the one.  i took a few pictures, would check the picture and delete it if it was too blurry i only had a few spots left on the sd card.  i got one good nighttime close up (picture 2), and then its lights went out.  \r\n\r\ni had my wife stop the car, and i got out; on the interstate to take a couple of pictures of the lifting off \"helicopters\".  i took two more pictures, a still photo (not sent), and a 30 second time lapse of the area (picture 3), i set the camera on the hood of the car, it was still running, so the picture is a bit jumpy but not as jumpy as it would seem please note by looking at the centered ascending lights, then note how much smoother the plane trajectory is in the upper left of the timelapse, this compared to the wild movements of the closer two lights. \r\n\r\nonce they got to their altitude they moved off in near opposite directions. the other \"helicopters\" are further away to the far right of the picture and did not get on film, they were further away and behind the main object. note i never really heard the helicopters, it was still  busy on the interstate, only 7pm or a slight bit later, but they were close enough i should have heard something, but i didn't. they moved off for awhile,the light intensities remained constant, then as one, they shut off their lights as well.  no strobes on any of the \"helicopters\" anywhere, anytime.\r\n\r\nthe whitish light with the red light which has gone black in picture 3, would have been to the right (north) of the near objects lower than the gray horizontal squiggly (center right), and an entire squiggly length behind the horizontal sqiggly.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

v formation east to west in the northern sky.  were very close together, moving too fast for an airplane (appeared to be much higher than a plane would be anyway) and too fast for satellites.  i only saw it for 4, maybe 5 seconds.  as it disappeared, i saw what i first thought was a shooting star going straight down from where the object was, almost a 90 degree angle from the direction the objects were going.  my attention shifted to that single object as it fell and then disappeared behind the neighbors house.  when it did, i tried to find the other objects and they were gone.  after thinking about it, i realized that there was no trail on the shooting star, just a bright dot of light falling.\r\n\r\nthe first four objects weren't very bright, maybe \"medium brightness star-like\".  the object that fell downward was much brighter, more \"planet-like\".  at first thought i believed i was looking at an owl (bright moon out tonight and i thought it was simply reflecting on a bird).  but after a second i realized it wasn't a bird and that's when i realized it was much higher than a plane would be, almost like they were in orbit.  \r\n\r\ni stayed in the pool another 10 minutes to see the objects would appear again.  after that, i really got nervous/scared over what i had seen and went inside.  it's 2:00am and i'm wide awake.  i don't think i'm going to get much sleep tonight.  i've always hoped to see something like this, but now that i have, i'm a little freaked

went about his usual scan of the sky around the airfield past the stand of trees at the building's rear, starting with the eastern sky, picking out the various blinking traffic lights along the horizon's edge, moving up to the prominent planet further up in the eastern sky, and then turning west where the airfield's beacon sweeps the sky.  it was noticed then, that an object was moving with a north to south trajectory.  the object had a brightness similar to the planet seen earlier, but its movement was much more noticeable than a planet's would be.  at first, it appeared to be a low-flying plane with its landing lights on--perhaps just taking off or preparing to land at the nearby local airport.  however, the object did not have the usual red and green running lights illuminated.  after a brief moment (2 to 3 seconds) of observation, the object's white light increased in luminosity, increasing over a period of approximately 5 seconds, approaching the brightness of a full moon.  it seemed similar to what might occur if a plane, as mentioned above with its landing lights were on, changed trajectory towards the observer.  the object remained bright for a brief moment (about a second) then quickly faded to being dimmer than the background stars.  at that time, the observer lost track of the object.  during this event, the velocity and trajectory of the object both appeared constant, and no engine noise could be heard.  it should be noted that the observer has witnessed small planes land at the nearby airfield during the night, and engine noise was always noticeable as the plane neared or departed.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

p.M. on july 2nd, my family and i witnessed 3 ufo���s.  we were sitting on my outside deck visiting when 2 bright orange lights rose up above the tree line.  we were looking toward the se.  without knowing for sure the objects sizes i am not sure of the taking off point or altitude at hover.  my best guess is that they were 3 meters or so in circumference which from my estimation could have placed them in the lake.  any way they rose to maybe 500 to a 1000 feet  and hovered.  then one of the object took a path away from us toward the se while the other took a nw path over our heads.  the object was very visible while it went over head and what had appeared only bright and orange took more of a stubby cylinder shape with rotating red lights on the bottom of it.  as it continued its path we were briefly obstructed by a tree but then again spotted the object on its same coarse.  the object then accelerated out of sight in less than a second.  this entire encounter lasted about 3 minutes.  we had just started talking about how we did not believe what we just saw when another single object rose up from the same point as the other two objects and took the same path to the nw over our heads again.  i have always been curious about the unknown but now i am a believer.  what my family and i witnessed was not from this world.  we did manage to catch it on video but it is not very good other than just before the end of the video the digital recorder on the phone caught a very strange sequence of sounds we did not hear at the time.  i would love some more information on any

monitoring an object in the northern sky. at 22:27 pst. my family and i were monitoring the actions of another object in the northern sky when i just happened to turn around and notice another white object suddenly appear and move across the sky from west to east. the object was high in altitude not orbital altitude perhaps 60 to 100 thousand feet. too high to be a plane and moving to fast. i thought perhaps it was the space station but it still didn't appear to be bright enough for that yet moving about the same speed. it was easy to determine the object was not an asteroid or space junk as it had no trail and no debris and this object was viewable across the sky far longer than something burning in the atmosphere. i quickly called the attention of my family and pointed out the object, marked the time and duration. we watched the object move across the sky then suddenly disappear. after the event transpired (20 seconds later), we returned to monitor our first object. i instructed my daughters to continue to watch the first object as i then proceeded to my laptop to see what the location of the space station was (south pacific-western chile), i then checked a couple websites that monitor most if not all satellites (even govt.) nothing along that trajectory reported. besides i thought it was too low in altitude to be a satellite and to bright.
