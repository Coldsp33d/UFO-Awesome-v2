the northern sky (i'm not certain what drew my attention) and then immediately i observed three bright amber orbs in an isosceles triangle formation.  only sky was apparent between the orbs.  the triangle/orbs slowly, silently moved roughly w-nw in the direction of us 41.  the object(s) were north of my location at an indeterminate distance in the sky, although the size of the triangle form suggested a relatively low-flying orbs or very massive if a high-flying 'solid' craft; i could not discern which.  the triangle shape seemed tilted, perhaps 15-20 degrees, with the northern-most orb lower. i called to my wife and sister-in-law, whom were in the house, to come out and see. we observed the orbs for a brief period, perhaps no more than thirty seconds, while the orbs gradually (perhaps 6-7 seconds per orb), individually dimmed and seemed to \"go out\" beginning with the most distant, followed by the \"front\", narrow end, and finally the 'closest'.  the orbs did not stop their slow w-nw movement during this period.  i walked a short distance down the alley behind the house because a large tree obscured my vision of the sky within which the object(s) would have moved if they had followed the same trajectory after going out; however, i saw only stars.  there was no sign of the object(s), no contrails, smoke, vapor, clouds, only stars.  despite the brevity of this sighting, these orbs did not appear to be conventional aircraft, stars, planets, flares, fireworks or distant lights from structures.  there was smoke, no differential intensity of light besides the controlled dimming effect, and they did not seem to lose altitude or distortion of overall shape.  the orbs moved in conjunction as if attached to a solid triangular shape or as if flying in a steady formation.  i had no unusual sensations or thoughts during the sighting, only curiosity and then astonishment.  i did not have time to grab my camera or cell phone to get a picture.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:45","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

still quiet clear night in 2008. i was looking around and noticed a small round bright light it seemed high in sky moving in a circular movment not fast .My house roof blocked my view.I kept seeing it coming around.It kept same speed and it was moving in a circle but i could only see a bit of circle as house blocked view. i moved around to side of house.I now seen at least two thirds of the circle shape it was moving in and it was not one light.But 4 all same size all bright white moving in a big circle they never changed colour or flashed or strobed and they kept moving around in a big circle moving anti-clockwise they kept equally apart like points on a compass n.E.S.W. i watched for a few minutes and tried to video them on my phone but did not work.I phoned my brother to tell him what was going on. after another 10 minutes or so the lights started to speed up still in same circle then they stopped and almost immediatly they all flew fast in to middle of circle and a very bright explosion like flash as they collided. pure white no colour. and no noise ,they never made any noise. and then the 4 lights were together and they shot straight out to origanal positions and went fast around again like before and again all flew in to centre and bright white flash and 4 lights together before moving out to circle again this reapeted about 8 or 10 times and then nothing at all in sky? it was between 30 and 40 minutes in total.The lights were about size of my thumb nail.I have no idea what height in sky i felt they were quiet high up 500 feet at a guess!What it was not is a helicopter or a plane i see them all the time and hear them. airport is a few miles away.Or chinese lanterns see a lot around here moving on the wind.I went out the next night and was amazed it was same again for about same length of time again between 8pm and 9pm another still quiet clear night and a man and women and a dog walked past my garden fence talking and i could not see them for fence but they seen lights and were bemused as i was . have looked every night but nothing! \r\n \r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

seminole pratt and whitney rd. it was probably anywhere between 8-9:30pm, i was riding in the passenger seat watching the fireworks when i noticed 2 large glowing orbs floating in the sky out my side of the window. unlike the fireworks going off around these were large, did not \"burn out\" like a spark from the fireworks, did not descend, and i couldn't take my eyes off them. i've lived in the area for about 20yrs since i was a toddler and never seen anything like this before. \r\n\r\nthey seemed to fly up and from side to side, they changed shape, dimmed and brightened between colors of orange, yellow and red. i told my husband and he got scared over the way i was reacting. we reached my parents house and i got out of the car and continued to watch them. after about a minute or two they seemed to go higher in the sky, they both went brighter at different times, they finally crisscrossed in the sky, then one seemed to shrink and vanish followed by the other. there didn't seem to be any sounds being made by them. \r\n\r\ni was shocked and amazed. i wanted to grab my cell phone to get a picture but i was afraid to take my eyes of them they were so amazing. i felt so excited to see them. i've never seen a ufo or anything like this before.\r\n\r\nwe do see a lot of air traffic in our area. palm beach international airport is nearby, so is a private country club of private aircraft owners called aero club. we see helicopters pretty frequently from the sheriffs office or wildlife people or the occasional private helicopter. we live in a rural area so at night you see the sky pretty clearly along with air traffic. \r\n\r\nfrom just living out here nearly all my life i can tell you this was no typical airplane or a helicopter. i don't know what it was but i know it shocked me. \r\n\r\ni was a little afraid to report it but it was so big i figured others must have saw it as well. i thought to report it to mufon after i did a youtube search for \"4th of july ufos\" and found that other people in other states say they saw similar ufos in the sky.

the sky, and ever since i saw something bizarre last year, i don't take my eyes off the sky. when we arrived home, i commented on the lack of light pollution in the area, and said i would come back outside after putting my things down. there was nothing in the sky at this time. a few minutes later, i walked outside, into the drive way, and looked around. i saw two red lights blinking in a one-two one-two pattern. i assumed that it was a tower of some sort. then they moved to the right, and the flashing began to happen simultaneously. i then text-messaged my friend that rode with me to come outside. she came out and watched the lights with me and it began to become apparent that this was a rather unusual light show. the lights began to flash a third light, randomly it seems, slightly lower than the other two. the patterns of the blinks began to vary, without pattern. sometimes simultaneous, sometimes with a second of no lights in between, sometimes one right after the other, sometimes with a third. at this point, after discussing the possible options of what it could be, we decided to walk closer. we walked maybe 4 houses down, only to become frightened and turned around. it looked like it was coming closer. as i turned to head towards the house, i saw a white orb flash brightly in the sky opposite the object, and when i turned back, a faint beam of light flashed beside the red. i tried to take video but the lights would not show up on the phone, so it's a recording of my friend and myself muttering profanities as we realized this was not manmade. i ran inside to get binoculars and looked through them. it was a very dark and solid object, but i couldn't make out more than that. i watched for over a half hour and now i must be trying to sleep. i

there were none in sight to compare it to.  my first thought was that we were catching a glimpse of atlantis.  it seemed to be travelling about as fast as your typical satellite, maybe a little faster.  we watched it for a minute or two and it got dimmer and dimmer to eventually match the dimness of the stars around it or dimmer.  it was lost in clouds eventually.  it was heading northward at about 11 o'clock from the horizon.  there is a possibility that it was getting dimmer because it was getting father away, because it also seemed smaller in size. we get a lot of air traffic around here, and i know it wasn't a plane or a helicopter.
