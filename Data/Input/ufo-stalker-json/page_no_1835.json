not to mention the lighting would have to be timed perfectly.\r\nwe speculated it could be a hobbyist project or one of those toy ufos.  it flew across the entire skyline well out of the range of radio control. and the brilliance of the light looks like it would be quite out of the range of most consumers' budgets.  i really do wish more people could have seen how bright it was. \r\n\r\nthose are really the two things about this sighting i cannot wrap my mind around. how it was just able to stand still then drift slowly without making any noise.  and how it was able to project such a bright light.\r\n\r\nnormally with lights, the brightest part is usually visible when its directly pointed at you. this thing seemed to have that effect despite what angle it was at while flying over.  as if the light was focused on all points instead of one.\r\n\r\nafter it flew away out of view (continuing its consistent light behavior) i stood outside for the rest of the night wondering what it was, what it wasnt, and if anyone cared.  i called the police when it first showed up because when it was stationary and pulsating, i didnt know if it was something about to hit the ground or what.  \r\ni am not a fan of false reporting but i cant help but wonder if i reported something else more severe to get them out there quicker would have been overlooked once they saw what we saw.  i would have been willing to risk it and will risk it in the future just to get a more authoritative witness to this. they were kinda dismissive and skeptical as i would have been 2 hours prior. \r\n\r\ni wish i could show you more and explain more. but really like most others, you had to be there.   i will promise everyone this though,  i will start investing my money in more night-friendly camera equipment.  i dont care how much it takes.  this changed my life and my whole view on things. \r\n\r\nthank you for your time.  the videos i include are directly from the camera's memory card.  no tampering has been done in anyway.

but neither fireworks nor landing lights could perform the maneuvers of the objects.  at no time did i hear any type of noise coming from the objects, and there was no trailing tail of light as they moved.  also, the objects appeared to move in a straight line when they moved, then stop for a moment, and then move in a straight line in a different direction.  the exception was when they would occasionally spin around one another, but even while spinning they appeared to move in a straight line.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":30049,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.2502938,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07072011-0019","longitude":-111.6269793,"occurred":1309845900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1310094232000,"summary":"2 round orbs equal distance apart moving together in all different directions.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Phoenix","timeZoneName":"America/Phoenix","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2,"locationName":"Queen Creek, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:48160"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Eugene","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Late in the evening during the annual 4th of july holiday fireworks i was standing in my back yard when i noticed a bright orange ball moving through the night sky.  this caught my attention immediately because it matched another ufo sighting i had just a few months earlier.\r\n\r\nthe object moved quickly and silently.  it appeared beyond the diminishing fireworks going off around the city and had two noticeable features - the orange glow grew and decreased in brightness in a way that made it appear to flicker, and its movement was non-ballistic in that it seemed to jerk forward sometimes pausing and then continuing on.  \r\n\r\nthe night sky was perfectly clear.  it was easy to discern that the orange ball had no red or green conventional aircraft lights.  also, the bright orange light which at first seemed to be coming toward my general location was equally bright when it gradually turned to the south and eventually first faded and then vanished from sight as it appeared to move south roughly following the path of interstate 5.\r\n\r\nthe luminosity of the orange glow was far brighter than any star or planet visible at that hour.  the magnitude of the object was perhaps 7 to 10 times larger than any other object in the night sky.\r\n\r\nseveral minutes after the object had disappeared, my girl friend came outside and i mentioned the sighting to her just minutes before another bright orange ufo appeared to the east of eugene.  we watched it approach from the east and then like the fist object, it eventually turned to the south with a similar jerky and sometimes brighter, sometimes dimmer appearance.\r\n\r\nover the next 30 minutes we watched as another three individual orange ufos appeared in the east and made their way one by one curving eventually to the south and fading strangely from sight.\r\n\r\ni mentioned that late in 2010 i had seen another orange ufo from my back yard in eugene.  that sighting lasted only about 30 seconds but the object appeared to be directly over head and at much closer range.  i was able to get a good look at the orange ball through moderately powerful binoculars which i had been using to star gaze with.  it was moving from north to south silently and appeared to be about as large as the full moon, so it was quite large.  i could not determine the altitude, but it seemed to be several hundred yards above me.  my magnified look at the orange ball revealed it seemed to be a translucent glowing ball which may have contained an object inside.  the surface of the orange sphere seemed to flow with a liquid consistency and was very dynamic.  i speculated it might be some kind of high energy plasma field surrounding another object.  the object disappeared abruptly by fading from sight.\r\n\r\ni was in the u.S. air force and am accustomed to working flight lines in many parts of the world observing all kinds of sophisticated air craft at night, but seeing these orange ufos from different perspectives, flight paths, dates, times, and with another witness convinced me that i should report the event.  i did not notice other reports about the july 4th sighting in the media, but at that late hour and after so many other holiday fireworks, this did not surprise me.

works come out nicer and clear, but washed out the ufos) and instead took them at 800 (which allowed the ufos to show up, we did not see them directly, with our naked eyes). we think that they could not be remnants of the fireworks, or some kind of military aircraft etc and this is because of the way they behaved. one time they hovered (no movement) for over 30 seconds) they also seemed to appear and disappear in and out of some kind of vortex/hole/opening, which can be faintly seen on the photos. the reason we know they did not move but hovered at some point is due to no change between photos

(i usually have the blinds in my bedroom about 1/3 of the way down.) i forgot until saturday evening when i turned on my television and my tivo that i had recorded during the exact time of the event. because i'm very sure that it was the second burst of static that caused me to turn off the television, i can time the start of the event (using the tivo clock) at precisely 10:42.\r\n\r\nin retrospect, the static on the television is very interesting. our cable service is very reliable here and is not affected by the weather at all. neither my sister nor i can ever recall seeing bursts of static since we've had this service (more than four years) and they are dramatic. both are preserved on my tivo.\r\n\r\n\r\nwitness two: on the evening of friday, 5/21/04 i was in my bedroom reading. a very powerful thunderstorm had been right over our building for approximately ten minutes when my sister came into my room and asked me to come look at something. i glanced at the clock and noted that it was 10:46pm. she asked me to look out the window in her bedroom at the sky over rock creek park. i saw at different times 1, 2, 3, or 4 blurry, yet distinct white lights moving counterclockwise in an apparent oval shaped orbit. the cloud cover was heavy, but my perception was that the lights were within or circling one particular cloud. the lightning was intense and lit up the entire sky several times as we watched the lights. the lights moved constantly in an erratic, jerky fashion, seemingly unaffected by the lightning. their movement appeared ghostly to me and i thought of casper cartoons. their shape is harder to describe. narrow at the bottom and wider at the top is close ��� almost torch-like with indistinct edges. it was my impression that their blurry, undefined appearance was due to the cloud cover and extremely hazy skies. after about ten minutes the intensity of brightness dimmed and i realized that only one light was still visible as it gradually disappeared. the storm raged on for another few minutes. my sister and i talked for a minute or two and i went back to my room at approximately 11:00pm.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":30028,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.9030918,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07062011-0022","longitude":-77.0328758,"occurred":1085204520000,"potentialRelations":[3070],"rating":"Unrated","region":"District of Columbia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1310002885000,"summary":"Fireballs over washington, dc","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2601,"locationName":"Washington, District of Columbia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:48178"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"New Carlisle","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My mother's friend marsha and i were sitting on my family's pontoon boat that was docked on our pier in front of our cottage on hudson lake, which is located in northwest indiana.  we were sitting out there for about 15 minutes watching the fireworks, as it was july 3rd and fireworks of all shapes & sizes were going off around the lake & in nearby towns - all of which are visible from the water.  then out of the corner of my eye i spotted a very odd looking object coming in slowly from the west.  i noticed it because even from far away it looked like a ball of fire floating in the sky.  marsha completely agreed that it was not fireworks (and no, we were not drinking).  we just sat there and watched it slowly move closer and closer, until finally it was hovering directly over the middle of hudson lake.  it hovered there for about a minute.  as it got closer, it appeared to be more rectangle in shape and the inside of it gave off a brilliant red flame-like glow, while the outer edge appeared to be grey.  it had no propellers & no wings, in fact, it had no appendages at all.  after the object hovered for a minute, it made a complete right turn and headed south...Slowly at first, but then after about 30 seconds it sped way up, and poof it was gone.  both marsha & i knew without question that it was a ufo.  i knew it from the second i laid eyes on it...I mean, i look at the sky all the time & in my 38 years had never seen anything even remotely close to it.  marsha is much older me, and she too said that she'd never seen anything like it & completely agreed with me in my assessment.  the whole time we were watching it, we just kept saying to each other, can you believe what we are seeing?!?!  my mother then came down to the boat & we explained to her that we had just seen a ufo.  she brushed us off, said we were crazy...That it had to have been fireworks.  i assured her that fireworks don't travel horizontally slowly for miles & then hover in one spot & then make 45 degree turns & continue traveling in another direction.  strange thing though, about an hour later - when both marsha & i were no longer around - my mother and aunt donna said they saw the exact same thing from our deck (which overlooks our pier & hudson lake).  however, they said the object came in from the south (which is the last direction marsha and i saw it traveling).  they said it came in slowly, and that it then hovered over the middle of the lake.  however, this time it appeared to be a green ball of fire, not red.  they said that after about a minute of hovering, a smaller oval looking ball of green fire descended from it, and when it did, there appeared to be yellow rope-like strings attached to it from the main object.  they said the smaller object hovered for a moment below the larger one, and then plunged very fast into the lake & disappeared.  the main larger green fire-like object then turned left and headed back out west towards laporte, in.  both said they have absolutely no idea what it is that they saw...Nor are they able to explain it or make any sense of it.  and i told them, \"hence the term ufo.\"  also, i asked our lawn boy (john k.) when he came by this morning if he happened to see anything strange in the sky the night of july 3rd.  he said, yes, in fact he did.  he was watching the fireworks with a friend that night from hudson lake's public beach, and he said they both noticed what looked to be a bright moving fireball in the sky...But then they lost sight of it, and just started watching the fireworks again.  he said they weren't sure what it was.
