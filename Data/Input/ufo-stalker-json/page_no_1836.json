(around 9:30ish) me and my mom saw this floating orange ball in the sky, the glowing of the orange ball was pulsating, we spotted it from a distance as it moved closer to us, still with the orange glow pulsating. we knew it had to have been moderately high in the air because the object kept going behind clouds that appeared to be very high in the sky, and you could still see the glow (faintly) behind the clouds. it was moving in and out of the clouds. witnesses beside us said it was a candle tied to a balloon, or a japanese lantern, which i started to think \"oh yeah that makes sense\" but, the orange ball continued to pulsate and then the orange ball started slowly dimming, which i thought was the candle going out due to lack of oxygen. the weird thing was though that as soon as the orange glow went out there was a bright blue flash immediately followed by a bright white flash, (and the flashes werent like the flash of a firework) the object disappeared for a minute, then the orange glow reappeared and continued to pulsate again for a few minutes. as it was approaching above our heads, the object stopped glowing, but you could see the silhouette of the object in front of the blue sky. it looked like an oddly shaped blimp or something, still hovering above us. then it floated out of sight. i thought maybe i was crazy or hallucinating  but my mom saw the exact same thing i saw, we thought there was another explanation until the blue and white flashes. we would have recorded a video but my moms phones battery was dead. there may have been more witnesses due to the large crowd of people at the fairgrounds for the fireworks, and people all over lancaster watching fireworks.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then

the hill the trees open up and you can see the sky and mountain of the horizon very clearly.  i looked up and saw, just over the horizon, 5 red balls of light and immediately thought they were the fireworks of a 4th of july celebration from the next town over.  i stopped my car to watch, but quickly realized that these ���fireworks��� were not descending after their apparent explosion, they were stationary in the sky.  i watched for about 1 minute before i put the car in park and got out to really get a closer look.  there was about 5 red glowing balls of light (looking like firework sparks, or a flare).  the one closest to the middle of the group was the only one stationary.  there were two above and to the right, one below and to the left, and one farthest one below and to the right.  the one below and to the right was moving very slowly out of my view and eventually i could not see it anymore.  this left only 4 now.  after about 10 minutes one of the top balls got very bright and disappeared.  this left only 3.  the one in the middle still did not move, while the other two kept hovering around it and ���checking in with it��� almost like how a parent doesn���t let his kids stray to far.  the ���roaming two��� dots would move left to right, up and down in a very fluid but slow motion, but always returned to vicinity of the middle ���mothership��� ( i use that term very loosely).\r\nthe behavior of the dots was odd.  they would periodically disappear, separately, and then reappear.  the would get very bright, separately, and then dim out to almost nothing. and once they all got very bright simultaneously and then dimmed to their regular brightness. the entire event lasted about 40 minutes, for me.  i had even left to go home and get my camera, and when i returned and the lights were still there!  i could get no image with the camera because it was not a good enough one.  the lights were very close to the horizon.  i tried to find another place in town where i could see that part of the sky, but could not find any.  when i could stay no more, cause it was getting late and i told my wife i was going for ���icecream��� when i went back to get my camera, they were still sitting in the sky.\r\n ","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path then

maybe 3 or 4 times the diameter of a star - perhaps the size of a matchstick head held at arms length. the dots were not a clear white light like navigation lights and there was no strobe affect that you would see from nav lights -

the same size, intensity and color as before in approximately the same location. this i captured on tape. you will see in the video 2 bright lights at the bottom of the frame - those are deck lights on houses approx 50 yards from where i was standing - the unexplained dots are in the mid frame. while i was taping the lights two of my neighbors walked by going to watch the fireworks and i asked them if they could see the lights (you can hear part of our conversation on the tape). they said they could see the same thing and they had been watching them for about the same time as i had. they also said they had both never seen anything like it.  after a few minutes the dot blinked out again. my neighbors walked off to watch the fireworks which started and lasted for about 25 minutes. after the fireworks were over for 5 minutes or so i again saw 2 dots the same size, color etc as before in the same location which i captured on the second video - they moved a small amount towards the north east but i only realized that after reviewing the video and seeing their position in relationship to the 2 lights on my neighbors houses.  after a few minutes they blinked out again seperately within approximately 15 seconds of each other. again after a few minutes one appeared the same size, brightness, location which was also witnessed by my same neighbors returning home who i had talked to earlier and again they agreed it was very unusual and they have \"never seen anything like it\" after a few minutes it \"blinked\" out meaning it disappered and reappeared and disappeared again over the course of 5 to 10 seconds.  i continued to watch the sky for 15 minutes or so and then went into the house. during the whole episode i felt excited about what i was seeing and at no time did i feel fear or apprehension - the lights seemed very distant although i cannot give an altitude - i would say they were in our atmosphere but that is just a guess. these lights were many times brighter than satellites which i have seen crossing the sky before. i consider myself to be level headed, practical, logical and not prone to the dramatic or speculation. i have no idea what the lights were but i have never seen anything like it before.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":30011,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.2031265,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07062011-0006","longitude":-79.9261603,"occurred":1309840200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1309938443000,"summary":"I saw 2 blurry orange dots that disappeared and reappeared over the course of an hour .

international airport.  the plane was already flying over north 77 sunshine strip and was directly over us heading west.  we walk the industrial park across the street from our house for exercise.  as we made our way across the street and into the park.  we noticed another plane or airliner taking off and also heading west in the same direction as the previous one.  from our viewpoint the first plane was to the right of the \"star\" and the one that just took off was to the left of the \"star\".  i say \"star\" because that is what it appeared to be at first glance.  \r\n\r\n  after staring at the \"star\" for a few seconds we noticed it was moving heading towards us in an eastern direction towards the airport.  assuming that the \"star\" was an incoming aircraft. i turned to my wife and said that seems dangerous because i have never seen them group planes this close before in our area.  after both planes heading west were in the clear we observed the star or white light coming toward us and almost over us.  we looked for the faa required lights or some blinking lights but there were none on the object.  as it approached us i noticed it seemed to waiver or sway back and forth a  bit erratic.  we also observed that the object made no sound.  at this point the object began to change direction and head south.  it took a slight curve to the south and in a matter of three seconds it sped up and disappeared.  it's speed could be compared to that of letting the air out of a balloon.  that is how fast the light shrunk and disappeared.  no faa lights and no sound got me thinking on what this object was but when it took off like that and went out of sight.  i knew my wife and i had just seen a ufo. \r\n\r\n  i thought about calling the airport to see if they had any close calls involving aircraft or any odd hits on their radar but the only number listed is for customer service and not the tower. i decided to submit this report because about two months ago around dusk.  my wife and i were getting ready for our usual walk and she saw a white light in the sky with no faa lights either.  which also was heading east and then erratically changed it's course and flew south.  the way it changed it's course all of a sudden convinced my wife that she has just seen a ufo. i don't know the proper channels in contacting the pilots in those two aircraft heading west out of h.I.A.  but they had to had seen something.  the sky was clear and there was no clouds.","distance":"Over One

without the handle. as they continued flying north towards us, we noticed that the bottom-right orb in the formation started to dim, until it was so dim that it was not visible at all anymore. a few seconds later, the lower right orb began to fade until it was not longer visible as well. the last 2 orbs faded out one at a time as well, until nothing could be seen anymore. we were all very curious and interested, and baffled by what they could be. i can confidently rule out them being any form of commercial aircraft due to the lack of appropriate lights (and the fact that the lights went completely out). i cannot completely rule out the possibility that they were chinese lanterns, though the speed and seemingly deliberate formations give some evidence against the chinese lantern

report this to someone who might be tracking this information closely.  my husband and i live on the southeast edge of pleasant hill, missouri which is about a 10-15 minute drive southeast of lee's summit, missouri.  we had just gotten back from watching the city firework show yesterday night (july 4, 2011), and my son and i were sitting on our back porch which faces to the southeast watching neighbors fireworks.  my husband was in the front of the house which faces to the northwest.\r\n \r\nit was about 10:00 p.M. when my son asked what something was in the sky.  i looked and i saw a bright orange glow in the shape of a circle that was moving from the northeast to the southwest.  to me, it looked to be at about the height of our 2-story home and was moving very evenly on a linear track.  there was absolutely no sound.  at first i had thought it was a piece of firework debris that was on fire.  i watched it closely thinking that i didn't want it to land on the roof and catch our house on fire.  but then i realized that it was not bobbing up and down, or moving erratically like you would expect a piece of paper to do in the wind.  it was also not dying down, which you would expect a piece of paper on fire to do.  i began to think it was pretty odd, but didn't even think that it could be a ufo.  \r\n\r\nabout a minute later, my husband ran from the front of the house saying \"do you see that!\".  he does not believe in anything other-worldly, and believes that there is a very reasonable explanation to everything.  this had him stumped.  it continued to climb higher for about a minute and then it faded away.  it was hard to tell if it had just faded away or just got higher and we couldn't see it anymore.\r\n \r\none reason why i had initially thought it was a piece of paper on fire was that the glow was only on one side of the object.  not like a solid orb.  i felt that i had a pretty up close look at it, but then my husband thought that it was at an elevation similar to an airplane coming in for a landing.  we live in a somewhat rural area.  our property is about 2-acres, which is long and narrow and backs up to a tree line.  there would be no airplanes coming in for a landing there, nor are there any crops on the adjacent properties for crop dusters.  we live in a subdivision where everyone has about 2 to 4 acres of land, but it is only residentia\r\n  \r\nafter that, we stood on our driveway facing to the west.  then we started to see about 8 or 9 of these same orange \"orbs\" on the western horizon.  this is when i realized something was very different.  they moved in the same manner, in a long steady, linear track but gradually got higher and higher.  the kind of flickered like balls that were on fire.   we saw about 5 or 6 that initially began in the northwest horizon (we were guessing over greenwood, mo or lee's summit, mo, but they could have been closer) and then tracked to the south.  we saw about 3 that initially began from the southwest and tracked to the north.  what was weird is that they all tracked to the exact location on the western horizon before they dissapated, including the first one that flew overhead.  it couldn't have been chinese lanterns because they flew in three different trajectories, some opposite of the wind last night which was from the east-southeast during that time.  the one that i saw up close was definitely not a chinese lantern.  also, they could not have been airplanes because of the first one that flew overhead did not make any noise, nor were there any noise lagging behind it like you would expect in a jet plane. \r\n \r\none last thing, these must have been moving very, very fast based on the rate of where they moved on the horizon.  \r\n\r\ni've never seen anything like this before, and neither has my husband.  we are stumped and cannot believe what we saw.  we did some research online last night and found that these same orange orbs are being documented around the country, including several last night during firework shows.  their videos look exactly like what we saw.  \r\n \r\nwe were able to catch some video of it.  but i'm not sure how good of quality it is. (note from fi: i am obtaining this video)\r\n \r\ni hope this helps you in your research! i hope to some day understand what happened last night.\r\n  \r\nthanks for listening!\r\n\r\n\r\nfi note: i spoke to the husband by phone today.  their 2-year old son saw a orb first and pointed it out to his mother. the father thought it might be a plane on fire at first. he noted that there were 10 objects coming from different directions and speeds and that they all ended up at the exact same spot.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":29999,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.1059765,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07052011-0049","longitude":-94.5759867,"occurred":1309842000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1309921227000,"summary":"10 orange orbs fly to same location from different directions","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Kansas City, Missouri","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:48796"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Minot","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I want to share a sighting with you. hopefully, other people will contact you about this unusual sighting. please pardon my terrible grammar.\r\ni live on south hill in minot. i'm about 13 miles away from minot air force base. from my house i can see and hear bigger and louder planes flying near the base if the weather conditions are right. last night, july 4th, the weather was good. visibility was stated to be 10 miles. in practical terms it was unlimited. there was some thin altostratus clouds in the area.\r\nat 10:49 pm local time i was outside looking due north at some fireworks and i noticed a very bright orange colored orb. i first thought it was a firework mortar that had been fired as was waiting for it to burst. but the orb grew in intensity and was moving horizontally. i first noticed it about 30 degrees above the horizon and coming from the same area as the base. the object crossed almost overtop of me. i would guess about 70 to 80 degrees above the horizon. it was traveling extremely fast and headed sse and about 170 degrees. it was much faster then any satellite or jet i've ever witnessed. it appeared to be many times brighter then then iss or venus at their brightest apparent magnitude. it was solid in orange color and had steady brightness and having somewhat of a sparkle to it. possible due to the atmosphere. it had no fiery tail like a meteor. i couldn't see any airplane position lighting or strobes. it was somewhat oblong. its seemed to have length. it was not round like a satellite appears to be. i tracked it on its southerly heading until it went above a small cloud. it then faded very quickly in the clear just like a satellite going into the earth's shadow. i'm guessing it was 50 degrees above the horizon when it disappeared. total observation time was about 2 minutes or less. the speed and bright fiery orange were remarkable. i'm a pilot (not current) and have done much satellite observation. i know cloud movement can play tricks on apparent speed. the clouds were not moving very fast last night and i think the high speed was real.\r\ni did not hear any noise at all from the object. there wasn't much wind or much noise from the fireworks either. i usually can hear the noise of commercial jets passing overhead at cruise altitude. i did hear one commercial jet overhead a short time after the sighting.  so, the conditions were right for me to hear something from the object. i didn't hear anything, it was completely silent.\r\nsometime later, i not sure on the time. it may have been about 10 minutes. i was looking north again and i saw another orange object in the sky. this one was in the area of the base. it was 10 or 20 degrees above the horizon. it appeared to be rapidly climbing and moving right to left. possible climbing northwest. i was thinking it would come overhead like the last one. i ran inside to get my camera and when i came outside it was gone. also, earlier this spring, about 1:00 am i spotted my first one and didn't think much about it except for the unusual orange color. this one was moving slower and was much farther to the east of minot. it faded from view like a satellite would. i thought it was to late to observe a satellite because the sun was far below the horizon.\r\ni googled \"red satellite very bright\" and came up with a lot of \"hits\". apparently, many people are seeing the same thing.
