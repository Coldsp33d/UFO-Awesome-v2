States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Everything in this report is 100% correct and factual. i have no reason to make up or fabricate anything, i have no other reason other than to try and explain what i saw on this day, and the incredible impact that it has had on me all these many years later. it is not my intention to try and convince the naysayer and nonbelievers, but i will be honest and forthright with the events that transpired on this day. people can conclude what they will from this, but the people who know me, know that i am not capable of making up stories, or lying for that matter. why did i wait to write now after so many years have passed, or for that matter to bring it up at all? perhaps it is all the events going on in the world right now. there are so many strange events happening all over the planet. it is no secret that more and more ufo sightings are happening on a regular basis. i���m writing this report for my own personal reasons. the people that i choose to share this with will most likely be close friends and family. i have no reason to try and get any form of recognition, and certainly not looking for any kind of fame or glory. while i still can, i want to convey this event as accurately as possible, and with as much detail as i can remember. one of my regrets is that i did not go straight home and write down the exact date that this occurred. in the last 10 years or so, i have been keeping very accurate records of day to day events, rarely skipping any. sadly during this time period, i didn���t give much credence to such things and therefore did not keep up with particulars. as far as my biggest regret with this encounter, would have to be the fact that i did not have a camera or video recorder in order to substantiate my story. if only i did, they would most certainly be some of the most revealing up close and in great detail, as ever witnessed by anyone. i say this not to boast, but to simply state a fact. i have seen probably hundreds of videos on you tube, some really good, some bad, others down right stupid or a hoax. i am convinced that what i saw would have afforded me a visit from the so called ���men in black���. it would have been that spectacular, and set the standard by which all skeptics would have to admit- what was that? the aforementioned is the forward of my story. what follows will be the time line of what happened on this memorable day, one that i will never forget.\r\n\r\nwhile i don���t know the exact date that this occurred, i do know that it was the winter of 1996, around november or december. i know this because the days were short, and all the leaves had fallen off the trees- this i know for sure. i was working at milliken design center in lagrange georgia. my normal work hour was 8:00 ��� 5:00 o���clock, monday through friday- a typical office schedule. it was not uncommon for me to work over an extra hour when ever necessary. on this particular day, i shut down my computer and prepared to leave the building at exactly 5:45pm. i remember a gentleman walking ahead of me, approximately 50��� feet or so. he exited the side parking lot door first, a few seconds later i did the same. he already had a head start going to his car, which was towards the left as you walk out the side doors. my car was parked more to the right as you walked out the door. i will try to give a reference as to where his car was, as apposed to mine. it was at this moment (after leaving the building) that i first saw the unidentified flying object with my peripheral vision. at that very moment the object had just came from the right corner of the building. it was at a very low altitude, approximately 80��� ��� 100��� feet in the air. it was traveling from a sw direction (215��� azimuth), going in a ne direction (35��� azimuth), at a line sight elevation of approximately 35���- 40��� degrees. it was moving at a very low rate of speed, thus giving me plenty of time to observe it. it made absolutely no sound at all- none whatsoever. perhaps the one thing that caught my eye first was the huge bright light on the underside of the craft. it was so bright that at times it was hard to look at. the top portion of the craft was shiny silver metallic. i remember thinking how strange that this craft had appendages sticking outward from the sides, different geometric sizes and shapes- something that i would later refer to as probes. of course i can���t be 100% percent sure what they were, but that is what it appeared to me as. as mentioned above, the craft moved or hovered slowly from a south westerly direction going towards the north east. once it came somewhat over the parking lot, i could see it plainly, making out the distinct shape and approximate size of the craft. at the time of this sighting, i drove a 1980 white cadillac fleetwood brougham. the size of this model car is 18.5��� feet long. given this fact and judging the height and distance of the craft, and the proximity to where i was standing- i estimated the object as being approximately 25��� feet in circumference. it was not a huge craft by no means, but was certainly capable of being maneuvered or controlled by some kind of intelligent life form. as the craft hovered slowly over the parking lot and past over the trees in the median, separating actually two parking lots, it continued moving in the north east direction. i never took my eyes off the object the whole time, and as it moved on across the parking lot and almost over the main road in front of the office complex, it did something that defied all explanation of physics. it went from moving slow, let���s say 5 mph, to an accelerated speed so fast, the only way to describe it would be: ���shooting a bullet��� out of the barrel of a gun- basically a streak, then it was gone. i have read similar cases of flying objects doing the same thing as i have described here. all one has to do is go to you tube and type in ���ufo���, it wouldn���t take long to find some videos showing similar maneuvers. an example would be to type in the phrase on you tube: ���ufo over river in italy���, then you could understand the velocity by which i am describing. i am convinced that america nor any other county on this planet has anything in its military arsenal that could come close to what i witnessed. let me say for the record: this was not an airplane, jet, helicopter, balloon or anything else of this earth. i certainly don���t need to be told that it was ���swamp gas��� or the planet ���venus���, or anything else that would insult my intelligent. what i saw was real, it really did happen, it took place exactly as i have outlined here, and no i am not crazy by a long shot. \r\n\r\nsummary: the gentleman walking out the door ahead of me to his car never saw this object. as soon as i saw this object, i wanted to yell to this gentleman and say: ���hey man, do you see that���, but i was literally speechless, the words would not come out. i was so in awe at the sight of this ufo, that i just could not take my eyes off it- not even for a second. the funny thing about this whole scenario- i could remember telling myself that ���this is a real ufo that i���m looking at���. i just knew immediately what it was, but at the same time i couldn���t believe that it was right there in front of me, in all its wonder and  mystery. \r\n\r\nnote:  on july 2nd, 2011- i did travel back to the place where this event took place and took several pictures. i used the aid of my old compass in order to get an accurate bearing on where i was standing, in relation to what direction the craft was traveling. keep in mind these photos were taken in the middle of summer, with the trees full of leaves, not to mention these trees have grown considerably over the past 15 years. \r\n\r\ni have used the aid of ���google map��� in order to show a satellite view from space, the office complex where i worked at the time (mdc). i even have a picture of what my white cadillac looked like in order to give some credence to the size of this object. the ufo was slightly larger in circumference than that of my car, but it was the only thing at the time that i could reference in describing the objects size. lastly, i found a picture on the internet that somewhat closely resembled the object in question. please note that i did use software on my computer (mgi photosuite iv) to help further enhance the photo. it was my intention to show a truer comparison to what i saw on that day. it is not precisely the same in every detail, but certainly very close. one exception worth mentioning here is that the photo that i have is darker, the actual ufo was very shiny and metallic on top. the bottom was somewhat darker than the top due to the lighting outside, except for one huge light in the middle- this was amazingly luminous. \r\n\r\nthe information that i have provided is true. this report is mainly for my own personal recollection. if other people read this and are inspired- that would great. if others read it and think its hog-wash, that���s ok too. it is not my intention to make people believe me. i do think people should open their minds to the possibility that we humans are arrogant, if we think that we are the only intelligent beings in the universe. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndate: july 3rd, 2011\r\n","distance":"101-500

the tracks were so high, we were able to see fireworks displays all around us (4 or more). \r\n\r\nsuddenly, a new group of lights appeared that didn't seem to be a part of any of the fireworks shows.  \r\n\r\nwhat we saw were 3-4 lights looking like a child's drawing of a \"falling star\" with a pointed star at the front or vaguely like a comet.  these objects appeared to us as the most active

explode during the duration of the phenomena.  the sighting lasted at least 60 seconds, maybe longer.\r\n\r\n2.  incredibly slow descent / moments of vertical motion - as the objects were swirling (imagine a bicycle wheel turning), it was clear the objects were gaining altitude during the motion.  \r\n\r\n3.  size - these objects were far larger then the bits of firework.  if i held my hand up, the whole show could be covered with two thumbs, and each object about half the size of my pinky nail. \r\n\r\n4.  isolation - while there were several shows going on (and several individuals lighting off store-variety fireworks), these objects seemed completely isolated, about 5 miles away from us.  \r\n\r\nour second thought was flares.  but i wonder can flares move vertically?  do they have

witness to an unknown craft flying overhead. it was a clear, warm evening close to 8:30pm est with only a slight breeze from the northwest. there were few clouds in the sky and the cloud deck appeared to be several thousand feet for those that were present. we had just arrived at my mother���s home on silver lake in kinderhook michigan (south of coldwater michigan) and gotten our stuff unpacked. we were sitting outside of her garage watching my dog wandering around the yard, staring at the lake and just enjoying the beauty of the evening and being there. \r\n\r\nout of the west/southwest, i noticed a red light appear above the tree line, moving toward our location. that area has several smaller airports that many aeronautical enthusiasts frequent. it is common to see ���things��� flying about. given the topography of the area, it is generally easy to identify those enthusiasts and their machines quickly. this was not one of those things.\r\n\r\nthe light held a steady brilliant red glow as it approached the lake. about the time it reached the opposite shore line moving towards us, i began pointing and saying my son���s name to gain his attention. he looked where i was pointing and said ���what is that?��� as he said that, the other two witnesses also looked at where i was pointing. it was moving about the speed of an ultra light aircraft as it came across the lake.  initially my son declared it a plane. \r\n\r\nin my view, as others got a ���fix��� on it and began looking intently, the red light went out. the craft continued across the lake towards us in darkness. it was initially the traditional ���saucer��� shape round with a small dome. the size was roughly the size of a four-seated cessna aircraft common in the area. the coloring was completely ink black. it passed overhead less than 300 yards away and about 1,000 feet above the ground, without sound. the harder i tried to look at it, the less i could see detail. almost simultaneously, we all verbally declared that this was not a plane. this is where we all in our own ways began saying the ���oh my god what is that��� and ���that���s not a plane��� things to each other as it passed overhead. \r\n\r\ni began asking for a camera or my binoculars. the cameras were still in our bags in our rooms, but my binoculars were right in the garage. my fianc���e ran into the garage behind us and grabbed them for me. the rest of us never took our eyes off it. \r\n\r\nthere is a large farmer���s field across the street from my mother���s house, and during the time it took my fianc���e to get those for me, the object had only just crossed the length of the field, heading north, northwest. i trained my binoculars on it (10x50 power) and was able to follow it with them until it passed below the tree line.  as i watched the object, i tried to discern details such as wings, or edges to it. it appeared to alter shape slightly, as a loosely filled balloon would in a breeze. this was no balloon though. what continues to stand out in my mind is the blackness. no edges or details were visible at all within the boundaries of the objects outline. it was just blackness. it was kind of like watching a round black hole float across the sky, with its edges slightly blurred and its outline wobbling.\r\n\r\nas i watched it approach the tops of the trees in the distance, the object made a subtle shift up and to its right, and then dove downward and left at a 45-degree angle. it disappeared behind the treetops and i could not locate it after that. \r\n\r\nit was not until several stunned moments afterwards, that i realized it had not made a sound. i mentioned that, and everyone was again stunned and in agreement in realizing that it in fact did not make a sound. considering how close it was to us, there was no way we could not have heard even the smallest of engines. it is very quiet and calm out there and you can hear even just birds from a long distance off. this made absolutely no sound whatsoever. \r\n\r\nmy mother has lived there for many years now, and i have seen all types of aircraft and balloons launched from local airports. this was none of those things. it was far too light outside and too clear, for us to mistake it for anything else at that distance. normal aircraft flying overhead at that altitude are very visible and audible to the point of almost being able to read their call signs with the naked eye and tell how many cylinders the aircraft is running on. it was also traveling across the mild breeze at about a 45-degree angle, and i feel confident in ruling out a free-floating balloon based on that alone.  we do not know what we seen, but we all seen something truly amazing. \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

looked up & outta where over our neighbors roof a big glowing orange reddish ufo appeared over my neighbors roof top. we said what the fu** is that!!! multiple neighbors witnessed this craft it was like a fire ball in the mddel and a saucer/triangel shape on the bottom. you could see the out line of the ball on top and circular/triangel shape below and it was raidating. it hovered for a minuetand & i sent my sister in 4 a camera and it started moving down my street. i followed it it went into the clouds and tried to hide its self as a cloud. but you could still see the red glow in the lil bit of clouds it was in. when it came out the clouds it shrunk majorly in size and it looked like a baby baby cloud flying down the street but you could still see orange reddish craft inside. we took some pictures i have to down load the to the computer & hop they come out. the pics we took was of the craft disgusied in the baby cloud. so ill have some pics hopefully a.S.A.P 4 you. i need the usb to download. hopefully it looks good. me and numerous witnesses followed this craft down the other block & it dissappeared. i took off when i sent my sister in the house for the camers and i was following it. like it noticed us following it and \"ran\" off. and it was weird how we noticed it because the fire works were on the opposite side down a few blocks. outt no where all 5 of us just turned and looked and said what the f*ck is that. no chance in hell it was a plane or a fire work!!!!!! a plane woulda fell out da sky at that low low heigh! and no fire work is hovering and cloaking

occasionally i would see a streak of small, crooked lighting bolts being produced and branching across the cloud cell, but none of the lightning bolt went to the ground.  while observing what seems like a constant cloud lightning, i saw in one of the cloud lightning occurrence produced a pure ball of white light at the end of a lightning bolt and occurrence which the ball of light was by itself

seen after lightning has been made and the bolt gone, leave behind after the lighting flash just a pure, white ball of light just hovering for about 2 or 3 seconds.  from my perspective, it almost seemed like there was a round object that might had been in front of the clouds which lightning may had hit a ball object and lit it up for 2 or 3 seconds. when i continued to watch the cloud produce more cloud lightning in the same general area, i never did see that pure white ball of light again. i went into the house to get my video camera, then i went back outside and started filming some of

glow caught the corner of my eye that seemed out of place. it was a bright reddish-orange glow to the northwest high in the sky.  at first i thought maybe it was a pyrotechnic but the glow stayed suspended in one spot and didn���t seem to move.  i continued to watch for about a minute when it started to dim slightly. after another 15 or so seconds more it completely disappeared.  i compared it to the other stars that were out and it definitely had a reddish-orange hue, glowed much brighter than the other stars and seemed to pulse for a few seconds before going completely away.\r\n\r\n  one thought was that it might have been a meteorite burning up in the atmosphere; however, i���ve seen meteorites before and this one didn���t have the characteristic streaking and didn���t seem to move at all.  the only movement i noted was at the end before it disappeared, at which point it took on the shape of a straight line about three to four times the original width, then blinked out.  from my vantage point there seemed to be a slight discernable shape of an l.  aside from this brief instance of 1.25 min., i���ve never witnessed anything like this before. i���m figuring maybe a falling object burning up in the atmosphere except for the fact that it just seemed suspended in mid air.\r\n\r\n  it happened at approximately 2230 pst on monday july 4, 2011.  the object was spotted to the nne of hermiston, or and i would say it was directly due east of kennewick, wa.  the fireworks had just ended in the hermiston area and i was heading into the house when i noticed a bright orange glow between the leaves of a tree in our front yard.  when i stopped i continued to stare at the glow and went to the side of the tree to see it more clearly.  what i saw from that point on is what i just described above.\r\n\r\nthe picture that i'm attaching is my recreation of the incident and not an actual photograph.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

to begin.  looked like fireworks were warming up to start, as a few tester fireworks had gone off.  \r\n\r\nthought at first it was one of the roundish globe fireworks.  but it moved up, then out and then forward.  then i thought a piece of the firework was going to land in the field and catch on fire, as another one had just gone over and landed nearby us.  but no fire, as it had just rained.  today was the start of a slight monsoon rain, black clouds, thunder and lightening.\r\n\r\nthen i realized it wasn't part of the firework and said omg it's a huge fireball!  we thought it was going to land in the field we were in.\r\n\r\nthen i said, omg, no i bet it's a huge meteor!!! then i noticed the outer red light looked less fireball like, and started to pan left and right.  then it slightly turned and started to come in our direction!  \r\n\r\nat this point i was still disoriented thinking a meteor was getting ready to smash down and was wondering if there was more and, when it came in our direction i was concerned it was going to hit us.  i was just trying to figure out which way we should move to be safe.\r\n\r\nmy boyfriend got out of his chair at that point, as he wasn't sure either.  after it turned in our direction, and we moved, then it straightened back up and flew right over head.\r\n\r\nit was low... slow... and gradual moving...With no sound!!!  we both mentioned there was no sound.  it passed over head and then just faded into the distance.\r\n\r\nwe never saw something like that!!!  was very different!  hope others noticed it too!  good luck on your quest and if you know anything please feel free to share! :)  i knew i should have brought a camera! :(","distance":"501 Feet - 1
