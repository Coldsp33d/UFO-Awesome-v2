window, and asked me \"what is that?!?\" i saw what looked like a squat pyramid shape, and thought it might just be a balloon, but then i saw it slowly moving and realized it was quite large. my next thought was maybe a blimp, but this was very strangely shaped for a blimp. i was in shock and just watched it for a bit, then yelled for my brother to come see and show the rest of the family. we noticed some red lights on the bottom, slowly flashing on and off. i ran to the balcony and continued to watch it for about 30 seconds before running to find my sisters camera and record video of it. i then proceeded to record video from the balcony and later from the parking lot outside. the object very slowly drifted from west to east while gaining altitude, very much like what i imagine a large balloon would do. we noticed some slow clockwise rotation that didn't seem consistent.\r\n\r\nwe were watching the object with binoculars, as well as trying to get video.\r\nthe object eventually climbed up near the cloud layer and we lost sight of it behind the apartment building.\r\n\r\ni was very excited as i had always hoped to see a ufo, but also disappointed as i have a feeling this was probably just a 4th of july prank.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with

across the sky from east to southwest, to the south of us.  then we lost sight of it, as it got further away, whether it was too high up or too far west, we don't know.  \r\n\r\n3. it was odd, definitely did not have two or more lights which appear on planes.  at first we just thought maybe we couldn't see the other lights, because of the angle and that maybe it was just a small 2 passenger

the whole time it was in view. we continued watching the fireworks, then almost exactly 15 minutes later, @ 10:15pm, another object identical to the first, appeared, traveling from the east (it appeared to come from the same exact direction as the first) traveling to the west, this time not as far to the south of us as the first object. once again, it disappeared as it got further away.  then fifteen minutes later (10:30pm),  another identical object appeared, this time going right over us.   then two more objects appeared one at a time within the next 5 minutes, each one traveling further to the northwest of us than the last.  10:30pm was the last sighting.  we continued watching until about 11:10pm and did not see any other objects.  on each occasion, the one preceding it would disappear before the next one would appear.  \r\n\r\n5. we were calm and curious.  i mentioned the possibility of weather balloons, then ufos because they seemed to be traveling with a purpose

all around us in the neighborhood so we were looking in all directions.  one of us noticed a light in the sky that appeared larger than a star (3-4 times larger in diameter than an average star).  it was circular in shape and was the orangish color of a street lamp.  the light it emitted seemed to emanate from the object in an orangish hazy glow.  while we were looking at it we initially thought it was an airplane, but there were no flashing lights on it and it's movement was not that of a plane. it looked to be heading towards us and then suddenly moved left and then right, left and then right.  while it was doing this it was moving side to side in a way that i've never seen any aircratft do.  it appeared to float.  after it stopped moving from side to side, it continued moving towards us, slightly to the right.  once we pulled out our camera to video it, it slowly (about 10 seconds) dimmed out.  it is without a doubt the weirdest i have ever seen.  we all contemplated airplanes, fireworks, burning ambers from fireworks but there is no way it could have been that.  for one, it was too high in the sky to be fireworks or firework debris (not to mention it didn't move like a firework or debris.) and number two, it certainly didn't move like a plane. whatever we saw was certainly unidentifiable.  there were plenty of other planes in the sky tonight, none looked or moved like this object and all of them had their flashing navigation lights which were easily visible.","distance":"Over One

i mentioned i heard a band playing. she mentioned, that���s probably the celebration for the completion of the world���s tallest sand castle. at winding trails. as i stepped out the back door to identify the tune being played (looking west), i looked up and noticed a large cloud formation in the midst of the beautiful blue sky. the sun was setting, so it was crystal clear around this one large cloud, with the exception of a few smaller dissipating clouds. the sun had been setting so the sky was blue around and behind the clouds (west).\r\n\r\ni then noticed to my upper right (north / north west), a shinny silver cylindrical fuselage \"bullet shaped craft\". as the sky was a perfectly clear, this thing was traveling from the north side of my house towards the west approaching the cloud. at first i asked myself, ���is this a plane? i felt it was something different. then i noticed it had no wings or tail. it had what looked like two small fins with two white short air streaks following (less than half the size of the craft), this was coming off the fins (not a contrail). i also noticed it was silent, no sound, no engine was heard. we have much traffic from bradley airport and you can hear jets engines or prop engines readily at even higher altitudes. \r\n\r\nthe craft seemed to be traveling in an arc toward this (cloud) destination. now as it went into the cloud, i wanted to verify this was not a plane, as well as observe it further. as the trees seemed to be blocking this view, i quickly ran through the house to the front of the house to our driveway. i was viewing the cloud and sure enough no objects came out the backend.\r\n \r\nsince, i could see this thing clearly, i believe it was traveling very slow - perhaps 100 to 200 mph it seemed to glide upward toward the cloud. upon looking at the cloud, to see where it might be. i then noticed it was became stationary near a small cloud. as the cloud drifted, it seemed to go with it in our direction. it was now over our home. i looked up right under this thing, it had a haze around it, and seemed semi-transparent. while looking under it - still at cloud level it had one red light (blinking) directly in the middle of the craft.\r\n\r\nas it hovered over my home, it then it blinked once, then twice and disappeared. it was a something to watch.\r\n\r\nafter checking cloud ceiling levels from new britian weather channel, they were reported at 4900 feet. the distance to the object was walked off and calculated to a distance of 6,169 feet. the object was initially in a cloud bank directly over the park event which was located at 3,748 feet.\r\n\r\non a conservative calculation, using the cloud levels (weather.Com),the distance to the event over which it was stationed (once at my home) and (just 1/2 mile away-over the outdoor event), the craft size would be approximately between 100 to 150 feet long. it had what looked like a black streak down the middle of the crafts length and what looked like windows.\r\n\r\ni hereby allow mufon to study this case, to see if similar cases have been reported. i heard channel 8 news captured a few unidentified crafts in the storm clouds last week.
