then two. i even closed one eye to make sure my eyes were not playing tricks on me. i still couldn't tell ya if it was one light or two. i see jets and planes pass every night as i watch the stars before bed, but this one caught my eye. i have never reported anything. ever.\r\n\r\ni was smoking a cigarette as that is my usual routine before bed. i usually smoke about 3. i live near of bethel road and interstate 20. it's plenty dark out here at night. every few months i get to see a satellite when the conditions are right.\r\n\r\ni thought this was a satellite at first, then noticed it was not taking an orbit course. so i kept watching. it started a direct eastward path. it must have passed me at about 5 to 10k feet up, and 3-5 miles to the north. totally silent. i can hear cars on the road for miles out here for miles, no exaggeration. it was moving at roughly 100-150 mph. i am judging this by the speeds i see cessnas go by. it was way too fast for a balloon, and too silent for a plane or jet. i kept watching in awe, but it just kept going, silently. i looked down at my cigarette and it was about a puff away from being out. that is how i judged the time.\r\n\r\nit passed the house a few miles to the north and i kept trying to get a focus on it with one eye. it passed on silently head almost due east with a slight northward aim. no strobes, no noise. could it be carswell jrb with something interesting. unsure, but i can tell you the fourth of july would be no time to be playing with something like that. everyone is looking up and out and about.","distance":"Over One

looked toward the west horizon and was looking up up at about a 60 degree angle. this is when a bright light suddenly appeared out of nowhere. it was about 25 percent larger than most the stars in the sky. it was really quite bright, almost like a full moon but brighter. it stayed in one spot for a fraction of a second then moved to the right. it moved in a northeastern direction, at a speed i have never experience. it suddenly stopped and just hovered for a second, then its light went out. when it moved it left a trail of light as wide as the object also. i searched for it for about another half hour but never say it again. the reason i mentioned the speed was because i worked with f14 tomcats and other fighter jets when i was in the navy. i have never seen something with this kind of speed. it was like something out of star trek. it happened so fast i wasn't able to get any pictures. it still boogles my mind about this experience, i was always a little skeptical about these things
