they are much further away than this was. i tell my friend to tell me if i'm wrong but i think i see a ufo.. he starts to agree as he witnesses the same as mentioned above. unlike the rest of the world we pull out our phones and record. this object was unlike anything my mind has seen. very quite and not flying perfectly straight. heading north out of view. after we caught pics and video we decided to watch with our own eyes, for this may not ever happen again. we also decide to call out to it and put up peace signs. we felt stupid for not doing that when it was directly above us. we had a sense of aww. that feeling started to dissipate, until we looked at the video and zoomed it. i pleasantly freaked out. this was not a plane nor anything i have seen. the object looked as though it may not have been an object, but it may have been. bright lights of several colors and a moment of combustion possibly. but the array of colors was magnificent. possibly a craft with a triangle around it but not connected at the edges. reminds me of movies about star travel where the small ship has to align with an object to achieve a faster rate of travel. not that, that seems to be the case, but i just can't explain it at all. i doubt anyone knows what i saw. but after i saw several planes, even a jet fly by, then five or ten minutes after that i saw the weirdest thing, another low flying plane, maybe military with bright lights, carrying something it seemed to be normal maybe to sum, though really odd to me, especially that this was the first time i ever seen something like this and it was right after i saw a ufo. i would send you video and the pictures, but i do not want to hand you over the rights to it. what is your problem. i could send you it..","distance":"Unknown,

contact!This got my attention and caused my heart to race! after the plane passed on out of site the ufo came back into view! thats when i for some reason decided to flash my flashlight on and off like an sos symbol.Thats when the ufo came closer and closer into view to check me out!I could see green and red lights rotating around the oval shaped vessel! there was no sounds.Before i knew it the vessel was treetop level hovering over our little house in the wooded clearing.I was shocked and exited and hollered for my father! he came outside looked up at the vessel in amazement and said what the heck is that?We could both see the extremely large vessel hovering over the clearing at treetop level with the under belly all lite up! it hummed as it slowed down.It had no wings or propellers like a helicopter! it was oval .It leaned to one side and changed direction and left the clearing! the object was not of this earth! it was several years later i was driving home about 2:00 am in the morning on german church road after a late night shift at my factory job.The road is very curvy.After an s curve not less than a mile from the nuclear plant i saw a ufo again like before at treetoplevel itstartled me.It looked as if it had been coming from off the ground.I flashed my car lights on and off to get its attention.I know; not smart! it abruptly turned and hovered over my car at tree top level.My heart was pounding! it was like the same object i had seen years before as a teenager! thankfully the object didn't do anything but leave.But; i could see it very quickly beyond

were 6 of us canoeing late october 2015 on the chiniguchi river system east of sudbury, ontario. we were camping at the north end of dewdney lake at about 9:00pm. i noticed a red light due south of us. the red orb was stationary but after about 10 minutes, it drifted to the west slowly then disappeared. i captured many photos with a 30x telephoto on my canon. an airplane in the area is plainly visible with running lights and 2 searchlights. one photo shows camera shake. another at low magnification shows the light reflecting off the lake. this is my third sighting of lights so there was no surprise for me. the others were curious but some discounted my ufo explanation. i farm and do carpentry, so i spend way more time outdoors than most, not including my canoe time. i also spent about 2 years working on and around aircraft, helicopters and fixed wing. this was neither.\r\nsurprisingly, the night before we camped about 15k south and a helicopter with searchlights buzzed our camp about 2:00am at low altitude. is there a connection or just a coincidence?\r\ni saw an incredible light display about 25 years ago and finally saw a craft this july. i will file reports
