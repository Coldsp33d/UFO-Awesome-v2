didn't look like the regular planes that go over, so after a few seconds of wondering what it was, went outside to see it more clearly.  night was clear, stars were out, sky still slightly illuminated by leftover light from the day.  saw what appeared to be a possibly flattish- cone or bell shaped dark body with bright red lights emanting from all sides, bottom, possibly top but not sure about that.  it was moving from the west to east when i first saw it.  i could see it very clearly.   my first thought was, it was a helicopter, because of the \"deliberate\" kind of way it was moving, and also because of its speed being rather slow - maybe under 100 mph, and its height from the ground.  but there was no sound.  and so many lights and they were not blinking.  another impression i had immediately was that it reminded me of a world war ii marine mine - and this was because of the shape and dark color of it, and because the red lights were so bright that they reminded me of the things that stick out from all around a marine mine.  i would estimate its height at about 1000-1500 feet give or take.  the thing was not spinning, because the lights remained in the same places throughout my sighting it.  it was passing to the south of my house, in a very large arc from the west to the southeast, so as i continued watching from the backyard, i could see it from the side.  i didn't see a propeller like a helicopter would have, nor did i see a \"back end\" like a helicopter would have.  i was losing the last of the light in the night sky, so i can't say for sure if there were any protrusion from it, though.  my veiw became obstructed, so i ran through the house and out the front to my front yard, and continued watching it.  it got about where i would estimate it was over the ocean, but to the south of me, continuing in that same \"deliberate\" way, and still following that big arc to the southeast.  so now i was seeing the back end of it, but it was getting farther away, and the leftover daylight in the sky was pretty much gone.  then all the lights except maybe one went out, and within maybe 2 or 3 seconds, the whole thing either disappeared, or the last light went out.  i didn't see it anymore.  there are jet paths on the same trajectory the thing was following (except much higher up) and many small private planes crisscross this area often.  there is also jet traffic to one of the military bases in the area so there are sometimes lower landing jets, but they are to the north of my house - and they in and go out in an east/west flight path.  i couldn't imagine anybody flying anything that didn't have the standard blinking lights - because it could be unsafe.  i have never seen anything like a ufo before and its taken me a few days to remember all this stuff.  while the event was happening, i could not take my eyes off of it.  it was surreal.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

full moon that day and the moon was up while the sun was still out . i was looking at the moon as it was verry pretty when just below and to the left an object caught my attention . i watched the object moving toward me for approximately half a minuite before calling to my son who was inside the house to come and look . he came outside and we both observed the object fly directly in front of our house ,off to the right , and make a banking turn before dissapearing behind the tree line .\r\n    the object was white and shaped more or less like an almond . there were no wings or fins and no visible seams or windows on the object . as it passed close to me i could see a black rectangle on the bottom wich seemed to conform to the shape rather than protrude from it on the bottom .In the middle of the rectangle were two white circular rings, black in the center .It had no markings whatsoever, no numbers etc. and no lights anywhere , that is what i found the strangest , because any craft, even a baloon would have navigation lights on it ? \r\n         the object made no sound and moved at a steady speed in what seemed to be a perfect line i did notice that there was a breeze that day and the spotty clouds behind the object were moving in a direction that was crosswise from it's flight path . also the trees in my yard were bending in the same direction the clouds were moving in , so i concluded that it was not travelling on wind currents but moving under it's own power . \r\n        just before we lost sight of the object it made a baking turn to it's right and then disappeared behind the tree line .When it made the turn it became clear that it was sort of flattened and not exactly egg shaped . also it left no trail as airplanes (jets) do. i could not tell you the objects size as i had nothing to compare it to for reference , it was just up there in the sky and i do not know how far i was from it,but i can say that it appeared to be rather large .\r\n            i do not know what it was , but i know what it was not . it was not an airplane as it had no control surfaces . i dont think it was any type of duridgable craft as it was too smooth and lacking any markings\r\n. my son and i are airplane buffs and are farmilliar with aircraft appearance in flight . i also am farmilliar with baloons as the air force used to have a baloon base just a few miles down the road and flew a baloon here every day for years . \r\n             initally we did not intend to report this , but our conversations seem to keep going back to this incedent and wondering what it could have been . when we saw it we were just trying to figure out what it was and the more we think abut it the clearer it becomes that we cannot find an explanation that fits .

neighborhood to pick up my 16 yr. old son at his friends home. close to the home, i made the last left hand turn onto his street (i was now facing north-the home���s driveway was within a few feet on my right side). before turning into the driveway, very bright lights came from (the north) behind a line of trees. the lights began slowly moving from north to south, towards me. it was very close.\r\n \r\nafter taking it all in for a few seconds (face to face with the object), i then immediately drove into the driveway and was relieved that the homes garage door was open. i jumped out of my car and two high school young men ran out of the garage to meet me (neither were my son). i asked if they wanted to see a ufo and pointed to the moving object that was now slowly passing in front of the house. the two young men were very excited, but as they watched, reality set in and they both became very quiet, aw-struck.\r\n \r\nwithout thinking i told the boys, \"it will not hurt you, watch and it will turn onto red oak dr. and you will see the round lights in the back that look very much like a cars headlights\". sure enough the small craft slowly passed us and made a right hand turn onto red oak dr.-it seemed to be using the street as a guide. i asked the boys if they wanted to follow it and they said ���no���- i quickly called my sister who lives with me and told her to go outside to our front yard -the craft was headed west towards my home. she waited outside and did not see it. i live in a semi-wooded area so the trees may have blocked any direction change the craft may have made.\r\n \r\nmy concern turned to the teenage boys standing on the driveway who were speechless.  one of the boys has agreed to be interviewed, his mother is an artist and they are working on a drawing. i asked him not to speak to his friend who also witnessed the object in hopes that they would not influence each other. \r\n\r\nthe next day i spoke with the teen (artist for mother) and asked him to describe what he saw the previous night.  i assured him there were no wrong answers when he became reluctant to describe the air-craft; he thought it was either a diamond or rectangle shape-i believe i know why he described it in that way.\r\n \r\nit was the crafts smaller size that when it was approaching me (head-on), i could see why someone would describe the front end as resembling a go ���carts pointed front end-or having a rounded protruding diamond shape (point) to it. before i sped into the driveway, the front end approaching me was some what bowed out. there were very bright lights across the bowed area (more than one), i saw two bright lights coming from front-underneath, and the smallest lights were one red and one green on the underneath side.  with the white lights being so very bright it was difficult making out specific front end details.  as it passed, the overall shape to the side and back was rectangle (with round tail lights). the back lights were not intensely bright making it easy to recognize the rectangle shape. \r\n \r\nit was moving just high enough to clear the mature oak trees. it passed us slowly, remaining above the street; it turned right onto red oak dr. as if it were following traffic laws. without a sound, it gracefully and slowly moved west out of our sight.\r\n","distance":"101-500

size and brightness as the largest visible planet.  they were close to being in a straight line, made no noise whatsoever, and left no trail.  had they left a trail, i would have guessed they were meteors.  \r\nat the time i was with 2 friends who also saw the objects and thought them to be odd enough to quickly call their wives outside to check them out before they disappeared over the

coming in random intervals for the next couple minutes, sometimes only 2 at a time, sometimes up to 5.  there were no patterns i could discern except for a couple groups seemingly forming a perfect

night, we felt a burning need to let authorities know what we had seen. \r\ni checked wind direction for that time frame, and it was blowing south at 5 mph which pretty much discounts the possibility of chinese lanterns or flares.  i have absolutely no clue what these things could have been, and i feel very fortunate that i had friends with me to witness this.  we are all in our 30s and have careers in retail, insurance and teaching.  i am sharing this experience in the hopes that someone else saw these and can possibly explain what they were.  the random formations discount (to me) the possiblility of military aircraft, the wind direction rules out lanterns or flares, it was a clear night so they weren't reflections, and no trails tell me they weren't meteors.  absolutely unexplainable, and the quantity made it somewhat of a scary experience.  for a brief time i wasn't sure if they would stop coming.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":29883,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.2359969,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07032011-0019","longitude":-80.8368567,"occurred":1309687200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North

as i read the description and then saw the witness' drawings, i couldn't believe that - with the exception of the reported size of the object - i had seen something incredibly similar on three separate occasions in koreatown in early january, 2011. the following is a description of that last sighting, as i had a witness and it was more eventful than the previous two sightings.\r\n\r\nat 10 am, march, 2011 i went outside for a smoke break at my job in the koreatown area of los angeles. as i always do, i looked up and there in the sky, for the third time in two weeks, was a hovering, off-white object just hanging almost directly overhead of my building. it was the only thing in a gigantic blue sky and, while i have no evidential basis for saying this, it seemed to be there on purpose. my very first impression was that it was a surveillance device of some kind. ridiculous, i know, but that was my first irrational thought. after all, this is los angeles, so who knows what kind of surveillance is in use...\r\n\r\neven at this height (about a mile, i think - not good at estimating distance), i could see that it had a rounded surface, that it was reflecting sunlight, it was a solid and completely motionless object. because i had seen this object twice before in this same area, i had brought a small pair of binoculars to work with me in case of another sighting. i ran in to get them and also called out a co-worker to see this with me.\r\n\r\nshe came out and we watched it, both noticing (prior to using binoculars) that it seemed to be changing shape. i hadn't noticed this characteristic the first two times i'd seen it. it gave the impression of being mechanical in a way that i can't quite describe.\r\n\r\nthrough the binoculars, we were both shocked to see that it seemed to be made of several moving, rotating parts that were constantly changing position. as impossible as it seems, the parts seemed to be moving out and around each other, settling in position and then other parts would do the same. this constant morphing reminded me very much of the evil box in the hellraiser movies, or - and i'm reluctant to say this but it is accurate - the transformers. the object which had at first seemed to have a rounded surface suddenly seemed to be made of many rectangular and sharply angled moving parts. also, there seemed to now be a shimmery haze around the object itself - like when you see a mirage over the road or above the hood of your car on a hot day. this was happening all around as it began to change shape and i did not see that effect prior to the apparent shape-changing. perhaps it could only be seen with the aid of binoculars.\r\n\r\nwe watched this for about 10 minutes as it slowly began to move west towards santa monica and finally disappeared out of sight. it did not move upwards, only west - away from where we were.\r\n\r\nthe other koreatown sighting that i read about in late june, 2011 reported the size of the object to be building-sized. what i saw was not nearly that large, although the distance (perhaps a mile in the sky) made actual size difficult to estimate. maybe the size of an army tank would be my guess.\r\n\r\ni was reluctant to report this because of the bizarre shape-changing properties of the object until i read the june, 2011 report that was so similar to what i'd seen.\r\n\r\nthis was definitely a physical object, i saw it clearly enough to state that with certainty. it was absolutely in the sky on three separate occasions over a two week period and it hovered in the same general area all three times for about ten - fifteen minutes each time. after remaining stationary, it slowly moved away and out of sight all three times. throughout the sighting, it was too far away to take a picture or video of with my phone. i did attempt to do so, but all that could be seen in the picture was a white dot in the sky. frustrating but not surprising, considering the distance.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line

out of the house around 4:30am and noticed an incredibly bright light in the sky. i thought it unusual because we had constant cloud cover all night, and this object appeared to be under the clouds and moving. at first i thought it couldve been a satelite, but realised the movement of it, which went from left to right, and up and down. i was quite intoxicated, so i had to further analyze the situation and what i was looking at for about 10 minutes before i called my friends out to see. one friend brought a video camera out and we filmed it until it was no longer visible. video link is below. \r\ni am a very amateur astronomer, but i do know the difference between a celestial body and an object that is a few hundred meters above me.\r\nseeing this gave me a great feeling of honour. im sure it was an intelligently controlled craft, not of human origin. \r\nit gave me the feeling that it was aware of our presence.\r\nby the end of the sighting, a group of dark storm clouds had

ground. \r\n\r\nthe object was jet black and made no sound what so ever, the object was at least twice the size of a 747 jumbo jet. i was able to gauge the size of the object, because we live within 5-6 miles of o���hare international airport and see jumbo jets taking off and at low altitude every day. this object was at least twice the size of one of these massive jetliners.\r\nas we watched the object with our mouths agape, we saw two objects came up along side of the object. \r\n\r\nthey were silver, cigar shaped and maybe a quarter of the size of the triangular shaped object. they stayed parallel to the object for about 20 seconds, after which they all three accelerated together as one, and left toward the north at a very fast clip. they were out of sight within a matter of seconds and everything seemed to return back to normal, the neighborhood seemed quiet again and the only sound for the moment was the sound of the music playing in the background. \r\n\r\nabout 5-7 minutes

horizontally from south to north along the treeline, i saw a bright orange ball about the size of a tangerine held at arms length. my first thought was, \"oh look at the gorgeous firework\". then i realized that it was moving far to slow and steady to be a firework and way to level to be a chinese lantern. i exited the vehicle quickly realizing that this was not something i had seen before, and was both alarmed an in awe. i am surrounded by farmland and it's a clear night on the fourth of july....I am used to seeing all kinds of stuff this time of year...But this was different. this could only be described as nothing other than a bright orange fireball. it made no noise whatsoever.\r\n\r\ni hung up the phone and quickly tried to take a picture with my camera phone. but try as i might the photos weren't clear at all, and i was now running to keep up with it as it continued along the horizon gradually getting only slightly smaller. i then proceeded to try and get a video of the object from my phone...However the camera only saw black sky on the viewfinder. now i was confused, alarmed and increasingly agitated . in the video all that can be heard are crickets and me saying  \"what is that?! and why is not visible on the camera? \" \r\n\r\n(that's right i am the stereotypical guy that could not get video of the blasted thing in a day when everyone has a camera on them. i wont waste your time by posting the video its 20 seconds of me yelling at myself )\r\n\r\n i put the camera away as i came up on the end of the dead end street i live on and met the edge of a large farmers field. it was at this point that the object had slightly curved ahead of me, and was now directly due north. it was then without warning or sound that it moved straight up in the sky at a high rate of speed until within milliseconds it went from the size of now a  ping pong ball held at arms length, to a the size of a large star, only to shrink to match the  size of any other star within the night sky. it dissipated into the sky like a star just fading out. \r\n\r\ni kept repeating to my self now, \"no one will believe me, i couldn't get it on film... i maybe have on very blurry picture of it. i cant tell anyone... who will believe me??\"\r\n\r\n\r\ni stared waiting to see if i would see anything else for only a minute or two...Perhaps  firework or a plane or anything, and it was just silent. nothing.  i turned to walk back to my home and proceeded to call my parents who i was on the phone with when this whole thing started, to explain to them why i had hung up so abruptly. as i began to explain, from the corner of the sky where the object originated, came three helicopters, flying in formation moving in from south to north following the direction the object went. i watched them until they disappeared from site...They took much longer, and they made noise.\r\n\r\ni have no explanation for what i saw... it was huge, it was glowing bright orange and looked almost like it was on fire....It moved slowly and completely parallel to the ground until it shot off into the sky. it just defies explanation.\r\n\r\ni am attaching the one phone photo that actually came out. its a really lousy picture, with no frames of reference and would never hold up in court... but its all i have. i just don't know what to think.

antenna array possibly for aircraft, but there are no red lights visible.\r\n\r\n4.  blinking/flashing\r\n\r\n5.  mental thought: there it is again.\r\n\r\n6.  by coming into the garage here to make this report.\r\n\r\nsorry, no pics.  will try better next time if my little camera can zoom in on them from here.\r\n\r\nby the way:  this was not over the marine base but south of hwy 62 in 29 palms proper.\r\n\r\ncalled my wife outside to show her.","distance":"Over One

gone down but it wasn't dark enough to see the stars. i looked straight in front of me towards a house across the pasture from my house and saw a red light. the house i was looking at had its lights on and i thought there was a car or truck in front of it and the red light was a tail light. then the red light took off at an angle, kind of like a roman candle. i thought it was fireworks due to it being so close to the 4th. we have a ban on fireworks due to the drought, but i still have seen some. the red light kept going up and got larger until it was an orangish-red, large shape. it didn't have a definite shape, just large and orange. now it has hit me that this is not fireworks. i yelled for my husband and when he came out it was up in the air and he ran back in the house to get the camera. it moved slowly up and the higher it got, the smaller it got. it turned west and flew away, turning into more of a white light. we watched it until we couldn't see it anymore. i am still in shock. the pictures my husband got look like white lights, small and indescript. i watched this thing go from ground level to very high in the sky and out of sight in under 2 minutes. it has blown my mind.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

it was a white ball of light flying across the sky and first thing that i thought it was that it was an airplane. but it was flying real smoothly and quietly. it was far enough that it should have been  heard. it continued across the sky at the same speed not too fast and i just watched until it just faded away and disappeared. it just vanished. i thought it went behind clouds but it was a clear sky no clouds. i wish i could have recorded it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

while i played. needless to say, i was a little disappointed. looking for something to do, i decided i would water the herbs on our window sill that we recently got at our wedding shower. when i looked up, out the window, i saw two orange pulsating lights in the northern sky. they didn't look like plane lights, and the light pollution is too great to see any stars. after watching them for a bit, i realized that they were shifting slightly, so i grabbed my girlfriends camera. as i started to video tape them, they started to fade, but three more showed up. they appeared to be in like a v formation, but my perspective was from the front. i set the camera down, got my fiance, and started to video tape them again. they moved slowly, never really getting bigger or smaller. they eventually shifted upwards slowly until they disappeared after about two and a half minutes. to answer question five, i am quite blown away. i have always had my eye to sky for a number of reasons. first, i am an amateur astro-photographer. i love taking pictures of stars and the night sky. in doing so, i have learned the differences between satellites, meteors, planes, and planets. i know whats what in the sky. secondly, i must admit that i am a bit of a ufo enthusiast. that being said, i am also a skeptic. i'm not going to believe anything out there. i know that what i saw tonight wasn't a plane, a meteor, a firework, or a star. thank you for your time. this is the link to the video on youtube,  [link moved to additional evidence

a 1000 feet up traveling south to north. the objects had a very bright orange-red light on the bottom.  the color looked like the color of a flare.  after they both passed a certain point the lights went out but you could still see the objects which looked like they were somewhat like a three dimensional triangle.  we watched them for several minutes until they were out of our sight.  just a couple minutes after the first pair went out of sight, a second pair appeared traveling the same path as the first, and with the same bright orange-red light which went off at the exact same point as the first two.  we set realativly close to an air force base that uses c-130's and having been in the military and around different types of aircraft, both in the military and in my job as a police officer, i am sure that this was not a plane or helicopter of any type.  there was absolutley no sound of any type with these craft.  the craft were not flares or fireworks as they continued to travel
