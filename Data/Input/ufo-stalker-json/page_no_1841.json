States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was either late november or early december 1988, and i was 16 years old.  i was riding on a school bus back from panama city, fl around 10:00-10:30 pm.  we had just defeated one of the best teams in the state at the time.  i was feeling very well and happy about my performance and continued to replay the game in my mind.  \r\nabout 30 minutes into our return trip home to tallahassee, our bus was crossing over open water on a bridge.  i looked around the bus and noticed that all of the players, coaches and cheerleaders seemed to be asleep.  the only person i could tell who was awake was the guy sitting next to me \"dave\".  \r\neven though we played on the same team, \"dave\" and i rarely spoke because we were two different people internally.  so we sat next to each other quietly.  i looked out of the window out of sheer boredom and noticed a very bright, white light.  i turned to \"dave\", as i was the one seated by the window, and asked \"dave is that venus or the north star.\"  he replied that he wasn't sure.  so i turned and looked back and thought to myself this star sure is bright.  all of a sudden without realizing it my eyes were set and transfixed on this star.  it was pulsing like a heartbeat.  i thought to myself that the stars must look different on this side of the state.  \r\nafter staring at this light for 1-2 minutes my brain went into an unconscous thought mode and all of a sudden a true grip of terror and primal fear ran all over my body right down to my bones.  and i tell you i had never been that scared in my entire life.  my thought was \"jesus, if these guys wanted to take us out they could.\"  and then the light moved.\r\nthe light moved straight up, quickly about eight inches and stopped for 15-20 seconds.  it then moved diagonally southeast (45 degree angle)around six inches and again stopped for 15-20 seconds.  it moved again straight across over to the left around 12 inches and again stopped.  southest again it moved around six inches and it stopped.  it was just floating in the air, almost hovering a little up and down almost right on top of the water.  finally the pulsing light just shot straight backwards and was gone.  it reminded me of turning the television set off.   the little white light that remains at the end and then just disappears.\r\ni turned back to my left at \"dave\" and asked \"did you see that?\"  dave's eyes were widely openned, like a deer in headlights, mouth closed and his head turning in a \"no\" mannerism back and forth.  he was in shock.  we just looked at each other, rolled opposite ways and went to sleep.  until that night i had never even thought about ufo's.\r\nthe very next morning as i was getting ready for school i had the radio turned on as usual listening to music.  then the morning news was being reported in-between songs.  and i heard it with my own ears; \"76 people over in gulf county, florida reported seeing an unidentified flying object last night.\"  \"thank god\"  was all i thought to myself.  somebody else, somewhere else, saw the exact same pulsing light as i did.\r\nlater that day we had practice and before practice i approached \"dave\" and asked if he remembered what he saw that night before.  he said \"yeah, i do, but i don't want to talk about it anymore.\"  \r\nthirteen years later \"dave\" and i crossed paths again in our professions.  i was a basketball coach and he was a referee.  when we looked at each other there was not a drop of basketball in our eyes.  i asked him \"do you remember?\" and he just nodded his head up and down in a yes-ward motion.\"  we never spoke about that evening since.\r\neven today i don't know if there are aliens or martians, but i am absolutely sure that there are unidentified flying objects.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

quadrant of the sky from west to north just above the treeline, climbing slightly. it was moving slowly, taking perhaps a minute to cross a 45 degree arc of sky. it then seemed to shift course, coming closer to where we were gathered outdoors near the greendale vinyards. i called my friends attention to it at that point, trying to figure out what it was. all observed it as it seemed to come closer, then rise almost vertically out of sight. during the apparent ascent, it moved slightly further across the sky in a northeast direction. it was quiet; there were no sounds discernible over the crickets and the crackle of our cookfire, nor did those sounds nor other animal noises appear to stop during the event. noone present had a plausible guess although we did make several ufo jokes afterwards. i think overall the feeling was curiousity.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional

randomly looked out the window and up (for some strange reason) and saw this strange orange ball of light, not too far up from us. i stared at it for a good 15 seconds, trying to cancel out all the possibilities. at first i thought, \"oh, maybe it's one of those chinese lanterns or a blimp.\" i kept looking at it, trying to figure it out. i told my friends, \"you guys, look, it's a ufo.\" no one believed me. we stopped at a red light on the intersection of valley and temple when i told my friends just to look at it. they both looked up at it. we were all baffled. none of us knew what it was. my friend made the left turn at the intersection and i quickly turned around to stare at it through the back window. i kept trying to determine what it could possibly be. my eyes were glued to it. all of a sudden, i'm looking at it, and it slowly begins to hover toward the direction we were going. the further we would drive down temple, the closer (in distance, not altitude) it would come towards us. when i told my friends that i had a feeling \"it\" knew i was watching and that it was following us, they began to freak out. we made a right onto kellogg and ended up at another red light where a police officer happened to be in the lane next to us. we yelled at him, asking him to pull over with us and ask him what it was. we all pulled over and watched it over. it was about 1,000 feet up and a quarter mile away, not too far at all. the bright orange fire ball stayed in that spot, motionless for about a minute as we all stared up at it. after, it began hovering in a figure 8 motion for a minute. it then started dimming and brightening in intervals of about 2 seconds. all of a sudden, it completely darkened. we couldn't see anything--but in the spot where it was, tiny little \"fire balls\" began falling from the sky. it then appeared a little lighter than the sky, so it was barely visible, continued to drop these little orange fireballs (which also disappeared after dropping about 20 feet).  the police officer then called his partner to come check it out since he had no clue what it was. we all sat watching it in awe. at first, i felt protected, it was strange. i felt like it was trying to tell me something. i didn't become fearful until i felt like it was following us. i had no clue what was going to happen. we lost sight of it when it moved behind some tree. we were able to see it for another 30 seconds then disappeared. we haven't seen it since.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

retrieved the phone a bright pulsating light caught my eye. the object was to the north and appeared to object heading north east. the object was moving erraticly and extremely slow! it would move up, down, left, and right in no particular pattern that i could tell and even pausing was times. i sat and watchd the object until the light from the sunrise and direction it was headed made it impossible to see with the naked eye. this was around 5:50. i had witnessed two identical object the night before around 3 a.M. the second object was near the same place this object was the following day. both

about 1500 ft up following us-125 sw toward interstate i-275.   i followed the object for about 3 miles, when it made a right turn and turned the point of the chevron up.  the object then shot upward at a very fast speed and went into the clouds and i never saw it again.\r\n\r\nthe next day june 29, 2011, at 12:30 pm. i was going to lowe's down us-125 in the same direction as the object the day before, and there was 2 doe vans with dark out windows and flashing yellow lights on top.  they were going about 25 mph in the same direction as the object yesterday, and the lead van had a long bar across top of it just behind the driver and passenger doors.  on the top side of the bar at each end was a small white ball about the size of a softball with a flat bottom.  there was a metal plate under the bar and there must have been a lot of equipment in the vans due to the way there tires were looking.  the drivers of both van had green coveralls on and some kind of blue vest like you would see an x-ray tech use.\r\n\r\ni followed the vans for a mile and had a white doe car pull in front and stop me.   the driver got out and told me to stop following them or i could be arrested and to go about my business.\r\n\r\ni don't know if all this is connected, maybe you guys have seen this before.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Path with directional

bedroom window (the blinds were up) and i saw four amber balls of light in a diamond shape drifting across the sky.I called my husband to see it and as we watched these lights they proceeded to change shape to a triangle type shape. so i ran for the video camera. i recorded the last part of the first \"wave\" and all of the 2nd wave & 2 pictures of the 3rd.\r\n     the 2nd wave were 6 lights 2 in front and 4 following behind. they wern't very fast & seemed to float across the sky. what are they i don't know. i'm not very technical so i played the tape thru the t.V. and recorded it to my digatal camera. after the 2nd wave i was not expecting a 3rd wave to come by. the 3rd wave was about 8-10 of these balls of light in 2 strange formations. i tried to take pic's of these formations but they wouldn't show up on several pic's,however i do have 2 pic's that show a single ball of light in the lower right of the stills.\r\n  sorry for the language in the video,we were
