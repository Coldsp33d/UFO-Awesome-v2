d���as.  me gustar���a comentarles mi caso. escribiere en espa���ol y traducir��� para ustedes en ingles con un traductor de google que es lo mas pr���ctico pero espero que tal vez me entiendan tambi���n el espa���ol. yo vivo en colombia en bogot���  y mi caso sucedi��� as���:\r\nen el a���o de 1998 a las 5:15 de la tarde, se muy precisa la hora porque yo o���a siempre en la radio un programa que me gustaba y al momento de unos comerciales aproveche para dirigirme al ba���o a orinar y dijeron son las 5:15\r\nresulta que cuando compramos esa casa, las ventanas de los ba���os eran muy peque���as y no daban mucha luz, se hicieron ajustes y se ampli��� la ventana, lo cual cuando abro la puerta de este lo primero que tengo es una buena vista del panorama del cielo al frente, y justamente quedando en esa vista yo puedo orinar all��� de pie mientras veo esa vista; suena un poco chistoso esta parte pero  quiero explicar detalladamente como sucedi���. al estar orinando normalmente y viendo esta vista, vi que entre algunas nubes blancas, pero como un poco mas fuera de estas, como mas al lado izquierdo de mi,   se ve���a una��� nube���  mas peque���ita con forma de ovalo muy determinada, y supe yo diferenciar una de otra, tanto as��� que inmediatamente me pregunte��� es esto lo que dicen ser ovnis?  mi impresi���n de saber que realmente estaba viendo algo diferente fue tal, que yo tu tuve que dejar de orinar y me puse a ver esto. de pronto ,no s���, yo mire a otro lado a ver si segu���a viendo algo extra���o o si ve���a algo en otra parte ,y al volver a mirar all��� no estaba ya, pero igualmente a ese mismo instante ya aparecieron, como metidos en la nubes que estaba m���s al frente m���o, pues el primero estaba un tanto diagonal a mi izquierda,  aqu��� dos  luces tambi���n blancas ovaladas y digo luces porque aqu���  estas dos nubes peque���as y ovaladas ya daban luz propia  y era ya innegable que era algo, tan as���, que me hicieron  con esto sentir su presencia como si quisieran ya hacerse sentir y yo as��� lo percib���, es como si alguien inteligente hace actos inteligentes para que uno se fije  y tuve la sensaci���n de que me observaban.  cambiaban muy r���pido de un sitio a otro de la nube. empezaron a llegar ahora si al todo al frente m���o,  y hacia mi luces varias pero ya se tornaron ahora  de un color azul y no pod���a saber si eran exactamente 6 o 7 algo as��� porque se mov���an en zig zag y parpadeaban o titilaban o me parec���a que se apagaban sus luces y se volv���an aprender era algo as���. hasta llegue a pensar si no apagan ellos su luces todo el mundo las iba a ver!  y pensando yo esto, y ya ellos estando m���s cerca de mi casa, apagaron sus luces y tuve la sensaci���n que seguir���an pasando sobre mi casa y de hecho  fue as��� pero eran como nubes de gas en forma de ���valos pero apagadas sus luces, es decir como nubecitas  grises en formas de dos ���valos andando de par es decir de dos en dos a una distancia constante entre estos dos en y a velocidad contante aproximadamente y no muy r���pidos, y l���gicamente ning���n ruido. el hecho es que yo los observaba pasar sobre m���, sobre mi casa y de de repente un par de ellos que se acercaba dejo  pasar la primera, y la de atr���s empez��� esta nube de gas a hacer remolino y yo present��� que algo iba a ver. espere un segundo y mire nuevamente sobre m��� un ovni es decir ahora si de vedad el plato met���lico sobre mi y una altura aproximad de  cuando pasan los aviones sobre mi casa ni muy altos ni muy bajos pues salen del aeropuerto y pues yo vivo cerca del aeropuerto. este plato met���lico aunque quieto sobre mi cabeza,  giraba sobre su propio eje, y  era  y plano totalmente por abajo solo detalle como una mancha negra peque���a que no s��� si ser��� su punto de salida es el resto solo metal limpio. as��� paso no se si 30 minutos en mi pensar o algo as���. luego empez��� este plato a temblar me dio la sensaci���n que le pasaba algo malo y se pod���a caer, pero el luego se inclino  no s��� como hace eso, de quedarse quieto y se inclinarse, que luego entend��� que tembl��� para tomar potencia para partir y se inclino ya para dirigirse a alg���n sitio la partida y tuve miedo de ver porque cre���  que si produc���a alg���n destello muy brillante o algo as��� me afectara la vista y no quise ver, quite al mirada un segundo y luego volv��� a ver y efecto se hab���a ido, baje al patio de mi casa y ya m���s oscura la tarde segu���an pasando y alguno de ellos as��� con sus luces apagadas dejaba ver como si al girar saliera algo de el  y los otras no ten���an eso.De dos en dos\r\nen esa ���poca de 1998 aqu��� en bogot���  al menos no era ���poca de celulares y menos  que tuvieran c���maras o video incluido como  hoy en d���a , ni siquiera ni eran comunes las c���maras digitales y yo menos tener una no ninguna de estos aparatos para tomar su foto pero la experiencia la tengo. no s��� que hicieron all��� ellos cuando pararon  por ahora es un misterio para m���. bueno luego les adjuntare unos esquemas dibujados y tomare unas fotos de esta ventana y el sitio para que me comprendan mejor si les parece. gracias espero me den su opini���n,. atentamente (name deleted)fg\r\n\r\ntranslation:\r\ngood morning. i would like to tell me. writest in spanish and translate for you in english with google translator which is more practical but i hope that maybe i also understand spanish. i live in colombia in bogot��� and my case happened like this:\r\nin 1998, at 5:15 pm, the time is very accurate because i always heard a radio program that i liked and when to address a commercial advantage to the bathroom and said it is 5: 15\r\nit turns out that when we buy that house, the windows of the bathrooms were very small and did not give much light, adjustments were made and expanded the window, so when i open the door of this first thing i have a good view of the sky view front, and just being in that view i pee standing there i can see that view while, sounds a bit funny this part but i want to explain in detail how it happened. when urinating normally and seeing this sight, i saw that among some white clouds, but a little more out of these, as more to my left, saw a \"cloud\" over tiny oval shaped very determined and i knew i differ from one another, so much that i immediately ask is this what they say they ufos? my impression of knowing that he was really seeing something different was such that i had to stop your pee and got to see this. suddenly, i do not know, i look away to see if she was seeing something strange or if you see something elsewhere, and look again there was no longer, but also to that moment and appeared as stuck in the clouds i was more in front of me, as the former was somewhat diagonally to my left are two white lights also tell oval lights because here these two clouds were small and oval and its own light and it was undeniable that was something, as well, i made his presence felt with this as if they already do and i feel so perceived, as if someone is smart intelligent acts done for one set and i felt that i watched. change quickly from one place to another in the cloud. get started now if the whole front of me and to my lights and turned several but now a blue and could not tell if they were just 6 or 7 something because they moved in zig zag and blinking or winking or seemed is turned off its lights and turned to learn was something. i even wonder if they do not extinguish their lights all over the world would see! and i think this, and as them being closer to my house, turned off their lights and i felt they would continue going over my house and actually did but they were like clouds of gas in the form of ovals, but off their lights, that is as small clouds gray ovals forms of two-pair is walking in pairs at a constant distance between these two and approximately constant speed and not very fast, and obviously no sound. the fact that i watched them pass over me, over my house and suddenly a couple of them approaching the missed the first, and behind this cloud of gas began to make swirl and i sensed that something was going to see . wait a second and look back on me now say a ufo is vedad if the metal plate on me and a height of approximately when the planes pass over my house, neither too high nor too low as they leave the airport because i live near the airport . this metal plate but still over my head, spinning on its axis, and it was completely flat, down just a black detail smaller than maybe it's his starting point the rest is just bare metal. this step is not whether 30 minutes in my thinking or something. then he started to shake this dish gave me the feeling that something was wrong and could fall, but then tend not know how you do that, to sit still and bowed, then shook understood that to take power and to leave already inclined to go somewhere the game and i was afraid to look because i thought if it produced a bright flash or something like that affect your view and i did not want to see, remove the eyes a second and then i saw he was gone and effect , down to the courtyard of my house, and darker in the afternoon were going and some of them with its lights off and let it look as if to turn out something from it and others did not have two at eso.De\r\nat that time in 1998 here in bogota at least was not time unless they had cell phones and video cameras or included as today, or even digital cameras were common and i have a least not any of these devices to take your photo but the experience i have. i do not know who made them when they stopped there for now is a mystery to me. well after some diagrams drawn adjuntare them and take some pictures of this window and the site to better understand me if you please. thanks hope to give me his opinion. sincerely

of the time.  i then saw two planes flying at the same exact speed, very close in altitude.  they were moving very fast too.  after seeing those planes flying so close together i thought that was very strange and i looked down and skimmed the horizon.  not too far from the direction that these planes came from i saw a very large light that at first i thought might have been a planet, but i had never seen it before.  it was very bright and very low on the horizon, but definitely above the mountains.  it sat stationary for about 5 minutes while i was on the porch and i then went to get my brother and grab a camera.  when i got back it was gone.\r\n\r\nit looked very much like what a planet looks like, except 3-4 times larger in perspective.  whatever this was, it was in the atmosphere.  i'm very disappointed that i didn't get photos or video, but i find the two planes that i saw before seeing the object to be very strange.  almost as if they were buzzed to go check this thing

saw very faintly a large spotlight waving back and forth across the sky. i got to my house and went outside to investigate so i called my brother (another ufo researcher)whom lives not a half mile away to see if he was playing with his powerful laser or had at least heard of anything going on that would warrant a spotlight flying across the sky.  he had not heard of anything so we ended the phone call.  as i was bemused by the spotlight, i spotted a tiny spec relative in size to a far away star start to slowly move across the sky at about 25`-30` above the horizon. as i watched the object i was reminded of an experience a few weeks before where my sister-in-law saw, for all intents and purposes, the same object move in a similar fashion.  she called out my brother who then called me down to witness the object.  all three persons were in a coherent and sober mindset the night of both sightings.  we all saw the same movements and would even laugh independently when we saw it start to move.  however, on this night (june 30th), i watched seemingly the same object at about the same height above the horizon move what looked to be many, many miles (50-100?) across the sky, and very specifically stop, and move up maybe my out stretched thumb's length straight up.  the object then made a direct 180` turn and went back across the sky in the same fashion as before, but only a thumbs length above the first flight path.  by this time (approx 10:50pm) my brother and his wife were watching the same object, and had immediately spotted it as soon as they stepped outside. maybe 30 seconds later the object just faded out behind some thin clouds and was no longer visible.  keep in mind though that throughout these few minutes an enormous spotlight was waving back and forth in the same basic direction as the object.  however, not 90 seconds after the craft was no longer visible a definite human directed craft (airplane, as was visible from normal flashing airplane lights) flew straight down the flight path of the unidentified object, except it was traveling the opposite way.  the airplane was then visible a few seconds later down the exact same flight path coming from its original bearings.  i'm not sure if this was a second plane, or if it was the same plane after it had turned around.  \r\n\r\nthe first time we saw this phenomena it was an exalting experience, as we spotted and viewed the object moving in respect to a green laser we had setup.  however, the second time around was quite a bit more foreboding in the respect that at the same time as i witnessed this \"craft\" (as it was definitely not a star as stars don't move, and it was not a civilian or military aircraft as there were no light beacons flashing, and lastly it was not a satellite as i see them quite often, and have even seen the iss and spaceshuttle darting across the sky in low earth orbit.) there were a spotlight waving back and forth toward the area where the craft flew, and then subsequently either 2 planes separated or one plane by itself followed the exact same flight path as the object, except in reverse.  this is absolutely one of the top 3 most quizzical experiences of my life.  i am a rational person and have viewed the world through a scientist's eye since i can remember.  i have also spent many years being taught the various sciences, and even took the time to take physics and both chemistry 2 and 3 in the same year of high school .  science is my life and i am pretty good at it.  99% of the time i will be able to come up with some kind of an explanation for an idea, event or occurrence, however on this night (june 30th) the only explanation i have is that the object i saw was not piloted by humans.  it was most definitely a ufo, but its not so hard to not definitively identify something.  so, we must look at other attributes and qualities of the incident to make some kind of determination; for example the movements of the craft across the sky into a 180` turn.  that is not normal.  \r\n\r\nunfortunately i did not have time to get our good camera and was not able to spot the object through my terrible phone camera.  \r\n\r\nthank you for allowing me a credible place to post my story.  this is one experience i will never forget, and will continue to look for answers for the rest of my life.  i would also like to add that i live in a region of the appalachian mountains where there is much less light pollution than in many other places, and with my natural inclination for science, have subsequently spent my entire life looking at the night sky when possible.  i am well aware of the visible planets and major constellations, and this object was very abnormal for this area of the sky and time of year.  \r\n\r\n

immediately went out to see if it was still there. it was a strange white blinking light that didn't seem to be any kind of normal aircraft. it was noticeable as i looked off to the east, a bright but distant blinking orb of light. it would blink one light a few times, then it would blink a second light sequentially 3 times then go back to a single blinking light. it seemed to stay rather stationary for a while and then randomly change directions heading north east to south east and back again due east. after a few minutes it was doing connected circles in the eastern sky. it would do a counter clockwise circle connected into a clockwise circle headed in a south east direction. i called the neighbor out to have someone else to see what they thought of it. she just asked what it was and i told her i didn't know. a few moments later another light appeared out of nowhere and flew north to south very fast just in front of the first object. it was the same size, color, distance, and brightness as the first object. it was not a meteor, it left no trail and neither faded in or out as it passed. it came into sight and i immediately began to shout, \"look!\" i didn't believe my eyes. i was very excited now. we watched the object for almost two hours and spoke to neighbors who were also out at the time. they had seen it since 11pm, and had spoke to relatives that had seen it as far as 80 miles from our location. it stopped doing the figure eights and moved far off to the southwest. then a few seconds later a low flying airplane passed by. after the plane was gone it continued back to its previous location and continued the same flight pattern all the way off to the east until it vanished from sight.

red, orange and was seemingly segmented. this rotating light also made rather erratic motions and flashed a very bright, white light. \r\n   using an imaginary plane, it made sine/cosine maneuvers as

so, it flashed extremely bright, shot up and disappeared. the same thing happened at about the same time on 30 june at about 3am, however, it was a little closer. one could clearly discern the

to be moving too slowly.  it seemed brighter in the middle, and more orange toward the edges, like a flare or a flame looks.  it continued, and it became clear it wasn't a firecracker.  it crossed over our heads and continued until it was out of sight near the northern horizon.  as it travelled across the sky we talked about what it could be and quickly ruled out any kind of meteor. possibly a sattelite reflecting the sun?  my husband thought it went out of view behind the trees, and to me it appeared to dim and go out, but it could have been seeing it through the trees that gave it that appearance.  i can't really say how long it took, but my husband says less than a minute.  it stayed at a constant speed and at a constant brightness.  there was no noise.  a few minutes later we saw a plane fly over high enough that we couldn't hear the plane.  i would say the the oragne/amber light appeared 2 to 3 times larger than this plane appeared in the sky and traveled slightly faster.  we

about 7:20 p.M.  i usually take my time leaving the house, making certain i have everything i need because i live quite far out in the country.  in hindsight, on that particular night, i left the house very quickly - almost bolting out of the house; and i have no idea why i did that because i was only returning a pair of underwear to the store.  if i had left 20 seconds later, i would have missed what i was about to see.  i was in my pickup truck, pulled out of the driveway heading west.  in the wetern horizon i saw a very bright yellow light; then two and three appeared, and so on until there were eight.  my first quick thought was that they were landing lights from an airplane until i started seeing more and realized how big these lights were.  i immediately pulled off to the side of the road, turned off my radio, and stuck my head out the window.  there were large orbs about the color of the moon.  at first count there were seven; but after recounting i'm positive there were eight orbs.  as fast as i counted them, the eight orbs traveled across the sky in 20-30 seconds until they disappeared into the southern horizon.  the eight orbs took up almost 1/2 of the entire sky as they traveled.  they were in-line and did not change their positions but weren't spaced evenly apart.  there were 2 - a gap, then 3 - a gap, then 2, another gap, then 1.  the last orb was a little higher than all the others.  it did not appear to be a solid craft.  as they passed over the field, they were approximately 300 yards away and 300-500 ft in altitude.\r\n\r\nmy first solid impression was that this was a controlled flight and not anything man-made.  there was no propulsion sound or sonic boom which i thought there would be for something traveling that fast.  immediately after they disappeared from sight i turned my truck around and followed where i thought they may have crashed; expecting to see a police road block or flames.  after seeing nothing for a few miles, i decided to go to my friends' house to tell them what had just happened.  when i arrived jim and laura were reading.  they knew something was wrong as soon as they saw me.  i told them what happened and talked jim into coming with me to imvestigate where these orbs may have gone.  we went back to my house where i had first seen them in the sky - then drove east about 5 miles and didn't see any sign of a crash.  i took jim back to his house and talked for awhile; then proceeded to k-mart.  i felt as though the cashier must have known something was wrong because i must have been very wide-eyed after seeing such an unusual thing. when i returned home i called channel 4 news to ask if anyone else had reported anything strange in the sky.  the answer was no.  i went on-line and reported it on the ufo alert website.  while searching that website i found an astronomy student at the university of toronto.  i contacted him through his e-mail and he told me he had seen 7 orbs at the same time and place in the sky - he described them just as i had seen them. we wrote back and forth a few times but then lost touch.  i no longer know how to contact him. the next night i went bowling with my friend ken.  when i told him this story his jaw dropped because ken told me that earlier that day one of his employees sat him down and told him the exact same story i just told him.  this employee lived in akron, n.Y.  the only difference was that this man only saw 3-4 orbs.  ken gave me his employee's phone number and we talked on the phone a few times.  i no longer have his correct phone number but will contact ken and ask him to try and get in touch with this man to see if he would be willing to talk to mufon field investigators about his sighting.  this was all i thought about for weeks afterwards; and since that time i have read numerous books on ufo's and related topics. before this incident, i took no particular interest in the subject. i keep an extensive dream journal; and have had lucid dreams in the past.  on march 22, 1997, i had two out-of-body experiences.  i don't know where i went but it was extraordinary and amazing.  i haven't been able to repeat them since that time.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":29807,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.0106139,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06302011-0016","longitude":-78.6375283,"occurred":942808800000,"potentialRelations":[30366],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

watching the many airplanes moving about in all different directions..Some i could see the underbellies of them and the twinkling lights so those ones were either taking off  from or landing in

that the north star is the brightest, however, when looking in the southeast segment of the sky i saw two different phenomenons going on: one looked like a supernova star just twinkling away...Big bright white flaring spurts of light. while just off the side of it was a steady bright white light just hovering and not really twinkling but in a slow turn and hovering in place. i grabbed my bifocals to zoom in better and discovered it was more triangular when looking through my bifocal readers. i was certain then that it was a ufo. i watched it for at least another 10 minutes and it just stayed put in this location. i did not wait to see if it would zoom off as others have reported seeing in many other reports i've read in the past on this site. \r\n\r\ni am convinced that whoever

tracking nearly straight up. i live in the traffic lanes of newark liberty airport, and have seen and photographed many planes going overhead... frankly, i'm a skeptic, and use this process to show how easy it is to mistake common, explainable things as exotic, unearthly things. \r\n\r\ni had my cellphone nearby, and started videotaping the white ball, about the size of jupiter, all the way across the sky and down behind the tree. i later confirmed this to be a flyover of the iss, at a very bright magnitude -3.7. anyway, i reviewed the footage and sat back, then glanced back at the area where the iss had emerged from. there, at roof level to the home across the street, was what i can only describe as an oval, canted, glowing jellyfish, about half the width of my outstretched index finger, slowly drifting silently from right to left on the western horizon. my first reaction was that my eyes had unfocused, and i rubbed them to rest them, but the object remained. i was elated! i had seen meteorites and bolides, but never something so unusual. it was like a bubble of soap, white top and bottom of the ellipse, with red pulsing light on the bottom tip that changed colors, and a few other greens and blues in the opposite (top) end.\r\n\r\ni reset my video camera and caught a few seconds of video before the object brightened, then moved out of sight behind the neighbors roof. i ran to my front lawn, caught sight of it again, and snapped as many pics as i could before it disappeared.\r\n\r\ni returned to my porch, and thought that i should get my better camera a from inside, at which point the object reappeared on the opposite side of the house, in a brief hole between two trees. i ran inside and got my slr, but the object was gone. i thought about chasing it down with my car, but didn't want to alarm my sleeping family. i shared the pics and video with my wife, who aptly called the object a blob. i have since watched the video on a larger monitor, and tweaked the pics a bit. i posted this to facebook, and almost immediately got confirmation from another witness in a nearby town that swears she heard engines on the thing, and says it's an advertising blimp. that was my first thought as well, but why at such an hour? i have since heard from a second witness in the same town as the first, who saw the same object at 3am the following morning.
