30 seconds.  hard to tell really my jaw was hanging open.  i had to get a better look so i ran out to the alley behind the house for a better look, about 30 feet east of where we first saw it, and it wasn't in the part of the sky i expected it to be, it was further down the mountain towards cumberland.  it seemed to be moving faster as i was yelling for m. to come look.  from the time she walked from one end of the driveway to the other it had changed from a solid bright white light, like a star much bigger than any in the sky maybe 10 or 20 times, down to the shape and size of a dim red star on a clear night, and vanished.  it looked like light that just faded out smoothly to a single point, then gone.  i cant give you a distance from us to the craft with any accuracy, but it was maybe 50 - 200 feet above haystack mountain when it faded out, so maybe 250 - 500 feet directly above us at first sight.  i was excited, and m. was just saying \"what was that? what was that?\".  and to make it creepier, there was not a sound to be heard, my parents live in a fairly quiet and secluded place. there was no sound. that was not an airplane, blimp, or helicopter.  i am still trying to wrap my brain around this one. i wish i had a photo, but honestly it would look like a photo of stars, one being much brighter than the others.  feel free to ask any questions, i will give as much information as i can. thanks for your time.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet -

first cleared for immediate take off. people were still boarding the plane, and rushing up the aisle to their seats because of this sense of urgency. i was sitting on the right hand side of plane by the window, at the emergency exit. there was a young woman next to me and a young man on the other side of her. a flight attendant came by and asked us if we had any problem with helping out during an emergency since we were sitting by the emergency exits. i said no and so did the guy, but the girl next to me had headphones on and was sleeping apparently. the attendant made her wake up because he needed a verbal response. she made some kind of response but the words couldn't be understood, and sounded unusual. i'm pretty good with accents, and couldn't place it at all. it sounded like more than an accent issue. the attendant repeated himself a couple times because he couldn't understand either, and finally the guy sitting with us said she understood and agreed. the attendant left, and i didn't see him again. a new attendant came and strapped himself into the seatbelts on the wall infront of our three seats. he was tall, extremely thin, bald with tan skin. he never smiled or made eye contact like normal attendants do. after take off, he left. the lavatories/restrooms were on the other side of the wall infront of us. one was in my line of sight because it was diagonal to where we were sitting. a female attendant with a strange, wobbly walk kept going back and forth checking into the bathrooms. i noticed the bald, male attendant started to do it too. about an hour or so into the flight i went to the restroom. there was something in the air in there that was making me cough badly. i returned to my seat having a coughing fit. a few other passengers who went to the restroom started coughing too i noticed. \r\n   when the food cart came around i got an apple juice and some cookies. again i started coughing violently due to a tingly feeling in my throat. i don't have any known food allergies. usually when people start coughing, other people move away, but the girl next to me took off her sweater jacket and actually moved closer. i noticed a very sweet perfume smell wafting from her and the guy's direction. when random people started going past for the restrooms, some of them would smell unusually foul, others would smell sweet. it was very strange. two men, one of them with no shoes or socks on, started doing stretching exercises by the restroom doors.\r\n then i started to have a pulse go through my body at different intervals (like a mild electric pulse that contracted some muscles and spread upwards). i couldn't control it and didn't know what was causing it. it would literally make me jump in my seat at times, and i noticed whenever this happened, i would hear the people in rows behind me react with laughter, whistles, chirping bird-like sounds, and something that sounded like a purr. it did not sound human at all, except for the laughs/giggles. the guy sitting one seat from me was on some kind of computer device that looked like an ipad.\r\n   when i looked out the window about three or more hours into flight, i noticed unusual cloud cover. it was dark, roiling clouds. at this altitude, clouds are usually flat and non distinct beneath you. but these were like foamy rain clouds, and near the plane. a amber yellow light started to streak the clouds and illuminate them. then they started to fade into wisps. outside the plane, beyond the right wing and slightly behind, a yellow oval light was following plane. and as i looked below, a bunch of lights started to appear. they were clustered together in spherical formation at the center of a web-like arangement. a few lights in linear formation would branch off from some of the center clusters (like spokes on a wheel). they were white, amber, yellow lights. i would have to describe it as a fleet. they kept pace with the plane for awhile, 10-15 minutes. i was having trouble staring out window because the pulses through my body had increased in frequency and intensity. when i looked away from window it would stop. when i looked back it would start again. i was being trained not to look out the window. \r\n   the girl next to me started stretching alot. at one point she leaned all the way forwards for awhile and i could see that her torso looked alot longer than before, and something was going on with her shoulder blades. when she sat back up her head, which had been lower than mine's before was now on level with mine's at minimum. she turned to look at me and out the corner of my eye i could tell her face had significantly lengthened. her eyes seemed more prominent. i did not turn my head to look. i wish that i had, but at the time i was in shock. she looked away, and in a few minutes deliberately touched her foot to my lower leg. i got a tingle sensation that was different from the pulses. she went back to sleeping position when i didn't move or look. the guy one seat over from me was tapping away at the computer device, and every time he gave a big tap i would get a pulse. then sometimes he would lean forward and hold his head, or lean his head back in the seat, and then i would get a series of intense pulses. he looked over at me a couple of times, and left me with no doubt it was him doing it.\r\nat the end of the flight when we got off, i noticed the girl went off with a large group of people from the plane in the baggage claim area. she also had an unusual gait. i'd like to note that there was absolutely no turbulence on the plane ride. smoothest ride i've ever taken, and i fly quite a bit. also, at no point did i feel threatened...In shock yes, but not threatened or fearful for my life. and my asthma symptoms were much improved for days afterward. i'd just like answeres to what happened. i think about it every minute, every second.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":29788,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.940455,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08072011-0075","longitude":-74.91415,"occurred":1308985200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

i think was a satellite crossing the sky. it started from the south and a little east maybe.  it was heading to the north-south and vanished on the south and a little bit west part of my sky.\r\n\r\nthis one was actually one of the brightest i have seen so i simply gave it attribute to the clearness of the sky. oh yeah, it was kinda going just a little faster than i'm used to them going.  i thought nothing of it other than it was pretty cool and kinda bright.  it lasted a little longer in the sky then a cigarette worth so, when it disappeared into the contrast of the sky to the north, i decided to stay out for a bit and watch for more. \r\n\r\nnote: there is about 1/3 of the northern sky not visible to me due to the contrast of the sky, not sure if it's city lights, or the sun hazing it out a bit.\r\n\r\nafter a duration of about 3 minutes or so, another satellite came on the same exact trajectory.  the difference was, this one was not nearly as bright. it was about as bright as the dimmer stars in the sky.  i stayed, and followed it across the sky just like the last one.  i started loosing it to the change in sky contrast to the north, it disappears for just a fraction of a second, then (don't know how else to explain it) exploded in bright light for almost an entire second, then disappeared completely.  the flash was 3-4 times that of the brightest star in the sky that night, it actually gave off a diamond shape, just like you would imagine the star of bethlehem.\r\n\r\nso was it a ufo?  i can't say i have ever seen a satellite do that, i may have seen more than the average person, but not as many as a real stargazer. it was pretty cool, but i'm pretty sure it was just a satellite crossing over.  you

goldmine in apache junction.  this is the second time this object has appeared close to me which i have the visual proof event, the 1st time was in las vegas march of 1993 spring mtn and decator rd 10:00am hovering over las vegas. two other friends and i viewed the phoenix, along with a few other gas station customers, from the terrible herbst gas station at that intersection.  it hovered facing our direction we were west of and we watch it slowly do a 180 turn and go back into the clouds. the whole event lasted 5mins.  incidentally, the sky was complete overcast with the exception of a perfect circle cut in the clouds revealing the only blue in the sky behind the craft. two years later i unintentionally bought a book ufo sightings which shows a picture of this craft on fire in the night sky taken in siberia 1974.\r\nthe part i am hesitant of discussing is i think i was abducted as a child in mesa where i grew up when i was about 6 or 7 and when i lived in las vegas in 1993 when i was 23, i was residing close to tropicana and buffalo roads which was  considered the outskirts of town then. that's when the last abduction event i can recall took place.  that story is a bit long so i will stick with this sighting.(but it all connects and seems relevant)   how i came up with the name of the craft was from a series of events.  i named the craft the phoenix after attending the phoenix lights convention in 1998 and after viewing the craft up close and buying the book with the image of it.  it was the phoenix emblem projected on the wall at the convention center at the conference that gave me that idea.  on another note, i think i have been on this craft and i have met the personnel and aliens that fly the craft, but again that is a different story which to this day i still believe.  this craft is extremely impressive and is light stealth brown.  to view craft must re-size image larger. the craft is to the right of the water tower.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

today as it was about 5-6 years ago, when it occurred. but it continues to baffle me. from time to time i search for ufo sighting reports that sound similar to what i saw, and i never find anything even remotely like it reported. here's what we saw:\r\n\r\nit was winter of either 2005 or 2006, i can't quite remember what year it was now. we were driving home from a friend's house a few miles away, probably a little past 2 in the morning. as we were driving down garden street in mt. holly, we came to the stop sign at monmouth rd. i looked both ways for a moment when my sister exclaimed, \"oh my god! look!\" and to the right was this thing in the sky. it wasn't moving at all and we heard no noise as it hovered. it's hard to tell how far it was above the ground without knowing how large the object was. if i had to guess i would say it was very large and about 3 or 4 football fields above the ground. this is an area with a lot of houses and trees. but i saw no trees moving, no breeze or anything. there is also a lake in that area (in the vicinity of upper lake), and it looked like it was right around that spot. the object, as i remember it, was metallic, bulky and irregular shaped, like a crumples piece of metal or something. it's very hard to describe. the metal itself had a jigsaw puzzle type of design to it, as if it was a bunch of patchwork metal piecing the whole thing together. and the bottom looked like it had lights on it that shined up at its underbelly, lighting the up bottom. but there were also shadows on the underbelly because of the irregular shaping of it. it was definitely illuminated, but not very bright. just bright enough to be able to distinguish the jigsaw-like appearance of it. the top was more or less in shadows.\r\n\r\nwe sat at the stop sign staring at it in shock or awe or something for what i would guess to be around 3-5 minutes, before my sister said, \"go! go! go!\" and i sped off back to our house. my house is only maybe 1 or 2 miles tops (bird's eye view) from that spot. we looked around in the direction we had seen it in when we got home but saw nothing. either it vanished or the treetops covered it (which would mean it was very low to the ground), or i don't know, we couldn't see it from our front door for whatever reason, i don't know. i never saw it again, although i always hoped i would, and still do hope. my house was a few towns over from both fort dix and maguire air force bases--about a 25 minute drive away.\r\n\r\ni looked for newspaper reports of a ufo sighting the following days but didn't find anything. whatever we saw was unreported as far as i could find out. i'm hoping someone will be able to shed some light on what it was that we saw. i didn't have a camera on my phone at that time, and i regret not having any photos of it--although i'm not sure i would have thought (or had the nerve) to take a picture in that exact moment. i always felt i had seen something incredible, and unique. i've tried sketching it, but i have a very hard time trying to put on paper what i see in my mind's eye, and i'm an artist by profession. i will keep on trying so i have something to show that maybe someone will one day recognize.... and if i'm fortunate enough to see that, or anything like it again, i will report it right away and do my best to have a visual to go along with it.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

got up and opened the blinds to look at the street which is visible from the bedroom window.  he looked up and over the rooftop of the house beside us three orange balls in a straight line with one trailing behind (created a triangle look) were approching our home at a very low altitude..Around 500 ft or so...A height that our police helicopters fly often.  he yelled at me and i rushed to the

helicopters flying together?  i didn't think so, because they were orange balls. i said lets get outside to see if there is any sound. the formation turned slightly to the right as they went over the

never seen a smoke tail look like that. the smoke trail was rather short but, fanned out .. was quite amazing. at first we thought we were looking at the asteroid. after watching it and realizing it was moving up..And its maneuvers led me to the conclusion it was indeed a ufo.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

from lei garden restaurant in beijing back to the crowne plaza hotel i had taken a moment to look up and see if i could see stars in the sky. during the stay so far, i have not been able to see a blue sky or a darkness to the night sky, most likely because of the gaseous pollution. anyway, upon looking up towards the south, i noticed a bright object emitting a redish color. a moment or more later, i noticed more objects to the further south. each had a stationary appearance and then upon a few moments more observation, they began changing color and flickering and some in the far distance began swaying and in my words \"dancing\" in a slight side to side movement. at first i wasn't able to really tell if these were advertisement balloons or something else in the sky until they really started to do special movements and changes in color etc. after a long period of just observing and such, the farther ones kind of faded away off to some other part beyond vision, while the closer one seemed to stick around with me for awhile. eventually i had to go inside, and the close one also gradually went away. hopefully there were others that observed them also.

in more detail.  no wings, no tail, no contrail. a large cylinder, at least twice the size of a large jetliner, with rounded ends vs pointy nose and tail.  estimated altitude 30,000 ft. there was no
