the yard behind me near the trees it was dark and we have big trees near me we also live near woods. i saw this object that looked like a airplane or something because it was dark i could not tell if it had wings. i do know that it had bright red lights on the bottom of whatever it was it was. it was flying very slow but not that slow. i was stunned and was in shock to move and find my camera phone to take a picture. i ran upstairs to see if i could see if the thing was still there but it was gone. my brother was up and didnt see anything or hear anything out of the ordinary. i came back to the window and was to afraid to peak but then like a minute later i saw the bright light again. but it was coming back towards my house. i figured if it was a plane it wouldn't come back over my house as the original direction it was going was towards the nearest airport about 40 minutes away i looked like it had a plane like shape but beacuse it was dark i couldnt get a clear picture i only

sure if they were \"flying objects\"  it seemed to me more like \"orbiting objects\"***\r\n\r\n==================================\r\n\r\nbefore i begin with the report,  i have answered the questions to my right (as i write this post) first:\r\n\r\n1. where were you and what were you doing at the time?\r\napple valley, ca\r\nsitting in my car smoking a cig.\r\n\r\n2. what made you first notice the object?\r\nit flared up and was moving.\r\n\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\r\nsomething orbiting the earth.\r\n\r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions.\r\nonly noticed these objects as they flared up into a bright ball, and i watched as it dimmed down moving from north to south (and south to north for the last object)\r\n\r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object.\r\nconfused\r\n\r\n6. how did you lose sight of the object?\r\nthe light source dimmed as it moved towards the poles (first two objects heading south, last heading north)\r\n\r\n==================================\r\n\r\nthe report:\r\n\r\naround 9:30pm pacific time (west coast united states) i was sitting in my car smoking a cigarette looking through my opened sunroof just gazing at the stars.   then out of nowhere, a star like object appears directly in front of my field of view.  this object was moving from north to south, and as it moved the light from it became more and more faint until i could no longer see it.\r\n\r\na couple of minutes later at the most, i saw a second object, this one flared up really bright, easily the brightest thing in the night sky at the time, i watched it as it moved on the exact same path as the previous object, and it too dimmed until i could no longer see it.\r\n\r\nthe weird thing about these two objects is, they both did not become visible until their light source/reflection flared up.  and this location is about halfway in the sky from left to right.\r\n\r\nafter i had my nicotine fill and about 30 minutes later (give or take 15, i was not really keeping track of time) i was standing in our back yard and i saw the third object flare up (just like the previous object), the only difference with this object is, it was not going north to south,  it was going south to north in a perfect strait line.\r\n\r\ni have provided a simple mock-up of my field of view and about where these objects originated in the sky, and the path they traveled.  in this mock-up image,  there are 4 brighter stars, they kinda make a diamond shape, i am not an astronomer so i do not know what region of the sky this is or what its called, hopefully somebody will be willing fill me in on this.   in that image,  the bright line that seems to get smaller as it goes to the right is the path the first two objects took,  the third object was moving in the opposite direction, but still originated from that same point,  just outside of that point of the diamond.\r\n\r\ni feel like i am leaving much of the information needed out, so if i am able to edit this post (my first post here) i will do so if needed.","distance":"Over One

(aside - i noticed for the first time tonight that one of the stars in the handle of the big dipper is actually two stars that are very close to each other. cool stuff) anyway, i saw a ball of white light similar to a star appear and move at something similar to aircraft speed, but over 5 or 10 seconds the light slowly faded out until i couldnt see it anymore.  i never actually was staring exactly where it appeared, but it was the motion out of nowhere that caught my eye. i have no idea what it could have been, but i am sure that it was not a star or a planet, because it was moving. it was not like any aircraft i have seen before because it did not have flashing lights(was steady light) and did not appear to make any sound. i do not think it was a sateillite because it was much brighter than any sateillite that i have seen before, and the light faded out slowly and unexpectantly. it travelled in a straight line, but faded out as if it was travelling further away. it happened high in the sky so it is not as if it faded as it headed towards the horizon. the first one i saw was travelling mainly south to north. the second one i saw was only about 60 seconds after the first, and this one was travelling mainly north to south. i came inside to tell my friend about what i saw, and a short while later i went back outside and after about 20 minutes i saw another one do the exact same thing, although this one was much further east in the sky, and was travelling mainly north to south.\r\n\r\ni was not scared, maybe just a little bit excited at what it could have been. i will be looking for more of these in the future!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":29756,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":46.1430999,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-06282011-0001","longitude":-60.191354,"occurred":1309244400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nova Scotia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1309247239000,"summary":"Star like object moves quickly and fades out over 5-10 seconds. saw 3 in ~1 hour.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Sydney, Nova Scotia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:51828"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Wichita","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My wife and i just returned home.  she sat down to smoke a cigarette before going inside and i took to checking out the stars.  when i turned my attention to the big dipper in the northwest, i noticed a bright yellow flowing orb underneath and moving upwards toward the constellation.  almost as soon as i spotted it, it picked up momentum and seemed to decrease in luminosity by about a third.  the color changed from a deep yellow to more of a white.  i called my wife to come quickly, even though she hurt her foot yesterday.  she quickly hobbled over and spotted it with me.  \r\n\r\nas we watched, the object zipped through the cup of the big dipper and seemed to be heading out of the atmosphere.  it continued on until it completely faded from view.  i immediately came inside and started this report.  \r\n\r\nover the course of the sighting, the object fluctuated in acceleration, brightness, color and direction.  i've attached a graphic to better communicate what i perceived.

11:15 pm june, 26th 2011. i sat down at my northern facing window, which has a panoramic view of the central valley, hollywood sign, los feliz, griffith park and observatory... in short, i can pretty much everything see from west hollywood to the eastern san gabriel valley very clearly before the hills the observatory sits on. no smog coverage ever obstructs my view, and i pride myself on my 20/20 vision, as well as my sane, rational, and moderately skeptical perspective of the world. i am a double ba holder, an engineer, and a non drug using, fully functioning member of society. \r\n\r\nthat being said, what i am about to describe defies everything i have come to comprehend about modern science, the boundaries of what is possible in accordance with the laws of physics, and the limits of human understanding, ingenuity, and engineering.\r\n\r\ni lit up a cigarette and looked out north towards the valley, and noticed a large light-greyish, possibly even dark white, rectangular object, the size of a small building, that seemed to be floating over the silverlake/eastern hollywood area at what seemed to be an altitude of roughly half mile above the street, possibly even less than that. at first it behaved a lot like a used car-lot sales balloon would, as if it was tethered to the ground, and was being gently rocked back and forth by the wind. it hovered stationary, silently, and seemed to be making very small east/west movements, like back and forth by a few feet. almost as if it was keeping itself up, but for the most part remained stationary over the city; very small movements. at this point i screamed for my girlfriend to come and verify what i was seeing and also get some assurance of my own sanity had not slipped. she too saw exactly what i was seeing.\r\n\r\nat first she couldn't speak, but then reasoned that it must be an asteroid entering the atmosphere, as she had read about one travelling in record proximity to earth in recent days. the we quickly realized this was not possible due to the fact that the object began to transform in mid air.\r\n\r\nat around 11:33, three minutes after she came to see it, it appeared to come closer to our location by a cupe hundred feet. i was able to make out a clearer shape of what to me looked like someone seated with a jetpack or something square strapped to it's back for a moment, but it was tough to make out still due to the fact that i could not see any self illumination on the object. my girlfriend disagrees and is convinced she saw small blue and white lights on the craft. then it began to split down the middle and change shape. \r\n\r\n11:37, at first it appeared to split down the middle into a v-shape, then more of an l shape with the vertex of the angle pointing towards the ground, then to the western horizon. the rays of the angle were vertical, about 45 degrees to start with both facing the sky, then at 90 degrees, the tilt of one ray shot straight up and the other pointed due east. it then flattened out into what i thought was more of a pyramid shape than the previous rectangular building shape and began to move north, away from us and over the observatory. it then disappeared into the fog and clouds directly over griffith observatory. it must have covered 15 to 20 miles in about that many seconds...\r\n\r\naround three minutes later two craft, which i believed to be choppers, but in hindsight i realized were more likely jets due to the speed and color of the lights on the craft (white and green as opposed to lapd choppers, blue and red), appeared at the farthest extent of my view coming from both eastern and western origins towards the area the craft disappeared into. the jets crossed paths with what seemed to be about a mile between them on a north/south axis and continued along their trajectories one towards the pacific, the other inland over the san gabriel valley.\r\n\r\nthis whole thing lasted about fifteen minutes. end time of 11:48. not a sound was heard the entire time.\r\n\r\ni work at night and am very aware of how fast time passes once the sun goes down. my girlfriend pointed out to me at 1am that it had seemed as if hours had passed during the time of our initial report to mufon at 11:55 to the 1:30 am we were now experiencing.\r\n\r\nthe emotions experienced during the sighting ranged from bewilderment, to utter terror at the ominous presence seen over the city.  i am just stunned at the lack of reports and visual accounts of an object so large being \r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

overcast; it remained too light to see many stars, and we never did see the moon. as we were wrapping up and putting chairs away, a bright light suddenly caught my eye. i turned around, anxious to see what i believed was the moon finally making an appearance. but to my great surprise, i saw a small white light ��� very bright, flying across the sky, and it was encircled by very large cream-colored glow. note that there were no clouds specifically; the sky just seemed rather gray. i was surprised that the glow was so large, circular, and bright, yet assumed it was somehow an airplane behind a fog or clouds. still, since our sky-watch had been uneventful, i pointed up and tried to get everyone���s attention. however, i found myself fumbling my words, because, as i spoke, the glow didn���t fade in and out of any clouds as i would have expected, rather it began to shrink evenly around the center light until it was no longer there. what���s more, as the rest of my family looked up, the glowing vanished, and we all witnessed the object suddenly come to a halt. we were thoroughly bemused and unsure as to what we���d actually just seen. had the object vanished and we were now looking at a star���or was the flying object still there and truly standing still? nothing unorthodox happened after that point. as to the size of the object, to cover it if i held something at arm's length, i would have to use a pencil eraser to cover the center light, and a quarter to cover the entire glow. also, the glow was a perfectly shaped circle, not irregular or faded in any way. i have no
