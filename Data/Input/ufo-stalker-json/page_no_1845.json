every one showed up the day before the 4th and left the park the day after so i'm not sure if anyone else even saw besides us, we were the only ones on that half of the campground.\r\n  on one of the last days we were there i came out of our tent in the middle of the day and, don't ask me why, i looked at the horizon through the trees in the direction of the lake and saw a stationary red glowing/flickering object. at first i thought it was a jet or something... to be honest i wasn't sure. i called my wife over and asked her what she thought it was, her first answer was 'ufo'. although i do believe in this sort of stuff, i'm also a very rational person and never though i would see anything of the sort. i know that there used to be an aircraft base within 50 or 100 miles of the campground (i'm almost positive that its inactive now, however if someone can confirm this or not) as well as a few airports here and there; at this point i'm running through a list of what kind of jet it could have been.\r\n  i've seen lots and lots of jets (childhood hobby) including a f16 go sling wing right over my house just to disappear fast... that's not the same glow this was, before or after, not even close. it just hung in the sky at first and seemed to take forever for it to start moving although i'm sure that it was only a matter of 5 or so seconds after we noticed it. it traveled across the horizon varying in elevation at a moderate speed (not extremely fast) an inch or so up and down one or two times from my perspective (it was way out there and very bright, another reason why i didn't think it was a jet). it's movements seemed random, not extremely quick, but sudden. my wife was a bit \"freeked out\" so i sprinted down to the water just in time to see it disappear, literally disappear. i did loose sight of it for several seconds (10-20) running through the woods to get to the water. again i did see it disappear after i got to the water.\r\n  i wasn't sure how to react or how i felt about the situation, i had some skepticism, but then was skeptical of my skepticism. i said \"its a jet\" only to say that there was no way that color matched anything i had ever seen (i'm no expert). tossing that out the window, how does a jet just disappear without the jets/visuals getting smaller and eventually disappearing? i took fireworks into consideration for about a nanosecond due to how the object acted as well as how long it lasted. i'm yet to see a firework travel horizontal.\r\n  after seeing the dan akroyd documentary and hearing about this site, i had to share. i only recently even shared this story with my co-workers after one or two of them shared a similar story. i, at this point, am convinced that it was no known man made craft. looking at some pictures while writing this paragraph the color was identical to the red lights that seem to appear on the big deltas although i only saw one light and it was flickering for sure. as soon as i saw the pictures and that shade of red, i got chills and my eyes got watery. i may just be convincing my self of what i saw... but i'm convinced.

just happened to be the coast to coast am program with art bell from his program of sept. 29th of 1999. the show came to the break and i was heading from the garage to the house door a few feet away from the garage door.  i happen to notice what i thought was a 4th of july firework that was seemingly moving slowly upward from above the tree line and neighbor's house.  at that moment it had the same goldish color as would the type of firework that would go up over 100 feet and then burst into the typical firework display shell. i had heard some other small fireworks earlier in the evening and assumed this to be a larger one, typical of the college age residing a couple of blocks away. however as i kept waiting for the boom or the firework display, i realized that the \"upward\" direction that this object seemed to be traveling, was not upward as a firework at all, but instead was coming toward my direction.  i thought it still to be something like a large size bag or firework on fire that did not burst correctly and was burning as it came my way. i realized as it became closer that there was no sound and it was continuing in a strait line which trajectory was about to go right over my house and neighborhood. i'm noticing that the altitude was constant at this point from the time of my first seeing it to present second.  since i am interested in any such item in the sky being a ufo sighting, i gave it a quick thought, yet would never imagine to see such a thing, i was still pondering that since it was not a firework floating, then maybe a small plane that was on fire trying to make it to the airport which was exactly ahead of the object by about 5 miles.  i was seriously expecting to see the object explode or crash in thinking it now has to be a small plane.  now, at this time i was about 30 seconds into watching this object, and the total time was only 45  or so. i'm still trying to deduce it's speed as it seemed to be going slower as it was nearing the area directly over my head.  i'm trying to figure out if it were to go slow enough i'd go inside and get my video camera. i'm thinking it could be a helicopter that had a problem.  we have quite a few that head to the airport on that same line of travel.  i heard no sounds at all, and it still appeared to be around 200 to 300 feet in altitude as i could tell that as it was now directly overhead and seemingly slightly slower in forward speed, that it seemed to be somewhat spherical and yet almost like the triangle shape with 3 circles lighted up under it.  it still had that goldish and orangeish glow like burning newspaper, or the typical firework.  i'm straining as hard as i can to see details, as i'm still thinking it's going to blow up and spew darbee all over my area.  i really wanted to get my camera, but the thing kept on moving slowly toward the same course headed n.E. to the airport. i quickly moved to the center of my front yard to i could see it \"land\" as it closed in on the airport. note, there is a 4 lane highway behind my neighborhood area which runs north to south.  as this object began to clear my area it seemed to be gaining in altitude at a slightly increasing angle as it continued forward.  i thought it would be going on a descent path, but it was gaining height.  i still expected it to blow up, but as it was finally getting over the area where the airport was, and seemed to be about 600 feet in altitude, just went mostly \"upward\" and totally out of sight.  i'm thinking, did i see a ufo, because it didn't land or explode, it just vanished as it gained altitude rather quickly.  all i can say is i would have loved to photograph it as it looked like a helicopter on fire, or something on fire and ready to blow up.  i would like to know if anyone else has seen or heard of such occurrence on this eve of june 25 at 11:01 pm or anywhere near that time in the eve.  note, the sky was clear and stars and constellations clearly viable.  note, the forward speed was too fast for a helicopter but more closely that of a small plane, except when it appeared to be right over my head at it's altitude.  i did look up at it and did not take my eyes off of it one time. i was actually hoping whatever it was could see me looking up at it, and it became a bit creepy as it did not seem to be moving away as fast as it had approached my area. i still thoughth it was something on fire as it had that type of movement of light as you would see fire at a distance, the light would have some degree of appearance of movement due to the

there were several other sightings and police agencies who actually followed similar craft in their vehicles.At 5:10 a.M. i entered my vehicle at state park campground, started it and then noticed the surrounding area of woods was beginning to show light like sunrise.In this area it was too early for sunrise and than i noticed a light shining down into my windshield. i than opened my driver door and stepped out onto my runningboard and looked above my vehicle.Above and slightly to the east was a very discernible and large craft emitting no noise and travelling maybe 2-3 m.P.H.I continued watching this craft travel west-northwest to a position over the reservoir,this taking about 5 minutes.The craft than entered the water in almost a direct downward movement.In a further note, that during the previous days to sighting, the reservoir water level had increased and a lot of people were talking as to how poor fishing had been lately. i than travelled into town where i had commented at a convenience store i had just seen this craft. several local bus drivers who feared for their jobs than told me i should not speak to anybody about this as a couple of their fellow employees had lost their jobs for talking about seeing this same craft. shortly after i learned their had been other local reports of these sightings and that the ind. state police had logged over 100 miles on previous dates of following this craft.There was no fear of this vehicle but an overwhelming calm as to have been given the chance to see such an exquisite vehicle.","distance":"101-500

was coming back from the supermarket, walking on the side of the street, when right in front of me this very bright phosforescent electric green fierball cross from east to west. it was not falling down, it was flying parallel to the ground. at about 50-70 meters (150-200 feet)above the ground, it was about 10 meters or 30 feet of circunference, the ball was almost white in the middle, and green in the sides, and it had a small \"tale\". it didn���t make any kind of sound, and what i think was very peculiar, was that it did turn on and off radically, is to say, imagine seing the fireball flying across and then put something between your eyes and the ball, so you cant see it. then take it away very fast, then put it back on.. i hope this example helps you to understand my explanation.. and by the way forgive my english.\r\nthis happend very fast, but i cuold see it very well, and it was close to me. this happen in january 2005. in january 2009 i saw it again, but this time it wasnt geen, it was blue.. phosforencent bright electric blue, it was just like the first one, the same size, the same speed, it turn on and off just like the other, but it was blue. this one i saw it in hato el cedral, a wildlife refuge in the south-west of venezuela.\r\nwhen i saw it the first time i was impressed, i knwe it was a ufo, it was not normal, it was not a metiorite, because they fly down to the ground.. this thing was \"flying\". the second time i saw it.. i felt relax.. it was like. ey here they are again...","distance":"101-500

shore looking out across the water when i noticed a bright light low in the sky coming from the west end of the pond. i observed this light for no more than 3 or 4 min move in dead silence west to east, first it was moving in a straight line, but a little over half way across the pond it seemed to move up and down in a very odd manner as it continued to move east. it was at this point i knew that this wasn't any aircraft i have ever seen. the way it started moving up and down it seemed as though what ever was in control of this craft was not operating the way it should. i continued watching the craft until it disappeared behind the trees of the east shore on its way toward the budweiser plant.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":29708,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.5930302,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06252011-0001","longitude":-105.078733,"occurred":1308979800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1308991080000,"summary":"Very

less before they connect. it was slightly dark out and then it was very bright, there was traffic so we were able to look at it.  i saw a bright white light the size of a football field in the sky to my left.  i saw the light being attacked by what looked like toy planes shooting at the object (2 planes)then smoke.  after that it was gone but the light dimmed in the smoke as it left.  i felt the object fled so fast and with the light so bright that light was traveling slower than the object itself.   i was in the fast lane cars were stopped at this point.  the year was between 1986 and 1993. i called the the news station and got nowhere but caught only a glimpse of what they had to say about it 5 days later. i only heard them say the bright light in the sky. in my heart i honestly believe i witnessed a ufo sighting and feel strongly that military was trying to shoot it down.  it was so shocking to see that it stuck with me all these years.  i even have told my children about it.  i wish i could remember the date but it was only who i was with and where i was at and the incident.  i never reported this to anyone in writing because i didn't want to be called crazy.  i'm much older now and i know what i saw. if at all possible i'm sure someone has documented this and i hope they saw those tiny planes as well because i would very much like to read all of what they saw and compare it to what i saw.  also, i would really like to know the date.  thank you for your time. pk\r\nlocation: riverside, california\r\nleaving van buren area on 91 frwy towards 60 frwy, before they connect. \r\n1. just picked up boyfriend from work. 2. the area lit up very fast.\r\n3. ufo. but had to watch it to confirm what i thought. 4. i felt it left fast. 5. my boyfriend and i talked for
