it seemed transparent. bf differs on what he saw concerning this. then the treetops began obscuring our view, we started running east towards the park for a better view, but it was gone, apparently into the big wall of clouds to the east.\r\n\r\nfrom where we stood when i first noticed it, it seemed about 2-3 miles away due west. there was cloud cover in all directions, except for this large clear patch stretching maybe 2 miles w-e around us & 1-2 miles n-s. low, wispy clouds were prevalent closest to us on the w, sw, & nw and a big cloud wall was to the e, ne, & se. the air felt extra humid for denver. i feel lucky that there was this break in the cloud cover for us to see it. the entire viewing from first noticing lights to it disappearing was 3-5 minutes. neither of us had seen a ufo before this. we don't drink or do drugs. we regularly take night walks with the dog & look up at the stars. we have both seen a stealth over denver in daylight. that gave me an ominous feeling, this ufo did not. it was silent the whole time. no red or blue blinking lights. it was definitely not a conventional aircraft. although i wasn't scared at the time (i always thought i would be if i saw a ufo), i've been a little nervous since. didn't take a walk the next night or two, haha. posted on facebook initially & a friend said to post here. hadn't heard about mufon before;

no sound was present. the time was 1:21am; and as i drove onward, the light descended and flew about 4 feet above the ground. i was able to clearly see it light the ground up red. it flew parallel to my vehicle and just about kept the same speed as my vehicle (65mph). the orb itself, was red, and emitting a red glow - darker red in the center, brighter red around the edges. it was to the left of the vehicle, approx 50 yards away. at this point i was feeling panicked, afraid and curious.\r\n\r\nas the road turns, i broke sight of the light and while i was turning the bend, a bright light caught my attention in the corner of my eye. the orb, now bright white, and approx 8 inches in diameter, was now flying alongside my vehicle, no more than 8-12 inches above the road. it was flying on the shoulder of the on-coming lane and kept perfect speed with my vehicle (65mph). the time was now 1:24am. while viewing this object, i had no feelings of emotion and i was calm and collected. no noise, besides engine noise was noted, the only notable difference was the presence of cellphone signal (there usually is none). it followed my vehicle for a quarter mile, and it sped up 2 car lengths in front of me and abruptly made a 90 degree turn, upward into the sky, at which point, i leaned forward to see it shoot across the sky, like a shooting star toward the east. it was not as bright when i saw it disappear in the sky.\r\n\r\ni arrived at my destination at 1:36am. as i was pulling into the driveway, my headlights shone upon a rabbit, sitting where i was about to park. i stopped within 3 feet of the rabbit, which did not move, flinch, blink, of any sort. it was very large and from the ground to the top of the head (not including the ear length) about the height of my hood (approx 37 inches tall). it's width was approx 20 inches wide and it was brown and white mixed color with no distinct pattern or spots. it's eyes were black and it was sitting upright, like that of a cat. the ears were very stiff, long and together, and they were slanted back at an angle, like that of a jackrabbit. at this point, i began to panic, and i called a 2nd party to tell them of what i was seeing. the car remained running with the headlights on and i sat staring at this huge rabbit for about 5 minutes. after talking, i turned my engine and headlights off, and with the outside light from the house, i was able to keep eye contact with the rabbit as i exited the vehicle and proceeded to walk slowly around the rear of the vehicle and into the house, not breaking sight. the area seemed to be still and calm; i did not hear any usual night noises (bugs chirping, dogs barking, etc). once inside, i remained on the phone until 2:12am. \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":29703,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.2047916,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08082011-0030","longitude":-111.636249,"occurred":1308903660000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1312824136000,"summary":"Red orb that changed to white, approx 8in diameter","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":45,"locationName":"Flagstaff, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:51940"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"The big ship was the size of a football feild long and half a football feid wide and there all diference like of light under the ship. in the middle the ship there was like a window that go all around it. i look like to me hovered over the trees cross the country road that is. i can tell you more if you like to know more ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:15:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":29702,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.8487932,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06242011-0011","longitude":-84.2618679,"occurred":772518120000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kentucky","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1308957422000,"summary":"Will where there frist two smalls ships . then the the big one .

redwood city, ca. i was on woodside road in the direction of central ave. when i saw a cluster of silver or blackish sphere/circular objects. it reminded me of the cluster ufo videos you find online, but these were dark.\r\n\r\ni immediately said \"holy ****\" out loud in the van. i pulled into the parking lot of karakade thai cuisine in the woodside road/central ave. area. all though there were plenty of people around, including people talking in the driveway nobody looked up to notice. i had my camera phone out and all. \r\n\r\nthese objects were hovering in formation for several minutes. at first, they were headed towards me (south-ish, not exactly sure on the coordination) but when i parked they were headed back north where they were coming from (from sf, redwood city area) and upward. i thought for a minute that maybe they were a group of balloons, but that quickly changed.\r\n\r\nas i watched and tried to record one of the balls came down semi-low. it was the strangest looking thing. it kept reflecting light from the sun but it looked red-ish in color but also looked like a sheet flapping in the air but in a ball. it was a solid object but it looked like it had waves in it. does that make sense? it was visibly not a balloon.\r\n\r\nonce again, all of these objects stayed in standard formations. triangle, orion's belt-like, etc. if they were balloons, would there be this many? there were over 10-20 of them at first. the reflections on them were intense at times. \r\n\r\nwhile filming, many of them disappeared over time. the final three were lined up in an \"orion's belt\" shape across the sky. they never strayed away from each other all though they were very distant a part. you could tell they were connected somehow. these objects i could no longer see the object, they were now just white lights. as the white lights hovered and looked star like, they just got higher and higher into the atmosphere until i could not see them. \r\n\r\nwhen reviewing my videos/photos only one of the out of 20 objects showed up on one photo. none of them showed up on video. even while filming i noticed they would not appear on camera.\r\n\r\nhere's the interesting thing... while reviewing my videos i noticed white balls fly across the sky at very high speeds. \r\n\r\nthe video i uploaded consists of two videos combined. this video is at 0.25x speed. which means it is much slower than the original footage. i have the original footage available upon mufon's request. \r\n\r\nthe photo uploaded has one ufo in the bottom center. you can zoom in to see

stopped for a smooch, when suddenly, i see what from my perspective, giant headlights to my left. they were spaced far wider than a standard plane's lights. and then, it did almost nearly a 90 degree barrel roll- and held that position for something like 2 minutes. while we're (or at least i was) goggling this sight- it traveled out of our sight behind a tobacco barn, and- well, we didnt see it for well past 30 seconds. it should have popped out from behind it in less than 10- at the speed and altitude it was going. it just simply.... took too long to appear. i started up the road, intent on looking for it (i was 40 feet from the building), i was 3/4 of the way back to it, when my g/f says 'here it comes!'it went over us, and right on cue (it had been completely silent the entire time) i said 'uh, where's the engine noise?' whoosh! suddenly, engine noise!\r\n\r\nwhat happened next, i am not proud of, but it's sure to bring a chuckle... i was carrying a 9 iron, you know... just in case. as this thing got closer (noting the fact there were no formation lights, it had wings far too wide, and my g/f swears up, down and sideways the cockpit was the size of a bay window- it was far wider and longer than a standard cockpit window- more on that later)... i ended up 100% *convinced* it was not of this planet. it was headed for us, far too slowly, and basically stayed less than 45-50  feet up. was i scared? oh, hell no! i jumped up and down in absolute, unmitigated, unrestrained insane glee, holding the putter. and then realized i had no camera, and swore like a sailor in port. needless to say, the thing flew on, and disappeared behind some trees, completely.\r\n\r\n*ahem*. anyways, even during this incredibly ridiculous display- i and my g/f noted the following:\r\n\r\nno windows other than the cockpit. not even a lit 'the door is here' one.There's discussion as to it even *having* a standard door- it was the left side of the craft- where doors usually are...\r\n\r\nthe cockpit window was 10% longer than a standard jet cockpit. also, it was a continuous piece of window, not broken up by anything holding it up. i also have been told, it was a lot taller as well.\r\n\r\nthe 'cabin lights' were on, and unfortunately, all my g/f could see was a shape. yes, it was that close. \r\ni noticed wings too far up on the body, just too wide for the amount of 'jet', the 'on cue' engine noise, and the fact there was no jet wash. none. not even a slight breeze. \r\n\r\nthere were no formation lights, only something akin to spotlights on the 'wings'. the underside of the wings were white metal, but instead of smooth and wheel well markings- it was a v shape from cockpit back as far as i could see in the craft lighting.\r\n\r\nit was going hella slow for the altitude it was maintaining. \r\n\r\nwhat the hell took it so long to go behind, and then past the other side of a smallish, thin building? my theory is it stopped to hover. \r\n\r\na nearly 90 degree smooth as silk roll? for 2 min?? also, i think it did do it for our benefit. as for the jet sound... there was something off about it, but i am just not sure what.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),  Patterned Surface,  Louvres,  Wings","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then

travel (on my way to work ).\r\n\r\nevent: as i turned onto the southbound feeder road i observed a white blinking light in the sky. it pulsed rapidly 4 times, then a short pause, then pulsed 4 times again it was this blinking that drew my attention to the lights. it seemed to be in the flight path for abia but the strange pattern of the flashing made me want to check and see if it was. after merging onto hi 35 southbound i looked for the light again, i located it and observed it was traveling on a ssw course and i expected it to turn as does all air traffic but the lights did not follow the air traffic pattern but instead continued ssw. at this time i was driving under hwy 45 (toll), after passing under the overpass i noted the position angle from me to the lights at position angle 3. again i noted that the lights flashed in a burst of 4, no other colored lights ever showed during my entire observation of this ���object���. at approximately 2220 i observed the lights change from a single flashing light to three flashing lights. they would start on the left pulse 4 times,  then the ���original��� lights  (center ones) would flash 4 times, then there would be 4 pulses on the right. the distance between the 3 lights appeared to be from wing tip to wing tip of a commercial airliner that i frequently observe on the flight path to abia.  at approximately 2225 i lost track of the lights as they faded into the distance / i prepared to exit the hwy. \r\n\r\nbeing a trained observer (os1, trained the lookouts aboard ship / sea combat air controller, controlled various aircraft while they preformed their missions.)i watch the air traffic in the area... and wish i was controlling aircraft again. when i first observed the single flashing light i thought it may be a helicopter or a plane making an approach to abia. when i looked again it had not made the turn that air traffic does during their approach to the airport nor did i observe any other colored lights. when the other white lights began flashing i had the impression that they ran in a single line across the back of something in the air. to me they seemed to be ���tail lights���, for lack of a better description. \r\n\r\ni have never observed lights of this nature before and i am left wondering just what i observed flying in a ssw direction over austin, texas on this night.
