thanks for writing. please report your ufo experience at the mutual uf...\r\n1:51 am (8 hours ago)\r\nreply\r\n[name removed/cms/tg] to roger\r\nshow details 1:55 am (8 hours ago)\r\ni will report tomorrow..I'm just stunned that they are real i've always believed but to see was crazy like a cruise liner in the sky also there was a hum maybe a freq made me feel so terrified i feel like such a coward that i didn't get a picture..I'm down for an interview but first i got to get some sleep ty for reponding fast.\r\n\r\nsent from my iphone\r\n- show quoted text -\r\n reply\r\n forward\r\nreply\r\nroger marsh to me\r\nshow details 2:05 am (8 hours ago)\r\nthanks, [name removed/cms/tg]. get some sleep. i just walked in the door and checked my email before going to bed. glad to have responded so fast. my personal sighting was incredible too - was within 30 feet of a disc-shaped object. wild. talk soon. let me know when you're up for a chat. thanks for filing the report tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nnow i'm just like incredibly interested in what i saw. it really had like a military feel to it and the blinking red light i think kinda leans toward that way. but really i want to get across that it had a very dark ominous feeling and was terrified by the sheer size. i have always believed and been curious about ufos and read the internet article here or there but i'm like really happy to know now that they're real. truthfully i thought if i ever saw one it would be from far and maybe a cool color changing thing but no what i saw was a.) close b.) gigantic and c.)bright white lights almost like a airplanes but like 3 times as bright. also i'm now just even more curious to see if anyone else reports this..There was a car behind me at the time on windsor-perrineville they had to of seen this thing it was huge and incredibly bright, again i mistaken it for the moon so there you go. i'm a filmmaker and would like to investigate all of nj's cases and would happy to do a phone interview or talk with whoever. this was scary in person but exciting after the fact, very happy that they're true.\r\n\r\n-[name removed/cms/tg]","distance":"501 Feet -

it started to move into the dipper of the big dipper. as it moved in the flash diminished yet i could still see its faint movement as the light dies down. they always seem to enter that way or even when they leave just opposite. they enter with a bright flash and light and move to their flight pattern. cloaking or just powering down changes the intensity of the crafts  . . . well, for lack of a

traveled in a northernly direction.  they all traveled consistantly and maintained regular flight path.  none left contrails or had any flashing lights or strobes.  typical jet airliners were also

dont believe these are satelites just becase four passed over in the same flight paths in a matter of minutes.  also satelite flare outs (bright to dim) happens when the solar panel escape the setting

one craft raced the entire horizon east to west in about 3-5 seconds, it moved so fast that i could not get the camera on it.  it let 3 lights pulses out that were very very bright and intense.  its

the horizon for several miles, i noticed there were actually four \"stars\" forming a gentle arc.  i quickly picked up my camera and snapped a picture of the objects.  the lights did not move nor blink, they were white stationary points of light, exactly what a star in the night sky looks like.  my camera info shows i snapped the picture about 8:18 pm but my clock in the car read 7:45pm or so.

noticed some flashing lights to my left up in the sky. i live near an air force base so i'm used to seeing planes and flashing lights but these lights caught my attention. i observed the two red-orange lights flicker/flash and soon realized they weren't two separate objects, but they were the lights of one craft moving together. i can't quite explain the distance apart, but they were definitely too far apart to be any normal airplane. eventually the lights, which were moving rather fast, became just one light; or shall i say one light disappeared. one light flashed by itself for approximately 15 seconds. as soon as the second light reappeared a third light seemed to flash 2-3 times right behind the first light. that's when my interest really peaked. by this time the lights had traveled pretty far across the sky and that's when i noticed that the two separate lights moving together were actually 1 light spinning in a super fast circle. it also seemed to have a slight slant to it. for the next minute and a half, approximately, the spinning light moved further and further away until it couldn't be seen anymore. what impressed me the most was how fast it made its way across the sky. also, the way the lights flashed/flickered were unlike any flashes i've seen in the sky before. the seemed to skip almost and it became more clear once i realized the two lights were just 1 light spinning fastly around its ship. i first thought it was just an airplane, i see them all the time. but as it made its way across the sky and started turning from 2 to 1 to 3 and back to 2 lights rotating, i figured i was observing something very different. over the past 2 years i have become a believer in et but have still remained a skeptic. i never expected to have my own ufo encounter, and still wonder if it was some unknown military craft or indeed a ufo. i attempted to take a video but my camera isn't the best and i couldnt seem to capture or focus on the lights.

drive to the nearest school rugby field (rondebosch boys' high school) to get a betterview. on the field that object mentioned continued further away from us, however it was definitely not in a regular way and also was definitely visible in an area of sky (low to the horizon) in which no other stars could be seen due to smoggy conditions. the object became more distant and on the way back to our vehicle we spotted a far closer yellow-orangey light moving, as well as an identical object to the one described to the north (opposite direction to the original one we had viewed for more than an hour). the yellow-orange light/object immediately thought by us to be an aeroplane sudde then suddenly changed direction and came toward our direction. it became extremely clear that the object was a bright glowing disc (oval from where we were standing) that quickly disappeared in the direction to the north. after this close sighting of a definite object of superior technology we excitedly all jumped into my friend's car and drove to an even bigger open space around the corner called rondebosch common. when we arrived there at around 1030pm all 3 objects had

seconds later i realized they were moving toward our direction. they were not moving the same direction as the stars. they were big,very bright white and silent one was behind another to its 5 o'clock position. my brother has binoculars and he got them and he says through them he couldn't make out anything but light. i ran inside to get my mother because i wanted her to see them (this took about 15 seconds maybe less) as we stepped out the door he said to our mom look right there and then they were gone, they hadn't been close to being overhead yet. he said in the split second he took the binoculars down and back up to keep looking they were gone, he didn't see how they left, at the speed they were going they still should have been there. he went around the front of the house to see if he could spot them and couldn't. about 10 minutes later we saw (it could have been a satelite but i dont think so) another bright white light heading (i think) south to north it seemed to change speed but also the brightness of it faded away and went from a large bright white dot to a very small one until we couldnt see it anymore. about another 10 minutes later i saw a very small white dot heading again south to north at a steady speed then it took a 90 degree turn north east and out of my viewing range. we saw over the next little while some other small white dots moving around in unregular patterns. i've never seen anything like this and i've seen ufos before. this happened over about the period of an hour between 10:30 and 11:30 eastern daylight time in west roxbury (boston) ma. june

[it is important to note that in the west there was still some light from the setting sun so it's not like the craft simply turned off it's light beacons and flew off.] \r\n\r\nthe lights on the ship went dark immediately but watching the second ufo it's outline remained there for a tiny amount of time as well before just vanishing completely. after this i still heard the jets pass straight over me in the direction where the objects had vanished before coming about and circling a few times before heading south and fading away. again i never had a visual contact on any of these jets, although several other people who were listening also agreed that it couldn't be a commercial jet. \r\n\r\nimmediately after this event while i was trying to figure out what happened was when i connected this with another strange thing i had seen in the same location a few weeks earlier when again, two ufo's of the same profile appeared at about the altitude but maybe a bit further away. however during this sighting they were flying at speeds far greater than what they displayed march 17 and to me seemed impressive speed at that distance for a military fighter to match. one came in from the west diving at about a 30 degree inclination, while the second came from the east diving at about a 45 degree inclination. \r\n\r\nthey appeared to be at approximately the same distance from me and their flight paths crossed perfectly both of the crafts missing by what seemed like a couple meters. at the bottom of the dive one craft vanished still going very fast while the other made an 80 degree course correction and continued flying at the same speed. \r\n\r\nthat's basically it, i haven't been back there for a while so i haven't seen them again but i'll definitely be looking.

(facing south east) it is hard to see the whole sky there, since there are many trees, but almost directly over us is a good clearing.  it was just before midnight and one star caught my eye, because it looked like it was flickering, almost like a candle flame. as i stared, i noticed it was not a single flickering star - it was a single light that was getting brighter and dimmer, but also with several smaller lights immediately around it that were flashing randomly and sporadically. these lights were much dimmer & hard to see next to the center bright light. it seemed to move slightly side to side & my wife was noticing the color change slightly from bright white to a hue of reddish, back to white, then greenish, and back to white again. by slightly, i mean the overall color had a reddish or greenish tint to it - the main light was still white. it only moved slightly side to side - almost unnoticeable, then would hold stationary.  we watched for about 4 minutes and saw the light move in small circles, up, down, etc., but still staying in the same relative area.  it stayed just above the tree from our view.  i then noticed a second similar light to the right of this one. it appeared & got a little brighter and dimmer like the first. as we watched both, they seemed to be moving exactly the same, as if attached.  within 30 seconds, my wife saw a third light just like the other 2 & it was already in motion or sync with the other 2 lights.  this third light appeared more above the second light, but when looking at all 3 together, if you connected the dots, it made an equilateral triangle shape. i attempted a picture, but there was too much light interference. i wasn't scared, but kind of excited and nervous. at this time, my dog started howling - which i thought was weird, because he was inside the house & i have only heard him howl one other time.  i went inside & he looked freaked out- eyes bugged out, ears down & shaking. i took him out to go potty, hoping that's all he needed.  when i was out with my dog, i walked him down the south walkway & looked out between a clearing of trees from our driveway. i saw a very bright light (to the south west) it was moving the same as the others, but looked bigger, brighter, and closer, so the movements were more obvious. it would almost jump to the left, then up and to the right, bouncing & stopping.  after about a minute, the light faded out to nearly nothing. as this light faded, another light to the right of this one appeared and got brighter.  then, this second light faded & the first one got brighter again.  they did this back and forth a few times. i didn't see the second light move, it was stationary and didn't get quite as big/bright as the other.  the first light only seemed to move when it lit up. after it dimmed out, it would again illuminate in the same place, then move around, then stop, and fade out as the other one got brighter. my wife could not witness this second sighting because her neck was messed up from looking up for too long.  i checked back on the first 3 lights & they were still in place.  we agreed we were being watched over & called it a night!
