a star team investigator for kansas mufon.  we had a spectacular ufo sighting while on the last leg of our trip from kansas city to piedmont, mo, located in the se corner of missouri in wayne county.  \r\n\r\nthe duration of the trip should have been six hours according to my gps.  with stops taken into consideration, we should have arrived at 9:30 p.M., but we arrived at our destination at 10:37 p.M., so we had over an hour of missing time. we cannot account for the missing time. \r\n\r\nas i was driving south on 67 highway past farmington at the very south edge of francious county, i noticed a bright object in the sky to the east.  the object appeared to be three very bright lights in a triangular pattern. it was approximately the size of a large pea held at arm's length. the object was much brighter than any planet (5 x brighter than venus) and was bluish/white in color.  it was at approximately 50 degrees off the horizon and ene of our position. it appeared to get larger and clearer as i watched it. i also had an uneasy feeling, which started before i saw the object.  \r\n\r\ni asked my passenger (the other mufon investigator) to take a look at the object, so he opened the sunroom of my suv and watched it. he said the object moved to the north, and when i looked it was gone.  he watched several shooting objects without tails moving from west to northeast, but behaving like shooting stars.  then three long white lights appeared, moving very fast from a ne to sw direction.  the first triangular object appeared and disappeared three times.  these objects moved around the sky for approximately fifteen minutes.  the skies clouded over and we lost sight of the objects. we were both very uneasy about the entire sighting, and thought it was coincidental that this occurred while we were on our way to the piedmont ufo festival where i was speaking.  \r\n\r\nwhile at the event, my computer, which contained the power point presentation on ufo sightings in missouri, was stolen from my locked vehicle. it has since reappeared in my house on my dining room table, minus the power point presentation i was going to use and another one on a different ufo case.  the laptop was not there last night, but was this morning. i am absolutely positive it was in my vehicle, since we discussed taking it inside on the first day of the event (friday), but i said no since i didn't need it until saturday, and moved it to a different spot in the back seat.\r\n\r\nalso notable: we had some paranormal events happen at the house we were staying at in piedmont, which consisted of scratching and banging noises on the outside of the house and a glass breaking sound inside the house, which two of us heard, as well as some objects moved to different locations.  i had a strange dream about being abducted and restrained on a ufo, but that may be just a dream given the circumstances. \r\n\r\nattached are google earth pictures with the location of the first sighting noted and the location of our destination.  note that east of our first position where the first ufo was spotted is the mississippi river.\r\n

gazing up at the stars when i noticed what appeared to be a very large, bright, white object in the western sky about a third of the way up from the ground towards the sky's zenith. when i first noticed it, it was stationary and i thought it might be a planet, though it appeared to me larger than i have ever known a planet to appear. as i watched, this object suddenly grew slightly larger with a flash of white light then immediately shrank down to the size of the surrounding stars. as i kept my eye on it the small light slowly begin moving upwards toward the zenith of the star field, faded away and was gone about 5 seconds after it started moving.\r\nabout 10 minutes later i noticed two very large, bright white objects in the southern sky. they appeared exactly as the first object did in brightness and size and they appeared to be about a hands width distance apart if i stretched my arm out in front of me. the lights were rather high in the sky, about 2/3 of the way up from the ground to sky's ceiling. they were positioned vertically to one another. i watched them in this stationary position for at about 10 seconds.  at that time they shrank down to the size of stars and then begin moving together toward the west very slowly.  they appeared to move together as one unit, keeping an equal distance apart as they moved. they grew dimmer and disappeared about 5 seconds after they started moving.\r\ni kept watching the sky for about 30 minutes after the last sighting but i never saw any other usual lights. i was very curious what these lights could have been and i

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was on vacation in sedona, az.  i brought my canon 5d mark ii 21.1 megapixel camera and tripod to do some photography of the stars.  i've never really read the directions so i just used the automatic settings.  various ones preset on the camera.  one setting allowed longer exposures to get better light into the camera.  that evening, me and my girlfriend are in heavy winter gear, it's an absolutely clear night, the moon is out, and it is slightly windy.  the temperature is about 25 degrees fahrenheit.  we only stay about 30 minutes because even with our gear on we're freezing out butts off.  we didn't notice the object until we got home and uploaded it to my macbook pro 17\" laptop.   i didn't notice the object even after first run through, as i was looking for the airplane as a baseline of what a time exposure picture looked like.  a friend was taking a second look and noticed the objects.  she noticed it right away.   this was the first time i have ever had a personal experience with a ufo / or unexplained phenomena.  i had to review he picture over and over and rationalize and justify that nothing on the planet that i know of moves like this object does.  obviously airplanes fly in usually one trajectory and look like one line or a smeared color from it's lights on the wing tips... and the flashing produces a brighter dot, at regular intervals.   i lost sight of object when i turned the camera and continued fishing, towards the north, towards the sedona airport.\r\n\r\nso i shoot towards the moon as a baseline, which was nearly perfectly west.  if you were at bell canyon, just north one rest area... there is a pull off to view the sky and stars, on the west side of the road.  we setup the camera on a tripod and start shooting.   using an aluminum tripod (of not that great quality) i was able to get a number of shots of the sky.  i decided to see what an airplane looks like in a picture using a longer exposure (set by the camera).  i zoom out to about 190mm, of the 200mm lens on my canon ef 70-200mm l ultrasonic lens.  the lens is a $1500 accessory.  i'm shooting with the canon 5d mark ii which runs about $3500.  so the setup is about $5000 plus the tripod.    in 4 of the pictures i capture movement, and some smearing of the stars / and airplane path.  and then later i noticed the \"star\" like object that moved in 3 different frames, all time delayed 6 seconds.  in the first frame you see the star / ufo start at the bottom, move up, then to the right, then to the left in a curve, then up and stop.  you'll see the object \"radiate\" light brighter than any other object, and it has haze around the image.  no other stars or the airplane even look like this.   in the 2nd picture the ufo/ object moved in the exact opposite direction, while the plane in the bottom of the picture has moved more north.  you'll also see the shadow of the tree line as i was shooting at about a 20 degree angle above the horizon.  in picture 3 of 3, you'll see the object start at the bottom, move to the left, then curve back down and to the right, then up stopping there, and you'll see the object \"glowing\" near the top.  you'll still see the airplane in the frame near the bottom.   however since i moved the camera to the north, you'll have to align the object by the nearby stars to make sure it's the same object, which it is.  then i took a wide angle shot of the entire sky.... and it looks like there are 3-5 objects moving in sync.... unless it's just the lens smearing from camera/tripod shake... but if so... why aren't the other stars all smeared like the 3-5 brighter objects.   all of these are shooting directly west and to the north west a few degrees north of due west.  the moon is directly behind me, and that could be the reason why the object is \"glowing\" or emitting a light source back to the camera.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

birds. then a flock of sea gulls flew past. then from higher above these birds came down what look like confetti. they came spiraling down then all would fly off in a different direction and disappear. all except for two. they came down spiraling like others except turned south and flew in a straight line. one slightly higher than other. parallel to each another. the bottom one was slightly ahead. they then stopped and just sat there. my daughter and i were watching and kept staring. i asked her if she sees what i see and she described it the same way. we were just puzzled but not scared. told her wanted to make sure i'm not seeing different. after 3-5 minuets they faded from sight. when she couldn't see them to well she said i don't want to look away or i won't find it. that was funny to me and i said i was just thinking those exact words. i would say they must have been 6 feet wide. either like balls or maybe disc shape. but an egg would be accurate to. couldn't tell if they were flat. when they spiraled down they look like disc shaped paper. so maybe they were flat. i think width of 6 feet because they were much higher than the birds. in fact birds kept flying without changing direction. they weren't frightened or afraid of colliding. telling me this object(s) were not close to them. yet from my perspective looked about same size of larger black birds i believe to be buzzards . they have a large wingspan. i would estimate maybe 3 feet from tip to tip. so if objects were higher than it would be larger. my guess is they were larger than the birds. it couldn't be debris. how and why would two pieces turn in a straight line then just stop in mid air? and there was no sound but it did seem far up to maybe be heard. my daughter was ok but now she is a bit scared and doesn't like to talk about that day. she doesn't deny seeing them just refuses to think of them as ufo's. i'm still puzzled to this day at what it could've been.

manhattan. i was driving on the grand central parkway heading east bound to the cross island parkway at 3:45 am on sunday june, 19 2011. when i noticed this bright star like object in the sky to my right. it looked like it was moving, but i'm not sure if it was to me being in motion or not. so i kept monitoring this bright lit thing in the sky. i was trying to distingiush if it was a star or a plane. when i merged onto the cross island parkway south bound, i decided to pull over on the side of the parkway at the union turnpike exit ramp besides the parkway. i put the car in park, and could see this bright lit thing to my left now. i observed it for about for about 2-3 minutes before driving off. i did notice, it wasn't moving. so i knew it wasn't a plane. another thing, i took notice of, was that it wasn't pulsating like a star. it just seemed to stand out, because there was no other stars, or clouds in the sky. it also seemed bigger then a usual star, and maybe not as far as a star. i might be wrong, and it could possibly be a star. but, i decided to take a picture at 3:49 am. to my surprise when i got home minutes later and looked at the picture, and zoomed in on my iphone. i noticed it had a shape to it. i thought, that was unusual. i do have a understanding of ufo's, as i've been intrigued in the subject for years. i've never had a sighting before, but i don't look up as often as some people do. but, i do know the difference, between planes, stars, and other things. i wish i had taken more pictures, and monitored it longer. since, it didn't move, i decided to go home. i texted to my girlfriend at 3:59 am. i also emailed it to a close friend at 4am.","distance":"Over One

to an ambulance that was heading toward the rome/mossville area.  i was listening to station 99.9 and noticed that it quite abruptly turned to static as i passed an abandoned fuel station.  as soon as i passed the station i saw two very large, orange lights just hovering above the cemetary at the corner of rt. 29 and cloverdale road and my blood ran cold.  i immediately turned right on cloverdale and pulled into the cemetary.  people were pulling into mcdonalds across the street and jumping out of their cars, pointing at the lights.  i turned off my headlights and got out of my car, grabbing my cellphone.  i called my brother right away and told him to get down to the cemetary immediately, explaining what i was seeing.  \r\n\r\ni watched them for next few minutes as they just stayed above the cemetary, not moving.  the one on the right moved closer to the one on the left, which was much closer to me, and that's when i saw the top of the larger one from the light being reflected off of it.  it was teardrop shaped or cone shaped, the base being the largest part and glowing an extremely bright orange.  the very top had these long spikes coming out of it that sort of went out and down instead of pointing up.  i estimate there were at least 10 or 12 of them from the side that i could get a look at.  the smaller one started heading off toward the field behind the cemetary and the bigger one followed.  \r\n\r\ni called my brother back and told them that they were on the move, but within 40 seconds or so they just sort of dimmed and were gone.  they didn't disappear behind anything and they didn't just \"turn off\"...They just dimmed their lights down and were gone.  i got back into my car and started driving down cloverdale toward where they had gone.  when i reached the high school on bradley i noticed a helicopter heading straight in their direction.  my brother called me a minute later to tell me that he'd seen one of them disappear by the high school and then saw the same helicopter heading toward truitt, about 6-8 blocks away from where one of them had disappeared.  we weren't able to make much sense of it, but definitely believe that the helicopter was

about it i feel the hairs stand up on the back of my neck.  unfortunately, i only thought to call my brother and it never dawned on my to take pictures.

a few years ago, on a whim, we went to roswell while traveling. i reported my story at the museam. one of the staff members said to me \"oh, you saw a mother ship\"! i wonder if it's true.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":29612,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.2779974,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06182011-0013","longitude":-118.779902,"occurred":420620400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,   Rectagular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1308450562000,"summary":"Flew low over house humming sound, lights, a lot of detail underneath","tags":["sound","lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":10275,"locationName":"Simi Valley, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:52377"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Valdez","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"  i recall that it was a beautiful sunny morning, just a perfect temperature sort of day.     we were both single men from michigan, my buddy lived in town and, at that time, i lived at the valdez marine terminal construction camp.     we both had sunday off and had decided to have a good breakfast and take a cruise up the highway.     i was impressed that the day seemed very quiet and sleepy.     there were few people up and about as we had breakfast.\r\n      we left pickin' our teeth and had no well-defined destination in mind so i just turned right out of \"the totem\" restaurant and motel.     it was just s relaxed and quiet sunday morn.     \"the totem\" was just on the edge of this little alaskan community and my right-hand turn points you at a tight left-hand turn in the highway only a few hundred feet away.     \r\n      as we began the swing into this left-hand turn in the highway we both had our attention stolen by what abruptly entered into our field of view just off the highway to our right approximately 150' - 175' away.\r\nit was so bizzare that i made a conscious decision to concentrate on a couple of specific items so that i might recall those items later on.\r\n( i fully realized at that moment just how unusual this was to my routine everyday sights and nothing before lent any perspective so i was just trying to instill common sense to the moments of this unique observation !!)\r\n\r\n      i state the following with great confidence:\r\n\r\n     the \"craft\" .... oval in shape .... approx. 30' - 35' diameter .... the exact color and transluscence of new bubblegum ater chewing it for only a couple of minutes and then blowing a bubble, ( lotsa sugar still in it to give it that luminescence ).    it was 6.5' - 8.0' in height.              around the outside perimeter was a feature that looked a lot like lab hose, ( +- 3/4\" ).     i estimate the diameter of this \"hose\" to be three quarters of an inch, and, individual lights revolved inside the \"hose\" every  4' - 5', in a counter-clockwise flow.      the light looked as though it expanded the \"hose\" as it traveled from left to right around the craft.     i recall being particularly impressed by the ability for the hose which, at the same time seemed so much a part and parcel of the craft,  seemed to effortlessly expand and then contract as the light coursed it's way around. \r\n      when i saw enough of the foregoing i began to catch glimpses before i drove out of view around said corner, leaving my friend to continue his observation before it went out of his view also.       glimpses:    i'm sure that i saw a ramp dropped from the belly of this craft, approximately 4' - 5' wide and 6' - 7' long.      i believe i observed two metallic extensions which comprised at least a part of the \"landing gear\".      last, but certainly not least, i saw two small grey-green animals, that looked like the stereo-typical description of \"aliens\".     at this distance of 50 or sixty yards i cannot provide any specific details.      they were 4' - 5' tall, seemed to be in a quandary, ( i got a very distinct feeling that they were caught with their pants down and were in much of a hurry.      then, they were out of my line of sight.\r\n      i saw my buddy turning to look out his window as i continued round the corner and, perhaps ten seconds later, sitting on the edge of the seat he turned staring vacantly out the windshield .... ( his mind was very obviously involved with what he'd just seen ).      i said, \"did you see what i just saw\"!?!      he did not answer and simply continued to look straight out the front windshield.      for the third time i began to ask him that same question when he abruptly turned to me and nearly shouted, \"you're ******* right i did\", and immediately got that far-away look in his eyes again.      i said, should we turn around and go back!?!      he immediately and with emphasis replied, \"no!!\"      i drove as far as the \"salmon turnaround\", ( +- 2 tenths of a mile away from the corner we'd made our observations ), and turned around there and went back.      it was nowhere to be seen and my friend was against going out toward the beach area where we'd seen it.      i searched the skies for it or a contrail or anything that would tip off its location.      i looked at the beach for skid marks, and the immediate mud-flat and water for a wake or concentric circles of it going beneath the water.     nothing.      i'll estimate that from the moment we saw the craft until we returned to the site and found it gone was less than four minutes.      my friend became increasingly unwilling to discuss the event after a few months and refuses to acknowledge the entire experience these days  ---\"geez, i don't remember\".      \r\nnot acknowledging reality when it is imposed upon us is, i'm convinced, some of the worst of circumstances that we can impose on one another.
