airport and steady ,i keep driving and the sphere was moving very slow south crossing over the airport, at that moment i realized that cannot be a plane if that is moving north to south and the planes land in miami either form west to east or east to west, i took my cellular phone and start recording while driving, when i did crossed 87 ave and them 84th avenue i saw that the sphere had move south of the aiport at about 3 to 5 miles and the sphere was big and super bright,it was emitting a very constant bright flashing lights, i keep recording until i was under the hightway bridge and took the entrance to the highway and i could record anymore since i was taking a 350 degree curb, at that ramp going up i keep seeing the sphere until i was facing north and i lost the sight of it.I was sure that the big sphere was not a plane and the only think that coulb be a big helipcoter, but there was not any metallic forms and i never saw a helicopter produce such of intense flashing lights and how a helicopter will be traveling from north to south over the airport interfering with the air traficc, saw that nigh i look at the local news and i did not hear any  reports of an strange

because i checked. my mom,who was driving, told me to look ahead at the bright \"moon\". turns out it wasn't a moon but a very weird object in the sky. at first we thought it was a blimp that was flying but after we kept looking, it looked very weird. to both of us it seemed as if it were triangular or pyramid like in appearance. also of importance was a blinking red light it had on the bottom. it would blink every 6 seconds or around. also, it looked as if the craft was still but it was moving slowly to the right. after about 2 minutes, we lost sight of it because it the trees blocked it out. 30 seconds into it, we saw it again by the raritan river. it looked even further away and this was with  turnpike being a straight away through all this. i took a video while this was happening. also, it seemed as if it was turning and going away from the turnpike because the red, blinking lights were turning until it wasn't visible. we eventually passed it and we couldn't see it anymore. my mom and i have never seen anything like that so that's why i waited till today to report it. if you guys could message us back with what you think we would greatly appreciate it. thank

grove.  literally right as i turned on the highway i watched what i thought to be an airplane flying in a southerly direction (due to the road traveling east/west in the area) but i then noticed more lights than a conventional aircraft that remained on, no strobing or anything.   i then could make out the shape and noticed it was a v-shaped craft almost identical to one i had seen before during hurricane ike.  i watched as it traveled slowly towards and eventually stop entirely to hover over cellular towers that lay directly east of my location (or right in front of me as i traveled down that particular part of sh 99.)  it sat there for not even a minute when at the very nose of the craft a red light the same color as the cell towers flashed twice in almost a pulsing manner (like the cell towers themselves do).  upon the second 'pulse' all the lights on the craft began to dim dramatically until the only light visible was the red one at the nose which then remained illuminated and disappeared last.   the whole sequence of events played out rather quickly or i would of attempted to take a photograph with my phone.  i remember thinking it was an ordinary airplane during much of the experience like my thoughts on my hurricane sighting until i watched how it could stop and hover, then the adrenaline got going.   i continued to watch to catch it again after it had gone to no avail.  it was a clear night and it wasn't until i had gotten home and was telling my brother about the ordeal that i realized how truly strange the experience was.  i also found it quite interesting that i've seen an object almost exactly like it before over houston's skies.  nasa has got to be experimenting with some sort of craft, that or lackland/brooks are testing said craft in this area of texas.  it might also explain the over abundance of black hawk, chinook, and apache helicopters that have been flying over houston as of

weird, so i looked behind me up into the sky, and i almost (deleted) my pants.  way up in the sky there were two bright orange things almost swirling, but just kind of floating and carving around.  i

saying holy (deleted) holy (deleted) i then whipped my car over to the side of the road, parked that thing and started running full speed back down the road.  the \"fireballs\" were now much further away and looked very distant.  my view was blocked by trees so i had to keep running.  i got to the opening and the were gone. i stood there for a about 15 seconds and then from behind me! i saw two more \"fireballs\" float right over my head! they gained speed and flew up and kind of danced and then procedded to just fade and dissepear.  i had run about 100 yards now and i saw the kid on the other side of the road right by mcdonalds, still with his cell phone recording.  i yelled \"do you know what the hell those things were!\" and he replied \"no!\" so i ran over and we were both just flabergasted and tripping out.  i actually noticed a plane with bright lights approaching and i was so excited i couldn't believe there were cars just driving around oblivious to what just happened.  i watched the video on the kids cell phone and we exchanged phone #s and i went on my way back to my car.  as i was walking back to my car i noticed that the large plane/jet had actually done two

light out (dusk), i guess because the days are so long right now. there were wispy clouds in the sky. i noticed an odd red light low in the sky to my left, through the windshield, as i approached shimerville. i believe this would have made it north-west of shimerville, definitely west of rt 29. i assumed it was an airplane, but i thought it was odd that i only saw a red light, no other color, and it wasn't blinking, it was shimmering. it almost looked like a stoplight hanging way up in the sky. it wasn't a clear well-defined light due to the clouds, which may have accounted for the shimmering. it looked stationary, but since i was moving it was hard to conclude whether the object was also moving or not. i still assumed it was an aircraft of some sort and that our movement relative to each other was what was making it seem like it was hovering. but after a while that seemed unlikely because enough time had passed that it should have displayed more movement than it did, in fact if it was moving at all it was certainly too slow to remain aloft. i started to wonder if it could be some celestial body that was particulary large right now, but there were no other objects visible whatsoever, and it would have been much, much larger than any object i've ever seen in the night sky except the moon, and it was glowing bright red. after a minute or two, it was overhead or behind me so i couldn't see it through the windshield anymore. i couldn't look back because there was a car close behind me, so i made a left into a parking lot, turned, and stopped facing south, where i could see it again. by now, it appeared to be east of route 29. i can't tell if it had actually moved east or if my few minutes of driving had just taken me to the west of it. i watched it for a few minutes, it seemed like it might have gotten slightly dimmer during that time. it may have been rising, and if it was moving at all i'd say it was heading southeast. if you pressed me for an everyday explanation, i'd say it might have been a road flare tied to a balloon or something. whatever it was, it was very odd. when i gave up and turned north again, it was 9:17pm. i just wanted to be on the record in case anyone else reported it

satellites and shooting stars.  i routinely sky watch before going to sleep because it helps me clear my mind.  i was facing north.  i was looking in the direction of cygnus. i had seen two fairly bright satellites traveling from the north to the south over the last half an hour that i was stargazing. i had finished my last cigarette and was taking a couple more moments to take a final look for anything in the sky.  below the constellation cygnus but not as low as lacerta, i saw movement. at first i thought it was a dim satellite but after about 1 second it looked more like a dim shooting star with a short trail. i almost always have my 8x binoculars with me. so, i looked at the object with the binoculars and was shocked to see it was clearly three dimly lit orangish lights. the lights looked slightly out of focus, as my binoculars were focused for seeing the stars. i re-focused and while shifting the focus, the lights looked as if there was a haze or solid craft around the lights. there was darker area surrounding the three round lights.  with all three lights in a horizontal position they looked to be on an elongated oval.  when i first viewed the object with my binoculars the lights looked larger than the bright star in lyra and were of a dim or translucent luminosity.  all three lights were first seen horizontal and spaced evenly apart and very close together. i perceived the three lights to be part of one object.  i am familiar with what planes of different sizes look like from many different angles.  i have seen meteors of many sorts as well as large birds at night and balloons of many types.  this object had no faa required lighting at all and was traveling faster than any planes i have seen above my city. it was not traveling at such a great speed as to be shocking but definitely faster than an average jet. as the object headed nne from it's point of first sighting it seemed to shift so that the lights were now vertically aligned. when it appeared vertically in the sky the lights had more of a brighter white quality than they had when they were in a horizontal position. as the object traveled further towards the horizon it shifted back to a more horizontal position and the lights were again more of a dim orange glow. i lost sight of the object at about 10 degrees above the horizon due to light pollution. this object looked very large in comparing it with my experience of viewing many planes with my binoculars. there were no viable airplanes that i could see but i could hear one south of me. the object that i saw did not seem to make any sound.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

developing oklahoma city and moore, the airport is fairly close and it was common to see or hear airplanes as they approached the airport. that evening i noticed a tall dark object fairly close to us (appx 500ft. away) hovering in the air, was not able to make out much detail from this angle, but it appeared to be as tall as it was wide.\r\n   my friend and i debated and he thought it was just an aircraft etc. but several minutes go by and it apparent this is too stationary, and there is no noise, albit the humming sound comming from the telephone line which was very near us.As we debated on what this was , slowly the craft began a very slow 90 degree turn, as it did so quickly it became apparent what it was, as soon as it began turning we noticed lights also, most striking was a very large triangular light in the dead center with a brilliant white light, it also had a series of colored lights on a lower rung of the craft, we could see it was about 500 ft away and very low flying no more than a hundred feet or so,.\r\n   at this time i became noticably nervous. and had concerns as to what their intentions were, this is the era where cattle mutilations and abducties and experiments were common. my friend, however was ready to approach them and meet them, at this time i  was lit up like a lightbulb with a very brilliant white light, it had no noticable heat, i looked at my friend and we were both shinning white, it was at this time i noticed that we were not casting any shaddow from the light, which struck me as peculiar, with the vehicle in front of us and at the angle the light should have cast a shadow of our bodies, it did not the light completely surrounded us, at the time i assumed, or thought the light was imminating from the large triangular light (which had very soft, rounded corners and was appx. 20-30 feet around) , but i do not remember seeing the light come from the triangular one. \r\n   i was very apprehensive and its like my life passed before me and i did not feel good about the encounter, even though my friend did, and i took only about 2-3 steps back, and slowly convinced my friend to do the same, all this time the craft was still decending slowly directly towards us, my friend finally took a step or 2 back, the light was still shinning on us, remarkably, as if to read our minds the craft stopped when we backed off, several more minutes passed and it just hovered in front of us, shortly there after it made several very quick and non-uniform ascents upward, traveling at an unbeleivable speed, the pattern of flight showed no planning etc, just zig-zaged and finally away.\r\n   through the years i have wandered if the events i remember are all that happened, and to the best i can remember this was the extent of this encounter, i did feel a sense of ease in the fact that when we showed conscious thoughts of apprehention, the craft stopped, this was more than enough evidence to convince me that there was intelligent life guiding it and making decisions, and i admit i felt some respect at the time for not being carried away without my will. \r\n    i have shared this story a few times over the years and as most people shrug it off and do not beleive it, however there is no doubt what the 2 of us saw was very real. years ago i looked at a pamplet which identified all of the ufos seen by people across the world, and sure enough one of the depicitions is indeed very close to what i saw that night, so that at least has given me some comfort.","distance":"101-500

pulsing just looked like a planet or large star till we realized it was moving then in the opposit direction another light appeared with blinking lights like a plane but unmoving we took four pictures on the cell phone but they are too grainy to see detail and get a perspective of size but the object was about four times the size of the surounding stars that were barely visible due to fog. earlier that day around 830 pm i saw two other shining objects while standing outside of work having a cigaret breakin that incident it first seemed to be one object which in a matter of seconds became two identical objects near each other. i am always watching the sky so it was not unusual for me to have looked up but this morning there was no missing it the light was very bright and the first thing i did was say to my son look a ufo at first he said it was probably a planet as it was too big to be a star but when we became certain it moved he told me to go in and get the phone to take the picture i was hesitant to leave him out there alone i did not loose sight of it in fact i am going back out to see if it is still there right now perhaps get a better picture i just wanted to know if any one
