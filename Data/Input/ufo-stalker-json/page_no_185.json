abought 10. or 10.45. pm . i went out back ouf the house to have a cigarette.So i did i was out side smokeing and looking up at the stars. i notice there was a round cloud that was comming towards where i was it was in the sky. but it was a perfect circle but had a white light but looked like a cloud . moving there was no clouds out that.Night.So i was watching it and then i notice another circle cloud moving fast to catch up to the first one. they still werent that close to me yet so i could see there flight path. once the other circle of misty cloud caught up to the other one. they changed directions and started to go from north east to south west towards going to niagra falls direction. i finished my smoke and went back in to my sisters house and told her i just saw two dome shape clouds moving passing over her house going towards the states. we started talking abought getting me a telescope that can see far into the sky. she knew i was right into believing in ufos. so that was that night, but there was four other times in june and the begging of july that me and my nephew saw a star sitting way up in the sky near the three stars that are the egyptian. stars but there was a fourth one there three time. in three different days. but it was siting there acting like a star untill a jumbo jet started to go towards it the first nigt it started to flicker as the plane was moving closer. as it did the star started moving the first one the first night. it started to move and it went fast as the plane got close it went north east the plan was coming east south. the first night that was june the 3rd, at 11.Pm or 11.30. i was out side watching the star twinkling then took off. the second was june the 6. same place same time and another plane was coming the same way but this time it went south west over toronto,s lake. the next one was on june the 11th. 11.Pm i was out side having a smoke on my back stairs of my small building the fourth star was there again but this time im knot the only one that saw it my nephew was three blocks away . and he saw the same thing i did cause he came to my place and we both started to tell each other abought the star that started to move fast and fly off. we both where freaking out that we both saw it and we where far apart from each other , the only thing is i wished i had a cell phone with me when the two dome clouds flew up to each other and flew in cinqe with each other. i also saw a lightning flashes in july . but it dident look like lightning . it look like lazers lights. i looked out my living room window around 10.30. that night but there was no clouds in the sky. but i saw a lot of lightning . but the sky was clear. ive been into ufo.S cince i was young. wishing i could atleast see one. some day. and i did 5, times. i know theres things flying in the sky and i know theres other things visiting our planet i knew from a long time. ago. im knot fully indulge in looking but when im out at night i keep looking up to the sky to see if i can see anything . im going to buy one of those telescopes that can see saturn from here it cost 600.00 bucks but im getting it. i know we are knot alone. in the universe. i just wish they come down and show them selfs. then there wouldent be so much fighting around the world cause they would see theres something way bigger than us and more advanced , so the wars would stop. and it make people understand to get along with each other. cause theres a bigger power than whats here. so ive been holding this in for yrs . and i still watch the

i live on lakeshore property. couldve been racoons or some other animal the beach and bluff is abundant with life. but just today i had a unnaturally lucid nightmare that brings me to tears in fear just reviewing it which i can do so vividly. i am reaching out to you as i am concerned for my and sheboygans safety. death is a human construct but i am fearful of the unknown. the dream beganbwith me and my girlfriend being at a nearby neighbors house outside on the porch. no ones around and its evening but very cloudclomy girlfriend laying on a matress naked on the porch. nearby on the right side of the house is a clothes line with an oversized beed sheet about 20 ft x 20 ft blowing in the wind. im standing in front of it. my girlfriend calls to me and i smile. a gust of wind begons and the sheets blow south covwring the bottom view of my girlfriend. than something behing the sheet grabs her legs and pulls her behind the sheets. she begins screaming for my help. but i am paralyzed i cannot move at all. i hear the same growling sounds heard on the beach the other day as my girlfriend screams foe me and says \"an alien is attacoinf her.\" i cant speak or move im vulnerable and the only reason im in thos world is being raped or killed by whatever the fuck is behind this unaturally large sheet. i wake up soaking in sweat, in tears screaming my girlfriends name. my brother wakes up too and we both feel a very odd atmosphere in the house. we search the house and find nothing. pleaee get back to me asap i have no idea what was on the lake or is on the shore.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"02:00:01","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":85317,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.72630600010528,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07242017-0005","longitude":-87.71330754476269,"occurred":1500347100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Wisconsin","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1500877162000,"summary":"Saw a multiple light object ascending into the sky and have detailed footage and pictures of the event. briefly began blinking amd changing colors and ascended into tje sky. watched the unidentified object for 2, after avery brief explosion 4 more objects","tags":["video","sound","ufo","lights","flash"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":1500891946529,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/85317_submitter_file1__0718170347.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/85317_submitter_file2__0718170347c.jpg"],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":30,"maxtempi":86,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":21,"meantempi":70,"meanvism":14,"meanvisi":8,"mintempm":13,"mintempi":55,"minvism":6,"minvisi":4,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":true,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":30,"maxtempi":86,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":21,"meantempi":70,"meanvism":14,"meanvisi":8,"mintempm":13,"mintempi":55,"minvism":6,"minvisi":4,"rain":true,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":true,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"53081","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":6,"locationName":"Sheboygan, Wisconsin","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:4826"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Saint Stephen","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Driving home from work in a eastern direction, i looked up at about 45 degree  to the east and i could see what looked like a star. but it was to bright to see any stars. i thought maybe a plane but i could not see a contrail. i am not saying it was not a plane, but i have seen a lot of planes in the air but this one did not resemble any planes i have seen. it was bright like a star and over about a 5 sec it went from bright to not able to see it at all.

a few more seconds went by and the object hadn't jostled or changed shape or changed direction; in fact, it seemed to be moving in a very straight line and to nw. no variation in its movement could be detected from where we were watching. a few more seconds and we both concluded that it had a definite rigid shape quite unlike a garbage bag--almost a very thin triangle. in addition it hadn't changed speed and was moving at a very consistent speed--no variation and smooth as could be given the wind turbulence on the ground. i suppose i could guess it was moving 45-50 mph but i can't really say for sure. \r\n\r\nwe continued to watch, and followed it----we faced west at first, faced north as it moved along, and finally we ended up facing nw as it continued to move. again--no changes in direction or speed, it was if it had somewhere to be. as mentioned before the clouds just north and nw of us were dark--and as it began to move in front of these darker clouds it remained jet-black. i want it to be clear that the object remained black as it moved in front of darker clouds. still watching--and at this point moving more away from us than closer---it's color changed from black to white. instantly. i figured that an object might look black in front of whiter clouds then white amongst darker clouds, but we concluded that it should have had a white appearance as soon as it was in front of the darker clouds; however, it remained black for a certain period of time against the dark clouds until--in an instant turned white. very white. it kept moving in the same direction but was becoming fainter (in size) but still very visible as a white speck among the storm clouds. at that point it looked as thought it had risen in altitude several hundred feet. i ran inside, grabbed my camera and by the time i had come back--it had vanished. a moment later we saw another whiteish object north and low in the horizon--which i got on camera but was not behaving like the object we had just seen and could have been actual trash.\r\n\r\ntrash? i don't know. i've unfortunately seen plenty of trash in the phoenix skies, especially during monsoon season. i also understand that wind directions and speed changes at certain altitudes. but i also know that  trash bag doesn't \"fly\". this thing flew in one direction--but no other motion could be detected and no quick variations in altitude. it seemed to be moving in one direction, slowly climbing, not bothered one bit by the gusts and changes of wind direction. peculiar to say the least. \r\n\r\nthe video attached is of a plane (so my fiancee and i think). there is a small airport just 1 mile north of us and they do circle around to make their landings. by the time i took this recording we had lost sight of the object we did see which was much higher in the sky, further west (left in the video). again--the video is of something seen shortly after but much less strange and most likely a plane; however, it did look very similar to the object that we did see after it had turned white. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":85313,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.652611354907634,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07242017-0001","longitude":-112.13286122136216,"occurred":1500837300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"N,  A","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1500854954000,"summary":"Black object moving nw changed colors abruptly (black to white) in the north phoenix valley during weather event.","tags":["video","triangle","landing","light"],"timeZone":"America/Denver","timeZoneName":"America/Denver","tweeted":1500871246509,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/85313_submitter_file1__MVI1825.MOV"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"85027","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Phoenix, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:4830"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Queens Village","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Before all of this happened, my friend talked about \"slender man\". for a few days, i continued to have panic attacks thinking about it. couple days later my mother asked me to buy a groceries, and to take out money from the bank. i went to a store which was across the street from the bank and brought the items, and i noticed there was a tall slender male, in a really nice black suit with a hat. his skin was pale, his facial features i cannot remember, he was staring at me as well; thought to myself \"that's really weird\" and was a bit nervous. i crossed the street and entered the bank, continued to think about that weird man, and went to see if he was still by the store while i took money out from the atm. to my surprise, he was in front of the door by the side of the bank outside. that's when i became terrified, and told myself \"if he comes to me or does any thing, i'm knocking his flip;ing head off\" implying i would punch him as hard as i could and keep hitting him. when i got the money and turned back around to see, he was gone. from that day forward, i have not had a panic attack of \"slender man\".

my transportation van was in the shop for servicing and i was using a motorized wheelchair. my daughter and son-in-law and accompanied me in my daughter's truck and were playing leapfrog sure that i had no difficulty because of the darkness. there were no streetlights in the area. i was using a  strobe headlamp so that oncoming vehicles could see me. as i turned from i highwood street onto wetherly street i became aware of the flashing white light approximately 50 yards behind and above me and there was absolutely no sound. i live in the area within the flight path of commercial aircraft approaching landing at lindbergh field in san diego. i thought at first the lights were landing lights of the commercial but noticed there were no navigation lights; just three white lights blinking at the same time. i assumed they were navigation lights, but the craft was too low to have been a commercial aircraft and the was no sound. i am quite familiar with jet engine, helicopter, and reciprocating engine sound and noise. because everything was silent, i stopped momentarily to listen. there were no sound of any kind, human, animal or any type of aircraft. the craft was now directly overhead but it was so dark i could not make out any shape except for the three lights which appeared to be at the points of a triangle. the craft was moving only slightly faster than i. i increased my speed as much as possible and continued up wetherly street. the craft continued above me and moved slightly faster. i estimate i was moving in about 5 to 8 mph. i stopped a second time to listen for any sounds. there were none. as i approach my driveway my daughter had moved her car onto the driveway and sheen and her husband got out. i have a motion sensor light in the driveway which came on at that point. in a normal voice i asked my son-in-law and my daughter if they've heard anything. they both said no. everything was silent in the craft and continued easterly direction and disappeared behind some trees in my neighbor's yard. i called the la mesa police who were unable to verify any savings by their personnel.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

on the back of the house.  seeing what needed to be done to mount a new surveillance camera i had bought to replace the old one and run new wiring.  the sky above was clear and blue.  some clouds off to the west.  \r\n\r\ni noticed off to the east, maybe slightly northeast, something shiny in the sky and began watching it as it approached.  i originally thought it was a passenger jet.  as it got a bit closer i could clearly see it had a shape very similar to a passenger jet but the wings were in the back angled forward, and what looked like smaller wings coming out at a 90 degree angle towards the front of the craft.  it sounds ridiculous but it looked very much like a passenger jet flying backwards.  the main wings seemed larger than those of a passenger jet however.  it also appeared a lot shinier then the jets i see flying over... looking like chrome illuminated by the sun.  and although it appeared slightly larger than a passenger jet flying over at altitude it also looked to be flying much higher, so it must have been much larger.  \r\n\r\ni am somewhere around 30 miles north-northeast of philadelphia international airport and have lived in this area for 42 years.  so i am very familiar with passenger jets flying overhead.  this thing i saw definitely had very large wings at the back of the craft and they were angled forward.  much like if you took a 747, made the wings at least twice as thick front to back and about 30% longer and flew it backwards.  and also much like a jet flying in reverse it seemed to have small wings on the front of the craft but those were at a right angle to the main body, not swept.  it's hard to judge but it seemed to be flying much faster than a passenger jet, and as i said much higher.  if i held a dime in my hand with my arm fully extended that would cover the length and width of the craft from my perspective but although it was a clear sky and the craft was very shiny, looking like it was reflecting the sun, and i could see it's outline fairly clearly, it seemed a oddly distorted due to what i'm assuming was the atmosphere between me and it.  it did not noticeably turn, or alter height or speed.  no sound, no trails behind it.\r\n\r\ni didn't take my eyes off it from the time i first saw it.  it approached from the east-northeast in broad daylight in a clear sky.  i watched it as it flew just about directly overhead maybe a few degrees north, still in a crystal clear sky. i continued watching until it went over the clouds to the west-southwest.  i'm guessing it was about 10 - 15 seconds from the time i noticed it until it went out of view over the clouds the the west.\r\n\r\ni had no feelings other than confusion as i realized it's shape.  i was wondering if it could be a satellite. for appearing (from my perspective) slightly larger than a jet flying above the clouds, but looking like it was much higher in the sky and going a little faster, i thought it must be absolutely huge and moving very fast.  \r\n\r\ni stopped writing and made a sketch in gimp while it was still fresh in my mind.  it's a good approximation of the size and shape of what i saw.  i wish i knew more about the image editing program so i could have portrayed the chrome shininess of it and the atmospheric distortion that made it look so high up.  i also spent a good hour on google looking at images of planes and satellites trying to find an explanation.  i know how much the the picture looks like a plane but it was absolutely flying in the wrong direction to be that.  and even though it's similar the shape didn't match any plane.  \r\n\r\ni'm 42 years old, completely lucid and fairly intelligent.  i don't do drugs and haven't touched a drop of alcohol in 12 years.  this thing i've seen has really blown my mind.  i just can't put into words how odd this was.  i had been working all afternoon on getting all my programs reinstalled on one of my computers, periodically letting myself get distracted reading about network security.  the weather cleared up from a rainy morning and i figured i would get off my butt and find a project away from the computer.  seeing something weird in the sky was the absolute furthest thing from my mind.  now this has completely derailed anything i had going on today.  i would give anything to get a second look at that thing.  i'm honestly not convinced it was aliens, but not saying it wasn't either.  it could have been some secret government aircraft (ours or otherwise) or some kind of satellite the general public doesn't know about.  i'm really so bugged i'm tempted to try to report it to the military.  maybe it was some foreign governments new stealth spy plane/satellite they could be trying to track.  oh well.  if that's the case hopefully some agency somewhere is watching these mufon reports.  sadly i will probably never know what i saw.  but i absolutely saw something completely abnormal.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line

to feed a stray dog. when he yelps, i go feed him. this time, he came at about 4:30 in the morning. it was a clear night and there were no stars.\r\n\r\ni decided to look out the front window because i noticed one time a few weeks prior that as i was watching a man ride the road on his bike, there was a large white light very low that moved and disappeared at will, at the same time 4:30 a.M.\r\n\r\ni looked out the front window and i seen that low bright white light. it looks diamond shape. it was too low to be a star. i decided that i would videotape it since i had my ipad handy.\r\n\r\ni was able to open the window totally and there is no screen in that window so i am videotaping in the open air and not through a window or screen.\r\n\r\nin the videotape, you see the streetlight, its the big light.\r\n\r\nto the upper right of the streetlight, you see the white light that i am filming.\r\n\r\nwhen you look at the ufo close in the video, you see some sort of movement of the light. it's not just a stationary light. it's pulsing or something.\r\n\r\nas soon, as the video plays, look immediately above the streetlight.\r\nalmost 2 seconds in, another white light appears momentarily and disappears. it is the same size as the first ufo i am filming.\r\n\r\nnote: i videotaped on july 14th at 4:30 am and the same light was there stationary.\r\n\r\nnote: i videotaped again on july 18th at the same time, 4:30 a.M. and this time there was a giant triangular shape of lights, many times bigger than the little light i was filming. there was also a little ship that traveled through the sky and disappeared.  these items were too high and could not be seen by my ipad. what's interesting is that i wasn't scared of seeing this. i felt calm and soothed. i stayed awake and checked periodically and with the rising sun, the lights disappeared and could not be seen anymore.\r\n\r\ni'm sending a 16 second video of the ufo when it was photobombed on july

with their red blinking lights and pattern of lights. also easily discernible were the various satellites moving through the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\naround 10:45pm we were still sitting by the campfire when i

\r\n\r\nthis bright white object was many times larger than how a star or a satellite would appear in the sky. it was about aspirin size if you were holding one at arms length. it was impossible to judge how high it was in the sky. it seemed to not have a perfect round shape and possibly had small spikes or rays. \r\n\r\nwhen we saw it, we both stood up and moved to the clear area away from the trees to watch it as long as possible. we were able to view it for about 8 seconds. it was definitely not a meteor. no other lights, no trail.  no sound. we saw it make a \"course correction\" of some

with her car since it was getting dark out, and they live a bit far from my house. i stopped right outside their front door and looked north west to the sky. i saw this out of place, white disk shaped light in stationary just sitting there. it did not move, but i could recall hearing a slight quiet hum in sky. \r\n\r\n2.Right when i went through their door i felt the need to look up at this specific direction, though i have no recollection as to why. and when i looked up from my feet, there it was. just sitting there. \r\n\r\n3.When i looked at it, i thought it was a street light for a mere second. but when i realized that there was no street lights there, i knew it was something abnormal and not of human origin. not to mention it was in the sky, not near the ground. \r\n\r\n4. it did not move at all. it was perfectly still. since i live in a town that has an air force base, i thought it would move in one direction like a plane. but the thing was, it was glowing and not making any motion my eyes could detect. it looked nothing like the plains that would fly above our town on a daily basis. it faded away slowly after about a minute or so. but it was still visible by the time i had to look away and move on. since we were going back to my house i did not see if it reappeared or if the object did anything else after we left. \r\n\r\n5. i felt a bit shocked when i first glanced at it. i felt a strong sense that it was not normal. i tried to point it out to my friend and her mom, but no words could come out of my mouth for some reason. i just stood there holding still in silence to see if it would move, or do anything. there was a little bit of fear, but not enough to make me do anything irrational. when i got in the car and we drove off, i wanted to ask my friend and her mom if they saw it. i still could not speak at all. i sat there in silence trying to register what i just saw up in the sky. i felt confused and baffled. i was shocked, and since i was shocked i suppressed it a little. i recalled the memory just today. i felt a strong need to report it.\r\n\r\n6. it was just about to fade away, until i had to go to the car to be dropped off at my house. i did not see it after we left the neighborhood. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

mile from the corner. the beams of light were twisting over each other and \"shooting\" from the street corner. as soon as i reached for my phone to take pics the beams of light started disappearing or for lack of better words \"disintegrating\". i managed to take around a dozen pics (+/-) before it was gone. as i was raking pics the beams of light went away and the remainder of lights and ship ascended into the sky to blend in with the clouds and rising sun. there was no sound or wind of any kind.\r\n\r\nwhen i woke up to the bright beams of light that were in this formation \"::\"into was immediately alert and thought e.T. and grabbed my phone to catch 0ics of the light beams. because the light was fading fast i was disappointed that i could not get better pics but excited to see what i saw. \r\n\r\ni lost sight of the object when the object and it's bright beams of light ascended into the clouds and blended in with the clouds that were already starting to reflect the rising sun reflecting on the clouds. \r\n\r\ni could tell the beams of light were not in the sky because i could see the lights between the trees, which in this area the trees are short like over grown bushes. if the pics are looked at carefully(because of being dark) you can see the beams of light in the road on on the other to side if my defence which there is a tree next to the fence.\r\n\r\ni'm simply adding that for some reason i am not able to add my pics.  when i click on the button to add it doesn't do anything but light up, doesn't give me the option to do anything. i would have left several.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500
