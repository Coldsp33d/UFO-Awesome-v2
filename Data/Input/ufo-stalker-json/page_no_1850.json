upon seeing him i asked him to have a look. the next time i see him he relates this story to me. this happened to him in athens texas. at the time we spoke february 18, 2010, the event had just happened approximately ten days earlier. the time of the abduction was 11:00 or 11:30 pm.  he was shaking and had goose bumps covering his arms as he was telling me his story.   i reported this abduction to another web site but did such a botched job, i felt i had to file it again. \r\nsubject got out of a car he was riding in with friends. he was going to walk across a field surrounded by woods to an apartment complex. his reason for not going directly to the apartments was that he did not want someone at the apartments to see him with his friends. as he was crossing the wooded area heading to the field he felt a presents above him. some how he knew it was a ufo without looking. he started running through the woods to escape. this is when he heard a twitching noise in the bushes in front of him. he turned and ran in a different direction but no mater which way he turned he would hear the same noises ahead.  the noises keep him running in a circle. then he became paralyzed and could only move in a jerking motion and fell to his knees. at this time god told him not to open his eyes. he became weightless for a few moments. next he was examined with some device that he called a scanner.  as it was moved around his head he could hear a buzzing sound similar to a radio being tuned across the band. this devise made his hair stand up as it was moved over his head. as he was relating this to me he was holding both sides of his head as if he were in pain.  while in the craft he hears someone say,  he is still alive. then hears someone one else say,  i need a transfer then a string of numbers.  for some reason he felt that these numbers were very important and related to me that he wished that he could be hypnotized to reveal the sequence. the duration of the time he was abducted was approximately fifteen minuets. he told me that he cried so much that his shirt was soaking wet. the event was so traumatic that he prayed to god that if he made it through the ordeal that he would give his life to god. when he was returned he was standing, his arms outstretched, looking up at the sky. the condition of the sky before the abduction was cloudy, after his return no clouds with the stars clearly visible.\r\n\r\ni forgot to add this part.   he also told me that they scraped his skin,  i think he said his stomach.  he ask me why would they scrape his skin.  i told him that maybe they were collecting his skin cells for dna.    he said they must really like my

early spring or early fall) & i knew that it would be dusk sometime soon but it was still daylight. i felt like i was being watched & i stood up & instinctively looked above me. i was not afraid and just stood there looking. \r\n\r\ni observed a large disk space ship hoovering above me over our back yard. we lived in a place that used to be farmland, a new development still in the process of building townhouses (3 per building) & most were not complete yet & there were only a few young families who had moved in. the development was also next to a golf course. so it was kind of bare & isolated to some extent. not many people around to notice a spaceship over someones yard. i just stood looking up at the craft.  i noticed that it had 3 big lights... one was a dome light, 2 were underneath & were 2 different colored lights. then all of a sudden i noticed that i could see through the craft ... it was a disk and the middle was similar to a car steering wheel shape (like 3 spokes with spaces between them) wherein you could see between the spokes & now i noticed that i could see the stars & sky between the spokes. i wondered how that could be. \r\n\r\nas it was leaving, moving to my right and angleing up i could see it had lighted windows along the inside spokes & outside rim. as the craft moved swiftly up & away (at first like slow motion & then it was gone in seconds) i ran into the back door of the house to tell my mother. the house was not well lit, my mom wasn't inside so i ran out the front door & immediately stopped in my tracks confused that it was dark outside. \r\n\r\nmy mother said what i saw was not possible unless it had been the sputnik. i am terrified of the movie \"fire in the sky\" & i have only seen brief parts of it... i feel like i

flagstaff, az, and continues to las vegas. area is sparsely populated, but easily seen from this busy highway.  \r\n   conditions:  clear and hot with almost full moon at zenith, hence no stars were visible, being obscured by the backscatter of moonlight.\r\n   description: at about 9:30 a single bright light in the western sky caught my eye through a window in my residence in congress, az, 10 miles north of wickenburg.  (phoenix is about 50 miles east of wickenburg.)\r\nno stars or aircraft could be seen.  i waited for the light to move or blink, as would an aircraft light, however it simply disappeared after perhaps 20 seconds.  a moment later another light appeared, slightly lower and a few degrees north of the 1st light, and it became a sequence or row of five lights in a straight horizontal row.  the initial light went out and immediately the second light turned on, remaining for about 1/2 second, went out and the 3rd light turned on, and so forth for 5 lights total.  the separations between lights was uniform and it was clearly a row of lights, not a single light that was moving and blinking.\r\n   this pattern of sequential lights was repeated 4 more times, at intervals of 5 to 10 minutes, during the next hour, but with significant variations.  specifically, the next 3 times the sequence was of 6 lights in the row, not just 5.  the 5th and last time the row was composed of 10 to 12 lights, which appeared much closer together and the on-off sequence was twice as fast as in the previous 4 appearances. each appearance was at a slightly different location in the sky, making it appear that the lights were attached to a rigid platform, such as a large ufo, which moved slowly over a distance of several miles.\r\n   inbetween and even during the \"row-sequence\" appearances there were individual lights scattered about this area of sky, which single lights appeared for several seconds and then disappeared.  some were distinctly moving slowly but most appeared motionless.\r\n   at about 10:30 a much brighter light appeared.  it was orange in color, much larger than the white lights, forming a circle of uniform brightness.  the orange light tuned on slowly, came up to full brightness and reamined so for perhaps 10 seconds and then faded into darkness.  still later, after most of the one hour show, a motionless green light appeared several times at various intervals.  it was a soft green, rather diffused and dimmer than any of the white lights.  after the green light had appeared 6 or 7 times over 5 minutes, all light activity seemed to have ceased and i stopped observing.\r\n   of coursse distances of \"lights in the sky\" are impossible to judge with any accuracy, however the platform of 5, 6 or 10 sequential lights provided some visual clues.  thus, i would estimate the main light displays were west of me about 10 to 15 miles, which would put them a few miles west of highway #93, and thus easily visible by traffic on that busy highway.  perhaps a truckdriver has or will report similar sightings.\r\n   if that rough distance estimate has any merit, it would require that the sequnce light platform be at least a half-mile in length, perhaps a full mile, as the sequence appeared a several locations at various heights above the horizon.\r\n   this is not my first ufo sighting by any means.  my wife and i watched a \"dance of 7 brilliant ufos in 1975 in minnesota and i photographed a ufo in scottsdale, az, in 2005, plus i have seen a dozen or so ufo-like phenomena. \r\n  i do not for a moment doubt that i was observing lights on board several ufo craft in this area for over an hour.  there was no sound, the actions were totally unlike any aircraft and no aircraft lights or stars appeared during this time period.  the purpose of displaying their lights in this manner seems clearly to be to make humans think and to raise human awareness that we are not alone in this wonderful universe.","distance":"Over One

weeks. approximately 1 ��� weeks ago i observed a bright light suddenly appear in the northern sky, approximately 40 degrees above the horizon. it appeared to be moving in a northerly direction (away from me) at the speed of a conventional aircraft. there were no strobes or directional lights visible. as i watched, the light faded to black over the period of several seconds. this occluded around 9:00 pm and i assumed that it might have been a satellite or space debris passing momentarily into sunlight.\r\napproximately four days later, i experienced the same phenomenon at approximately the same time. i watched carefully and confirmed there was only one single light, moving away from me. when the light initially appeared, it was the brightest light in the sky, reminding me of venus.  again, it faded quickly from sight and the entire event lasted 5-6 seconds. this second sighting convinced me that it was probably some of metallic object in orbit.\r\non this evening, (6-14-2011) i was enjoying a warm evening, again looking at the north sky. it was approximately 11:30 pm. the stars were somewhat faint and i could only really see the north star and the front two stars of the big dipper.  all of a sudden, i saw the bright light appear again. this time it was slightly higher in the sky well off to the right of the north star, and it was traveling east. just as the prior two incidence, it faded as it moved becoming invisible after about five seconds. as before i looked for any sign that it was an aircraft but saw none. i watched for about 15 minutes after it disappeared to see if it would reemerge, but it did not. in all three cases, i never heard any aircraft.\r\nfor investigative purposes, i would like to mention that beale afb is approximately 30 miles north of my location.  i am also very familiar with aircraft going in and out of mcclellan airpark and the sacramento international airport, both less than 10 miles to my west. these three incidents did not look anything like conventional aircraft that i am use to seeing.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

remembered about that never forgotten night.\r\n \r\non tuesday, august 31, 2010 at 9:10 pm cst, my brother, \"b\" iv and myself witnessed an aircraft in the sky hovering above athens, texas.  we were on our way to the trace in downtown athens, tx for karaoke night.  it really took me by surprise in that i have never had an encounter of the first kind (ufo visual), when you actually see a aircraft in full view and there are no doubts in your mind that this is not a aircraft in the sky that you normally see like a private plane, commercial airline or a helicopter, that can hover.\r\n \r\nwhat we saw that night was an aircraft shaped like a crunched up cigar with red lights permeating from the underside of the aircraft.  these lights actually show traveling toward the ground instead of just a bright shining red light.  i hate to say it is almost like a ray you would see shooting out from the underside of the object, like portrayed in the old movie, war of the worlds.\r\n \r\nthis object was seen approximately a quarter of a mile from us to the west on us highway 175 e., a little before turning off to get on the loop 7 towards the tyler exit off on highway 31.  my brother wanted to go get some cigarillos at valero service station across from walmart, but by the time he had bought these smokes and gotten back to us 175 w,to nobody's surprise, the object had vanished.\"\r\n \r\ni don't know if i will ever be a witness like i was that tuesday night.  i had always dream when growing up and even until that night witnessing something that cannot be explained in logical thinking.\r\n \r\nthat next morning i called the local newspaper, athens daily review to see in fact if any other people had called into to let them know they had witness that phenomenon that night.  i was told that my brother and i were the only two people that called the newspaper to inform them about this ufo incident.\r\n \r\ni am hoping that after this information, even though pictures could be taken, that this will be looked into, because another ufo incident occured this past thursday, june 9th of which i am not privy to the details, but the person that witnessed this gave that information to our local newspaper, the daily athens review.\r\n \r\nthis is the best narrative that i can explain the strange occurence that my brother and i witnessed that night.\r\n \r\ni can be

above my backyard patio. i was watching the sky when something to the right of my favorite star caught my eye. tonight a small \"red star\" (which later turned to a white normal star color) was flying up from a little left of the end of the \"handle\" of the big dipper, up and over my head, \"jumping\" very quickly, then pausing almost a full stop, then would begin moving at a steady pace, then pause, then shoot off a different direction at a very quick pace, then slow again, then \"jump\" into movement again, from steady to very fast pace/speed. i watched it go overhead, pass by the moon and over to the complete opposite side of the sky from which i saw it rise, and then eventually shoot off, and disappear from sight. it seemed very high up, and looked like a moving star. i have seen satellites in the sky with and without telescopes and i live close to an airport so i am very familiar with identifying planes and helicopters. this was very odd to see an object which changed speeds, directions, and seemed to pause and then jump back into motion. it stopped fully in two spots in the sky, right before it traveled out of sight. it stopped, like it was taking it's place among the stars in a set lil constellation or something, and then shot off, or just became invisible to eye sight. no sound at all, again it seemed very high up but was so interesting i did not stop watching, i even waited a few minutes after it disappeared from sight to see if it would reappear, but it did not. i have seen odd activity in the night sky from my backyard before, i actually usually see stars moving from their set place in the sky every night, and have shown it to family and friends when they have the patience to sit and watch. stars moving in zig zag patterns, shooting up then down or in odd patterns, not just shaky side to side star movement, full on totally noticeable distances at quick speeds and then random changes in direction. it is very confusing, but intriguing,  which is why i always go outside to watch the stars, i love to watch and wonder what exactly it is i am seeing and why. i would very much like to know what it is and what is going on. i do not have a camera that is strong enough to capture the stars in action but hope to be able to purchase one soon. my boyfriend and our good friends have seen the stars move in the sky before and have gotten freaked out, it happens so much its not scary, its exciting and a puzzle. i was calling to him to come outside and see this \"red star\" move all over and across the sky tonight but he didn't hear me call him. it was very fun to witness, and it's more fun to share the sights with people, as an exciting moment to share, and as a validation that i am not the only one seeing it, and that i am not crazy or hallucinating. :)","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

but i really wanted to get a shot of the lightning bolts that i was seeing ahead of me! the storm was coming in from the southwest over troy.  i pulled off the country road, put my flashers on and stood outside my car with my arms resting on the door to stabilize my hands.  how lucky do you have to be to catch lighting--especially without a tripod?  so, i took lots of pictures, probably about 20 with the hope of capturing some lightning bolts. when i finished taking pictures i had to drive into the storm and it was very scary.  it was pouring rain so hard that i couldn't see and then there was hail!\r\n\r\na few hours after i got home, i downloaded my pictures to my computer and saw something strange!  it's a rectangular, flat looking ufo.  i did not see it when i took the picture, and

saw a ball of fire over a main street about 200 yards away hovering.  then i saw an oval object about 42' long about 100 feet away.  because it was dark out i could barely see it.  it flashed 3 squares of white light on its left side every 7 seconds.  i watched it for a while before opening the restaurant door calling my friend who worked there to see.  my friend was with customers, and when i looked again for it it was gone.  2 nights later i found my head off my pillow with my eyes more than half way closed sometime during the night.  i saw a beings head looking at me with a tight face.  he had wrap around thin eyes that protruded from his face, almost like goggles.  he had a lower lip (human looking)and a small nose.  he had no hair.  his face around his nose looked kind of concave or angled in.  within 7 to 10 seconds his head flew straight backward, and his head and right arm flew up disappearing 2 feet away.  he appeared to be a specie of grey i never saw before.  i saw his right arm fly up, as he traveled backward 2 feet apparently disappearing into another dimension.  i fell right back to sleep.\r\n\r\nwhen i woke up in the morning i found 2 deep long scratch marks on

airport). it took the thing less than 5 seconds to go about thru a yard's worth of sky (relative to my observations). also- the flight path wasnt the usual one to the airport. there were no formation lights, no blinking lights of any kind. it's what happened after it had disappeared from view that got me (and made me snicker):\r\n\r\n15 seconds after it had disappeared from view, the unmistakable,

(to see an exact duplicate of what i saw, youtube has video i found \"ufo june 2011 pennsylvania, multiple crafts descend into woods, 6/3/11).\r\n\r\nin our backyard and looking into the north west portion of the sky, we saw a couple of airplanes which we consider normal aircraft traffic. while continuing to look in this direction i saw an extremely bright white light coming toward us very low; in fact, it appeared to be just above the roof tops of the houses in the sub division behind us.\r\n\r\ni told my daughter and son-n-law to look and asked if it was an airplane. my son's first response was \"it's a plane\" and he left the yard. my daughter and i continued to watch it. we both commented that it was flying lower than normal air traffic and the lights seemed to be abnormally bright for air traffic. we considered maybe it was a search helicopter but as it got nearer to us we realized that we could not hear a thing. \r\n\r\nmy daughter then took the high powered binoculars (we can see moon craters they are so powerful) and started to scream \"it's a ufo, a real ufo!\" she then handed them to me. i used the binoculars and was shocked and awed over what i was seeing.\r\n\r\na large almost kite-diamond shaped craft that had very bright white lights in the middle of the front of the vehicle, however; the lights took up most of the front of it (not a headlight type). it's distance above us was about 4 single story houses stacked one on top of each other. it appeared to be flat on the bottom and all 3 sides were smooth rounded up. when it was directly over top of me, the light on the front shifted to a round white light under neath and i made the comment \"i hope it doesn't beam me up!\" (jokingly). we then noticed that the front where the lights had been seem to have a section \"notched inward\".  what was so amazing is no sound! it was gliding across the sky. as it passed over us i handed the binoculars to my son-in-law and he said the light changed again from underneath to the front. however, i am going to let him as well as my daughter make their own report. i only want to report my perception.\r\n\r\nalthough we do have an afb about 30 miles to the east of us; i am the daughter of a retired af pilot. the b2 did come to mind but i am familiar with this plane and this craft did not resemble the b2. we also have \"drones\" but this did not resemble them.  we have a lot of air traffic at night because we are 40 miles north of an international airport. we are very familiar with planes and use a smart phone app that shows us air traffic. there was no plane in our vicinity at that \"moment\" and this craft did not resemble any air traffic we are very familiar.\r\n\r\ni want to add that we have become avid skywatchers and it is my opinion that the more you watch, the more you see and the more you see and develop a love of the phenomena, the more connected you become as we now see up to 20 \"orbs\" per night and some will stop and glow as bright as the moon right near us. this phenomena is becoming more prevalent in my opinion and many are recording it. unfortunately i do not have the proper night time equipment to record these.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

3 feet across.  it followed us for about 2 minutes then vanished.  this all happened halfway between las vegas and kingman.\r\n\r\nin the middle of this we were looking for power poles that might be arching.  there were no things that might have caused the event.  it was not military flares..I have observed these many times. it seemed to have intelligence.   it stayed about 65 mph and about 20 even feet from the passengers winders.\r\n\r\nwhen the object was in front of the car it stayed about 15 feet even in front of the car.  i had a good look at the star-like  fireball.  my husband said this object appeared as a white really bright object.  when i first saw it i said to my husband \"i guess they really  do exist.\"  when the star like fireball right in front of  the  car was observed i said i don't wan to be a specimen.\r\n\r\nthis all was observed at night so there are no pictures there is no military base.\r\nthere are no houses  at all.  \r\n\r\nmy husband was quiet and quietly
