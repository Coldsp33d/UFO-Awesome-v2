their driveway, when one spotted a cigar-shaped craft \"gliding\" across the cloudless sky from north to south. the craft appeared to be silver or light in color, as it reflected the sun and made no noise and left no chemtrail. though strange, the event seemed insignificant until another identical craft came into view less than one minute later, following the same altitude and path. the two original witnesses were then joined by two additional persons, and they all continued to watch as three more of the same type of crafts followed, appearing about one minute apart. the only difference in the three subsequent crafts was that they were still appearing to adhere to the same directional path but flew lower or higher than the originial two. no more than five minutes later, another craft appeared coming from the opposite direction of the original five, this one flying from southeast to northwest. speed and altitude were similar but the craft seemed orange in color (perhaps a reflection of the setting sun which was an orange/pink hue). then rather quickly, perhaps within thirty seconds of the former, another craft was seen flying from the original north position, but was traveling southwest, instead of directly south. occurring at the same time, an easily discernible commercial plane was flying from south to north. following closely behind but at a slower speed, characteristic of the other unidentified crafts, another craft travels from southeast to northwest. traveling parallel but in the exact opposite direction, another one of the crafts is seen. the two parallel crafts appear from the naked eye and with aid of a digital camera, to be dangerously close to one another. (never seen with commercial flights.) their average speeds appeared to be \"too slow\" for any familiar craft at such low altitudes. this was apparent to the original witness, of military background, but obvious to the other witnesses as well. moments after the previous three were witnessed all at once, a dark or black craft of indiscernible shape was seen traveling from northeast to southwest, but was on a completely separate path than any of the other crafts. during the entire event, one witness was using an application (planefinder)on his iphone, which turned up no commercial flights at the time, with the exception of the obvious aforementioned flight. the entire event lasted approximately thirty minutes, with no more activity observed from the witnesses for the additional half hour they remained outside.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

the closed blinds.  i went outside to take a look at what was causing the bright light and i took binoculars with me, i live directly on the water of saginaw bay.  through the binoculars the object appeared as a large white light with blue light sometimes flashing erratically around the bottom.  this made me think it was a coast guard or law enforcement ship of some kind, i thought they may be arresting some drunken night boaters perhaps.  this light would randomly flash very brightly, and appeared to be directional. it was so bright at times it illuminated the tops of our boats sitting on the beach, and this object seemed to be at least a mile away.  then thought maybe this was a search light and they are looking for a ship that's in trouble.  the object faded to a dark orange/amber color and headed out into the bay while still randomly becoming bright white, sometimes only for a moment, sometimes for a few seconds.  it appeared as sometimes white sometimes red small dot and began moving back towards land then out into the bay again still flashing brightly occasionally as if on a dimmer switch.  at this point it moved back out into the bay again but at a very high speed, much faster than any boat of any kind.  this is when i realized it was not any kind of boat or ship that i was aware of and i now thought it may be a helicopter. i went to wake up my father after i realized it wasn't a seafaring vessel of any kind.  as he came outside to look at it i saw if fade until it disappeared through the binoculars as it headed north into the bay.  after it faded away and i took my binoculars away from my eyes and saw a helicopter coming from the bay city area out into the saginaw bay and towards where the object had been.  when the helicopter neared the general area of where the object seemed to disappear it appeared to begin to search the area for several minutes.  the helicopter seemed to be just south of where the object faded away.  then the helicopter flew quickly north, turned around and came back near the first area they searched.  the helicopter seemed to search a few more minutes and then headed east.  this helicopter was obviously different from the other object.  the helicopter had a white light in the front and a red blinking tail light, i could also hear the helicopter as it flew south after it quickly headed north.  i heard no sound coming from the ufo or maybe uso.  it was very low to the horizon and appeared to be at least a mile away.  someone in the sebawaing area may have been able to see what it was more closely.  it could have been a helicopter with strange lights i've never seen before but it was obviously different from the helicopter that came after it.","distance":"Over One

not see its approach.  it traveled  from south/ southwest to north/ north east in a straight line for 6 seconds and disappeared beyond my ability to view because of tree cover. the light was traveling very fast, and it disappeared and reappeared in the cloud cover, as if it were flying through the clouds.  the clouds were cumulus, and lit by a half moon. the light was not an airplane as it was as

contrails that i have observed would require. it didn't, it just flew strait and i was once again left with a feeling that there is a sense of humor at play.  i had actually been asking to \" see one

ufo...It is about my many encounters with extraterrestrial beings, mostly in my home.  all together, there have been 9 encounters..The one that stands out in my mind the most:  my daughter and i were coming home from a long day of work and school.  she went directly to take her shower to get to bed quickly...I gathered up her things and walking from the kitchen to the living room...Suddenly three beings..Not human..Appeared before me.  i was stunned to say the least.  they were each different in size and shape, but all had medium grey coloured skin, longish arms, fewer fingers than humans, a large head and prominent eyes..Very big eyes with a seemingly second eye.  the first one to the left was larger than the others...He looked directly at me as i was only a foot or so from him i could see him well.  the one standing next to him was a bit smaller and the third was smaller yet, standing in the doorway of the bedroom.  the larger one said telepathically to me:  \"we're sorry you saw us; we're leaving now\"...The whole room became bathed in a glow of sparkley substance...They literally went up through the ceiling and dissapeared.  all the time they were with me i sensed they were benevolent...Almost kind.  it was an amazing experience i could never, ever forget.  i told my daughter immediately as she wrapped her towel around her...I was concerned that she was ok...Did they see her too? i wondered.  we stayed up a long while, hugging and wondering who they were....The next morning as we were in the kitchen, she asked me \"what are those red dots on your arm, mama?\"  i looked and saw them in a circle.  i then checked to see if she had them and she did.  i realized they had come to see her too!  i have told a few select people..Friends..Family..But not many.  it was a lot to \"wrap one's brain around\".  since that night (and prior to that encounter) both my daughter and i have had further encounters with them.  i am glad to report they never caused us any physical pain and every time seemed to express a concern for our well-being.  i am more curious now than afraid.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":29522,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.886209,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06132011-0004","longitude":-73.2573369,"occurred":780988800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

large window allowing a view to the east. i glanced out the window into the darkened sky and noticed a bright star in view. i didn't think anything of it until i looked away, in my peripheral field i noticed a small amount of movement. i refocused and noticed it was on a straight trajectory from right to left in my field of vision. i noted the time and went outside and stood on my front doorstep. the object had moved slightly more to the left and continued its trajectory to the northeast. at the same time, i noticed an airplane flying above an behind the object, the plane appeared to be headed in the opposite direction and more to the southeast. i watched as the smooth movement of the object took it beyond the horizon. at no time did it slow or speed up. nor did it blink or change colors. the star like appearance remained constant. the size and brightness of it was very comparable to other bright stars.","distance":"Over One

acost������ en el piso del solar de mi casa a descansar. como de costumbre me gusta observar las estrellas en el cielo, transcurrido cierto tiempo me llama la atenci������n una estrella fugaz desplaz������ndose en sentido nor-este. en las estrellas fugaz por lo general la estela tiende a desaparecer lo cual no ocurr������a en ������sta, de repente observ������ un disco redondo en la punta de la estela descendiendo a una velocidad incre������ble, acto seguido me levante muy impresionado pues no sabia de que se trataba. me coloqu������ en el marco de la puerta que da con la cocina de mi casa, pero sin perder de vista el objeto el cual era de color pardo y no emitia ninguna luz al tiempo que se desplazaba a una gran velocidad en linea recta y ascendia, perdiendose de vista. pense llamar a alguien para que tambien viera el extra������o objeto, pero en mi casa no habia nadie ya que mi esposa y mis hijas estaban en una reunion familiar.\r\ndespues de haberme ocurrido este suceso observo constantemente el cielo para ver si puedo volver a observar este fenomeno; me hubiese gustado que alguien mas pudiese haber tenido este contacto.\r\nen conclusion para mi el fenomeno ovni existe despues de vivir esta experiencia extraordinaria, pienso que no estamos solos en el universo pues el avistamiento constante de este tipo de objeto hace suponer que estamos en presencia de civilizaciones con una inteligencia muy superior a la nuestra.\r\n\r\ntranslation:\r\nthat day on saturday may 9, comes from my work at about 7:30 pm i slept on the floor ��� solar home to rest. as usual i like to watch the stars in the sky after some time i called the attention shifts a shooting star n ndos in northeast direction. shooting stars in the wake usually tends to disappear which is not ocurr���a in ��� ��� sta, suddenly observes ��� a round disc on the end of the trail down to a speed incredible, immediately followed up too impressed because i did not know about question. ��� i put under the door that leads to my kitchen, but without losing sight of the object which was brown and did not issue any light while traveling at high speed in a straight line and amounted out of sight. i thought to call someone who also saw the strange object ��� o, but no one was home because my wife and my daughters were at a family reunion.\r\n after this event having occurred constantly watch the sky to see if i can return to observe this phenomenon, i would have liked someone else might have had this contact.\r\n in conclusion ufo phenomenon for me to live there after this extraordinary experience, i think we are not alone in the universe because the constant sighting of this object suggests that we are dealing with civilizations with an intelligence far superior to ours.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":29517,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":19.3772922,"location":null,"logNumber":"VE-06122011-0018","longitude":-99.2018293,"occurred":1241923740000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Distrito

360 degree view of the night sky. i was facing towards the southern sky when a meteor like object crossed the sky heading towards the west. the object stopped moving, hovered briefly, appeared to back up slightly and the accelerated towards the west again yet in a steeper trajectory. the object was a yellow light that appeared to be about five miles away. i felt elated as i had always wanted to see a ufo.  i turned around to see if anything else was occurring. i did see meteor crossing the big dipper constellation but it's behavior appeared normal and it wasn't as bright as the first object. we often get meteor showers here in az so i thought this was a coincidence. in retrospect, i recalled seeing objects similar to the hovering object earlier this winter as i was driving back from flagstaff on 180n. the area was near mile marker 241 about halfway between flagstaff and where i live in valle, az. at the time  i thought the objects i had observed were meteors or flare guns being used by hunters. i observed them on the side of the road through the trees and low to the horizon.\r\n","distance":"Over One
