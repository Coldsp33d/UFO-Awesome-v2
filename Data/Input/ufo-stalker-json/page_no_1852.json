incident.  i believe it was during the fall season.\r\n\r\ni was returning from the drug store and crossing the a1a toward the pier.  as i entered the parking lot, i noticed lights approaching from the sky.  the lights were rotating counter clockwise and each rotation was a different color.  red, green and blue.  they were at a 45 degree angle and stayed that way when the craft stopped over a small grove of pine trees.  then it leveled off and stayed over the highest tree which was about 40 feet tall.  i walked up to the craft and looked directly under it.  there were no seams, rivets, indentations or anything else that would indicate the location of landing gear.  there wasn���t any sound to indicate an engine. i must have stood there for at least ten minutes before the craft moved toward the water which was only thirty yards away and it was high tide. it was about 30 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\ni followed it and saw it drop to about two =three feet above the water.  i watched the water and saw no disturbance on the surface caused by any engine exhaust.  there still wasn���t any noise.  it coasted past the pier and headed toward the cape.\r\n\r\ni ran onto the pier and climbed as high as i could.  i saw the craft glide toward the cape as far as i could see.  then it just ���winked out��� or went under water can���t be sure of which.\r\n\r\ni quickly ran to my grandmother���s house to tell her of what i saw and maybe she would be interested in seeing it.\r\n\r\nwe got to the beach at the end of east pasco lane.  there we encountered another woman who was walking her dog.  then we saw the craft again. it was coasting along the shore line keeping pace with us as we were walking while watching the craft.  this went on for a little while then it stopped. as we stood there the craft just drifted farther out to sea and out of sight.\r\n\r\ni believe this was in connection of the first atlas rocket to launched for a trial to carry the first man in space.\r\n\r\nat no time did i feel afraid for my safety.\r\n\r\nunforgetable!!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\n(name deleted)fg\r\n","distance":"21-100

in the night or day sky. there was no sound, and even when it was flying right over me,i did not see any wings. i stood there for about 15 sec and ran inside to get 2 cameras - just incase. i got a little nervous thinking it's going to disappear but it was gliding across the sky pretty steady. what's interesting is there was another smaller grey object that flew from the opposite side of the craft at a faster speed, and it disappeared after they crossed the paths. i'm not saying it flew inside the other craft, but i did not see it anymore. \r\n\r\nthe silver craft had a little dark stripe

inside and ate  at 2:30am give or take a few minutes we went outside so hecould smoke a cigarette.  standing in the driveway i was star gazing while he smoked next to me and a single orange ball of light appeared  out of nowhere as if it just poofed into existence. it was brighter than any star in the sky, much bigger than a star maybe two or three times as much and was brilliantly orange.  the light remained constant the whole time and there were no other lights associated with the object. i told my brother to look up and he confirmed he could see the object asking me what the hell is it.  the object remained stationary for roughly 20 seconds then moved north over lake erie at a great rate of speed.  we could see it zipping across the sky sky for 10-15 seconds covering what seemed like alot of ground and then is just disappeared. it didn't travel out of our field of view it literally just disappeared. when it first appeared i was staring at some stars facing north and it just appeared in my field of view like magic.  it sat in the same spot as i said earlier before moving.  when i first saw it i thought maybe it was a sattelite but it didn't move at all for twenty seconds and then just took off.  also i've seen plenty of sattelites  and none have ever had the brilliance of this object.  when ive seen sattelites the never just appeared they always came into view looking like a moving star the maintained the same speed and flight path.  this object was not a sattelite in my opinion because of its size, color, and the fact it remained motionless before zipping off.  we were both extremely excited by what we saw but also extremely confused.  i live in tucsonfor the past four years near davis mothan air force base so ive see my fair share of militarty aircraft. this looked nothing like what either of us would describe as a military or civilian airplane or helicopter. it wasn't a meteor either, weve seen plenty of those and they just streak across the sky for a few seconds the disappear.

generating, then i park my car in the street to have a better look and came out of it, with my girlfriend, at this moment we were looking at a rounded white light  staying in the sky for aprox. 10 min. with no movement with a size of a 1 meter diameter from our position, many people were looking this, and one of this persons was a lan airlines pilot that told me that he has never seen this kind of light or object, and the panic start growing on this street, suddenly this strange light disappeared in one second, remaining a smoke or cloud circle as an image, that was the same size of this light. i���m sure that was something not known for us.\r\n\r\nbest regards.\r\n\r\nsergio caballero

evening. i had just stepped outside to sit on the porch when the moon caught my attention, and just above it was what i thought to be an airplane. i decided to test out the zoom on my recently bought camera and i tried taking pictures of the \"airplane.\" i took two pictures. the first picture i caught the whole object. the second picture i only captured half plus a random tree branch from the

up and it disappeared. i felt puzzled and it struck me as odd that i didn't see how it disappeared. the tree line it was heading for was still a good distance off. on the car ride home i was going through the pictures and i zoomed in on the object. it had no wings or tail, it also had no trail behind it, as most planes do. it just looked like the cigar shaped ufos i had heard about. it was a white silver, cylinder shaped object. even when i showed the person next to me in the car, they couldn't see wings or anything either. they, like me, just saw a silver cylinder object. when we came home we took the picture's and expanded them on the computer. it looked like five orbs together, making the cylinder object. then i started looking up cigar shaped ufos. i came across this document

friend derek home. my friend lives out at a mobile home park on the far east side of pueblo colorado. while we were driving on highway 96 my friend and i both noticed this rather large metallic triangular craft with red and purple lights passed over my car and it was traveling east bound along highway 96 at a rather fast speed. the craft was about 900 to 1000 feet in the air at a speed of 150 plus mile per hour. the red and purple lights were flashing on and off at a fast rate which my friend and i thought was very odd. this craft didn't act nor did it look like an airplane or helicopter. my friend lives really close to the pueblo airport and he swore that was not an airplane.\r\nsince this craft was going in the same direction as we were, we decided to follow this craft. i turned down the radio to see if i could hear any type of noise from this craft which i couldn't. this craft was travel really fast and i had to do the best i could to keep up with it. \r\ni had to drive around 110mph to stay with this craft. my friend asked me to catch up to this object so that he could take a clear photo of it, so i sped up to 120mph and yet i still couldn't catch up with it. we were following this craft for about 15 minutes then this craft just shot straight up in the air. i slammed on the brakes and pulled over. my friend and i jumped out of the car to see where this craft flew off too. sadly it was nowhere to be seen. \r\ni'm not sure if this was just some kind of airplane or if this was a ufo. i have never seen a ufo before. i wasn't even sure i should tell anyone about what my friend and i saw. my friend said we should file a report with you guys at mufon. maybe you could give us some insight to what we saw.\r\nit was just very and odd and my friend and i both just had this weird feeling while we were trying to chase down whatever that craft was. i've seen a lot of aircraft in my time, but i have never seen one just stop and shoot straight up in the air like that craft my friend and i saw. i'm not scared to admit it. but that thing really freaked me out. i just want to know what i saw. i never believed in ufo's or anything until now. i just have this really odd feeling in my gut after seeing that. i'm scared to tell anyone and so is my friend. we both are upset that we couldn't get close enough to take a picture with one our cell phones. we think without pictures that no one will believe us or that we are crazy. my friend and i know what we saw and it was not normal. please help my friend and i figure out what we saw. was it just some kind of experimental aircraft or was it something not from this world?

feet up and about 200 feet long on a side. it seemed to be gray metal, like an unpainted aircraft. there was absoluely no audible noise until it was at about 11 o'clock overhead when i heard a noise like a generator for a large bulding that was audible until about the 1 o'clock position. it was really, really close but if i had been 1 or 2 houses down, i think i would not have heard even the brief noise that i did hear. i really feel that it was a military aircraft, i had that feeling the whole time i was watching it and was surprised when i could not find the aircraft listed as some prototype or \"skunkworks\" aircraft . i have never been that close to a flying dirigible so i don't know if they are that silent.  to travel that slowly i think it must have been filled with a lighter than air gas. i know people would be skeptical that they could fly this across country and not be seen by millions, but it was so silent, and flying so low that it was in view such a short time, i think it would only be noticed by people already looking up unless a person was within 200 feet either side of it. there is no way that someone in their house would know it was there even if it was right overhead. i had it in sight almost from the treeline of the houses behind me to the treeline of the houses across the street and other than the slowness and silence it did nothing bizarre. it was really remakable, but i have the feeling that it was a military aircraft that in 10 years or so we will see on the news in military operations over the middle east or

starting at approximately 6:30 p.M. and abruptly faded from sight at 8:43 exactly. it was seen for two evenings in a row. i constantly sky-gaze in this direction, watching flight and weather patterns, and i did not notice anything like this in the days or evenings beforehand. \r\n\r\nit was seen in the eastern / south eastern sky.\r\n\r\nit is not venus, as venus, though visible during daylight this month, appears early morning. it is also not the iss or endeavor, as they were docked together, and were only visible that day over asia.\r\n\r\nit is also not saturn. although saturn was visible during sunset this month, the light pollution and air pollution of this area at the time would have made it impossible to see at that time. it also appeared much earlier than saturn, and faded from view much earlier than saturn, which should have been visible until near sunset. the direction it was first spotted, which was north east, does not fit the orbital location of saturn at the time, which would put saturn in the south eastern sky.\r\n\r\nthe object also had a slightly erratic flight path, unlike that of a planet or star. it is also oval shaped and bears a shadow on its bottom. if it was saturn, or any planet, it's shadow would not be located there, considering the sun was hanging low in the sky, although not yet at horizon level.\r\n\r\nmy sources are stellarium, astronomy.Com's stardome and google earth which i used for exact directions, altitudes, and orbital information.\r\n\r\naccording to stellarium with an ocean landscape to simulate sea level (fairfax is 312 above sea level) and being set to perspective mode, arcturus would have only been directly north east at 4 p.M. not only would i not be able to see it with this much daylight, it would be below our roof, right under the horizon, effectively out of sight completely. even at 6 p.M. arcturus would be directly east. at 6 p.M. the object was north east. \r\n\r\nthis video is not edited. i didn't know how to use the camera at first, so i didn't know i was recording in the beginning plus i felt that editing it would decrease credibility, so i left it unedited. and please excuse my language. my brother was being very annoying.\r\n\r\nwhat i find very strange is that usually when a planet or bright star is observable during the daytime, they are usually mistaken for a ufo, and the reports

engine sound? and they both look alike.Then they banked as they did so i could see that thay were round craft.I watched stuned as they flew of into the

been in bed about 1 hour.  i woke to see this bright white light sharp clean white light, it was about half the width of the window itself and was coming in the bedroom window at an angle from above the house.  at first i thought a flashlight or lightening but as i watched it i realized a flashlight is not that bright and it would have shined into the room, and lightening would not stay on like that it would flash bright and would also come in the window and light the room not just one window. \r\ni got up and looked out that window (the white light was only coming in the one window in the room) i saw what looked like a fire in a roundish shape just sitting there not moving just above the pine trees, and i watched it for a few minutes maybe 6-7 and figured it was a star or something got back in bed. i did not feel afraid or anything it didn't bother me at the time, not until the next day did i wonder about it and think i should have went out side and took pictures of it.   after i went back to bed i laid there trying to think of what it could have been when the beam of light came back in the window moved around the window and stopped.  it did not come in the room, it seemed to be just a foot or so inside the pane of glass.  so i got back up and the fire looking thing was gone.  i went right back to bed and fell asleep.  both times when i got up the light stopped.\r\n\r\nthe next morning i told my husband about it and asked him if maybe it was lightening out around that time he said no there was no lightening at all.","distance":"101-500
