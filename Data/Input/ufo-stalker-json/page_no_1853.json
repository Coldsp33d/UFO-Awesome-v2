(these thoughts of logic and determination go through my mind when i see something, is a thought/deduction process).  they were flying low, about the altitude a copter would fly.  \r\n\r\ni continued to watch as the moved closer and then realized they were unknown craft and knew what i was seeing was very likely extra terrestrial or unknown gov't technology.  i lean towards the former due to the

the air about 60-100 ft.  i kept looking and couldn't figure out what it was, it stayed in the same spot and as we were getting closer to it coming down the highway (mariposa rd.) toward stockton from oakdale i kept looking at  and saying do you see that april? do you see that? it was not a balloon, or weather balloon, or a chinese lantern or a model airplane or a regular airplane or a helicopter, my mind couldn't wrap around it because i have never seen anything like it. it looked like a large jellyfish with a round top, something around the middle and large wavy things that hung down as it hovered that came to a point at a wide angle. it did not have any lights, and it was a dark grey color, not shiny or bright or mult colored at all. we turned around to try to catch it on video on our phones, i don't think we were successful because we didn't see it again. shortly after we turned around a jet flying very low passed by very near where we saw it, going very fast. i have never seen anything like this in my life! oh, and we didn't hear it make any sound which was weird. we scanned the entire sky looking for it again, in the fields, on the side of the road, everywhere, and it was gone! poof!! i was so scared i didn't know what to do, but thought i should report it. the crossroad where we turned around at was wagner rd. we saw the object, that was definitely a ufo right above the road above a cow farm on our left. i can't think of anything else that i remember, but i drew a picture of it after we got back into town.","distance":"21-100

redish-orangeish hue to it and there were no lights blinking, no sound. it moved zig-zig across the sky in a linear fashion, from north to south, south to north, then it would fly up straight and disappear, then reappear.  then it would stop and just sit there and after a few seconds, it would start to move again across the sky...Again, no flickering lights like a plane or jet, no lights/search light from a helicopter (it was up rather too high to be a helicopter; however, couldn't tell you how high it was), no sound.  at one point a small plane was heading toward its direction and as it do so, the object moved away from the plane in a linear fashion.  after the plane was gone, it moved back toward the north without turning. it just moved back to position in that linear/straight fashion. it moved, disappeared, reappeared...And then it turned to a bright, white light and took off at a high speed to the southwest - i said omg. it wasn't a plane, jet, or helicopter..That's all i know- definitely not normal.\r\n\r\ni have seen meteors and \"falling stars\" (which it wasn't), and this was not a plane, jet, or helicopter, or satellite (unless satellites are able to move back and forth across the sky in a linear fashion like that). it looked like a reddish light (as bright as a star; no blinking light, no sound), maneuvering back and forth from the north to south, south to north, and then would hover for several seconds (looked like it was over the everglades - that's how far west i live), and it was intelligently controlled, as when the small plane headed toward it, it moved to the south at a high speed to get away from the plane, so....Like i said, it was a ufo in my opinion, and after my being on this planet for 52 years - have never seen anything like it - makes me wonder what or who is flying around in our skies at night and for what purpose (my roommate also witnessed it, as i called her outside to see it, too). it was there

 she started answering before i even mentioned the time!  i quickly developed the impression i might be the first person she'd talked to about lights in the sky last night.  \r\n\r\nthen peggy suggested i talk to the tv news stations in town.  if anything was going on, those people always knew about it, she said.  she was almost confrontational at this point.  but i wasn't looking for information on ufos, and i hadn't even alluded to them.  i was looking for info on aircraft in the sky at that time.  why did she go there?  why was the traffic control information person pawning me off to news stations about craft in the sky, anyway?  does. not. add. up!\r\n\r\nlast night was warm and there were other people out and about.  i figured if my wife and i saw something over a densely populated area, certainly someone else did.  so i checked ufostalker this morning.  i do this almost daily anyway, and i can tell you it's rare to have a recent mufon report from our region.  anything close is usually from oklahoma or kansas city (there has been a spate of sightings of multiple orange lights there recently).  but lo and behold, there was a marker over wichita, ks this morning - the first since may 23!  seems someone on the east side of town saw something, too.  this sighting is similar in that there were two craft together, but these were described as orange lights.\r\n\r\nif you're from the area and are reading this because you're looking to see if someone else saw what you saw last night, please leave a comment on this blog post and tell us what you saw!  then, report it at mufondotcom.  for the sake of truth, please do it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":29464,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.6966061,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06092011-0002","longitude":-97.3365248,"occurred":1307593800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1307654015000,"summary":"2 pairs of silent craft with multiple yellow lights ","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/29464_submitter_file1__LightsInSkyOverWichita20110608-930pm.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Wichita, Kansas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:54429"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"St. Marys","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was sitting outside most of the night looking up at the sky.  at approximately 11:00 pm to midnight ( somewhere in that time frame ) i saw what appeared to be a meteor at first burning in the sky...But upon closer inspection this was not the case.\r\n\r\nan extremely bright light lit up above the house...Reminded me of a florescent bulb...Started off kind of slow the zipped over the house extremely fast and extremely bright...Went behind the trees and it was almost like it dimmed itself and was not visible around the other side of the tree.  this light could not of been more than a couple hundred feet off the ground it was extremely close and fast.  there was no noise what so ever.  ive seen meteorites fall before and this just couldn't of been one in my opinion.  my grandmother also saw this as she was sitting right beside me.  we both just kind of froze in place.  my initial response to question myself if i really just saw that.  it was that wierd of an occurrence.  \r\n\r\nit was witnessed out in the country about a mile south east of grand lake. i think its ironic that we were talking about ufo when we saw it.

detail(cleaning the vans) with a friend that night after group. it was about 10:30 in the middle of november so it was pretty chilly. we just finished washing the last of three vans and i grabbed the hose and stepped back to begin rinsing, so i was standing maybe 6 or 7 feet from the van on the passenger side. at that point i noticed a group of lights some distance away.\r\nat first glance i took it for an airplane, (at first) because it was triangular shaped, and was moving too slow to be a plane. after watching for about thirty seconds another one appeared trailing behind it.(when i say appeared i mean suddenly it was there, like turning on a light switch) then a third appeared, in the same way. now we have three sets of lights, and each set had three lights, each one triangular in shape.\r\nthe second and third craft followed the same path as the first, which was i guess you would call a serpentine flight path. i would have to say that they were at the height you would expect a passenger plane to fly. maybe about a mile from where we were standing. my friend greg didnt notice until he saw me just standing looking over the van, by this time the second one had appeared, asked  me what it was, i said i didnt know.I wanted to say that they were planes, but i have never seen planes move the way they did, flying in the pattern they were flying and as slow as they were moving, back and forth in an \"s\" pattern. dropping below the mountain range then coming back up. so my next guess was helicopters. now i'm sure that helicopters could probably match the manuvers that these craft were performing, but not as close as they were to each other, and there was no sound, none. so for the next maybe 25, 30 minutes this went on. and greg and i watched until they dropped below the horizon one last time and didnt reappear. now during this time i didnt experiance any strange sensations other than feeling compelled to watch. after standing outside for another few minutes trying to make sense of what we just watched, and neither of us not wanting to say what we were really thinking i reached to open the back door and thats when i noticed the two dogs that lived there were just on the other side, with their ears up, on alert. i opened the door brutus,(a great dane) and sarge,(a german shepperd) bolted out the door. and like a bat out of hell they took off into the woods. after about 10 to 15 seconds there was a huge commotion in the woods. what sounded like at least half a dozen dogs barking, snarling, and some howling. and something screaming.(i say something because it wasnt a dog. it was something i couldnt identify) now that scared me. withinin seconds our dogs came running back, i mean really fast and were uneasy and very nervous for most of the night. later on i would say around 1:30 the girls in the girls dorm started screaming and said they saw someone at the balcony door. i dont know if that was related to what greg and i saw or the incident with the dogs but needless to say it was a very strange night to say the least.\r\ni guess the reason i am telling this story is because i want to know if anyone else in the ducthess county area witnessed

and clear night. it didnt take long for the first ufo to fly over. from my perspective i saw what first looked like a star moving slowly across the sky. i automatically knew that it couldnt be a plane because first, it was high enough to be thought as a star second, it didnt make any sound and it disappeared right after it cross over me. man made object usually have flashing lights, this didnt, it was just a glowing light moving very swift through the night sky. after that first sighting, i didnt take my eye off the sky for a spit second. as minutes went by i began to see more of these star like objects crossing the night sky one by one about every 20 minutes. one in particular was crossing the sky in a swirl zig zag way, like the way a snake moves on the ground. after about a hour's past, i have seen a total of 6 unidentified objects. that really amazes me because this is my 3 ufo sighting in the past 3 weeks for me and i have never seen any before so. one that completely blew me away was a week ago when me and a buddy were laying on a trampoline star gazing and we both saw a object that looked like a moving star due to how far away it seemed. it was moving at a very slow rate to a complete stop when it then turned into a huge blue flash and it was gone. something that gets me is that tonight, each time i lost sight of the ufo it was a few seconds each time one would pass. as if it was flying so fast in space, i only got quick glimpses of them. i dont know how to explain what i have me seeing in the night skies lately but i hope its a sign that change is coming somehow

one of the regular stars in the sky and then began to move slowly to about a 50 degree level opposed to the horizon.  this object then simply disappeared without a trace.  no sounds were heard.  about a week earlier i had viewed something similar at almost an angle of 90 degrees while laying on my back after a jog.  i was looking straight up and viewed a green colored starlike object moving at about the same speed.  this object was moving and came to a dead stop straight up at about the same altitude.  i remained fixated on this point for about 25 minutes and it did not move from that spot

single animal living on the farm had followed us thru the woods and back to the clearing.  5 dogs and about the same number of cats.  it was eerily still and quiet.  we had also heard coyotes/wolves howling about an hour before sighting for at least 30 minutes. \r\n\r\ni glanced up at the sky and my first reaction was \"wow, that is a really bright star\"/\"wow that one individual star is brighter than all others and putting off a lot of light\".  \r\n\r\nthen i realized how much it was twinkling.  i thought \"okay, i know stars do twinkle like the song but this thing is
