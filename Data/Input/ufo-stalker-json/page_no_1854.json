look it it also. slowly it descended below the second wire, then slowly went back up, all along using the eletrical wires to judge where it was at. this all occured in a matter of minutes. then it descended back down then moved northwest moving quite a distant. i suddenly saw a plane fly across the path it had been in...And i knew this was a plane. all a sudden i saw another very faint orb-like object appear to the southwest of the plane and the first star like object. now i was watching the electric pole to judge the first object and it was just pass it. the second faint orb did nothing for several moments, then suddenly glowed for half a second i would guess. then the first orb started to slowly move more northwest...And the second orb followed, emitting a glow every few minutes. i began to judge the second orb movements by the electrical wires...And it appeared to be following the first orb, although the kept the same distance from each other. i observed two more airplanes fly between the two orbs during this time. finally i went in the house, but i could still see both orbs in the distant sky. i really have no idea what they were...But i do know they weren't planes.

appeared flat. it was very brief, maybe 3 seconds, but in that time it flashed from a bright and pale blue to totally invisible to me two times before totally leaving my field of view. it may have been nothing but i know that no meteor i've ever seen flashes and the distance this thing seemed to travel, from my perspective, was very large. also, i think i made out a darker circle within the larger, main one but it was such a short view and moved so quickly i can not be 100% certain about this fact. i'd love to know if anyone else happened to see this but i know the likelihood of that is

the road. i got out and noticed that the car behind me stopped and got out too. as i took the photo i realized that at least 7 cars had stopped and were watching. it lasted about 3 minutes from when

(swisher/shueyville exit).  as i approached the rest stop from the north i noticed a iowa state trooper pulled over on the side of the road with his cherries on.  as i drove past him, i looked in my rearview mirror and noted only his rear cherries were on as from the front, he only had parking lights on and not even headlights turned on.  i just thought that was odd, it was as if he were watching something.  so i instinctively scanned the skys and to my southeast, i saw several orange lights in the sky approximately over shueyville.  \r\n\r\nfor a second i thought they must be on a cell tower or building but then i knew there were no towers or tall buildings in that area so i kept looking and that's when i noticed the lights were slowly changing position in relationship to each other.  i also for a second thought maybe they were fireworks but as i kept driving south, the lights did not change intensity and did not fall to the ground.  they did not blink and were just a light orange color.\r\n\r\nby this time i was nearing my exit so i started up the exit ramp and pulled over on the side of the road.  i tried to take a picture with my blackberry but the picture just turned out black - the camera was just not sensitive enough to pick out the orange lights.  they had no shape as they were too far away but they did not appear to be at a very high altitude - maybe like the altitude of an airplane on appoach to an airport.  i could not hear anything other than the sounds of i-380.  there were at least 3 lights and they very slowly changing position in relationship with each other but other than that, did not appear to move in any specific direction relative to where i was parked.  after about 2 more minutes of watching them, they just started faded, one at a time, until there was nothing left.  \r\n\r\ni have lived in this area all of my life and have never seen flares dropped and there are no military bases nearby.  that said, these may have been flares but i don't know why or who would drop flares around here and having never personally seen flares dropped, i have nothing to compare them to.\r\n\r\nif anyone else saw these or knows what they were, please

with my binoculars.  then i started to notice more strange things and became very aware of my surroundings.  since that first light i now know that there are things with almost a \r\npredator like look about them.  i actually saw when the wind blew a lime green snake like object with big green eyes with a vertical black line in the middle looking around and several feet away a brown and white owl like object under my tree with tiny moveable lights.  i took my video camera and caught it on hd.  i have since discovered there is actually something in tree's.  i have many videos of lights in the tree's, during day and night.  i see after all my current awareness that there is something illuminating the tree's.  i feel like there always watching.  because you usually see two lit dots close together then one or all will dim out.  it seems to manipulate the foliage and has some intellictual intent to hide.  but i see it!!!!  i am an rn, not registered nut! i have proof that will back up my statements.  the wind really seems to excacerbate these things.  the setting and rising sun lights really glitters brillantly off these things in the trees.  at night i get a little scared because i saw a projection like large snake like face in my binoculars looking at me.  at work, i caught this deformed snake like object(s), in a tree at night all green, moving and lighting up when i took my cell phone and video camera to it.  i have an employee witness this with me and alone.  please help.  i need to know what a professional thinks of my footage.  i want you to come and see for yourself.  i know this can't be explained.  but i know this is real!  \r\n   this all started in april, 2011.  i also have seen a silver blinking dancing light in the sky at times.  and there is a red, green, yellow reflection on my neighbors garage door. also, i have seen it above the tree line and i think in the sky.  \r\n   one night at sunset i saw red lights twirling around in two occassions in the woods. scary.  and when i was at work i saw a christmas light like bubble blob over a tree then followed by two red twinkling round ones in succession.  my witness saw one of them two.  this is when he started to think i was crazy until i showed him that weired lighted green thing in the tree.  i have it on my camera's.  call me, cell is [phone number removed/cms/tg]].  i have seen you guys

work for us customs in piegan, montana. my past id is 194485 class 626a sept. 2006.\r\n\r\ni was attacked on bridge in charleston, west virginia and somehow taken to another bridge about 1 or 2 miles from where i was at. my mind is blank..I do not know what or how i was taken.\r\n\r\nphysical problems since the attack-these beings put something in my right ear and i came back to nc with telepathic abilities. \r\n\r\ntelepathic ability- i will attempt to explain this- it is like being able to hear other humans in my head without the use of my ears. it is like listening to a radio and not being able to turn this off. the others that i am able to hear talking in my head have used me like their own et doll. i mean they have attempted to program me like a computer. they have used the book of war on me. they have attempted to make me go without sleep for days-usually 3 at a time until i go nuts. i finally just got to the point i would take a sleep aid to knock me out. as long as i get sleep i am ok and can function. some of the speech patterns are familar to me of humans that i know. i have even tested these other humans and gave them my cell phone number and address attempting to get them to make actual contact. these other humans or whatever they are will not do this. so basically i hear them talking about me 24 hours a day other than when i am asleep. sleep is the only break i get! these others that i can hear have developed some kind of code or use certain words that sort-of clue me in on who they are. these telepathic thing is totally seperate from when i am attacked by the alien beings. when i am attacked by the alien beings i am physically being attacked. others may not be able to see the beings but they can touch me. they mess around with my physical body. they have not bothered me since may. these being come and go..They will appear to be lights or shadows-orbs or gray like beings.\r\n\r\n\r\nproblems i have gone through since my return to nc- when i first got back i was in shock..Instead of someone taking me to my regular doctor and getting me checked out physically my mother had me thrown into a mental hospital. i was tortured by foreign doctors. it took me 1 month to get released. my career in law-enforcement was destroyed by this action being taken. i am not crazy! i have been attacked by these beings and no-one would believe me. i am banned at home from saying the word alien, customs, or montana. i am not allowed to talk about what has happened to me. basically i am told to just get on with my life and forget.\r\n\r\ni have been beat up by the cops here in nc-cherryville city and cleveland county sheriff department and rutherford county sheriff department. basically someone in my family will go and take out involuntary committment papers on me and then the cops chase me down and send me off to a mental hospital where they attempt to kill me by over dosing me on meds. the last attempt to kill me in a hospital was at gaston memorial where they forced meds on me that dropped my bp down to 77/44. if i am sent off to a local hospital it will take up to 2 weeks to get out. if i am sent off to a state hospital it will take 1 month. \r\n\r\ni work full-time as a cna at cleveland pines in shelby, nc and i will be going to college this fall at cleveland community college in shelby, nc. i am going back to school this fall for nursing-rn degree.\r\n\r\nwhat i need from you guys is protection-from the police and from being thrown into mental hospitals when there is nothing wrong with me. \r\n\r\ni need for you guys to move in people around me in this area-gaston county-cleveland county-rutherford county-see if you guys start picking up this telepathic thing going on down here.\r\n\r\nevery time i get thrown into a mental hospital the first people i call are the church of scientology in charlotte, nc and then they make contact with ca or ny. ny has saved my life before from kings mountain hospital where they were attempting to kill me with meds. \r\n\r\nyou may contact me through me e-mail [email removed/cms/tg] i do not have my own computer but i am saving to buy one. i do not have a phone right now

this to me feb-15-2010. i have been fighting to get him back and i will be in court in gaston county tues-at 9:30am. i am doing all that i can to get my child back and if there is anything that you

speed of a slow moving prop plane or helicopter, maybe a bit slower actually. these objects were red in color, with no pulsating lights, no strobe, no change in color, no flickering etc. they were just a constant red glow. the objects all moved at the same rate of speed, same direction and at the same altitude. they never drifted apart from one another always maintaing the same distance from one another. they were very large and you could not have missed them much, much larger than landing lights or marker lights of planes etc. when these objects came to a certain point in the sky, roughly above my neighbors house, the lights would turn off. no fading or flickering, again, just like a light switch and they were out. i followed one to that point and when the light went out i could make out an outline of a rectangular like shape briefly before it was obscured by trees.\r\nif i had to judge i would say the altitude was between 1,000 and 5,000 feet. speed would be less than 100 knots and approximate location (direction or landmark it was following) would have been centered over memorial drive, give or take. \r\ni know memorial drive is a common approach land mark for planes flying into tia however, these were not planes. there was absolutely no noise coming from them and the amount that were there would have made a racket. in fact, it was oddly quiet for the city on a saturday night further adding to the no noise. \r\nall in all i would say that there was approximately 25 or so of the lights. they seemed organized yet random, if you catch my drift? one grouping had a formation, 5 objects, like geese but without the lead bird. \r\nthis was my first ever experience of anything that i couldn't put a rational explanation to. it left my wife and i a bit excited, to say the least. my wife took several pictures on her phone but only one came out. i think she was shaking so the objects appear smeared. if you notice in the upper part of the picture you see many more smaller red \"orbs\" i had not noticed these until today.

i called my duty station in piegan, montana-don terry whom is now working and canada and begged for someone to come and help me. \r\n\r\nfact-something took me from one bridge in charleston, west virginia and took me to another bridge about 1 or 2 miles away. my mind is blank-the only physical affect that i have suffered is coming back to nc with telepathic abilities. \r\n\r\ngetting back to my attempt to get to my duty station. i made it back to nc from west virginia. i re-scheduled and tried again. i had no problems until amtrak train 29 dc to chicago. i could not afford to fly so i was stuck back on amtrak attempting to make it to montana. \r\n\r\non train 29 dc to chicago i felt like i had been drugged. my heart was skipping beats, my mouth dry and numbness in my head and arms and confusion and slurred speech. i called 911 from the train and was taken to a hospital in chicago. i told the doctor that i felt like i had been drugged on the train and i was en-route to work for us customs in montana. the doctor was a white male in his 40's tall brown hair maybe 6'2 190lbs. i overheard the doctor tell someone in the hallway that he did not want homeland security in there investigating! when i over heard this i knew i was not going to get the care and test that i needed. i signed myself out of the hospital and put my customs id on the paperwork-194485 class 626a sept-2006. i stayed at a hotel withing walking distance from the hospital for one night and attempted to treat myself. \r\n\r\ni made it as far as rugby, north dakota and called my duty station and told them that i still felt like i was being tracked and hunted and that i felt like i had been drugged. i was told that because i was 2 days late for duty to turn around and go back to nc and start the process over again. \r\n\r\nus congressman patrick mchenry attempted to get me re-instated to my same position but some smart ass from customs in dc sent back a letter indicating that my travel difficulties were not serious enough to give me re-instatement.\r\n\r\ni had to call someone in nc and borrow money to rent a car to get back to nc. i had spent everything i had to make it to montana. i rented a car from minot, north dakota-the first rental car place as you walk in the door to the left. they would not give me a car-even though they had a parking lot filled with cars. they insisted that i drive a white van with virginia tags on it back to nc. i found this strange. before i left north dakota i called don terry at my duty station in piegan montana and told him the tag number on the van. i felt like the damn thing was going to blow up and it had been sprayed down with something. \r\n\r\ni am leaving out details because i am being rushed to get off the computer. i am at a cookout at my boyfriends sisters house. \r\n\r\nsince sept-2006 i have been attacked by these beings 1 or 2 times a year.\r\n\r\nthese beings may appear as shadows, lights, orbs, or grey like beings. they have put something in my right ear. these beings touch me..They can basically do what they want to me and my own boyfriend is laying beside of me not knowing a damn thing is going on. i can feel when these beings are around and they have been back since feb-05-2011. these beings can also jump into other humans and their eye color will change. these beings are coming in stages and then leaving. \r\n\r\ni am having to get off the computer..If there is anyone out in this world that is going through what i am please e-mail me at [email removed/cms/tg]\r\n\r\nsincerely, amy in nc\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":29413,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.7618731,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06052011-0015","longitude":-79.0164797,"occurred":1305356400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North Carolina","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1307312540000,"summary":"Same attack since sept-2006","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":22,"locationName":"North Carolina","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:54505"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Woodstock","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My 7 yr old son, my wife and i were driving down i-575, heading toward towne lake pkwy (exit 8) from holly springs (exit 14). a bad storm was brewing so we were trying to get home before it got bad. as we were approaching exit 11 (sixes rd). my wife says to me \"what is that\" she pointed to my left (i was driving). i look on the north bound side of i-575, hovering about 75-100 ft above the tree line was, plain as day, a blackish-gray cylinder object and it was moving slowly across. astounded by what i was seeing, i got my sons attention and we all watched this object as we drove past it. i wanted to stop and take a video or something but my wife refused because of the storm. it was not moving fast, it had nothing attached to the bottom of it or the sides. very strange!
