a long, thin, string-like,\"tail\" behind it.  it was completely white against the setting sun, midway over the olympic mountain range...This was being viewed with binoculars from ne thurston county, on the puget sound, and a crystal clear evening. it could also be seen by the naked eye.  \r\n\r\nthe olympic mountain range is approximately 45 miles in the nw direction from my parents' house on puget sound, near olympia/lacey wa. on a nice, summer evening like we had tonight, the olympics are in full view.  we have lived in this house since 1970, and my parents have looked out over the olympics for years.  \r\n\r\nneither of them have ever seen anything resembling this object before.  we have seen our share of airplanes coming & going from sea-tac intl airport (approx 50 miles to the north) or joint base lewis-mcchord (approx 20 miles to the ne)...We've seen comets and asteroids. we have seen pancake clouds; clouds of all shapes and distinctions, especially as the sun goes down with a myriad of odd light fluctuations. this was a completely different phenomenon.  \r\n\r\nthe most interesting aspect to them was the motionless, hovering nature of it; just hanging there in the sky over the olympics...Defying gravity. it did not move for approx 15 minutes after the initial sighting. they did witness it \"fade away\" slowly, then \"poof\", gone.   \r\n\r\nthis was truly an \"unidentified flying object\" or more precisely, \"hovering object.\"   again, my parents have been looking at the grand vistas and skies of south puget sound for years.  they had no explanation for what they saw, or what this may have been.  i am their son, eric, who is writing this account on their behalf, since they do not use computers or type as fast. ;)  i did not personally witness this event.  my parents have never claimed to witness a ufo before, and my dad usually has an explanation for everything, a true skeptic.  tonight, he had no explanation or justification for what he witnessed. \r\n\r\noddly, this observation of theirs left them \"calmly perplexed\"...For lack of a better description. they did not panic or shout or \"ohhh and awww.\" it didn't seem to bother them that they couldn't identify it, but they seemed calmly serene, as if they truly witnessed something that could not be rationally explained.   \r\n\r\nboth have excellent vision, and both described the object to me in exactly the same terms.  i hope this adds something to the dialogue, or a corroboration of other sightings in the area.  (my parents thought it would have been visible to a great many people, since it was such a clear sunset...And quite a population in western washington who have access, if they care to look, at the olympics...From olympia, lakewood, tacoma, seattle, and everett, etc.)","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":29404,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":47.0395241,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06052011-0006","longitude":-122.8966851,"occurred":1307248200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Bullet,   Missile,   Cigar","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1307272579000,"summary":"Hovering cigar shaped object with long, thin tail over olympic mountains","tags":["hovering"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Olympia, Washington","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:54842"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Grapevine","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My family and i were on our way back from fort worth texas we were traveling north bound on highway 121 just past dfw airport. just as as i pass bass pro shop road to my left i see a group of white static lights, they are not blinking. i've driven this route many times but not usually at night and my first thought was that there were some elevated wires of some kind that had lights on them that i had never noticed before because the lights were not moving. they just hung there. so they had to be on some wires or a pole or something is what i'm thinking. when i first see it, the object is ahead of me on the west side of highway 121. if i'm looking out the front windshield the object is at about 11 o'clock. five seconds or so later as the object is at about 10 o'clock i see that the lights are in a v shape and i can see the dark outline of the object as it is contrasted against the night sky. there are five lights on at the point of the v and two on each \"wing\". they are evenly spaced apart and they are not strobing or radiating as far as i can tell. they are just on, bright white static lights. i ask my wife and my fifteen year old son if they see it and they say they do. five more seconds pass and the object is at the 9 o'clock position. there is no doubt that the lights are in a v shape. my wife and son are asking aloud \"what is that?\" and \"how are those lights just floating there?\". we pass the object and i track it in my rear view mirror. it starts out hovering then it begins to float over the freeway moving eastward in the direction of eastbound 635. i want to stop but its at night and we're on the freeway so i keep driving. my wife tracks it from the passenger seat for about 20 more seconds until it's out of sight behind some trees. the whole sighting lasted about thirty seconds. i can only guess as to how far away it was or how fast it floated away so i'll refrain from doing so. it definitely hovered, it definitely floated away and it was definitely v shaped . the object did not have flashing or blinking lights of any kind. i immediately took note of the time, the van clock read 10:51 pm cst and i said it aloud to my wife because i wanted to remember the date and the exact time that we saw the object. i came home and google searched \"dallas ufo\" and as of this writing i have found nothing. so i wanted to make sure the event was documented. it happened over a busy freeway near an airport so it had to have been seen by others.

rest of our evening there. we were in a toyota car and as were approaching her house i noticed in the southern sky about 15-20 amber-colored lights, arranged in a perfectly spaced crescent formation. they were stationary and did not move even when i stopped my car for a few seconds. they just stood there like beacons in the night sky. they were very obvious, anyone facing south tonight could not have missed them. they did not shimmer, flicker, pulsate or blink. \r\n\r\ni immediately pointed them out to my wife and we both started watching them as i was driving about 15 mph on one of our neighborhood streets in the direction of the lights (south). my first thought was that it was fireworks, because they looked like the fireballs you see on the fourth of july. but they weren't moving or fading at all after 10 or 20 seconds. my next thought was that it might be some astronomy club demonstration of some sort, because the shape they were in resembled the shape of the big-dipper to my eye. but they were much to high and perfectly spaced and none of them seemed to be drifting. that was when i realized i was witnessing a ufo. it reminded me of the phoenix lights.\r\n\r\n i sped home to my mothers house as fast as possible to tell her so she could them too. i arrived there about 20 seconds later and ran inside and told her to go out and look. then all three of us went into the backyard and watched the lights. we could just see a few of the lights through the trees that line her backyard fence.\r\n\r\nthe lights then started moving north very slowly, first in a formation then slowly separating. there was not wind tonight. they were definitely being propelled by something other than wind because they were moving quite fast, yet not as fast as a helicopter or plane.\r\n\r\ni could then see three of them together in a triangle shape. we all stood quietly and my wife and i could hear a sound coming from them. they made a soft whirring sound like a quiet fan would. or maybe it resembled a small electric motor. it was not loud at all, you would not be able to hear it if you someone was talking next to you, it was quite soft.\r\n\r\ni was excited by this time and so i ran to go to the park by our house so i could get an unobstructed view but before i made it there the lights had already passed over my position at the same speed but there were only 3 or 4 remaining. as i watched the last few they seemed to be growing dim, like a spark or ember. i thought, \"are they perhaps chinese lanterns?\" i've never seen a chinese lantern before in real life so i don't know. but how could they stay in a perfect, symmetrical shape and move together in unison like that if that's what they were? besides, they were much much too high to be anything tethered to the ground.\r\n\r\nthen i walked back to my house and my mother and wife were standing at the end of our street. i guess they were walking to join me at the park and get a better look.\r\n\r\nsuddenly a car pulled up and stopped. it was our neighbors a couple of doors down. they are a married couple, and friendly acquaintances of ours. my mother asked them if they just saw the lights and they told us that they indeed had and their description was exactly what we saw. they were beside themselves with excitement just as we were. the man said they also saw a shooting start in the eastern sky just a second or two before he noticed the lights. we talked for about 15 minutes, puzzled about what we had just seen and trying to reason what they could possibly have been.\r\n\r\ni asked them if they had heard the sound but neither had, maybe because they were in their car. the man said he tried to snap a photo of it on his cell phone but couldn't snap a shot, for some reason which i forget now. maybe his battery was dead i think. i didn't have a camera on me but even if i did i don't know if they would have shown up on a digital camera.\r\n\r\nevidently, while i was walking to the park, my mom called our next-door neighbor and told her to come outside and see this, whereupon she came outside, observed them for a minute and was said\"what is it? what is it?That is really weird!\"\r\n\r\nmy mother tried calling the airport but nobody answered. she called the police and the dispatcher said that they had about 7 calls about them. she said the number of lights reported by others was 25-50. i could only see 15-20 but perhaps that's because there were tall trees all around that partially obscured my view.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

following event took place on may 18, 2011 at around 10:15 pm during a nightly stroll around my neighborhood. the air is warm, the mood is chill, and the skies are mildly cloudy. \r\nderek, a close friend of mine, and i were walking around my neighborhood smoking cigarettes and engaging in worthy conversation. we were pondering on the half-ounce of marijuana we were soon to purchase. mind you, we were sober at this time as this was before we possessed or smoked any marijuana. nevertheless, all of a sudden, i noticed two or three spherical orange lights in the sky in front and well above us. they were positioned very high, probably well above the clouds. they appeared to be fairly large, larger than the stars that were in the sky at the time. honestly, i cannot say exactly how big the lights were as there was no way to gauge exactly how far away the lights were from us. from perspective, they were around three to four times the size of any star that was visible. as i pointed them out to derek, in a series, two or three lights came on from the left of the already circularly-aligned three. the five or six lights that were now glowing formed a tilted circular shape and according to derek, \"it appeared to be spinning\". the shape that the five or six lights formed as a whole did not appear to be spinning from my perspective. the lights just kind of hung in the sky and did not move at all; they were completely motionless. after just a few seconds, i'd say around 5 to 8 seconds, the lights went out in no particular order but almost all at the same time. they just kind of winked out. i am not sure if the lights were apart of one big object; each light could have been it's own object. but interestingly the lights formed a plausible saucer shape. and i say again, these lights were orange and spherical in nature. i am very interested in the paranormal and the mystery of ufos and always have been. i have researched the subject extensively in my spare time. when i first saw these lights appear, i immediately pointed them out to derek because i have seen orange lights in the sky before, and they never stay on for very long... it's strange. it seems as if the lights know that you are looking at them.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":29400,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.30723148141925,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08082011-0118","longitude":-82.03198872270177,"occurred":1305782100000,"potentialRelations":[29151],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Georgia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

of my home.\r\nreached down to ring out my wash mitt and happened to look about directly over my house as something caught my eye.\r\ni looked and saw what looked like a single pinkish-orange, sodium vapor street light colored, flickery like a flame in the wind, sphere traveling toward the south west about at a compass heading of 240 degrees to 250 degrees toward the sw. it slowed to almost a stop at about almost 95 to 100 degrees from over my house then sped back up to the regular speed, i ran in to get my wife to see it too, and it started a curve more to the west at a heading of 250-260 degrees and gaining altitude till it looked like a very faint moving star that vanished in the the night sky. it was about 9:28 pm. it was completly silent.\r\nthe sky was mostly clear with small, mid level cumulus cloud, sprinkled in on a stiff evening breez out of the due east, clouds also traveling from due east to due west.\r\nmy wife got to see this first light and got to see it vanish into the western sky at a very high atitude at about 2,800 mph as a jet fighter at 20,000 feet might look with afterburners on, but not conical like afterburners look and too round and flickery.\r\ni tried to photo them with my cell phone cam, but it didnt take too dark.\r\nmy wife went inside to take a shower as she is not much into anything out of the usual and presumes it was a freak airplane or something.\r\nthen i was telling the neighbor and his wife, daughter, son and friends, who came out.\r\nright then three more started above the tree line from out of the north east heading in the same direction as the first one at the same speed, one of the three seemed below the cumulus cloud bases, and passed through one small cloud completly illuminating it like a flare would, not a head light or plane landing light that has a forward aiming beam effect, and the others were above them, but the clouds were small and few between. i raced in to get my digital camera and came out to photo these, got three of them in my photos. all 6 of my neighbores, myself and my 8 year old daughter, and my 5 year old son saw these three. my neighbor's son of about 26 years old also got his camera out and took photos.\r\nas they passed overhead they too seemed to gain atitude till they were mere faint stars racing toward the almost westerly heading till they dissapeared, then three more rose over the ne horizon also spaced by what i could guess as a two to three mile spacing, one right behind the other also flickering two of thee three changed color to a brilliant red, but kept on flickering like a flame in the wind then they switched back to the pinkish orange as they gradually faded away to faint points of light mixing in the stars to the west of miami. one last one followed the last three for a total of about 8. i ran back in to get my wife who was in a towel and checked the time it was about 9:35 pm\r\nby then a total of 8 people saw them, and my wife was still in the shower, but was brought to the attention more were flying overhead.I then called miami-dade police non-emergency and officer at the phones also said multiple call were starting to come in regarding strange

plane go by in the same direction, then i turned my head toward my house. the next thing i new when i turned back, a turqoise glowing cigar-shaped object with diamond-shaped dark yellow-orange sparks emmitting from its rear appeared in thin air and traveled at a remarkable speed at a 45 degree angle downward, in the direction of a nearby cornfield. from what i saw, this thing appeared to be crashing. my encounter was brief, because i lost sight of it as it moved behind a tree and i was not able to see it again. at first, i thought it might be fireworks, but it never exploded, did not make noise, did not have a smell, was travelling at a straight trajectory downwards, and did not have smoke nor a visible fuse. plus, the cigar split into two equal cigars with very little distance between them, and they continued to safely travel in a straight line keeping that exact distance between them.\r\n\r\nfor a while, my sister and i had no clue what this was. we went inside and talked to our mother about it, but she did not believe us. so, without consulting each other, we went to opposite sides of the room and drew pictures of what we'd seen. then, my mom finally seemed to believe

(allegheny county) located near pittsburgh pennsylvania, in my single engine cessna 172. at 8:23 pm eastern time, my attention was drawn to a fairly bright light located in the sky out of my front window at approximately an 11 o ���clock position relative to the nose of my aircraft. over the next few seconds this light exhibited a strange behavior not typical for conventional aircraft.\r\n\r\nimmediately after the event occurred, i recorded a series of hand written notes on a charlotte vfr sectional, since i was unable to locate a notepad at the time. my notes read exactly as follows:\r\n\r\nmarch 7th 2011\r\n8:23 pm\r\n298 miles from\r\nkacg direct\r\nfrom ryy\r\nleft front window\r\n11:00 o clock\r\nat least 20kft\r\nslightly brighter than\r\njet landing light\r\nsky clear  at least 30- 50 miles away\r\nfades > s-turn in assent\r\nbrightest top\r\nfades as it moves side\r\nas soon as i look up it moves and takes s turn\r\n\r\nthe following is my own account of the event from memory, as i recalled it approximately three months later:\r\n\r\nmy autopilot was engaged and i was checking something on my iphone. as i looked up briefly to engage in a regular scan of my instrument panel, my attention was drawn to a light located in the sky. at first it appeared almost exactly as a normal landing light on a conventional aircraft, with the acceptation being that it appeared slightly brighter in intensity. the color temperature of the light appeared identical to that of a traditional halogen landing light (yellowish white cct approximately 3500 degrees kelvin).  it appeared to move slowly from my right to left (opposite to my direction of travel) and then appeared to accelerate while performing an ascending right turn towards the west. i now estimate the craft may have been 20 miles away, slightly closer than i originally assumed. my altitude at the time was 10,500 feet msl, and the light appeared at a slightly higher altitude than my own.\r\n\r\nmy general speculations about this event:\r\n\r\nit is extremely easy and common to misidentify objects and lights in the sky, even for experienced pilots. this is mainly due to lack of a reference point, making it difficult to determine factors such as distance, speed, altitude, and size. however, i have logged a significant portion of night hours and have always paid close attention to the appearance of other aircraft in the night sky. due to the maneuvers performed by the light i witnessed (perceived as accelerating ascending right turn) i can state with some confidence that what i witnessed was most likely not a conventional aircraft. in my opinion, there is a very good possibility it may have been some type of high performance, top secret, or/and experimental craft. based on my estimate, it is possible this craft was traveling in excess of 1000 knots, but a truly accurate speed cannot be determined due to a lack of reference points. i must note, as the light appeared to perform the turning maneuver; the intensity grew consistency dimmer in a very linear fashion. this is important to note because the light appeared to remain dim, but visible, as it proceeded away from my aircraft. this is not a typical trait of a forward facing landing light found on conventional aircraft. \r\n\r\nmy onboard gps was programmed direct for kagc, my destination in pennsylvania. gps indicated my distance was 298 nautical miles from kagc. i later estimated my magnetic coarse would have been approximately 035 degrees. this indicates my aircraft location was in close proximity to morristown tennessee.  without factoring for a wind correction angle, i can estimate the strange light i witnessed may have been located in close proximity to the harlan kentucky general area.\r\n\r\nthe weather underground archives indicate the following conditions on that day at 8:20 pm, as recorded from the jonesville virginia weather reporting station. temperature 37.4 degrees f, due point 30.2 degrees f, humidity 75%, sea level pressure 30.21 in, visibility 10 miles, wind calm, no gusts, no precipitation, conditions partly cloudy. \r\n\r\nmy conclusion:\r\n\r\nbased on lack of data, all i can conclude at this time is that i witnessed the visible white light being emitted from a self-powered and intelligently controlled object or vehicle, as it performed maneuvers not typical to conventional aircraft.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":29396,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.2201314,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06042011-0020","longitude":-83.2871522,"occurred":1299484800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Tennessee","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1307233068000,"summary":"I

the bedroom they would lead me to the window and on the ground below me was what i called the elfs the little ones(3+'). the reson why they did this is to let me know that they mean me no harm,that the little one is my friend. i have had many encounters with them-other then a few family member i have never talked about this,cause to me they are not here to harm us they have been here long before us and are here to help humanity to servife. all my life doctors have said i should not be alive and i still am,thanks to the ets, i dont know why they help us but they do. i can tell you of many encounters with them--like one day back in 1970 w'ill an eclispe they came into the house and it was like we knew they were coming and we hid behind the bathroom door and when it was over no one in my family knew of nothing happening-35 years after the fact i was talking with my mom asking her about that day and she says that she dont know what i'm talking about-yet i remember it like yesterday. throghout my life they have been in and out of it. like i said i dont fear them cause i know in my heart that if they wanted to destroy us they could.I remember they told me they are from 2 galaxsys away from earth- they did not use the world time travel, they used the term time milipeation (bending of time) in average time they said it would talk 360 years to get to earth. but by muilipeation of

lake. while fishing we noticed stars out in the distance that near the horizon. the weird thing is that they looked like they were fluttering. sometimes gases make a star look like they are moving but they really aren't so after talking about it for a while we just ignored it. on this night the moon was really bright so you really didn't even really need a flashlight. after a few more minutes i looked back behind us and there were thousands of these little lights almost playing in the clouds. they were interacting with each of clearly flying in and out of the clouds. at the altitude of the clouds the ufo's had to a decent size. at this point we weren't scared yet but that would change. after a few more minutes there was 3 large lights, one right over top of us and one on each side of the boat. once we saw that i threw my shirt over the latern that we had lit on the boat cause i thought maybe that was attracting them. then i started the bot and we got the hell out of there. i told my parents about the event and they made fun of me and joked about it. my dad was a chief of police back in washington pa and two week later my step-mom said to me. did your dad tell you about the men in black guys that stopped down at the police station? i said no. she said they asked him if anyone has reported seeing anything suspicious. he said no. he never said anything to me. when we were down in deep creek i was using his truck and boat. maybe this was a coincidence? i was watching your program on june 4th and the story is just like mine, almost. i never saw an alien or a ufo with spikes. but the orbs are exactly the same. i would submit to a polygraph and hopefully someone else can come forward and help explain what i saw. at the time my sisters boyfriend was with me but currently we

because i have been watching a few shows on television about similar sightings and it mentioned mufon as a place where people investigate these occurrences. the only reason i am mentioning it now is

                               it was almost dark when i was driving home. i noticed what i thought was a star in the direction that i was heading. as i got further down the road i realized it was closer than i had thought and now looked like an aircraft. i was on a long straight road with nothing but trees on either side. the light from the craft was near the end of the road over (3-5 miles) over the trees on the right side of the road. up to this point the light from the craft was not moving and not much higher than the trees. as i got half way down the road the light moved from above the trees on the right side of the road to the left side of the road and hovered again. at this point, i assumed it was a helicopter, no big deal. here is where it gets a little weird. as i was getting close to it i turned off the radio and rolled my window down so i could stick my head out the window and see what it was. i came to a very slow roll in my car when i was right next to it. what i saw from maybe 50ft away was, something hovering just over the treeline. it was making no noise. it was in the shape of a disc. it had lights or something rotating around it (which made me think it could be a silent helicopter). as i rolled past the object, i did a u turn so now it was on my right side. as i got near it again, it started moving parallel with the road. it started very slow. i started to accelerate to keep up with it. still no sound out of the object. it kept increasing speed till i couldn't keep up with it anymore and appeared to be flying as fast as a jet plane. it was weird because it showed qualities of a helicopter and a jet airplane, but disc shaped and made no noise. the area that this happened was a road that doesn't get very much usage. it was a time of year when its not busy. and there are many gravel pits beyond the trees on either side of the road. as i tell anyone who i have told this story to in the past. i don't know what it was that i saw. maybe a secret military craft, maybe a craft from a different world. whatever it was, it was amazing. just a note, in the following questionnaire i didn't know how to answer the question about colorblind yes

skyward i seen what first appeared to be possibly a roman candle. as i looked closer i thought maybe a flair. the object was about 100 to 200 feet in the air and as it got closer i could clearly see it was a round glowing orange ball about the size of a basketball. this object came directly over my house flying about 40 mph in a straight line heading north east. it was completely silent. i watched it until it flew out of sight. it was not a flair, i see flairs all the time from the grayling base. this was not a craft of any type. it was a round glowing orange ball. it had to be a probe of some sort. i wanted to get my camera but could not have gotten a photo in the short amount of time, plus i didn't want to take my eyes off of it. i have always been a believer but never thought i would be lucky enough to see something. again, it was not a craft of any kind, and it was completely silent. and it was not a balloon.","distance":"101-500

stars were and the night was cloudless. about an hour before the sliver of the moon had set in the west. was going back out after being inside maybe 30 seconds. as i opened the door looking west, for the ny border is only a mile away accross the lake, about 30 degrees up and coming from the west, directly towards me were 2 objects, side by side. they were about 2000 feet apart with the right one slightly higher and at an altitude of maybe 5000 feet. the brilllance of the white strobes was incredable, and each object had well over a dozen. no conventional marker or position lights were visable. each did have a dimly lit white area to the rear and upward from what seemed to be the rear of the craft. they both had a pattern of rapid flashing like i have never seen before where at any one time, 6 to 8 strobes would be flashing at once and all sequencing in less than a second. knew there was structure but kind of like a large sphere with randomly placed strobes.At maybe a mile distance they changed course and headed sswest with one object moving to trail behind the other by maybe 1000 feet. i would estimate their speed to be 150 to 200 mph. the nearest small airports are 20 miles east or west and these were the size of a passenger jet and definately not from there or going to and we don't exactly get much low level air traffic here and not lit like these were. i have been a pilot for 40+ years in both fixed wing and had a helicoper business. these were neither, and no sound whatsoever was erie. my fiance and just ariving neighbor witnessed them also. i have never seen lighting like that in my life. burlington vt is a 2 hour drive and albany ny the same. there is no airport they could have taken off from or been going to land at anywhere around here if they were aircraft. this is the middle of nowhere. not planes re-fueling for sure. the pilots would have been blinded. the were a few flashes of red also in the lighting. their last direction was towards manchester vt, a 30 min drive. no airport there. movement was steady. no military around here either. whoever was their pilot would need a welding mask to see. they were following no air corridors i know of. just joy flying for lack of a term. had just used up my 8gb card in camera and was too in awe to get it. there will be more. that i'm sure of. many other strange lights up here that i could have reported but this i had to. have seen many other silent strange lights up here and more frequenly in he last several months.Thanks and don't always take those lights for a plane. there is some

jellyfish or squid looking object was in the sky. i was immediately scared as i knew it was no flying object manmade. the object was huge. it had 8-10 long tentacles is the best way to describe it. they where waiving back and forth and had lights going up and down them. i would say the object was no more than 5-10 miles high. i went and woke a friend who was staying at my house and we both sat and watched as what appeared to be little craft flying in and out of the largest craft. i was almost brought to tears as i watched and knew that we in fact were not alone. my mother called the sherriff station and was only laughed at. my mother was approx. 4 miles away from me and we talked on the phone as we both witnessed this event. the jellyfish made no maneuvers other than the tentacles waving back and forth until just before sun up. as the sun rose the lights on the tentacles began to pulsate brighter and the craft slowly faded from sight. that night made me a firm

mother's home.  while i was talking to her, and because i was laying on the porch, i was looking up at the sky and i happened to notice an object that reflected the stars, like a mirror would, but it was moving very slowly, and it was very smooth, and very big, just moving slowly over the homes.  it is not something that i or anyone would have noticed because, like i said, it was like a mirror where it was showing the stars on the other side, but i was laying down and happened to notice that for some reason, even though it was reflecting the stars and sky it was moving and there was a way it was noticeable from an angle, almost like an optical illusion.  i started telling my girlfriend that she had to go outside and look at this object, it was moving so slowly that she should see it in about 10 minutes if she went outside to look, because i told her i didn't want to be the only one seeing what i was seeing.  i told her i couldn't believe what i was seeing.  i was seeing what looked like a ufo.  i don't think she went outside, and she never said she did, and even when she was taking out the trash, she didn't look, i don't think.  i was living with my mom at the time, and i know we live by the vienna airport, and i also know that the military works at the airport as well, but what i saw was not something that i believe our military has the capability to duplicate at all.  the shape was a smooth triangle shape, and it was very sleek, and i really don't think that out military has any sort of capability to reflect the sky so that any plane or airforce plane can reflect the sky like this object did.  this thing was, also, approximately the size of a football field, and the width was about the same.  and from what i could tell from the side, the height of it was big, but not really sure because like i said it was like some sort of optical illusion the way it reflected the sky and you really had to look at it to notice it.  i was scared at the time i was looking at this object because of all the ufo stories i have heard, but i was also very fascinated at the same time and did not want to stop watching it wondering what it would do next. \r\n\r\neventually i just went in the house, after it got far enough that it was no longer over my mom's house, and i felt my friend was not going to go out and look at it so i had someone to confirm i was really seeing what i was seeing, and all it appeared to be doing was moving slowly over the area.  the direction it was moving was toward the vienna airport, also.  \r\n\r\nabout 2 or 3 years later i was driving along main street in niles with one of my children and i just so happened to look up in the sky because i noticed something reflecting in the sky.  it was really high up in the sky so i am not sure of the size, but from what i could tell it was round in shape and it was silver.  i can't remember if my son or daughter was in the car, but i do remember i kept saying look, it is round in shape, and it is just staying in one spot and not moving.  what in the heck is that.  and i know for sure we don't have any planes that are round in shape and that look silver like that.  it scared me, in a way, because of that ufo i saw that night 2 or 3 years prior, and i kept thinking what the heck is going on that these ufo's are all of a sudden appearing.  this was during the afternoon hours...Not sure what time of day.  i just kept thinking i have heard so many ufo stories, i really don't want to have something happen to me.  so i just kept driving to my destination, and every now and again looking up to see if it was still there before i got to where i was going.  \r\n\r\nboth instances i was both scared and fascinated.\r\n\r\ni have told a few people about it.  but unless you see it for yourself, who is really going to believe you.

as i sit here today as a 31 year old, one of the most incredible things i have ever witnessed.  i'll set the stage, and quite frankly i don't care if you believe me, i just want to tell this story.  somehow telling it makes me feel better about it.  like, if just one person believes me when i stare into their eyes and tell it, i am somehow assured that i am not crazy.\r\n\r\nso there i was...A smart and naive 9 year old.  i loved batman and i also had a bad habit of staying up way too late.  i was working on a homemade bat cave out of cardboard and watching the original batman movie with adam west.  my mother had long ago given up on making me go to bed, and besides, it was the summer and i was out for school.  \r\n\r\nsuddenly, a strange feeling came over me.  as i sat next to two windows that had your standard mini blinds installed, i felt the need to look outside.  it was a strange overpowering need to look.  i opened one slat of the blinds and was blown away by what i saw...Tears in my eyes as i type this...\r\n\r\na large tree was across the street from my home, and there, to the left of it, an enormous craft lay perched...Motionless...To its left.  it was enormous.  based upon its position next to the tree but farther away, it must have been hundreds of feet wide and tall.  it was a disc in the middle...Your classic flying disc.  however, on the bottom was a small cone and on the top of the disc was a larger cone.  lights lined the outside of the disc.  they were green in color.  the top cone was lined with yellow or white lights and the bottom was lined with red lights.  the lights were sort of in a corkscrew pattern.  i believe, based upon its size, that they were windows.  they windows were in such an odd pattern, not symmetrical, but sort of in a corkscrew pattern.\r\n\r\ni rubbed my eyes in disbelief.  for those that have had that kind of encounter, the first thing you feel is the most intense fear you have ever felt.  i can assure you, i have never felt fear like that since.  of course, even as a 9 year old, i knew.  my belief system, everything that i knew to be the truth was forever shattered.  there was no doubt...This object was not of this world, and if the beings that manned it wanted to, we would all be dead...In an instant.\r\n\r\ni immediately panicked....Were we being invaded...What should i do?  i turned off the television and all of the lights.  i sat in the dark for a few minutes and tried to compose myself.  i was too afraid to cry...I had to look again.  i opened a single slat of the blinds and looked....It was still there, hovering like a mothership you would see in a movie.  silent and still...\r\n\r\ni ran to the kitchen; my mother asleep in her bedroom, and my stepfather snoring on the couch.  i grabbed a pad and pen and raced back to the room.  i looked through the slat again and tried to draw the craft.  unfortunately, i was and still am not an artist.  the image is seared into my mind...No tablet necessary.\r\n\r\ni closed the blinds and paced....What should i do....Should i wake up my mother...My stepfather....I opened the blinds again and....It was gone...Without a trace.  no sound, no lights, just gone.\r\n\r\nsince that night, there is no doubt, we are not alone.  the craft was massive....And there was no doubt that it was not of this earth.  since that date, i know we are not alone.  most importantly, i know that we, or our government, can't do anything to stop them if they decide to stay on a permanent basis.  \r\n\r\nlet us all hope they are friendly...Let us all hope we survive it when they do come.\r\n\r\ni have not told you a story tonight...I have recounted a memory...One i wish i didn't have.  for if i did not...My cozy little naive world would still exist.    \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),  Patterned
