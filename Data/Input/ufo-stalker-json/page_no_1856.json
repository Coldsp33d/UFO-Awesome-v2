shooting star, but dismissed both of those ideas when we noticed how fast the object was moving, and that it had no tail, nor did it burn out, like shooting stars normally do.  the object traveled on a straight path heading from south to north.  the sighting caused us to question what we were seeing, and ultimately, phoned a friend to tell him what we saw, and he referred us to this website.  we

about 8 inches across and very bright.  it went back and forth about 10-12 feet along the branches.  however, it was in front of the branch because the density of the light never changed.   there was

get to her house you must climb a steep hill that, if traveling in a car, puts you facing the western sky. it was very sporadic weather that whole day having been sunny, overcast, and raining. there had also been thunder and lightning earlier. as i was traveling up the hill i noticed two small dots of light in the sky. they were orange in color and appeared to be very high in the air. they caught my attention immediately because they were moving in very random patterns, zig-zaging around in a very erratic ways. i knew quite instantly that i was observing ufos. i have seen documentaries that describe similar sightings and because i am quite positive nothing that i have ever seen in the air has the ability to move in these ways. i was absolutely in awe of this spectacle, mostly because i am very interested in ufos and am an unwavering believer in their existence. i stopped my car in the middle of the street and continued to observe the ufos for a few moments before deciding to pull out my cell phone and call my girlfriend and tell her to go outside and see them for herself. it was at this moment one of the dots seemed to fade quickly away, as if zipping off into the atmosphere. i continued to watch the other one as it danced around in the same random fashion. just as i got my girlfriend on the phone the remaining ufo zipped away, slower than the first but in the same direction and fashion. i described the event to my girlfriend and several other close friends afterward.

upside down triangle benieth them. i even watched to see if the 'triangle' area in the center would pass over any stars and obstruct my view of them, but it didn't even pass over a single star. after looking at it about 10 or 15 seconds, i realized i had my camera on me, so i shakily took it out of my purse, all while repeatedly glancing upward at the object. i began recording, when it was almost strait over-head, and recorded for 1 min, 11 sec, until it disappeared behind some trees beside my house. (unfortunatally, my 14mp kodak camera does not record well at night, so all i got was black screen, heavy breathing, and then 'blair witch' type commentary once i realized how heavily i was breathing on film. but, if any of you official ppl from mufon care to contact me, to analyze my vid and see if you can pull anythiing out of it, that would be great... i know nothing about video editing.) so, once it disappeared from sight, i stopped recording, and though i was terrified, i was also in awe, so i put my camera down and ran around to the side of my house to watch it disappear to the horizon and the very barely early daylight. the creepiest part though, is that the further away it got, the more it appeared as though it was really, litterally spraying something down (the hazy light). this was definatally unlike any ufo footage i have ever seen, it was sooo strange. cannot find anything that compares! never thought i would see a ufo living here, as we have 2 airforce bases, 1 army base and norad!!!\r\n\r\nthe stats (flat out):\r\n-2 fixed (not varying in distance from eachother) bright white lights\r\n-perfectly angled/aligned with the direction of travel (approx. sw to ne)\r\n-a

airplanes in the distance (approx 10 pm central time). we were out there for an hour or so total. at 10:26 pm we noticed a yellowish/orange bright ball of light appear out of nowhere,just above the tree lilne in the front yard,the object seemed to move a little closer in our direction (we were north of the object). at first we though it was an air plane but noticed it had no blinking lights and the light was too large to be a plane that far away. i would say it was atleast a mile or two away. the object quickly veered eastward then faded away. it did not fade into the distance, it faded as if a battery lost its power. we were very baffled and tried to find logical explanations for what we had just seen..We sat on the same spot of the roof for the next 3 nights and every night between 10:25 pm and 10:35 pm we saw the same thing appear. it would just come out of nowhere then within 5 or 10 seconds it disappears. its not cell phone towers or spot lights or planes or helicopters, even planes that far away can be heard from the ground, we heard nothing when the light appears. the object also moves in different directions, but always fades away to the east.The 3rd night we saw this object we managed to get a picture but its so far away that you cant make out any detail. it looks like an orange/yellow ball of light when magnified. we have no idea what this object is but we have never seen anything like it. we are going to try to get video of it tonight. we have looked at some ufo websights and there was a video from kingsport tennessee that looks almost identical to what we

eye, to the right of the shuttle. i am not very good at estimating distances but i believe the object was in jacksonville airspace, not cape canaveral. it was high in the sky, about as high as planes normally fly. initially, i brushed it off as a plane but it didn't look right to me so i kept glancing back over it. it was insanely shiny, silver, chrome looking. from my vantage it seemed completely spherical. it seemed to just be floating and in the same direction as the shuttle and kinda fading and reappearing into view as the sun hit it. my overall impression of the object was that it was an insanely chrome-shiney ball floating at a slow speed. as soon as the shuttle was no longer visible, i looked back to the object. it had stopped moving in the sky and i observed it for a few more seconds before it suddenly shot straight up and disappeared at a very high rate of speed and i wished i had pulled out my cell phone camera (odds are i wouldnt have caught much though, it was really far away and my cell phone video camera isnt the best)\r\n\r\ni immediately called my mom and started to tell her about the object. she then mentioned she had seen the exact same thing but thought her eyes were playing tricks on her. she was facing in the opposite direction of the shuttle launch (she was not sure which way to look, so she missed it) so i believe we did not view the same object.\r\n\r\ni will admit i was a bit biased before this sighting as i do believe there is unexplained arial phenomena (that i tend to attribute to extraterrestrial forces), but at the same time i personally would like to remain completely impartial. i have been looking to the skys since childhood hoping to see a ufo and have even tried to talk myself into believing the rare blimp sighting or odd looking plane sighting was a ufo sighting, but i always erred on the side of objective reality. the entire time i viewed this object (an object that actually almost distracted me from watching my first shuttle launch ever) i was trying to talk myself out of the bizarre things i was witnessing. the only thing that convinced me this object was not an identifiable aircraft was its high speed vertical shoot into the sky.
