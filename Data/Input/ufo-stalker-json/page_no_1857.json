rectangular shape off to the left of of the mandalay bay towers. it grabbed my attention and i almost drove into the wall of the flyover. my first thought was that it was a balloon, but that didn't fit. instead of heading back to work, i took a right into the parking lots and tried to keep the ufo in sight. it was moving north along what seemed to be the general path of the i-15 corridor. when i first saw it, it was at least twice as large as the letters on the top of the mandalay bay casino from my perspective. the object was dark, but you could tell that the haze of the atmosphere that it was not near by. because of the haze, i would say it was a dark grey in color. the edges seemed defined. at one point it turned on edge and i thought i lost track of it. so it must have been thin when looking \"edge on\". nothing about it's various orientations during its flight told me that it could not have been a square shape. total time of view was about ten minutes and i figure that it traveled north along the i-15 corridor in that time so it must have been flying at over 100 mph. last glimpse of it was still heading north. it had to have flown right by the mccarran airport and nellis afb control centers. i cannot emphasize enough the square shape and the the relative thinness of the object. also, it flew with it's body at an angle that was not aerodynamic to its direction of movement except for that short time that i thought i lost sight of it. i finally lost sight of it trying to look down las vegas blvd as it appeared to be heading to the peaks of the mountains of the north las vegas valley, ironically and generally in the direction of area 51. i was the assistant state director for colorado mufon for eight years and consider myself to be a trained observer.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

able to witness and hear the ufo as it sped away. my daughter and her boyfriend had entered our neighborhood  which is densely populated with live oak trees around 1:00am and noticed there was a stationary object with 2 lights hovering about 25ft. above the treeline at their ten o'clock ne about 3 blocks away. her boyfriend noticed that the top part of the object seemed translucent and it seemed as though he could see through it and bottom part was more opaque and solid. they turned left on the next street towards our house and my daughter kept the object in sight the entire time. then they turned right onto the circle where we live. it is a keyhole circle surrounded by trees and we live at the end of it. they then parked the car and got out so they could get a better look. the craft at this time was about a block away and at their one o'clock se still hovering above the treeline. at this point i got a phone call from my daughter telling me to come out immediately as there was a ufo. i ran out of the house and could hear a whirring noise above my head. i looked up and could see an object speeding ahead of me with lights blinking than disappearing behind the sw tree line in the distance. my daughter's boyfriend looked up as the craft passed directly over his head. he said that after they parked the car and got out. the object moved to the eight o'clock position then made a right angle turn then passed directly over our house and over their heads speeding out of sight behind the trees. my daughter's boyfriend's description of the under belly of the craft was as follows; he said it was as big as a house and was about 50ft to 75ft from the ground. it was triangular with rounded corners, like a billiard ball rack. it had 2 round white lights, one at each end of the bottom of the triangle and 1 amber light at the top, was gunmetal in color and had an inverted rectangular tray shape inset within the triangle which had parallel lines. he also noticed the whirring noise as it passed over, but it didn't seem to be an engine noise but more like a wind noise passing over something. my husband also heard the whirring noise and felt the vibrations as it passed over the house. nobody heard the noise until it was moving directly overhead. my daughter was not able to get a picture because she was busy calling me and her boyfriends phone died just as he tried to take a picture. this is the second time they have seen a triangular craft in our neighborhood. the first time was around the same time about 6 months ago, a few blocks further away and higher up. it also sped away in a southwesterly direction.

aurora borealis lights (which brighten the sky during the night), red moon, red tides, midnight stars and a dozen other night lights in the sky, but this was very different.  it was shortly past midnight, when the living room's glass door seemed to have a spot light shining on it.  the light was so bright that it was shining off my ceiling and onto the kitchen cabinets (no small feat).  i noticed all three animals i own were acting very strange, our dog was hovering on the couch, growling very low like he was afraid to actually growl or bark as he would normally if anything was outside.  our cat huddled on the floor behind my husband's shoes, so just his nose and ears were above the rim of the sneakers.  he flattened his ears and was staring at the door that he is normally staring out or trying to sneak out (earlier i had let the dog out for his nightly routine and there was nothing strange about the night and our cat tried as usual to sneak out on me).  i called him several times before he literally jumped into the air and spun around to stare at me with huge eyes.  we also have a dwarf rabbit who was frantically clawing at the bottom of her cage, as if trying to bury herself.  the light seemed very steady and bright, so i walked over to look outside.  the night sky was lit up like it was daytime, except the clouds (there was broken cloud cover last night, but the moon was in its' waning crescent phase) had the shadows of the building near us and the trees around us, but there was absolutely no fog last night.  it was as if there was a giant beam of light in the southern sky that was being refracted off the ground and causing everything to shadow on the atmosphear in the northern sky.  i know this because i actually opened the doors and walked out onto the patio.  i was standing there looking around me wondering what in the world was going on, when i noticed that the entire night was void of any sounds, no animals or insects like would be normal for this time of year, no helicopters or planes landing, not even any cars going past...Nothing, but silence.  now, i'm normally not frightened by the night time.  in fact, i love the nights here in oregon, but this time i felt a choking sensation, became sick to my stomach and a little dizzy, it reminded me of being in line behind a car with very bad exhaust and being choked, sickened and dizzy, except there was absolutely no odor in the air.  so i returned to my seat on the couch.  after which, i noticed the television signal (we have directv) kept breaking up until i just turned it off, then i noticed that the vcr lights went brighter and dimmer.  the light outside went from normal white type light to a yellow haze, then to an orange color.  i watched the light for somewhere between 25 and 55 minutes (i'm not certain because although i recall looking at the vcr clock when it all began, i can't recall what time it was).  although i returned to the couch, i kept a steady eye on the light outside coming from nowhere.  i felt a strange tightness rising in my chest and my heart was beating heavily.  i grew up with fog, night lights that are organic and man made, but this was like nothing i've ever seen!  i can't seem to recall the exact time it began, although i do recall looking at the clock on our vcr, but the next time i looked it was 12:49 a.M., by 12:58 it was gone, just like that it disappeared leaving the normal night time darkness.  i am not one to loose my cool and get shook up over very much, because growing up in ak, i saw some very odd stuff, red moons, red tides, lights reflected off of heavy fog that looked doubley bright, but this was like nothing else i've ever seen and i'm no spring chicken either.  i've been chased by bears, even had a shark swim between my legs after a salmon one summer and never was as scared as i was last night.  and just in case there are those who may want to believe i was asleep and some how dreaming this, you can forget it because i didn't fall asleep until morning broke at 5:20 a.M. and i felt certain the thing was gone. i'm wondering if anyone else out there saw the night sky and the strange bright lights.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":29316,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.3318352,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05302011-0012","longitude":-122.8721049,"occurred":1306738800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oregon","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1306785136000,"summary":"Lit

300-350 ft. this object was simply hovering without any noise or movement. it was really shiny, the texture which could be best described like that of stainless steel surface (because of the factor as to how the sun light was bouncing off of it). it just hung there, when my wife also saw it. the object was a typical disc shaped, saucer like ufo. i could tell it was a disc-shaped object as it just on its side just for a bit revealing the shape. i witnessed it for nearly 20 seconds, with me and my wife sitting in my car at the round-about just staring at it when it simply just disintegrated into thin air, it just vanished right in front of our eyes. earlier i have always noticed certain huge round shaped shadows being casted ton the ground, just to look up and see nothing. also, other phenomenon like strange sky scars that cannot be formed by any airplane. it was very phenomenal for us to witness a ufo for the first time in our lives. unfortunately, since i was in my car with the
