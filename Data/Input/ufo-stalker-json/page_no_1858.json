and about a 1/2 mile apart.   i was able to determine that these stationary lights were either house lights or lights for the airplanes, as they were identical in size, remained stationary and constant.  2 small airplanes flew by as i talked to my husband.  then, between and above the 2 lights, a third orange light came on creating a triangle, with the 2 lights on the bottom.   my guess is

light or some other stationary light/marker, but then it started moving forward and slightly upwards about as fast as the 2 small planes i saw earlier.  then it hovered again for about 20 seconds, flashed brighter, then moved straight up quickly and blinked out.  the sky was clear and there were no clouds.  i waited a few more minutes, saw another plane and went inside.   the next morning i went out and looked at the same area where the lights appeared.  the 2 bottom orange lights most likely came from the higher points of near the top of the mountain.  the place that the 3rd light appeared would have been above  a crevice between the 2 points.  i checked my phone and i called my husband that night at 10:12 pm and the call was 5 minutes and 3 seconds.  i was on the phone about a

(they have cats, but the cats were shut into a spare bedroom on the 2nd floor of the house, so there was no opportunity for excitable interaction between the dogs on the first floor and the cats on the 2nd floor.)\r\n\r\nthe witness says it was perhaps 10 seconds after the dog started barking before she got out of bed.   her husband stayed in bed as the female witness looked out their 2nd storey bedroom window and saw a tiny, white. silent light (twice the brilliance of a firefly) moving along their front yard fenceline in the direction of their neighbor���������s home some 100 feet on along the road.  (witness thought the light was on the outside of the fence, but says she can���������t be totally sure it wasn���������t on the inside of the fence; she believes it definitely was not in the roadway.)  it should be noted that this is a dead-end road so traffic is minimal, and that the light was moving away from the dead-end, rather than toward it.\r\n\r\nwitness observed that this tiny white light always stayed level at about two (2) feet above the ground, and always moved at a steady unwavering horizontal pace, with no zigzagging  or side-to-side motion.  she also observed that the light switched on and off in a regular rhythm.  she was reminded of her husband���������s electric toothbrush light, which switches on and off in its charging rhythm.  witness indicates that the light seemed mechanical, and her estimate is that the on-off intervals were a bit longer than one second; she actually estimates 7-8 per 10 seconds.  this figures out to 17 to 20 times during the 25 seconds she believes she had the light in sight.  (it should be noted that no fireflies have yet been seen in that area, nor would be expected this early in the season in the state of iowa.)\r\n\r\nwitness was surprised to observe no illumination from this light.   (it should be noted that there are no security yard lights in this area, and witness indicates total darkness.)  she was also surprised that only one (1) dog excitedly barked, since the usual pattern is for all three (3) dogs to chime in when one of them gets excited.  witness also notes that the dog which barked is the ���������smarter��������� of their three dogs.  \r\n\r\ndistance from the witness��������� vantage point to about mid-way along the front yard fenceline where she first saw the light moving, is approximately 40 feet. witness observed movement of this light for a land distance of some 40 feet, that is, from mid-yard fenceline to just past the driveway gate area where she lost sight of this tiny white light as it made its way on toward the neighbor���������s house, and was obscured by vegetation.\r\n\r\nas stated above, she estimates that the light was moving so slowly that she had it in sight for about 25 seconds, in other words that it moved a bit over 1 ��������� feet per second, which figures out to a bit over one (1) mile per hour.\r\n\r\nher husband indicates that if his wife had thought to tell him right away that the light did not illuminate, he would have probably gotten out of bed to look out the window, also.\r\n\r\nwitness says she was looking out at total darkness.  since the moon was only 5 degrees altitude at 107 degrees azimuth, the moon apparently shed no appreciable light on the area of this sighting.\r\n\r\nwitness checked the time as 1:30 a.M. just before she went to the window and saw the light, but says she did not check the time when the incident was over.\r\n\r\nwitness has excellent distance vision, and so wears no glasses except for reading purposes.  \r\n\r\ninvestigator trout called the local police department and was told they had received no other reports in the area.\r\n\r\n[[[investigator���������s note:  it should be noted that this family moved to iowa from another state in the fall of 2010, and that investigator trout has known this family and has had a sense of their credibility for some ten years.  it should also be noted that family members have a history of abduction, that is, two adult children, as well as at least one of the parents.  they have no wish to have their identity known.  some years ago, one of the parents underwent a rather traumatic hypnosis session with a well-known hypnotherapist, (who frequently speaks in public), and has never had a wish to pursue any further probing into the abduction experiences.  whether the current report indicates any connection with the family abduction history, of course, is not known; it simply deserves to be mentioned here.

towards the top step smoking. it was a clear night and on clear nights i often try to find the constelations orion and the big dipper .I was facing north and to my right i thought i saw orion (east), but somthing seemed off about it.I hadnt had the chance to look at the night sky for a while (due to overcast skys or not being out after dark)\r\nusually it seems like orion is usually upright or close to it but it was\r\non it's side this night.I thought this is maybe just how it appears in the sky at this time of year so i looked around at the other stars to see if orion was somwhere else in the sky and i was mistaken at what i first thought was orion.As i looked back and forth something about the \"sideways orion\" in the east caugth my eye i percieved movment but could not locate it at first. then i began to focuse and was looking at what would be the 3 stars that make up the belt of orion. remember it was on it's side from my point of view. like if you saw it perfectly upright and someone turned it 90 degrees to the left.So the bottom star of the belt is farthest to the left from my viewpoint.The movement was slow and incredibly fluid all three stars of the belt where moving at the exact same speed but with slightly different trajectory's. the lowest star was moving almost in a perfcet horizontal way from right to left.The other two stars where moving both down and right to left on a course that would intercept the position that the first star(lowest)was moving. then the first(lowest) star just vanished as if it was just turned off .Then the next highest star reached the position where the first star dissappered and it also \"just turned off\" .Then the third star did the exact same.\r\ni was stunned and scared i could not understand what i had just seen and i wished so bad that someone had witnessed it.I felt immediatly the need to tell someone.But knew how crazy it would sound. it was as if everything i knew was turned on it's head. i have always thougt it would be great to see something like that so you would have an answer to whether or not ufo stories where real.Despite all the stories and videos i thought that seeing would be believing, but it did not feel great it was terrifying.Also it didnt answer any questions for me but raised more.\r\nthis part may sound strange but about 20 minutes after. the whole time i was freaked out and kept asking myself what the hell did i just see? then an incredibly euphoric feeling came over me, a palpible energy and excitment that i still can not explain it was the exact opposite of what i was feeling minutes earlier. a few days later as i was thinking about it i knew what i saw,but thought well that wasnt orion ,but was it somthing mimicking orion? on christmas eve i told my duaghter and future son in law. at a family get toghether on new years eve i took my daughter and her fiance outside to show them where in the sky i saw it.As i was showing them i was startled to realize that it actaully was orion.I am not an astronomer but i 99.9 percent positve it was the orion constellation i was watching that night of the incident. i was not drinking nor do i use drugs, and as far as i know i am not crazy.This was not a comet or meteor the speed was way to slow , also i live underneath the flightpath of an international airpot and just 5 miles from an appache reserve airbase, and next to that is a small craft airport.I know what these aircraft look like in the night sky, and they do not explain what i saw.\r\n\r\np.S. since then i have had one other experience earily similar, yet different this time with a witness for half the event. i will make a reoprt when i have time as it may be connected to what i saw.
