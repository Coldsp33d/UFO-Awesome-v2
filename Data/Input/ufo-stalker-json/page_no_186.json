mountain time, from a distance of approximately 2 miles on a clear night, i observed with my naked eye a star-like stationary light appear at approximately 10,000 ft in the mountain range just north of pikes peak. i estimate this height knowing that pikes peak is slightly over 14,000 ft high. the light lasted approximately 5 seconds and simply disappeared.  as i kept watching it appeared again in the exact same spot about 1 minute later for the same duration.  i grabbed my binoculars and fixed on that spot.  about 30 seconds later it appeared again in my binocular view in the same spot but was followed about 2 seconds later by a dimmer star-like light appearing at it's 8 o'clock position (from my line of sight) and i estimate the distance between the 2 lights to be approximately 100 yards. this dimmer light disappeared after two seconds and the first light disappeared after 3 more seconds.  the lights did not reappear.  being a member of comufon, i checked comufon active flight tracker and saw no air traffic in the area.  i know first hand from living here there are no roads in the mountains in that area at that height so i can confidently state it was not vehicle traffic, also it wouldn't have been that bright from that distance, nor was it moving. it also was at least thousands of feet above any houses below on the mountain hillside.  the 1st light was bigger and brighter than the planet venus at it's best brightness.  i am reporting this because living here and being familiar with the air traffic around the mountain day & night, what i saw did not make sense.  i took an existing daytime picture of pikes peak and marked it with the location of the lights.  it is attached to this report.","distance":"Over One

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This was on a sunday night. my father was sitting outside on our back patio and my mom and i were in the dining room attached to our kitchen. our dining room has a window which faces northward, with the dining room on one side (south) and the outdoor patio on the other (north). the window was open and at about 9:48 pm edt my father shouted something through that open window that i couldn't understand. my mom said, \"he's demanding i come outside!\" and he kept yelling at my mom to come outside \"right now\" to see something. i got up, completely expecting to go outside and have him tell me that one of the neighborhood skunks is in our yard (there is precedent for this). instead, my father told me where to look in the sky and, as i later found out in a photo i took, he also pointed to the sky to the northwest of our home. there, i saw a large, very vibrant bright object that appeared to me to be round in shape, so bright it seemed to glow, and it was quite large compared to the size of an airplane that might pass overhead to the north or northwest, even a plane in a fairly low flight pattern. it was moving quite rapidly eastward, and initially, its path was parallel to the earth (or so it seemed to me). for a moment it disappeared as it passed behind a tall maple tree that blocks a small portion of the view to the northwest of our home. when the object again became visible, it remained parallel to the earth/horizon for (i'm guessing) about ten seconds; then, it seemed either to get smaller or to increase its distance from my location; it absolutely seemed to gain altitude at this point, from about 35 degrees above the horizon to 45 degrees above the horizon.\r\n\r\nthen, the object stopped moving, and after remaining in place for seconds, it totally ceased its prior, straight path and started to move in many different ways: up, down, sometimes going backward, at other times moving forward, accelerating, decelerating, hovering, and moving in quick, turning paths as it would move up or down. to my eyes, it remained a glowing, vivid reddish orange the entire time. the light varied in intensity with no seeming relation to its movements, except that it appeared brighter when it was lower to the horizon. at one point, the object, while stopped and seeming to hover at a total standstill, appeared to split into two of itself; it looked as if the original object either ejected another object identical to itself or simply went from being one object to being two objects. the second object appeared below the first/original object, meaning slightly closer to the horizon; when it appeared, it seemed to come out of a glowing, flame-like emission the same color as the original object itself. the second object was identical in appearance to the first, but was slightly smaller. it only remained visible for a small fraction of a second before vanishing without any hint of movement.\r\n\r\nthe original object continued to be visible for a bit longer, continuing its quite varied path of movement and non-movement. shortly before it was no longer visible, the object was hovering, stationary, then suddenly seemed to grow a bit larger in appearance (perhaps it was closer, i do not know) and at incredible speed shot to the right (moving eastward) and then shot upward (seemingly in terms of altitude) in a steep diagonal path (east-to-west at a very steep angle, not moving in a perfectly straight line), before again shooting to the right (eastward). every movement was made in a beautiful, agile manner and even at the time the moves it was making reminded me of watching fighter jets and jet teams during air shows as their pilots push the boundaries of what their own crafts are capable of doing, moments that may sometimes be equally as thrilling for the pilots as they are for any observers. \r\n\r\nthe object was stationary to the north when it became invisible to me. low clouds (which i only now realized were moving from the southeast toward the northwest) first intermittently obscured the object, then at last totally obscured it. it did not become visible again and shortly after (within two minutes), lighting was flashing heavily around us and we went indoors. the object was, to me, completely silent.\r\n\r\nwhat i felt initially, immediately after i first saw the object was a very calm, content, warm feeling of safety and security throughout my body and mind. this was briefly mixed with an unpleasant feeling that -- well, you know when two magnets repel each other -- that's the only way i can describe the prickly feeling that felt as if it physically needled at the side of me where my father stood or sat; his reaction was one of nervousness and fear. that negative feeling was brief, and as soon as i stepped a few feet further away from him it ceased, and with the calming effect of whatever was going on, i calmly called to my mom through the open window (not knowing she was already on her way outside) something to the effect of, \"mom, it's a ufo thing! it's really neat!\" \r\n\r\nmy mom came outside and with her, in addition to the constant content, safe feeling, i also felt what was the complete opposite of the prior sensation of magnetic repulsion; i instead felt a sort of magnetic attraction toward her and a magnetic awareness of her location in the dark yard. she and i walked farther away from the house into our backyard where we stood side by side, both of us with our iphones held up to the sky at about a 45-degree angle to focus on this object, while my father remained behind on the patio. i could not visually see my mom in the yard -- i am nearly totally blind at night, with only minimal light-perception (this object was so bright that it obviously fell into the category of \"light i can perceive\") -- yet with this magnetic instinctive feeling i knew exactly where my mom was moving at every moment. she took photos, and while i took a few photos initially, i primarily i kept my phone focused on the object recording it on video. for me, i heard nothing from the object, nothing either physical nor internally, no buzzing, no engine noise, nothing at all. but even without hearing any sound, i \"knew\" it was moving under its own power and never doubted (and still don't) that someone (i felt that most likely there were actually 1, 2 or 3 \"someones\") was present inside of the object and in charge of the movements of the object. i felt an impression of relative inexperience yet full competence, youth in terms of mentality and not physicality, and also an impression of excitement entwined with wisdom, as if whoever was up there was both learning how to \"pilot\" the object and having a wonderful time while doing so. it felt as if whoever was there was aware of my presence, and whether it was for my/our benefit, the benefit of others, or for their own enjoyment, it felt to me as if they were showing off a little, and were rather pleased with and proud of themselves. \r\n\r\nthe experience resulted in a fairly inexplicable feeling that is most similar to emotions i once experienced, but which have since been fairly rare since childhood. it is a feeling of how the simplest of things can make you smile or make you happy, of knowing that everything is right with the world and that you are safe. watching this object, i felt very content and, for lack of a better word, whole. the strongest of that feeling lasted about 24 hours. \r\n\r\ni had the distinct and certain \"feeling\" the next evening, monday evening, that someone who was somehow related to the object with which this report deals was going to be or was already present in the sky again that evening or night (if they'd ever actually \"left\"). i went outside to take photographs, hoping to perhaps capture something unusual and also wanting to get photos of the gorgeous cloud formations which accompanied some light rain and thunderstorms nearby around sunset. i took photos for i'd say around 30-45 minutes during which the clouds were moving quickly, the light and cloud-shapes doing amazing things (just clouds being clouds), but i knew that yet also felt that someone (\"someones\") related to that object was there and was watching and aware of my presence. that feeling, along with the persistent, almost overwhelming feeling of contentment and security lasted until about 8:55 p.M. as i was photographing clouds to the west, there was an abrupt obscuring of one cloud layer by another and at that instant, too, the feeling of contentment was greatly diminished and the feeling of someone else being \"there\" was gone entirely. \r\n\r\ni still did feel this on tuesday, but perhaps at 30% of the strength as i'd experienced the night i saw this object. there is still a lingering sense of it, as well, which seems to slightly blunt the depth of my negative emotions and reactions. it is, more than anything, an unexplainable feeling of security and peace.

hovering appox.50- 100ft in the air to my nw left as it caught my eye and you couldn't miss it.  i stood still without saying a word, then heard another person in the parking lot stating they see it too, but i didn't bother with them, nor they with me...And i felt paralyzed watching this craft i have never, ever seen before in my life!  it looked like a two story type disc with what appeared at the time to be dark windows in the middle of it...I did not see any beings or other...But the most peculiar thing was how quiet this craft was. it was a peaceful, uneventful early evening that i can recall (right before dark, no rain, typical summer eve!) in june of 1977, or possibly aug 1977..It happened the same year i went to germany for the first time which was in the fall of 1977. it's been sooo many years, but i remember it like yesterday!  the second amazing thing was how it hovered..It didn't tilt, sway, or anything..It was so still!!  then i noticed the rotating, colored lights underneath the aircraft going i believe clockwise. the craft was disc round, and a darkish gray but i'm not sure if it was 'metallic' this seemed to last approx. 5-10 min. just watching, listening for something, trying to figure out what i was seeing...I was not scared but completely in awe of what i was witnessing.  i kept watching and never took my eyes away, and then it started to ascend very slowly and deliberately around 3-4 minutes into the sighting, and took off in a straight path to my south west.  i watched until i could see no more..Back then i knew i didn't have a camera with me (there were no throw away type cameras or cells in this timeframe that i could afford)or i probably would have snapped a picture.  when it was gone, i looked over at the parking lot and the person was gone...I don't remember when or how they left.  i just remembered they were just as in awe as i was..We were like paralyzed watching it.  i'm not sure but believe it was a male person that saw it too.  i remember telling my parents and my husband at the time.  those were the only people i revealed my sighting to. i then thought to call our local airport that is in the city, which i did, and reported the sighting.  they told me on the phone that it was \"probably some kind of advertising plane\"...I've looked up all kinds of planes, and the only thing that has resembled what i saw i have never, ever seen since and i've seen a lot of aircraft over my 61 years of age!  it was very recently i was reading a story about kelly cahill's 1993 abduction, and she described the aircraft of what seems to be what i saw!!  out of all the stories i've read along the years, that one comes closest.  why i have waited so long to tell my story?  i'm not sure how to answer. i think i didn't want all the attention it might bring. i wanted to tell the story to others, but kept silent because i didn't want attention or thinking they might think i'm high on something or crazy.  i just kind of went on with my life, but through the decades i always remember it. i do not like to be the center of attention...You can ask any of my family!  i am just an unassuming sort of person i believe.   but after i read that article, and have seen so many stories similar to mine, i thought i must tell it to help with your investigations and truth.  over the years, i've thought to myself, well, i guess if there were aliens in the craft, they didn't want to choose me for anything, so i've kind of left it at that (lol:).  but with all of the stories, research, and happenings in our world today, i feel an overwhelming responsibility to report what i saw that day. i have told my three sons also.  i may have brought it up over the years to a few people, but don't remember or recall.  i just hope this sighting may help in some small way.  i would like to know if there are others in my hometown who saw it that year or that summer?  thank you for allowing me to share my story.  i will undergo a polygraph test or other such as regressed hypnosis...I am now retired and have nothing to lose telling my story after all these years!!! i don't feel that i've been affected negatively by what i saw..But have felt the need to tell those who are the the professionals and have studied ufo's.  i am a christian and i believe i saw what i saw and it is the thruth!.  thank you.

say, seemed to follow me when i walked. we walked through the alley back to my apt. it seemed to follow and then go over my building to the front. i ran in dropped off my dog and grabbed my roommate

sibgle tree in the field and about 20 to 30 feet to our left was the woods and tree lines. we were just being teenagers making out and my gf said what in the hell is that.We both looked and right above the treeline maybe 10ft above there were 3 box shaped items about the size of a full size suv or a little bigger. both height and width seems to be the same. multi color lights were on them ranging from green,blue,white,reddish orange and all 3 box shaped things were making a slow strange circle.It would do maybe a 1/4 revolution and stop for 2-3 seconds and do another one.We both watched this with amazement.I got out of the truck and walked a little closer to the tree line because i thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. their was no motor noise whatsoever coming from this thing.After watching this for around 15-20 mins it slowly just continued to go over the tree tops further in the woods until we couldn't see it anymore. i've never really spoken to much about it but i'm positive it wasn't a helicopter or a weather balloon or a plane.I still don't know what it is but i don't think in 1985 we had the technology to possess something like this so i'm 100% sure this was a ufo and something i can't explain. after seeing that i became a true believer in ufo and that we are not alone in this universe.I hope the truth comes out in my lifetime. i'm 52 years old now and was 18 or 19 when i saw this object and i was very close to it. no more than 20-30 feet and my eyesight was 20/20 then.I watch your shows on t.V and i'm very interested in learning more about ufo's and help people who may have seen them also. the government has kept this covered up for to long and i hope the truth comes out one day while i'm alive. i think the public deserves to know the truth and i became a believer in 1985.\r\n thanks for giving me the opportunity to tell you my story and would gladly answer any questions you might have.\r\nbest regards \r\ndavid","distance":"20

(~6000 ft elevation).   i took a picture and when i looked in the picture there was an object in the sky.\r\n\r\ni thought maybe something was on the camera lens but i did take a pic at 130 and 132 - one before and one minute after and there was nothing on either of those pics.  the picture time and date stamps are on the pics (iphone 6).\r\n\r\ni did not see the object when i was taking the pic, only after i looked at the pic when we left.\r\n\r\nthe object looks a bit blurry in the pic, so not sure if it was travelling too fast to see with the naked eye but was captured with the camera.  i'm not sure how fast the iphone 6s camera shoots.\r\n\r\nmaybe it's bug that flew in front of the cam????? not sure.\r\n\r\ni attached the photo and if requested can forward the photos prior to and after the one with the object.\r\n\r\nthanks.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":85260,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":48.4125373,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07222017-0001","longitude":-114.3257352,"occurred":1499952660000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Montana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1500690501000,"summary":"Took
