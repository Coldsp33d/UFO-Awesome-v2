james' house all the time, it's like our clubhouse. can adults have a clubhouse? nobody actually ever calls james' house a clubhouse though. kids have clubhouses, so this would be like an adult clubhouse. there aren't any membership dues or anything like that, it isn't a real club, but it is a real house. i know, i've been in it and touched it and stuff. so we're in james' house, and i heard this weird whirring noise, but i ignored it because we were in a really heated discussion about what board game to play. i like clue, but nobody else really likes it. i like to think that if they would just take the game seriously, it would be fun and full of mystery and intrigue, but we usually just end up wanting to watch the movie clue. it's alright, not great. it has that guy from home alone, i think he worked in the hotel? i guess he was the villain, it's been awhile since i've seen home alone though, i don't remember. so while we're arguing, i heard the whirring noise, but it was even louder, but my ears had been acting up ever since i went to that party where loud bands play in the basement. my friend devan was playing, so i got up real close to hear, but i ended up standing next to an amp, and my ears have been ringing ever since. so we decide to play the game tribond, which was a lot of fun. they read off three clues, and you have to figure out what connects them. so if your three clues were like, \"baseball, the stock market, and former boston celtics superstar larry bird,\" then you would obviously answer, \"things white people like\". so you know, we're playing, having a good time and telling jokes, when this bright light shines down into the backyard of the house. but then we noticed that it was just the house's floodlights, and they were just triggered by an animal, probably a squirrel or something. maybe a deer. i don't know, it was dark. but i was really into the game, and i was close to winning. oh man, we had this joke that was so funny about governor chris christie, but i don't want to write it on the internet, or our friend muhammad might see it and ruin the joke. muhammad's a nice guy, but he repeats jokes until they aren't funny anymore. he's a joke killer. like if there was a prison for metaphors, muhammad would be serving 35 consecutive life sentences for his serial joke killing. so after a while, james wins the game, which was a bummer because i had just gotten a question right where the answer was, \"soundtracks that feature songs by kenny loggins,\" so naturally i was pumped. but james came ahead to win it in the end, and it was tense. then we all had some snacks. i think i had chips and root beer, but it might have been teddy grahams and water. teddy grahams are good, but some flavors are just bland, you know? it's weird how so many people like crappy food. my grandpa likes anchovies on his pizza, how crazy is that? but all joking aside, it was a good time. as we all thanked james and got in our cars to leave, we all saw a chevron shaped object in the sky. on the ride home i listened to \"subterranean homesick blues\" by bob dylan. that's a good song.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":29246,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.3386111,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05252011-0012","longitude":-74.2686111,"occurred":1306134000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

looked up at the stars & admire how beautiful the sky looked as i do every night. the sky was clear with no sign of clouds. i was outside for about 3 or 4 minutes & i started to notice something moving at a slow pace past the stars. as i continued to look at this object i saw that it was speeding up & then it slowed down & stopped completely. after that it made a complete circle then saw a bright white flash come from the object then it started to head south & vanished. i went running into my house to alert my husband as to what i saw. after yelling his name through the house he finally came downstairs & i proceeded to tell him what happened. we both went outside to look in the sky to see if it was still there. after about 1 minute my husband saw an object & pointed it out to me. we both saw it moving at a very fast pace then it stopped. it started to move back & forth & then another one appeared. both of them were circling around then the one on the left disappeared & the one on the right flashed a bright white light and was gone. we looked at each other in complete shock. we knew this could not be an airplane, helicopter, flare or weather balloon. these objects moved in ways that i have never seen before. i said to my husband, oh my god, those are ufos. we both became so excited & i started jumping up & down like a child. we kept looking in the sky for about 2-4 minutes & saw 2 more objects that were either the same objects from before or different ones. they were both just gliding slowly in the same direction. the one on the left stopped, made a quick left & was gone. the one to the right stayed in the sky for about 30 -45 seconds & was traveling east. the object stopped, flashed 2 times with a bright white light & disappeared. my husband & i are both believers & know what we saw last night. to us it doesn't matter what other people think. if people choose not to believe thats their problem not ours. i will remember that moment for the rest of my life. i believe this is just the beginning of what we will be seeing in the future. peace & love to all. \r\n","distance":"Over One

kind of craft coming from the south moving very slow and lower than most crafts would fly, barely topping the tree line. it was moving very slow and the sound seemed to be too loud. it was smaller than a small plane with swept back wings making it look more like a triangle but with prominent tail and nose. it looked metallic silver with patterns like joined plates together, it was that low. the nose is what was so different, it had a projection with a fairly wide cross piece making it look similar to a cross.The way it was moving i figured it was some sort of new plane that was using the nose to make pictures or record some type of information. my husband says maybe it was some sort of drone or some sort of new info gathering device.I watched it for about 3 minutes till it was out of sight. it just seem that the sound and the slowness was not normal for any plane or ultralight. i don't know what i saw but it was unusual for anything around here especially in the

to me. she said to look closely at the picture because there was an orange circle in the picture next to the light post. i zoomed in and i yelled out, \" ufo you guys look!!!\" lol funny thing was that when we were all outside taking pictures, nobody saw it because we were goofing off. but the reason why i reacted like that was because that night the sky was full of grey clouds. there wasnt any airplanes or anything on there. i happen to have the app ufo report tracker and i searched may 22nd,2011 to see if anybody else saw it and yes people did catch it. check out the picture. theres an

bakery. it was a beautiful clear sunny day with wispy clouds in the sky. i was sitting in the drivers seat (rh drive) and i opened up the sun roof to take in the day. i looked up an saw a thin black object shaped like a boomerang moving in a straight line from north to south. it was so high in the sky the distance was really hard to judge. at first glance i thought it was a bird, then i kept watching it and realised it was way too high and moving to fast to be a bird, i also thought it may be a jet or a plane but quickly eliminated these options as there was no sound or jet streams coming from the object. if i wasn't looking i would never have noticed the object.\r\n\r\ni watched for about 20 seconds then called out to my wife to come outside and take a look at what i was seeing. i pointed out the object to her and she said 'what is that?' and i replied 'what do you see?' and she confirmed seeing a black boomerang shaped object also. we continued to watch it for another 20-30 seconds, as it moved further south i noticed that it jumped from left to right and back again a few times before disappearing. i was excited to see a ufo so clearly during daylight, but my wife was worried and visibly shaken after the event.\r\n\r\nthis is the second time i have viewed a ufo the first was in 1995 the object was triangle shaped and the sighting was at night. i was driving in a remote part of australia, and the object was flying low overhead and seemed to be keeping pace with my vehicle.\r\n\r\nthis is the third time my wife has viewed a ufo. the first was in 2006, at night, the object was shaped like a teardrop or upside-down ballon, and it moved upwards into the sky.\r\nthe second was in 2009, also at night, and it was two solid white lights that started at tree level

my eye. i was thinking a jet mustve moved tilted its wing causing a flash against the sun. when i looked at the object it was verry hard too make out because of the distance i was observing, but the first impression i got was ( wait a minute ) i dont see wings. but i passed that thought off thinking i wasnt getting a good view because of the distance involved. i can only guess at the distance but i would estimate the distance at about 4 too 5 miles away at a height of about 20,000 feet.It really stood out in contrast because it was above the thunderstorms which was over 100 miles away, so consequently they wasnt high in the air from my perspective. also i was observing the object from the 7nth floor of a hospital. the disc stood out against the blue sky and the thunderstorm beneath it. so as i continued watching it kept a straight line moving from the southwest too the northeast. as i continued watching i still noticed no wings or tail section, also the most important thing that caught my eye was the fact the object left no cantrel behind it. sorry for my bad typing. the object continued northeast on a level flight straight. the duration was short but i can say for a certainty a. their was no wings or tailsection. 2. was on no normal flight plan that i have ever seen, even for wichita. 3. was circular and left no cantrel. i have lived in wichita for approxamately 4 years now and have observed the flight patterns for the air force base and civilian as well, and have never seen any planes or anything else fly in that space and especially at that altitude. almost forgot the last part too. the duration i observed was limited to just over a minute is all, unfortunatelly because the hospital tower  blocked my view so i lost sight of it behind the tallest part of the hospital. btw i just got my new glasses on 1 week ago and my sight is better than 20/20 so that part was good. i am prior navy  am am officially considered a expert lookout by the u.S.N. the object was almost impossible too make out at first but as it kind of came my way it became clearer and clearer till i could clearlly see it had no wings and no cantrel behind it. wish thier was more too report, it was short but interesting. my first feeling was a plane was getting tossed about by the storm, but that quicklly changed as it got nearer and nearer. i suppose that after i realized what it was i was looking at i got curious but at the same time creeped out by it.

algunos a���os 4 muchachos escalando un cerro, encontraron una cueva en una sierra a 30 km, al norte de caborca, en sonora, mex. se introdujeron el ella y a unos metros de haber entrado, notaron que la cueva era demasiado redonda, para ser una cueva normal, al avanzar un poco, vieron algo que los asusto demasiado, y salieron corriendo, huyendo de la cueva, era un animal, demasiado raro dijeron, regresaron a la ciudad,sin contar nada a nadie, hasta pasado el tiempo  segui insistiendo que me relataran el suceso, pero ya casi no lo recordaban, pero en abril de 2011 los convenci que se dejaran hipnotizar, empezaron a recordar todo con cada detalle, los regrese en el tiempo y la descripcion que obtuve de lo que vieron , fue la siguiente: dos de los muchachos iban m���s adelante que el resto, llevaban fuego tipo antorcha para ver en la obscuridad, cuando de repente, a unos pasos de ellos, y a un lado de un hoyo profundo de paredes muy lisas, estaba un ser parado  frente a ellos, no tenia  pelaje en su cuerpo ni en su cabeza, la cual era demasiada grande y como huevo ( ovalada ), no tenia orejas, pero tenia dos ojos grandisimos que les estaba mirando fijamente, apenas en cuanto movio la cabeza, para observarlos, no tenia colmillos o dientes a la vista, los brazos eran m���s bien delgados, pero los dedos eran extremadamente largos y muy raros, todo su cuerpo era de color aluminio( gris ), quedaron paralizados unos segundos, para despues salir huyendo los 4 muchachos y nunca querer regresar. a partir de esa fecha casi todos los dias m���s o menos de las 7:30  a las 9.00 de la noche he  estado observando la sierra desde el techo de mi casa o bien desde la pista donde voy a hacer mi caminata, y he observado en 4 ocaciones, una serie de luces color naranja que suben la sierra en 3 o 4 segundos, al  llegar arriba, toman una formacion como triangulo y luego desaparecen, pero hoy al estar observando, salieron dos luces naranja, y rodearon a algo como un circulo de luces azules y color naranja,que parpadeaban, despues hicieron una formacion y desaparecieron. estoy planeando hacer una incursion a la sierra con los muchachos a finales de junio, llevar camara, video y no se que m���s, aunque tengo miedo, ya que hoy al ver las luces, sentio una serie de escalofrios en todo el cuerpo.","distance":"Over One

mountains. i don't take many scenic pictures, however after looking out the window to the west, i decided to get the camera. the photo included with this report is a panoramic frame using three separate photos taken moments apart. in my mind that rules out a defect/debris on the lens (otherwise it would appear three times). my camera is a fujifilm finepix s1000 fd. it was mounted on a tripod at 12x optical zoom, and 3mb resolution. this photo was uploaded to facebook, and several of my family and friends \"liked\" it, or commented. sunday evening i was taking a second look at the picture when it became apparent that the screen on my computer was in need of a cleaning. that is when i detected the black spot on the right side of the frame. i could not identify the object in the picture. after magnifying the object on my screen it became clear to me that i was looking at something with a defined shape, but nothing familiar to me. we do see some air traffic here in the colorado springs area, and i was an aviation ordinance man in the marine corps. so, i'm good at aircraft identification. this object does not appear to me to be a bird, or aircraft, so i have decided to  report it as \"unidentified\", and \"flying\"...\r\n\r\ni will upload two photos of the object.\r\nfirst will be the original panorama photo, and second will be a cropped and magnified image of the object. in the original it will appear on the far right 1/3 of the frame as a black spot in the cloud. \r\n\r\nnote: at no time did i detect this with my naked eye, and did not discover it in the the photo until a day later.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":29219,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.9330494,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05232011-0007","longitude":-104.6085826,"occurred":1305961200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Bullet,

i rounded the corner of the building i looked up an noticed how bright the moon was and noted the one small cloud that was near it. i started to look away when three \"stars\" caught my eye. they seemed to appear below the cloud. i thought to my self that it was neat they formed a triangle..At that exact moment, they all started moving together. they seemed to be drifting...I watched as they all lowered slightly and silently,and drifted towards me and that's when i realized i was looking at one object with lights on it..It was not an airplane. it seemed to drift for a few seconds then pick up speed and flew off to my left (east i think). i was trying to keep my eyes on it and grab my iphone but gave up cause my iphone cant take pics in the dark. i think i stood there for a full min just stunned. i didnt mention it to anyone. i am waiting to see if i am the only one that saw it. this took place at exactly
