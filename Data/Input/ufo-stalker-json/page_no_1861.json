[i took careful note on my drive home- i couldn���t even see any airplanes against the heavy cloud coverage.] after about 2 minutes of observation, the orange object began to get smaller and smaller

our dirt bikes out for one last run when my friend pulled over to the side of the trail and waved back at me to get me to stop. when i took off my helmet and asked what was wrong she told me her engine had kicked out, which is really weird because her bike is less than a year old. as she tried to kick start her bike i saw her frown and point to the sky ahead of us (eastern sky) and didn't say a word. we both saw the same thing. nine or ten lights were glowing bright yellow, connected in a triangular pattern. at first i thought maybe it was a cell phone tower or maybe lights from town, but we were facing away from the nearest town and towards the desert and the longer we watched it, we saw that it was rotating in a slow circle as it moved across the horizon. the distance was hard to judge and i almost thought we were seeing a smaller object nearer to us but one of the tips disappeared beyond the mountain as it spiraled past it; giving me the impression of it being massive in size. once i got a scope of its sheer size, i sat on my bike with my mouth open and staring in shock, thinking about trying to get closer for a better sight. by the time i worked out that it didn't resemble any aircraft i've ever seen, the lights intensified and the whole shape vanished behind the mountaintop. i started to speak and was interrupted by what sounded like the belated boom from a jet after it passes you and i can only assume the two were related. i don't know if i say aliens or experimental military craft or what, but i know i saw something. also, my friends bike is still

they appear in multiples, their lights are usually out of the correct arrangement and are flashing erradically, they usually don't project any sound, and they can do extraordinary things. if you go onto websites such as helloflight.Com, you can check some of the commercial airflights in the area. i try to do this before i go out so i can try to have somewhat of an idea of how many planes are in my area. usually, there are less than a handful at any given time. when the investigators came over to investigate, i stood there and counted a dozen of these fakers in the sky along with a cigar-shaped bright glowing one stationed above the horizon in the distance. the investigators dismissed these craft as merely airplanes, which disappointed me. and they kept ignoring me completely when i tried to point things out to them! we don't live near any major airports. the nearest airport was a private one & during the time of the investigation (which i think was in november or december), there isn't half as much activity because there is no need for farmers to be flying their crop dusters. i'll be honest, i felt mocked the entire time the investigators came out for the field investigation. all other times were fine - such as the interview and the phone calls, they were really nice. so it really came as a shock to me. the two other witnesses were offended by the behavior as well. especially when one of them ripped the binoculars out of my mom's hand when she tried to point out something strange in the sky.\r\n\r\ni don't know if they were intentionally behaving this way or what the deal was, but that's why i haven't reported since.\r\n\r\ni was told that there was going to be video equipment set up, including nightvision, et cetera. all they brought was a flashlight, binoculars, and a star tracking device that they just couldn't 'figure out'.\r\n\r\nwhat i've noticed, in abundance lately, are the amber/fireball-like orbs. they like to appear in the same areas nightly, for whatever reason, and if you get close enough to them, you can watch them transform from a stationary red-orange orb and change into either a fake airplane or some other strange aircraft. once they notice that you notice, they will follow you. i believe that these orbs are doing something to the planet & i would like to believe that it is for the benifit of the planet. in all my adventures, i have received no harm from whatever occupies these crafts.\r\n\r\nstrange markings have showed up on my spine since january. they look like the typical scoop marks that you see in other cases. one of them is still very red, though it's been there for months now. it looks like some sort of punch biopsy, to be honest. i have pictures. i will send them upon request. i also have lots and lots and lots of video footage, and have created a channel on youtube to share what i've seen. that, too, will be available upon request. additionally, i've also had strange languages spoken to me in my dreams. a particular phrase in general. it's been burned into my brain. i don't know what language it is, and i don't know what it means. but the moment i heard it, i was awakened, and i knew i had to record it. this recording is also on my youtube channel. the language sounds ancient or native. some have said that they thought it was either hopi or mayan. which makes it even stranger. the phrase sounds like this: oot sah uwah, uwah a ki. short, but very specific-sounding. i think it's important.\r\n\r\nmemories from my childhood (and my sister's as well) have been surfacing & i don't know when i even realize that it's a memory because it's very foggy and very confusing (almost like a dream). i believe i was abducted at the age of 12 (along with my little sister and about a dozen other people) while out at summit lake. we were all getting ready for bed in our tents when someone told us to come outside and look at these strange lights hovering over the lake. they were the same cigar-shaped objects that appeared when the investigators were out here for a field session. but there were 6 or 7 of them. i remember them approaching us and i remember a flash of bright white light as we all stood there in awe. and that's where it ends. i don't recall ever going to bed that night. when i 'woke up' in the morning i felt very groggy. almost as if i had a hangover (but i was 12 and hadn't had a drink in my life at that point). i remember wondering what happened to the strange lights in the sky the night before and i remember wondering why no one else was bringing it up. i didn't remember that i didn't remember going to bed. which is the weirdest part of the entire thing. as soon as i entertained those thoughts, they vanished from my mind. and i never thought about it again until a few months ago when vague impressions of this memory started to trickle in.\r\n\r\ni'm not sure if these memories or real or if the information is correct. i'm not sure of much anymore. \r\n\r\nand this is all just the tip of the iceberg. i could go on and on about this. about my experiences. to be truthful, i could write a book! i sometimes wonder if that's what this is all about. is that my purpose in all of this? i can't help but feel i have some sort of purpose, some sort of task that i'm supposed to do.\r\n\r\ni mean no offense to the investigators that were on my case earlier, but i would prefer to be contacted (through email - heathermsilvey@gmail.Com) by someone different. in order to realize what's going on here, you need to open your mind. these things are masters of disguise. we've been invaded - whether that's hostile or not remains to be seen. \r\n\r\ni worry and wonder about the government's involvement. it makes me hesitant to even share this information. but i can't live in fear and i won't.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":29193,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.7855467,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08032011-0034","longitude":-96.3639108,"occurred":1312354800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nebraska","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,   Circle,   Cylinder,   Disc,   Egg,   Fireball,   Flash,   Oval,   Sphere,   Star-like,   Triangle,   Other,   Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1312407478000,"summary":"Ufos nightly & possible abductions","tags":["ufo","abduction"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Craig, Nebraska","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:57032"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Ventura","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At 10:50 three objects came into my sight from a distance of 20 miles away or more. they must have been beyond the coast line, possibly over the pacific ocean as i observed them facing due west/northwest from the city of ojai. initially i thought all three to be airplanes and observed the third object cross my field of vision (consistent with airplane flight) while the other two stopped and maintained there position at an identical altitude, hovering for 45 minutes. during the 45 minutes they were observed moving straight up, down and left/right. these movements are inconsistent with maneuverability of traditional aircraft. at 11:20 one of the crafts seemed to diminish in size while still keeping the same altitude as the other craft. i believe it was flying away from me or out to sea in this case. at 11:30 the remaining craft descended slowly straight down until it was out of my field of vision. i attempted to film and photograph but was unable due to there distance. i would describe the objects as orbs or disks. unfortunately from the distance i am unclear as to which. the put off a orange light and moved in a way as i can only describe as fluid in any direction. my feeling during the sighting was one of sheer joy and amazement.

michigan ave & saw a low flying craft gliding   across the i-275 expressway more slowly than normal aircraft in a southwesterly arc & watched it as it flew directly over my car, trying to discern whether it had wings. there were none, instead i made out a triangular shape, & there were large white lights @ each corner & a smaller red light @ tne bottom of the triangle just in front of the two lights in back. the craft was huge.\r\ni drove on trying to make sense of what i'd just seen.\r\n\r\nthe next morning (2/11/11)@ approximately 3a as i approached the same intersection, i noticed 3 lights side by side drifting downward at a angle over michigan ave. approx. a mile in front of me. i thought it was a plane @ 1st, but because of the sighting the previous a.M., i focused on it as it moved toward the tree line running along mich.Ave. the closer i got the more i realized it wasn't advancing, but stationary, which really struck me.\r\n\r\nit was hovering above the trees directly across from a large gas station which was brightly lit. it was just @ the n.W. corner of michigan ave. & haggerty. it was huge, i'm guessing close to 150 feet long, one light in front, two in back. as i was the only car on the road for a few minutes, i was able to drive by slowly & stare @ the craft for roughly half a minute, awestruck, even mildly stunned. it just sat there in the air about 100 feet above the trees, which showed no sign of movement, no disruption as if by downward air pressure for example. as i made the turn to go north on haggerty toward home, it took off on a straight trajectory following the tree line so smoothly i took note of that fact, as it indicated no impetus, no jerkiness or sign of propulsion. on both occasions,the craft made absolutely no sound. just after making the turn onto haggerty i decided to turn back & follow it.\r\nbut by the time i got back onto michigan ave. west it was gone.\r\n\r\nthen on 3/14/11, having been watching the skies in the

the i-94 expressway & kept looking back & forth watching the road & looking toward the craft hovering over ford lake. as i got off the freeway, i looked back to see it moving eastward, then lost sight of it, as i accessed the road to work.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line

instead of photographing ghost orbs, are we actually seeing ufo's capture by our camera?  i was wondering if anyone else out there has seen anything like this, or thinks there is a connection to these two phenomena?  please study the photo provided and see what you think.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:01","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":29183,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.5352929,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05212011-0027","longitude":-119.8116527,"occurred":1301977020000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nevada","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1306045109000,"summary":"Ghost orbs/ufo's","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/29183_submitter_file1__StrangeMultipleOrbs.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":47,"locationName":"Reno, Nevada","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:57041"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Morrison","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We were sitting on our 2nd story balcony which faces west. i looked up and saw a white light that was moving rapidly back and forth and got my husband to look up. it changed from white to blue a couple times and then it stayed blue. we couldn't see it the whole time due to trees and houses but it would pop out from behind them and zig zag. it would also go up and down. it was moving to quickly to be some kind of plane and it was pretty bright. we watched it for about 20 minutes before we went up a flight of stairs to the third floor landing of our building and could see it much better however shortly after that it didn't come out anymore. it was near bear creek lake park or possibly bandimere speedway.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":29182,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.6603788,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05212011-0026","longitude":-105.1868196,"occurred":1305952200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1306044230000,"summary":"Blue light in sky","tags":["landing"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Morrison, Colorado","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:57042"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82758,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1861}
