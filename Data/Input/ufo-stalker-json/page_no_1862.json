approx. 2-2:30am cst. i don't remember the mile marker in which i've seen this object. i can estimate it was between mm#25-45. it was a clear night with few scattered clouds when a glow caught my attention in front of me. i saw it through my windshield as it traveled straight to the east. what i saw was just above the bottom layer of a small patch of clouds. it was flickering, the best way i can describe it, imagine headlights peering through some trees (trees being between you and the headlights)as it travels down the road. it flickered about three times. at first i thought it was a comet or meteor, but it was traveling much to slow. as i studied it, wondering what it could be i could only see the underbelly of this craft. the object was round emanating a white light with a blueish tint. i noticed a dark shaded center spot. around this spot was a dark shaded ring, about the same shade as the spot. the circumference was also the same dark shade but it seem to have a pattern but not sure. these areas were not completely dark, just a shade. the light emanating from this craft formed a halo affect around it. in the halo i can see the clouds moving away from the craft(not around it)like the way fire moves. this object seem to have some obscured affect, shield or energy not sure but i was able to make it out. not sure of the size, but i estimate it was the size of a .25 cent coin if you held it just front of you as you. clouds were not very high, this object was just above the bottom layer of the clouds. i was confused as to what i saw, i tried to rationalize as to what it could be. the feeling i got from it was the feeling that i was not suppose to see it, but it got caught. then it just dissapeared before it reached the end of the cloud as i waited to see it come out. if you have any questions please call me anytime. i work graveyard i'm up through the

pulling into a rest stop to fix a bad map sensor in my 93 chevy van. as i was parking my van in the diagonal parking spaces facing north east of this rest stop (location is near homewood township, kansas, elevation 1,040 feet, latitude: 38-30'53'' n longitude: 095-22'44'' w.), i noticed a quarter moon setting low in the eastern horizon in a bright red color. having seen objects in the sky on previous road trips, i was prepared with two tripod mounted digital cameras (#1 cam is a jvc's gc-fm1au 1080 hd and #2 cam is a sony's hms-cm1 mp4 hd camera) ready to shoot which i had setup in the passenger compartment of the van. i quickly brought both cameras out and to the front of the van. i extended the tripods and made sure they where well seated on the concrete sidewalk and i made sure the cameras where adjusted and locked into a level plane before i began shooting photos.\r\n\r\nthe night air had a slight chill but yet the temperature was comfortable. the wind had a constant breeze from the south and the sky was quite clear with no cloud obstructions however there was a cloud formation about 40 to 50 miles south of my location. \r\n\r\njust after the red moon set below the horizon, i got a hair-raising-sensation in the back of my neck and rapidly snapped a few more photos with the sony hms-cm1 hd mp4 camera. i could only see the stars in the horizon at the time of the hair-raising-sensation so i did not know what i was photographing. after taking this next set of photos, i became real sleepy and decided to pack-up the tripods and take a nap in the van. i believe i sleep for four hours and then continued on my road trip.\r\n\r\nthe photographs enclosed are the four of the eight photos taken after the red moon has set below the horizon. i have used two stars in the horizon as point of reference. what the non-solid celestial object is - is unknown. the time line of photos (there were eight photos take total but these photos 8:03:06pm, 8:03:22pm, 8:03:32pm, and 8:04:12pm) show the object phasing in then out of sight then it is moving into the winds direction. i could not see this thing at the time the photos were being taken, i just had a feeling it was

appeared.  no sound.  the eerie thing is that it was perfectly stationary like a star, looked like an airplane, no sound and linear fade in and out.  meteor?  what are the odds that it could come perfectly straight at me with no color variation, and for five seconds?  i wanted to think supernova at first, but very man made looking color like halogen head light.  no size just point like
