red lights on what seemed to be the front behind them seemed to be a white hue/glow. it was pretty high up and it just seemed to be hovering there. it really creeped me out and we felt as though it was watching us. i turned off the car engine and car lights so i could really get a sense of how bright and far this object was or if it was making any noise. it hovered there for another minute or two and without sound or gaining speed it just took off to the southwest. it didn't even turn around or anything just took off but if what we thought we were looking at was the front how is that possible? its hard to say what shape the object was when we were looking at it with these red lights which seemed to ring it as if it was a disk/round/half cirle. but, then again it could have been a boomerang cause we were only seeing this one edge of it. if that were the case then its movement wouldn't have made sense. i am baffled. i m gonna guess and say it was a disk. when it took off it started flashing lights and turned out some of the red and looked like a plane would at high altitude. the white glow disappeared. i turned the car around and tried to stay in sight of it but it went directly into cloud cover and we lost sight of it. in total about 5 minutes passed that we got to watch it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

minutes while driving so, i watched them the entire time.  they did not move, but they almost seemed to pulse somewhat (like get brighter) and then they would disappear altogether.  they would reappear and be in the exact same position and place, to the best of my knowledge.  they must have disappeared/reappeared half a dozen times.  \r\n\r\nother cars on the interstate seemed to notice them since a few of them were braking.  i go to my off-ramp and sat at the red light at the top and that is where i was able to get a photo.  my nikon coolpix isn't a great camera and the shot isn't great, but it's better than nothing.  \r\n\r\nyou could see the passenger side window frame in the top left hand side of the photo and in the distance, about 1,000 yards, you could see a large flat building with lights.  there is also some street lights in the photograph which probably might make the objects in question hard to see.  however, you'll notice the objects (in the center of the photo) are much more orange than the street lights.  \r\n\r\ni tried blowing the photo up and sharpening it or enhancing it, but my software is limited.\r\n\r\ni was too spooked to stop so, i kept driving, as i was now the only car in sight.  as i drove away from the objects, i kept checking my rear view and i thought i saw a third, although smaller object come up from below the two at an

full moon tomorrow (but supposed to be a washout here, so i went to the beach tonight to take pics). i usually go to the beach on full moons, eclipses,storms, hurricanes, water spouts and meteor showers to get some awesome photos. tonight was the same, i had my family with me ( mom, brother, 2 daughters). there were plenty of other people on the beach as well, it was a warm clear summer night after all. \r\n\r\nthen as i was holding the shutter down with my bulb setting on my camera, i was staring over the horizon, when suddenly 2 orange orbs appeared. they quickly dissolved (idk how else to describe it) i tried to move my camera to catch them, and suddenly another one appeared, and faded just as quick. but i caught it on my camera faintly. i continued taking photos with long shutter in hopes of catching more of these \"orbs\", and i caught 2 in my photos. but there were more, i just missed them ( had the camera pointing slightly off, dang it!) \r\n\r\nat this point everyone was talking about them. some people left because they were scared it was going to crash and cause a huge wave. others said \"its like clover field\" and most just stayed and watched on in amazement. \r\n\r\nthese orbs happened several times. the first, 2 appear from up in the sky. like someone throwing a glowing bouncy ball directly at you, they had no tail almost. the faded into existence, got super bright, and the faded back out in a matter of seconds. 2 right beside each other (left one first then the right one and then went away at the same time.), then the were gone and a 3rd one appeared to the left of the other two. about 20 minutes after that, and other one appeared, only larger than any of the previous three. there was no noise other than the ocean. shortly after that, 3 appeared at the same time, only super close, like a plane over head, but still no noise. then one final one was faint in the distance. everyone was glued to the sky. about 30-45 mins after the last orb seen, military helicopters flew in from the south and north. we heard them coming. the paralleled the coast with lights on as normal. then the lights stopped, we could still hear them but could not see them in the dark. it gave everyone there an eerie feeling. very uneasy. \r\n\r\ni asked the local news, and they had no word of anything going on off shore tonight. i've lived near marine and army bases my entire life. i know what planes are like. i can tell you the type of plane just by the sound usually. i know what lights are for planes and which are for helicopters. i know what kind of things they do during practices. these lights were not anything that was flying. if i had to guess i'd say, ball lightening, a meteor falling at a straight angle to us, giving it a small tail and almost no sense of falling or a ufo. i have no idea what they are though, im just guessing blindly. the local news deemed it at \"space junk\".","distance":"Over One

40 - 50 feet off the ground, 150 - 200 yards off the highway and moving at about 20-30 mph. my first thought was that it was a balloon, but the wind that morning was out of the east and blowing real hard and this thing was not being buffeted by the wind whatsoever. it continued unaffecated by the wind for a distance of about 200 yds, bobbled a couple of times and rapidly decended to a height of about 8-10 ft and just sat there. i watched for a bit and seeing no further movement went on my way.\r\nnow was this a balloon? no. was it a government spy drone? possibly, but why would it be in some farmers' vacant field in montana? my personal feeling on what this could be is that it was an alien probe of some kind. possible looking for cattle to do some of that weird cattle mutilation **** to.

the south because out of the corner of my eye i saw an orange light. it looked like a circular, bright, fireball object high up in the dark sky, i and thought it may be strange airplane lights i hadn't seen before.  there is a lot of air traffic in this area, and the light didn't match what i always see in the sky. at once, another identical circle began to \"come out\" of it, and it moved in a direct line to the left (and slightly down) of the original circle, and stopped.  another one \"came out\" of the original circle, and flew in a direct line to the right of it and stopped.  another emerged more slowly than the first two from the original circle, and also went to the right of the original circle and stopped right next to it. i couldn't believe what i was looking at, i was dumbfounded and couldn't get the words out to tell my sister (on the phone) what i was looking at.  all four circles lingered in each of their spots for a few seconds, and then the circle to the left moved very fast back into the original circle, as if pulled by a magnet.  the other two immediately followed, and as if all them were enclosed back in the original circle, it appeared to fold and vanished from sight, like it had been sucked away into an invisible place, leaving no visible trace.  i knew i had seen something phenomenal, and felt very small.  i went inside to tell my parents what i saw, went back outside and watched the same spot for a while, but there was nothing else.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

at least a couple of hundred feet higher than any of the radio towers or buildings would have been and it was in fact slowly floating downward.  before the light turned green again, it actually stopped for a moment, hovered and then started moving up again.  because i live nearby an airport, and previously i lived near a military airbase, i've become very familiar with what the different

they were flying very slowly, but at a greater speed than a hoover.  she said they were flying very low, a little above treeline level.  one actually touched the ground and went back up.  she said she just sat there is disbelief, and she opened her window to get a better look.  she said they were silent.  they eventually flew off toward the southwest.\r\n\r\nas she was sitting there watching a truck approached the intersection, and it just stopped and watched also.  after the objects flew away, the truck turned next to her and the male driver asked her \"did you see that?\".  the female passenger stated that she was glad they were not the only ones that had witnessed the incident.  my daughter wishes now she had gotten the person's name driving the truck.\r\n\r\nmy daughter was

happened, but of course we saw nothing.  i came home and called the local police department to see if anyone else had reported anything, but they were very disinterested.\r\n\r\nmy daughter is an

about the incident, she said the items she saw were as orange as the moon was when this was going on.  but when we went out driving around, the moon was no longer orange and appeared to be about 1/3 of the size it was when my son and i drove home (and about the same time my daughter witnessed the incident).  that could be just because it was later and the moon's orientation in the sky was different, but it seemed a little odd to us.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

like any other star does. it was a perfect white orb. after staring at it about two minutes almost done with my cig it got a little larger in size but as it did the shape quickly turned cigar shape. thats when a feeling came over me like i knew what i was looking at, but i was not scared. i guess in shock. it stayed like that maybe six seven seconds then shot across the horizon like almost the speed of light. i was amazed! then almost wishing i could see more a tiny little white dot wiggled down stopping closely in line with where i saw the first orb then shot across the horizon following the other, and then one more repeating after that! the last two came in and shot off in less than ten seconds. i would have to say the speed of these things is mind blowing. makes nasa look like childs play. these were silent and when shot off there was no tail of light or sound. i live near the airport and watch airplanes pass all the time so there no confusion here. in my line of sight i would have to guess the first was far away and then moved toward my direction hints the orb getting larger and turning cigar shape. and the other two i think i might have witnessed coming into our

like a space ship!\r\nit flew right over my head and out west towards the ocean. i saw it pretty clearly and it was about 1,000 feet in the air and was gliding\r\nacross the sky at a steady pace. there was an airplane landing and it went directly under the airplane.\r\nit had no lights and no noise. it looked like it was semi see through white glowing material like a jelly fish in the ocean.\r\nno lights but it had a triangle shape with a pointed nose. it also had the shape of a paper airplane with folds along the sides but the back had 3 or 4 points.\r\nthis was at 4:40 then right afterwards at 4:43 i saw another orb flying really really slow headed south east.\r\nthen another one (they are all appearing from the same spot like before) headed north west turned slowly and headed back north east.\r\nthis one could not have been a satellite.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Path

roommate and his girlfriend were going for coffee at 12:20 am on saturday, may 14, 2011 and saw some clouds that formed a smiley face. they took several pictures of the clouds with a camera phone, went for their coffee, and then returned home. the next day when they were looking at the pictures saw something they didn't notice the night before. near the cloud's \"eye\" they saw what appears to be an object in the sky that is somewhat disc-shaped. they say there was no plane in the sky, no airtraffic at all and there was nothing inside the vehicle reflecting onto the windshield that could account for it.\r\n\r\ni have showed the photo to some people and they dismiss it as a lens flare. but if it is indeed a lens flare, why was it not in other pictures taken from the same angle and with the same sources of light?\r\n\r\ni have attached two pictures taken moments apart and would be grateful if somebody could analyze them to determine whether or not what is in the second picture is in fact a lens flare or something else. \r\n\r\nbest

pomery meadow rd. meet, i first noticed a pair of \"orbs\" flying in the same direction (towards westfield) in unison with each other, lost them over some trees, got to my brother/parents house, dropped him off, (he did not see them, i at first wasn't thinking anything of it, just some planes..). they live right on rt.10,dropped him off and i pulled out of their driveway, back towards easthampton, i took a right onto clark st.(southampton), a right onto east st. then i noticed a large craft with red and blueish lights hovering over a field on pleasant st. so i took that left, i was amazed, it was making a not too loud humming noise. i kept driving because i admit, i was kinda freaked out, this is my first \"ufo\" sighting. as i kept driving i saw the same \"orbs\" as before, atleast, i think they were the same ones. i slowed down to get a better look, as one of them seemed to be tailing me, everytime i looked out my driver side window, it was right beside me probably a couple hundred yards away. it stayed with my until i reached the center of easthampton, i then lost it. i will say, as i looked at it out my window, i had an amazed look on my face, a big smile all the way home, i kinda felt it was following me purposely. if you need a map of where i was driving, i can come up with one.\r\n\r\nthank
