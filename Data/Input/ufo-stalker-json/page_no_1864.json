obscure object emerging from clouds to my nw. as my son watched the object, i went inside and retrieved binoculars. upon returning, my son and i were amazed at what we were watching. it was a metallic, copper colored(with darker burned spots) perfect disc shaped object. it slowly moved toward us, occasilnally moving back into clouds. i went back inside and retrieved an old vhs camcorder , returned with my wife and began taping.As my son and wife watched thru binoculars, i taped the object as it performed complex manuevers, moving toward the south, ever closer to my location.\r\ni recorded the object for some 12-15 minutes.\r\nto describe the object is simple, it was a perfect disc shaed object with absolutely no features, no structures, highly reflective(as it reflected sunlight), silent and demonstrating controlled flight.\r\nafter the object got at it's closest(approx 8000 feet distant), it moved away to the west behind trees.\r\ni immediately called the faa control tower at the tri cities airport to inquire if they had seen anything on their radar since this sighting was in the direct flight path to the airport and was told no that unless the object had a transponder, their radar was not set up to see it.\r\ni also called the national weather service office in morristown and recieved wind data for that day at height. all wind at every level the object occupied was from the west, the direction the object left, proving powered flight. i also requested approx. distance to the clouds from my location using coordinates. the  culumulus cloud bank from which the object emerged when we first saw it was approx 5 miles distant from me at  16:30 hours.\r\nvideo was shared with dr bruce macabee for analysis. he also asked for and recieved a video shot with the same camera of a yard stick at 50 measured feet also zoomed and normal.  macabee's analysis was thorough and very professional. he surmised the object was some 35 feet in diameter and had an aspect ratio  of 6 to 1. distance varied greatly from the camera to the object. macabee also stated the object was displaying flight characteristics which defied laws of physics.  i originally submitted all this info(including statements from the nws regarding wind data) to mufon by paper forms back in 2003.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

pulled off to the shoulder to streatch out the kinks.  we were parked on a high bank looking down on the arkansas river.\r\n\r\nas we got off the bike i looked up and thought i saw 3 jets flying in a triangular pattern.  i remarked about how cool it was to see them and pointed them out to my husband.  he looked up and upon further watching realized they were not jets.  there were very definite lines connecting the three corners and the entire object was moving very slowly, with no sound.  we both said out loud, \"is that......A ufo?\"  then we said yes it has to be.  it was far far too large to be anything of ours, \"human related\".\r\n\r\nit looked as though it were traveling at about commercial airliner cruising altitude, so i'm guessing about 35,000 feet.  yet it was so massive, if on earth, there would be no where to park something that large, and no one see it.  the best depiction of size i can give you would be to take a normal sized sheet of printer paper and cut part off to make a perfect square.  then cut off two corners to make a perfect triangle.  now, mesure 1/4 of an inch in on each of the 3 points and draw a straight line (forming a 1/4 inch triagle on the 3 corner of the main paper triangle).  these would depict quite well what we first thought loooked like jets flying in formation.  taking the size of a jet in everyday life into consideration, and filling in all the rest of that triangle with the same sized jets, you can get an exact idea of how massive this thing was.  the points may have been either lights or metalic.\r\n\r\nit really blended in with the sky very well.  it moved very slowly compared to a jet.  as it passed over us and the river down below it was moving in a south easterly direction.  it eventually faded because there was a thin lacy cloud layer between us and it, but we watched it untill we could not see it anymore.\r\n\r\nit has been bugging me that i cannot find any reports of other sightings of a triangle this huge.  and yes, i don't want people thinking i'm a loon so i have not reported it.  we both saw it.  we both saw the same thing exactly.  another strange thing about the whole incident is that we both agree how strange we felt durring this sighting.  i'm not sure how to describe it, except that it was a floaty, dream-like feeling, a sensation that time itself had been effected....It ticked away slower than normal or something.  now i wonder if it could have been some kind of magnetic field affect or some such thing that made us feel that way.  after that, we went a little further up the road and fished.  that was it.\r\n\r\nbut has anything of this size been reported anywhere?  that is the frustrating part, besides the fact that we never have the camera with us when we need it.  and now, of course, we keep catching ourselves looking and watching for anything in the skies.  i have seen a couple other strange things over the last 2 years, but not huge like that triangle.  let me know if you want to hear about those.  thank you.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Insignia,  Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

phenomena, as they flew slowly, albeit radical, at about 20 degrees above horizon. as they spread and slowly began to disappear into the clouds above (low celing), a larger and brighter orange object at a faster speed, about 1-2 degrees above the horizon, behind the treeline, and then as it started to ascend, split into five smaller orange objects, again radical in flight, without formation, and slowly ascended into the clould cover. this occurred about 20 times over a 25 minute span. they all came from the north (low on horizon) to south and then turning toward the east and then into cloud cover. at one time, i observed over 15 in the sky at one time. at approx 9:58 pm, the largest ball at a faster speed flew, split into 5 smaller objects, they followed the same path as the previous objects, and then the event seemed to stop. there were other vehicles on the shoulder of the highway observing this event. i got one persons name and phone, and the next day he related that he talked to another individual who also saw this phenomenon. once they all rose above the treeline, i would approximate their speed at approx. that of a helicopter. but the jerky motion didn't make sense, and the coloration from a side view made no sense, as the sun had been down for over an hour and the low altitude above the eastern horizon would pretty much rule out solar reflection. i would guess that over the period that i observed these objects, there were approximately 125 of them. i do not do drugs/drink/or subject to illusions. i am observant, logical, and well educated. this happened, it was unexplainable, and a bit spooky. as this event lasted so long, with so many objects, i would presume that radar somewhere would have picked this up. if possible, i would like an explanation from some tower or authority trying to explain this to me. the initial speed of these objects at low altitude seemd to be about 100-120 kph, but during ascent appeared to slow to around 60-80kph. the wind was about 15 knots, which might contribute to some of the uneveness of flight, but probably not.

until it disappeared into the black cloud. \r\n\r\nat that point we both deemed it a ufo  but not claiming that it was extraterrestrial.   \r\n\r\nfor the first time my wife was very intrigued and

orange coloured lights(shperes) in the sky, at first thought maybe planes, but there were no flashing lights that are typical on aircraft, so i posted what i was seeing on my facebook page. someone suggested lanterns, but there was no \"flickering\" as you would expect to find in lanterns and given they seemed to be flying in formation, i didn't understand how lanterns could move so slowly without the \"flicker\" of a candle,:let alone that they were all travelling in a straight line horizontally. went to bedroom window and noticed there were about 6 at first, then more followed; all moving at the same speed (slowly) and many followed for about 15 mins. more just kept coming (about 50 in total- i had posted \"hundreds\" on my facebook page- as i was stunned at there being so many). i opened the window, to find out if there was any noise, but there was silence. they all seemed to be following one. it's like they were \"floating in silence but with a direction and all at the same speed\". bright orange coloured spheres that also seemed to (at exactly the same time)seemed to change to green underneath (all at the same time); it just seemed weird that they were all moving at exactly the same speed, and completely in silence (since i had opened the window to find out if i could hear anything-but there was silence). relatively close (close enough to be able to tell that they were large and spherical). my camera hadn't been charged (as i rarely use it and i don't have a mobile/cell phone) but it is documented on my facebook page during the sighting. i got a torch (flash-light) and began flashing it in their direction through the window(sounds silly i know). i wasn't scared; if anything i was hoping they would spot my flash-light (i would have no problem if they were actual ufo's, i would gladly go). afterwards, i kept posting comments on my facebook account, as i was very excited (in a good/healthy way). i have always been fascinated by the ufo phenomenon, but this is the first time i have witnessed anything first hand. i may state-i wasn't drinking (i haven't had a drink in over 3 yrs) or under the influence of any drugs. after about 15 mins i went to get my camera (as when i first spotted them i plugged in my camera in to charge it)and returned to my bedroom window, but they had simply disappeared. i went to the window at the top of the stairs at a different part of my flat (window view would have been able too see them if they continued in the same flight pattern-only a 45 degree angle difference)but they had simply just \"vanished\". i know there will be doubters, or people who mock me, but i don't care-i know what i saw, and i stand behind it 100%. camera is now fully charged, and i will be paying attention (with more interest from now on) to the skies above.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

the clouds above them were dark vinilla.   the sky looked like it was starting to clear in the west, but just barely.   i could see two layers of clouds one passing over the other in different directions.  the lower clouds hung down like drap bunchings sagging down like gumdrops across the sky.  the  two white  boomarang shaped clouds, were sitting at a angle the right side of the boomarang higher than the left.   still and not moving.   we wached them for several mins.  they  did not move.    then either the  clouds that were above the boomarangs  came down and enveloped them or they receided into the clouds.   it looked like they just receded into the clouds and were obscured from our view.    the closest one to us may have been 100 feet or more  from wing tip to wing tip.  twenty feet thick in the middle.  just guessing.    after the boomarangs receided into the clouds,   a business jet came around us from the south, passing in front of us in the west and curving back to the south looking like it was on approach to the mckinney airport nearby.   it was low to the ground under the cloud cover.   it didn't look much higher than the radio tower to the north of us. we

my thoughts. i found myself walking just outside newville (half a mile?) when i glanced up to see a yellow light moving across the sky somewhat above the mountain. my first thought was that it was a satellite or plane/jet with the sun still reflecting off of it. watching it, i further thought, \"wait a minute...It's almost 2 am...The sun wouldn't still be refecting at this time.\" also noting that it was moving a little faster than normal nighttime objects, i stopped walking to watch it. as soon as i stopped walking, the object slowed down, dropped lower and shot my direction so fast that i ducked down behind the embankment beside the road. it was at this time that i noticed the crickets were all chirping very loudly. after a few seconds, i got the courage to slowly stand back upright and look. at this point, i saw a disc with a small dome on top hovering above the trees possibly near the conodoguinet creek some distance away. at this point, the disc appeared to land in a group of trees. i did not stick around to see any more, running as fast as i could towards newville. near the elementary school, a car stopped and asked if i needed a ride. i took the ride into the center of town. on the short ride, the driver, apparently seeing my fear, asked if i was ok. i thought for a second to ask if he saw it too, but decided he would think i'm nuts, so i just said yeah, i was ok. dropped off at my car just outside a friends house, i knocked on their door, but his dad came to the door and told me to go after i said what i had seen. he thought i was on drugs (i wasn't, nor had i been drinking). later his dad said i was \"white as a sheet.\"\r\n       the object itself was similar to the one at the top of this webpage, but with a smaller dome and the top part coming down lower, making the bottom almost flat. the entire object was glowing a dull yellow, but with at least four lights on the bottom glowing brighter and lighting further, sequentially (rapidly)in a clockwise rotation. the dome was also glowing quite a bit brighter than the body, with the exception of a darker spot on the dome, that made me think it was something in the dome watching outside, causing me great fear. i can easily draw a picture of it still 37 years

stars. what put this object out of place is the movement in which it moved in. the movement was linear another words it was moving in straight lines. after about ten minutes of watching this thing which must have been rather far away as it only appeared as a bright star, the object appeared to be getting closer. after another five minutes the object appeared to be in front of us and slowly moved over head. the object was tremendous in size. it was triangular in shape with a bright light in the middle and smaller bright lights on each corner. the most amazing thing about it was that it made absolutely no sound. we could actually hear crickets and frogs and no other noise coming from the object. being in shock and scared my friend and i ran under a tractor which was there and another
