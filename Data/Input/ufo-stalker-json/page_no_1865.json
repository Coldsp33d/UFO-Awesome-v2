as well as just looking at the stars. i will admit that we were there to search for ufo's, but also that my self-proclaimed role for the night was the skeptic. it's not that i don't believe, but that i wanted to rule out all other possibilities. \r\n\r\nthe craft appeared in the gap between two peaks, which is slightly west of true north. it caught my eye because it was so excessively bright and because a member of our party yelled out to get our attention. my first thought was that it was coming from an entirely different direction that any other object (i'd already determined what appeared to be the flight paths of planes). planes generally traveled from northeast to southwest and visa versa (in line with denver), but this was totally different. \r\n\r\ninitially, it looked like a single, white light ��� an excessively bright light, in fact. it���s hard to explain, but it was really, really bright  - way brighter than any other plane or star. however, as it drew closer the white light seemed to separate into three smaller white lights in a perfect line with a red light hovering above it. presumably, this was the top of the craft as it seemed to be descending.\r\n\r\nthe truly interesting thing about this craft was that it was incredibly low ��� perhaps even 500 feet or less above our heads. it flew directly overhead and seemed to bank slightly before disappearing into the south - perhaps over vallecito reservoir. i wasn't quite scared - more awestruck actually, but i did have the presence of mind to attempt to take two photographs, neither of which showed anything distinct. \r\n\r\nas it passed overhead and banked it became clear that this was a diamond-shaped craft. small lights lined all four sides, delineating the diamond shape and showing the outline of the craft. from our vantage point we could see the underside of the thing which seemed to have four or five red lights (one at each corner and one in the center) and a series of three or four round white lights in the front and four slit-like lights toward the back. \r\n\r\nit moved slowly and took about thirty seconds to travel across the sky. it made a low, rumbling roar, but did not resemble a plane in any other way. i have no idea how large it was, but it seemed pretty big ��� at least as big as a jet, maybe bigger. also, to be perfectly honest, we were standing next to a creek which was sending out a low, rumbling roar, so i cannot really attest to how loud it was. \r\n\r\nabout an hour and one-half later, another craft appeared from the same general area and traveled the same general path. it seemed exactly the same: appearing as an extraordinarily bright single white light and then showing us the three white lights and single red light as it drew near.  as before it was very low. once again there were small, white lights around the perimeter, three or four white lights at the front and three slit-like lights in the back. the only difference was that the five lights at the corners were green and not red.\r\n\r\nnote: this object was not on the same flight path as any of the planes that we had observed in the sky, and, most importantly, it was far, far lower. i did a bit of research and discovered that there are nearby airports that could support a craft of that size. also, for the record, it was not the stealth. i've seen the stealth at close range and it looked nothing like this. \r\n\r\nthere were also lights and orbs and other \"visual anomalies\" in the sky that night and those will be noted in the final question section.\r\n\r\n\r\nattached is a very poorly rendered drawing of what i saw as well as too wretched photographs that show next to nothing. the red and white lights on the actual craft were basically the same size, but my rather deplorable drawing skills (it was an online drawing program), do not reflect that. the large thing at the front was the very bright light.

looked out the window and saw an ufo flickering, white, blue, green, red, purple, a yellowish orange color and then it turned completly black. it was right in the back of my house, just in the air. i grab my camera in starting taken pictures and filmimg it. i woke my husband, sister and my neice up; to come in wittnes what im seeing. i wasnt scared at all, it just seem so crazy because; even do the air force; tries to tell you, that not a such thing! then you see it with your own eyes, is a blessing. i dont know why it choose to stop behind my house but it did. ive been taking pictures and recording since then. i have over 80-pictures and around 30 recordings. they know im taking pictures and recording of them! sometime they'll put on a good show. i've notice right after that, everywhere i went; i will see as ther appear; looking like a star; they will follow. about a month ago, i was on my way home in seen one by the moon and i wanted to take a picture of it, and i really couldnt get a good picture, so i continue to try to focus on it, and the process i started to take the camera, everywhere i saw particiles, which lead down to the ground and right infront of my window. about an hour later, i got in the bed, then an the corner of my eyes, i saw what looked like a white piece of glitter going by me. i asked my husband to turn off the lights, so i can see better. i took pictures that night and recorded what i caught; little balls was coming out everywhere. sometimes i know their is there without turning on my camera and i took picture last night and recorded; outside and in my room and there they was. i'm not scared, but i do want to know, whats goin on. i'm asking for help; because this truely mean something. thank you

butts. the first time i saw them was a little after we moved in, and i was outside smoking, looking at the stars, when i saw three balls of light on the horizon. there are trees for acres behind my building with street lamps here and there where the road cuts into the woods, and there are mountains where they seemed to be. i passed them off as stars at first (or street lamps, or radio towers, of which there are a couple next to where i see them, but as you will read, the lights are not always there, so it cannot possibly be any of those), until i saw the third one on the far right begin to move away from the others. they seemed to be glowing/flashing different colors (red, blue, white, purple and not at certain points like the corners of a triangle, the entire sphere was morphing into these colors). so the one on the right was moving away from the group and thats when it started to get weird. the orb that was moving stopped and just hovered for a little while going up and down repeatedly, sometimes making circular motions. the one on the far left began to do the same thing, but the center orb remained stationary. i watched this continue for a good long while before i just went inside. this was not my only encounter with these orbs. ever since that first night, i have repeatedly seen them in the same general area doing the same thing and have had friends witness it as well. one of those times with my friend we actually saw one of the three light up immensely becoming the brightest object in the sky, then immediately disappear. that same night a red light that looked like a circular spotlight flashed very quick on the top of the trees in front of us while we were watching the orbs. it wasnt an object, just a quick flash on top of a couple of trees maybe 200-300 yards in front of us. all of this is usually late at night, around 12-3am. they also seem to have some kind of secondary orb that comes out from the bottom that is maybe a third of their size and sits a short distance beneath them and then joining back up with the main body. they are not always on the horizon, however, occasionally there is only one or two to my not too distant left moving behind the tree line very, very, slowly and never making any sounds whatsoever. \r\non another occasion, i got to see what i believe was possibly one of these secondary smaller orbs actually in the woods in front of my balcony (this is giving me chills just thinking about it, i was very afraid that night, i didnt sleep at all). i was watching the usual group of three (who i have concluded cannot be stars because it can be weeks before i see them again) when i saw a faint white light off in the distance in my woods. now, my apartment building is on a cliff, so to say, with about a 30 foot drop to where there are some tall grasses before it eventually turns into thick wood. these woods go up around the cliff to the left and up to the parking lot in the front of the building, so there is access to these woods without making a 30 foot jump. so i saw the light, and then it just went away and i didnt think much about it until i saw it again a few moments later, but closer. this time it didnt disappear but continued moving, very slowly, maybe 10-20 ft. from the ground. i could see it moving behind the branches, and i just froze. i dont think it was a person with a flashlight, because it wasnt bobbing up and down like some one walking, nor was it scanning back and forth. and it didnt have rays or a cone of light like a flashlight, it was just one orb of light that was only glowing, not emitting any kind of rays (or sound for that matter) of any sort, like the kind you see when squinting looking at a light bulb or something. it was very small too. eventually it moved off to my left where the trail starts and goes up the cliff to meet with the parking lot. there is a good 40 yards of trail there, so i never saw it break the tree line, it just sort of disappeared from sight. \r\nand me and my friends are not the only ones to have seen this. my father and his friend once were drinking on the balcony and saw all three of them moving across the sky during the day. i have yet to see them at any other time but night, but i usually dont get home until late anyways. i haven't captured any of this on film because we simply don't own any cameras with the ability to capture anything at night. our one camera is completely useless in the dark. \r\neverytime i see these objects i end up just going inside after a while because i see them so often and because i have nothing to capture them on. it has been perhaps a month, month and a half since my last sighting.

i stepped outside on my back porch to have a smoke before the next movie.It was a clear night no clouds you could see all the stars. it was just a beautiful night. as i was standing on my back porch i was looking down at the ground and i see lights reflecting on the ground. and i have never seen lights reflecting off the ground before when i was standing on my porch at night. so i thought that was kind of funny. and i have lived in this house for many years. so to see lights reflecting off the ground was not normal. anyway i look up to see what the lights were i see up in the sky 2 oval shape amber colered lights that were pulsing in the middle was a small round light it was orange the orange light was not pulsing it stayed bright orange the whole time. it was moving real slow. i watched this thing for about 5 seconds then it was like someone turned off a light switch and it was gone. i was so triped out by this thing that i called one of the local news stations later that moring and ask to speak to someone in the metorology. i asked the person i spoke to if anyone had called in about any thing strange. and he told me he had just got in and had not had a chance to look over anything. i asked him if i could call back later and he said yes. but i never called back. the thing i saw was kind of big and it was nothing i have ever saw i know it was not from this world. and it was not any kind of natural phenomenon. like i said it was a clear night and this thing it was like someone turned on a light because there was nothing around this thing when it came on or when it went off. and it was flying real slow and there was no noise coming from this thing. it was the strangest thing i have ever seen in all my life i am 49 years old. now ever time i go out onto my back porch to have a smoke at night i find myself looking up at that same spot hoping it will show itself again. but i know that it was more then likly a one time deal. but it is something i will never

overcast.  walked over to shut my shed door, where the street lights were blocked by the shed and noticed 2 very bright white in color lights dancing above the clouds south, south east of my location.  i of course stopped and watched for a pattern to rule out search lights or event lights such as a theater spotlight or a \"batman\" spotlight if you will.  and noticed the brightness of these objects would fluctuate no matter the distance.  i.E. instead of fading as they danced further away, they would almost pulse.  get brighter going further away, more dim getting closer, then switch. get very bright up close and dim far away.  there were absolutely no patterns to these lights at all.  they would move very fast and slow a bit, then one would speed up and the other seemed to follow to match this.  an absolutely brilliant pulsating light.  strangest thing of all was my loss of cell phone signal and the phone itself wouldnt function for me to allocate my camera setting.  when it finally worked, the lights were gone and i had nothing but my fiancee' to support this claim.  we both her a very distinct humming sound and then the sound of jets flying over.  again, you can check the weather.  it's solid overcast but the jets sounded like it was literally ripping the sky apart.  which would make me believe they were using afterburners.  we have military bases to the east and south of us.  and there have been an increasing amount of military presence here the past few weeks.  since then we've seen strange things, tonight being the strangest of them all..Especially with the presence of military force in a town with 5,000 people in it...White oak, texas.  i've never seen a ufo, never claimed to see a ufo.  all i have claimed to see tonight are 2 very bright, pulsating white lights dancing in the sky above the cloud layer.  then at 1:00am hearing at least 1 jet with afterburners active.  i'll leave this with you to decipher the accuracy of the claim.  thank you for you time.  *(wit's name deleted--cms/sg)","distance":"101-500
