eyes over towards the santa cruz mountains i noticed a very bright orb which was pretty much stationary except it kinda moved left and right a little. during this time, there were a few planes flying by it, but maybe a mile distance away. now the way these planes were moving by it was from north to south. i'd like to also add that this is not a normal flight path, and the only time planes or choppers fly in this area is during any strange light activity. when the planes did fly nearby (it was a total of three), the \"orb\" would get even brighter then dim down just a bit after they passed. \r\n\r\ni remembered to get my camera out to try to get some photos this time. i zoomed in as much as possible and took about 15 photos. when i reviewed them, most came out looking like a galaxy of rainbow colors from the movement it was making, but in two, you can make out the shape of a triangle. after i took the photos, i went to the computer to upload them which took about 5-7 minutes. meanwhile i kept checking back every few minutes to see if it was still present. at 2320 hours, i went back out to check again, and it was completely gone. \r\n\r\nnext week i should get my telescope back from the shop, and will be able to see things better, and will be able to take pics through my tele. i have noticed a pattern though. these \"lights/orbs\" seem to hover in one area for a 2-3 day span at the same time every night, then move onto another area and do the same. maybe they are scoping out areas for something. this event last night was not too far from the cupertino quarry. maybe 3 miles away. there is so much activity in this area, and i wonder if there is some mineral or something they are after.","distance":"Over One

mother's day. my daughter gets excited about birds and airplanes in the sky, so when we were looking at a passing commercial jetliner in a nearly cloudless sky i noticed an object considerably higher up in the atmosphere than what an airplane would fly. the object was visible to the naked eye as a brightly shimmering sphere, and appeared just to the east of our house. it was traveling at a rate of speed that was much slower than what a commercial airplane would travel, but faster than what a satellite would travel as it orbits the earth. in fact, a crescent moon was present just to the west of the house, giving me a point of reference to determine if what i was seeing was a satellite orbiting the earth, or if it was something else. typically, satellites do not have self-propulsion and cannot slow to a stop, as this object did. \r\n\r\ni asked my wife to look at the object with me and she was able to locate it in the sky easily. it was traveling quite slowly and, after watching it for about 10 or 15 minutes, it ultimately stopped and hovered almost directly overhead. we were both excited about seeing the object, but i wanted a closer look. i asked my wife to retrieve our binoculars so that we could try and get a better look at the object. with the binoculars we both were able to determine that the object was no airplane, and that it was not a satellite. i could not determine whether the silvery-white light emitting from the object was a reflection of the sun shining on it, or if it was coming from the object itself. because of its brightness, i believe it was emitting its own light. in order to get a better look at the object through the binoculars i sat in a lounge chair and rested my head on it. this helped to \"steady\" the binoculars to get a better look.\r\n\r\nthe object appeared to change shapes and/or split into as many as three separate objects, each with its own light. it pulsed, expanded, and contracted as it changed shape and split. after splitting it quickly reformed back into one object. there seemed to be no pattern as it split into two or three separate objects and then reformed back into one. i watched the object(s) for almost one hour. \r\n\r\nat around 8pm a young couple had come to our house to meet our dog (we are looking for someone to adopt her, as we are moving out of state soon), and i lost sight of the ufo. approximately 30 minutes later the couple had left and i tried to locate the ufo again. unfortunately, clouds began to roll in from the west and i was unable to locate it.

30 minutes or so of watching it i came to the conclusion that it was in fact something i had never seen before while stargazing and began flashing it with a flashlight (which i believed would have no effect whatsoever). thats when things got a little more intense. we were still focused on the object in the sky, when a huge blue flash lit up the tree tops to our left, which shocked us. we were not
