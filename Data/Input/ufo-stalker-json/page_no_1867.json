the country. i am from lexington ky, which is a decent size city. i heard what sounded like a jet plane going over, much louder though but not out of this world loud. i walked out of the back porch to see what the plane looked like and i saw a triangle ufo i would say about 150 yards off the ground i would guess. it was extremely strange to me because i had never experienced any ufo activity before but i was not in a real tizzy because i thought it could be some sort of government black op plane because it wasn't flying that fast but almost looked like it was kind of gliding through the air. it had like a nuclear greenish orange light in each corner of triangle. i thought it was funny but was not overly concerned because it did not do anything that was out of this world, it was probably only flying about 30 or 40 mph, maybe less, almost like it was looking for something. 2 min later, i started to hear the same sound, like a jet plane, and automatically looked in the same spot the first one was, and flying at the same height, speed and direction was another triangle ufo but my mouth dropped. this one was exactly the same as the first except it had a glowing neon bluish spinning orb right in the middle! my heart was beating so hard because as soon as i saw the second one i knew something was weird about it because of the glowing orb. i was shocked and to be honest it was very scary to me. this thing has changed my life, i was never interested in ufo or aliens etc until jan 14 2011, i will always remember what happened because it was so unbelievable. one real funny thing was a little while after i looked up any kind of triangle ufo and the internet because i wanted to see if anybody else had seen or whatever and found a picture of something called the tr-3b. that is

the other to show him.  i was looking at these three stars in a row that curved like the handle of a dipper and before i could look for the pan part the first one started to grow brighter and brighter.  it was like it was on a dimmer switch and someone turned it up relatively slowly.  it got probably 10-15 times as bright as the other stars and then in a snap went back down to original brightness.  before i cound get the thought through my head that i had prob. seen a exploding star it started to move.  it moved about 3-4 inches in the sky from its original position and then was gone.  it took about 5-7 seconds to make that distance from my estimation. whether it went out or moved out of sight i cannot say but it was gone and a space left dark where i had just seen a star.

ready to make the bed when we both noticed the light and i said, you need to see this. we had noticed hours earlier that this starnge glowing orb was sitting in the distance over the rooftops of the houses to the west glowing a bright white light and then flickering in reds and a somewhat blueish green light. when we realized the light was traveling extremely fast to the northeast we ran to the window and kelly went to turn off the dryer to give us complete silence. i was looking through the window alone at this point and i saw the craft get to the corner of the window just in time to hear nothing...There was complete silence in the house and all we heard was the whoosing sound of the wind, no plane or aircraft has ever sounded like this, there was complete silence other than a very faint whoosh, as if the craft was slowing down over our house. i ran outside followed by my friend and i saw a diamond shaped craft just peaking over the rooftop. the craft had two red light to each side and two white lights on the front and back but from a distance the craft would blink between the red and the white lights. when the red lights were visible the white lights were not. but the other strange behavior of the craft is that as it grew closer it would jump forward in darkness before the red lights would be visible again. it looked as thought the craft was coming through pockets of time, disappearing and reappearing closer than before. the other identifying feature i noticed was that when the lights would turn off, it looked as though a star was still travelling towards us. then the lights would come back on and it would be an on and off with this star and the craft lights until it got closer.  \r\ni went outside just in time to see the underbelly of the craft which was dark and shadowy with a somewhat geometric design but it was so dark that i could not make out everything under the craft, but mostly it was a diamond with the four lights, when i saw the craft over the house every single light came on, reds and whites, it lit up the rooftops and then i watched the orb dart into the trees, only 100 feet above the rooftops and then when i had thought it dissappeared behind the trees and the nieghbors house next door i noticed that another bright orb was hovering on the left side of the house, one orb on each side probably a football field away but far enough that i had to walk a few feet to find the other orb on th eother side of the house. the first orb dropped so quickly in the sky, at a very very fast rate and the second orb hovered and then followed the first orb darting towrds the ground and then dissappearing along with the other orb. my friend was standing ten feet behind me during both and she was able to see the side view of this strange diamond craft before it was gone and she noticed the other orb instantly.\r\nmy friend and i drew a representation of what we saw and we could attach the file at a later date. we did not think to grab the camera because it happened so randomly and took us off gurad, we went running just to catch a better glimpse than what i saw from the window. the whole even took less than ten minutes and we were out on the other side of the street when we saw the craft dip below the houses.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":29006,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.622231,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05082011-0006","longitude":-105.0106398,"occurred":1304835240000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1304885336000,"summary":"A

(they were described to me as orange; i am partially colorblind), brilliant light rose from wnw horizon above the tree line (which is at just less than one handlength for me, so approx 8 degrees) in between nw facing corner of greenwood suites and s side of coulter house. i was positioned approx two feet n of room ten window. \r\norbs rose quickly, in fashion that appeared faster than typical plane speed. they were glowing like stars--or more closely, nearby planets like mars or venus, although they were even bigger than those--and did not like planes blink so much as shine and glow like distant fire. \r\nmost startling was their motion: as they ascended, they moved left and right, one after another. they at times came near each other's angular position but never truly crossed paths. when they began, the higher orb was just above and right of the lower one, no more than 45 degrees in relation to the lower one. as they moved left and right, the lower orb neared being direclty below or even on top of the upper orb. their left and right motions were similar in speed but not constant; an upward movement of one space right (or left) could be followed by a movement ofthree or four spaces left. \r\ntheir overall motion began between greewood suites and coulter, and ended roughly over the middle of coulter. at a height of around 3 to 3.5 handlengths (i did multiple handlength measurements during the event) the orbs began to fade, eventually disappearing as they rose into a deck of  mid to high level clouds (from my juggement, stratocumulus clouds, with some cirrostratus above and possibly altocumulus).\r\nthe sighting of the orbs elicited fantastic reactions by all involved;all were startled and engrossed instantly. photographs were obtained by a few people; i can

answer the duration of the event)\r\ni can say with full confidence that the two objects moved in ways dissimilar to any plane or flying object i have ever seen, and that their color, size and briallance was equally unusual. nonetheless, their movement was not incongruent with the possible motions of human aircraft. my friends who were witnesses are ecstatic right now, marveling about how they have sen a ufo and making claims about it being a non-human space craft, but i am assuring them that there is probably a basic, boring explanation. simply put: i can't explain what i

another light in a circular shape flashed and moved quickly across the same cloud in the same area.  i asked my wife to take a look and make sure i wasn't crazy.  i pointed to the area and immediatly another light of the same shape and size appeared and moved around through the cloud in an erratic manner.  at one point there were at least four lights moving simutaniously through the cloud in several directions.  the lights never left the shape of the cloud.  they just moved around it very quickly and in erratic patterns.  i am quite certain it was not lightning as there were not thunder clouds or sounds associated with the event, and it did not look like any other lightning event i have ever seen.  the lights moved in what my wife described as a strobe light effect.  they would come and go in several different directions and make circular patterns in the cloud.  this lasted until 11:09 pm when they suddenly stopped.  a few minutes later one light appeared to head east and there were no more flashes or objects.  my first thought was someone was shining several beams of light into the cloud like you would see at a hollywood event but there were no beams coming from the ground

there in 1997 in a travel trailer just below the intersection of lee canyon road and deer creek road. i was paid to keep an eye on the property of the late *(name deleted--cms/sg) by his trustees.I also worked a graveyard shift at the mt. charleston hotel and became familiar with the night sky. the halebop comet was clearly visible from my trailer. i watched the shuttle fly over when it prepared to land at edwards. i once saw a shuttle experment where they sprayed zenon into outerspace like a celestial deodorant. the laser from the luxor was clearly visable. everything had an explanation until that september night.                                                                      working the graveyard shift i listened to art bell's coast to coast and about ten days prior to my sighting art had everyone in his audience do a mind concentration experment to contact an alien spacecraft. i did it for a minute or two and forgot about it until three weeks later when the sighting occured. i played poker at the tables and was going home up the lee canyon road about ten o'clock at night. my window was down and my arm was out the window i looked up to my left there it was. it just drifted along like impulse power but i could see the stars through it. i pulled off the road and got out my eyes fixed on the object. it seemed enormous encompassing entire constellations and miles high but what struck me maybe the most was geometric rigidity all sharp right angles a perfect semicircle in front. i watched it drift toward the mountain peak for about an hour a couple of cars went by but it was black on black with the stars shining through no one else noticed. eventually i noticed the faintist red glow from the right angles and midway up the edge of the rectangle like a lit cigarette at night seen from a hundred yards. it just drifted across the stars and it was still drifting when i got back in my car and drove home about ten more miles. i never saw it again but it took me two or three days before i could tell anyone. i've tried to imagine it on the ground easily a mile long probably several. my guess is the faint red glows are antigravity generaters and it is bending the starlight around it.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

when getting out of my car i grabbed my laptop from the back seat and started to walk up my front yard. upon looking up at the night sky to admire the stars i noticed this bright blue orb up in the sky. thinking this is just a star i dismissed it rather quickly. after realizing that in my twenty years of living at this house, i have never seen a star this bright in the area. i glanced back up to observe it some more. when i looked back up into the sky (object was located south) this object started moving east at a steady pace across the sky. when this happened i dropped everything i was carrying and was screaming for my mom and sister to come out of the house to see this object. i tried to get my cell phone out to try and get a recording but the blue orb was moving to fast for me to get the video recorder opened up and it was soon about to disappear behind the trees which are located all around my house. my sister and mom came running out the house almost instantly after hearing me scream for fear i somehow hurt myself. i point to the blue orb and we stood out in the front yard all seeing the exact same thing. this object was a bright, light blue orb that was much larger than any of the stars in the night sky. this orb had a constant light never blinked or flickered like the air planes i see all the time in the night sky. the most significant thing about this light was that it made no noise at all. after about 3 minutes from when i first spotted it in the sky this blue orb was still heading east and now just barely visible threw the trees. once it wasn't in sight anymore we all went inside and i started asking my mother and sister about this orb while trying to find a video camera just in case it came back. i had no luck in finding one so i immediately called my friend nathan who lives just down the road from me to tell him all about this incident that just took place. while on the phone with him i was outside scanning every inch of the sky of any sign of this blue orb. at 10:13 pm still trying to explain what i had seen, i spotted another (or same?) blue orb but this was coming from south to north and was at a much farther distance compared to the first time i saw it. this second spotting had the exact same characteristic as the first spotting but was moving across the sky at a highly faster speed than the first one. the orb had disappeared almost as fast as it showed up. i was outside for the majority of the night but didn't see anything else out of the ordinary.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

nice night...I figured i would watch the skies for a few minutes...Hoping to see this same ufo i have seen on several occasions...Just felt the urge to go out there...So i went out there with her.  out of nowhere...Right in the clear sky...Close enough again to me...To actually startle someone...A very, very bright white orb flew right by me...Very low...If conventional...It was easily close enough to hear something, but as always...It was completely silent...Not even wind resistance...And not a satellite because towards the south there was a line of clouds and it was clearly below cloud level...As it started to make a sweeping turn. it was moving southwest...Right towards o'hare airport...So i am sure if modern radar picks these things up when i see them...They are aware that something was in the sky every single time i reported (see illinois database), i have never seen the object go in that exact direction...And it was without question...(no radar gun on it, but it appeared to be moving faster than i have ever seen before...But not as fast as a shooting star.  the orb suddenly started a long sweeping turn...And as it made that sweeping turn...It began flashing like a strobe light.\r\n\r\nwhether private experimental...Military experimental...I will give you that possibility...As long as you give me it is possible this craft was not of this earth...But whatever it was...Was under intelligent control.  it was not moving in a straight line...It was not way above the clouds...It was not a plane...And it was as bright as the sun.  i ran inside to grab my cameras, but could not get a good shot of it...But at least i saw it...And i have promised everyone that i will get seriously close up footage this summer. i am mad i did not have my camcorders out there...But i am also encouraged that once again...It came back like i predicted it would and it came seriously close to me again...This summer...At one point...I will be ready and get this thing on film again.  search you tube for ufo in hd if you wanted to see video of the object 2 miles away...But zoomed in.  it will be on page 7 of your you tube search.\r\n\r\nsatellites do not hover...They do not travel at low altitudes...They do not make turns...They do not shoot up into the stars...They do not shoot beams down at you...After careful consideration after all these experiences...I lean towards exotic experimental aircraft (military or private) and or it is not of this earth. not a ball of lightning, not a meteor, not the iss, not accelerated imagination, hallucinogenic drugs or alcohol, either.  once you see it...Anyone reading this will agree that it is not like anything you have ever seen in the sky in your entire life.  it is so low and so bright...But you have to be looking in that direction and get lucky...But if you just look up every now and then...You will eventually see what i am seeing and it is worth the wait...Trust me on this...Your heart will pump like crazy...It is a very exciting feeling to see it.  it is around...This sighting was late, but i have watched indiana, illinois, michigan, ohio and wisconsin on mufon and without question...People have seen this same exact object in the midwest.  \r\n\r\nthis thing is an awesome sight and right away...It is easy to see it is not a plane or helicopter or satellite or ball of lightning...It will eventually show you that it is not one of those things and that is the best part...It seems to do something different each time.\r\n\r\nlast night...Reconfirmed my gut feelings i have said months ago...That #1...I will see this object again...#2...It will come close to me again...And #3...I will get close up footage.  well...#3 will come later this summer and i am disappointed i did not have the cameras out with me...But when you see one for the first time...Trust me on this...Seeing is believing for you...So because it is so rare...Just be happy to have seen it...Each sighting usually last only a few seconds.  even if i had my camera...It would take a couple seconds to get it out of my camera bag...And turn it on.  so this summer...I am taking 3 camcorders out with me...All on tripods...Recording as i sit out there...Because when i go out there...They show up and it freaks me out too, trust me.  i have never ever seen one ufo in my entire life for 40 years. i would read stories and just be dying to see just one for a few seconds.  i wrote a screenplay all about dulce, new mexico and when that script was complete is exactly when i saw my first one.  i am disappointed i did not get good proof this time, but at least i got to see it again and i am seriously encouraged that this summer i will get the close up footage that i promised.  i swear i wish stanton friedman and james fox could just sit with me...Because i can show it to them, but i cannot promise to deliver it to you on one specific night...Everyone has to patient.  that is the problem.  last night...I did not even have to wait long at all, but i have waited for a while to see it some nights.  i know that sounds nuts, but once you see it...You will want to see it again...Hoping just one more time...For a few seconds.  it is always the most awesome sight imaginable...Better than the thrill of a meteor or comet because it is not just a flash...It is a bit slower.  that mercury ball foo - fighter theory in wwii...From those descriptions...This is exactly what i have seen and experienced.\r\n\r\ni am in park ridge.  i have said this many times...The way to see a ufo is to seriously go outside on a nice summer night and you have to patiently watch the skies.  you will see it for sure if you sit out from 8:30 pm to 11:30 pm in the chicago area.  many of my reports had multiple sightings and the same exact descriptions...Same exact times...Same exact directions.  if you put in just a little bit of time and star gaze...You will see your first ufo.  every single time you are outside this summer...Take a look.  it happens so fast...You will see how hard it is...To get it filmed...And that is frustrating...But you will just be happy to see it for a few seconds...It is amazing and it is so different from anything i have ever seen in my life.  i feel like it is not of this earth, but i cannot prove who is driving this thing.  i also have the feeling that on several occasions whatever was up there wanted me to see it.  i never saw it start flashing before last night...That was a first.  the last few times i saw it...Ended the argument that what i was seeing was a satellite reflecting light towards the earth.  that is not what i have seen.  it is so low and so bright...It is unmistakable.  i hope one person sees this...Follows my advice and you get to see this awesome white orb...It is big...It is clear as day...It is silent...It may stop...Lower altitudes and hover right over you...It even put a beam down upon my face once.  it got so close that time...That i ran back inside.  when it was that close (above 100 feet above the power lines), you could see structure and black framing and more details...Like some type of cockpit...Around what looks exactly like an electromagnetic glow...Black curved framing around a ball of lightning.  but before you cast me aside...Balls of lighting do not turn, hover, flash, shine a beam of light down and/or shoot into the stars like the fastest rocket ever created. someone is in this structured silent craft, but who is it?  is it human or not human is what you will say out loud or think when you see it...And if you put in just a little effort...In this area of the country...You will see it i can promise you that...You will see it and agree with every single word of this rambling novel.  this summer...Close up footage to come and i am more sure of that now because it was back last night.  i was thinking i might never see it again, but i just had a gut feeling i will continue to see it...It will continue to get close and this summer by god...I will get the footage to prove it.  it happens so quick it is hard to catch it...You will eventually see what i mean.  you have no time to run in and get the camera started...Etc. so...This summer...I am just going to record in 3 different directions towards the sky...And let them run for hours.  if i am out there...This thing seems to show up over and over and over again...But no one really cares, no one really listens and no one really puts in any effort to investigate or put the effort into seeing it for themselves.  at times...Like last night...It is frustrating, but other times...I am feeling like...Why should i bother to prove it and force people to believe me?  well...I am a nice guy and i wanted to share the experience.  i have photos too and multiple witnesses from my neighborhood and multiple reports to mufon where i went above and beyond to describe in full detail and provided video and photos to them...And nothing has been done. if someone spent some time with me...They would be able to see it.\r\n\r\nif people are serious about the study of ufo's...All you have to do is look up into the skies...In the midwest...If you spend the time to just look up at night...You will see it for sure and see that every word i said on this rant is 100% true.  i am not sure a skeptic would be able to explain this away...But they have to put the effort into seeing it instead of just discounting my report without seeing the same exact ufo in person themselves. put in the effort.  see it. experience it.  then and only then can you pass judgements.  photographic and video evidence...Even in hd...Is hard to match your own eyesight. the only way a skeptic can prove me wrong is if they have the same exact sighting of the same object at the same time.  they would have to agree that whatever it is...It is under intelligent control and that is absolutely clearly displayed.  when you see it...You will see what i mean...It gives off an other-worldly feeling and in some ways...Because it is silent...It is so spooky too.  you will see what i mean when you see it...Those of you that put in the effort will see it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:34","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":28992,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.6349349,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05072011-0008","longitude":-89.3930883,"occurred":1304665200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,

sleep the night before.From the east(to my right)a small white light with a ring around it came into my vision and moved west(to my left).It got to directly above coolangatta airport and slowed and appeared to stop momentarily and it then changed direction and went straight up(90 degrees)and moved so fast that it disappeared in a split second.I remember thinking \"what the f... was that\"? it was in my vision for something like 6-10 seconds.My eyesight was very sharp then and i locked onto it and didn`t look away at all for the whole time it was in my vision.\r\na few seconds after that i heard some jet engines rev up as a plane was about to take off.\r\nthis thing made no noise and was possibly somewhere between 1 and 3 kilometres high at the time. \r\ni felt a little spooked by it when i was in my room that night as i couldn`t explain what i had saw.\r\nsome years after that i watched the close encounters of the third kind movie and saw some objects on it that reminded me of the thing i saw.\r\ni know that nobody will be able to explain this thing but i will never forget it.\r\ni didn`t know of anywhere to report it nor thought that it would be smart to do so.\r\nbut

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On friday evening, may 6, 2011(at approx 20:45 edt), while sitting inside of a relative's home, located between the cities of princeton and bluefield, wv, i happened to look up through the picture-frame window of their southeastern-facing window, and noticed a very distinct, bright, slow-moving white light in the se sky (about 20 degrees or so above the horizon). at the time of the sighting, the (dusk) sky was only very lightly/thinly covered/contaminated with cloud cover, and consequently, this object was quite obvious and bright in the expansive sky. in fact, the cloud cover was so thin that there was absolutely no way the object could have been hidden by this very thin cloud cover (for any period of time), yet this object disappeared from the sky in less than one minute!\r\n\r\ninitially, i continually/unflinchingly watched this very bright white object move slowly, and somewhat erratically for about 45 seconds, and then immediately dashed into the next room to retrieve a pair of binoculars. however, by the time i had run to the bedroom to get them,  and then raced back into the living room (about 30 to 45 seconds later- \"tops\"), the object had completely disapeared out of the expansive, relatively clould-less dusk/night sky! ands \"again\", my view of the southern sky was vast, and essentially unobstructed. so how this strikingly luminous object in the night sky simply disappeared, seems to defy all rational (and seemingly, \"earthly\") explanation. and to be sure, after becoming aware that this craft/object had disappeared from the niught sky, i visually surveyed the entire night sky (continuously) for a couple of minutes (just to rule out the possibility of it being temporarily \"hidden\" by any cloud cover), however this very bright object (which was definitely much brighter than the stars in the sky), was \"absolutely nowhere to be found\".  \r\n\r\nfor the record, this object did not have any discernible faa beacon or strobe of any kind (at all). in fact, it had no flashing lights of any color (just a continual, bright-white, non-flashing, luminescence). as for the object's shape, it appeared to be somewhat oval or circular, although during its somewhat oscillatory movements, it did \"seem\" to occasioanlly, yet ever so slightly, \"morph\" into somewhat of a cylindrical-shaped object-especially towards the end of the sighting. \r\n\r\nfurthermore, and with regard to it's visual appearance/luminosity, one could compare or liken it to that of a cell phone tower, having a white-light (faa) beacon. i use this analogy here, as such a tower is, indeed, located on a distant peak, some distance east of the where this unidentified object was sighted. in fact, such a beacon light would seem to quite closely simulate the object i witnessed (if one were to view it from amile or so away)- i.E., in terms of it's shape, size and color, etc. but again, and to be sure, what i witnessed was clearly not a stationary cell tower beacon, located along some terrestrial ridge, but rather was clearly airborne, and positioned thousands (possibly tens of thousands) of feet in the air, and moving in a slightly erratic (almost oscillating) fashion through the sky. as to whether the object was moving vertically, or horizontally (e.G., in a se direction) could not be discerned in the short period of time (approximately 45 seconds) that i witnessed it, but it \"was\" clearly moving, and doing so somewhat slowly, and slightly erratically, and in somewhat of a constant direction. \r\n\r\nfurthermore, and for what it's worth, my vantage point (during this event)was approximately 2600 ft above mean sea level (msl), while the elevation of the distant mountain peaks (i.E., the wv/va border)- above which this object was positioned - ranged from between say 3000 and 3400 ft above msl. \r\n\r\nnow, although i've seen such objects quickly and inexplicably disappear in the eastern skies at this location in years past (while walking at night), the object i witnessed this particular evening was clearly the brightest that i recall witnessing, to date. suffice it to say, however, no conventional (i.E., \"non-black ops\") terrestrial-based aircraft could have achieved the departing speed in which this did (to so abruptly disappear from the night sky), but beyond that, no human being (presuming they were on board this particular craft), could have possibly survived the incredible g-forces this craft must have induced/underwent, when so abruptly departing the night sky, etc.\r\n\r\nso could this have been a \"black ops\" craft? an orbiting satellite? i seriously doubt it, given the craft's sudden and inexplicable disappearance from a very expansive, and nearly cloudless night sky. indeed, this is the first time i've ever reported such an event (as i'm not the type to do so), but this particular incident was just such an obvious, and thought-provoking incident, that i felt compelled to do so. as to whether others in this area witnessed this same craft or not - i have no idea.

north/south line, with me looking at the north/nw quadrant of the sky. looking at the stars as usual, after about 5 minutes, out of the corner of my eye i suddenly saw a group of fast objects which passed into my view. the lights were white with a hint of orange and all of them were steady, no blinking or alterations in the light. it's hard to say how many lights there were but at least 8-20 objects flying in very close proximity to each other in a triangle/boomerang formation. they moved faster than anything i've ever seen and quickly passed behind the roof of my house. but i was so astonished by the lights and their speed so i immediately stood up on the couch and was able to see them briefly again as they moved nw direction and disappeared again behind the roof of my house. i heard no noise that remotely resembled the sound of jet aircraft. the lights appeared to be multiple separate craft however they could have been multiple lights attached to one object, it moved by to fast to determine. i say that because what was extraordinary is that all of the objects appeared to move at the exact same speed, heading, and altitude in a close proximity. they moved in what appeared to be a straight planned out line and were not in my opinion, meteors, asteroids, or whatnot because of the many indications that they were under intelligent control. in my mind there are only two possibilities of what i saw: secret military operations or something not of this world. unfortunately it happened to fast to record visual
