come outside now. after he yelled that the second time, i realized that he wanted me to see something~sounded upset/nervous/a bit panicked. our (adult) daughter and i went to the back porch, at which point my husband yells: \"look up!!! what is that?!!!!\"\r\ni remember saying (yelling) \"oh my god ~ \"whoa!!!\". my daughter said something loudly/excitedly, but i don't remember what. the ufo was headed in the direction of our home from the west in a straight flight pattern. when it flew within close vicinity to us, it veered left (nne) and stopped. no sound were emitted from this ufo at any time. when it took the nne turn, i had to run to the back of our yard to see it because during that turn, a large, tall tree was blocking my view of it ~ same with our daughter. my husband remained seated in a chair on the patio. my daughter and i each had our cell phones and she began to take photos of the ufo. i watched the craft for approx. 5 minutes before taking photos. the colors surrounding the craft while looking at it with the naked eye were bright orangish/brownish/yellowish/whitish ~ \"dancing colors ~ not still. as well as changing shape along with the ufo changing shape intermittently.  the craft was boomerang shape, small oval shape, rod shaped ~ within a split second or eye blink, its shape changed, while remaining in the sky to the north of us, at about a 50 (?) degree angle. it felt as though the craft knew someone was watching and put on an extraordinary display of light, flight, trajectory, speed, etc.  ~ and being flown / directed beings far in advance mentally of any human beings on earth. (as far as i know.)  \r\n\r\nnote:  i witnessed an extremely large \"oval/shaped\" ufo up close many years ago while attending university, but that ufo was entirely different in shape, size, etc. seeing that craft at the age of 18, changed my \"mind\" forever ~ and have always known we're not alone, so i wasn't shocked by this latest craft sighting :). \r\n\r\nthis ufo, seen/watched on july 16, 2017, was extraordinary, as well.  the craft looked different through the cell phone camera than it did after the craft left and i finally looked at my photos of it. all of the colors witnessed with my eyes and through the cell phone camera were mostly gone.  was very surprised at that!  \r\n\r\nnote: ( also ~ the battery on my cell phone, after taking tons of photos and a short video of the ufo, used zero battery!?!?)  \r\n\r\nsame thing happened with the photos our daughter took of the ufo ~ loss of color in her photos. \r\n\r\nat no time did i feel scared nor threatened by this ufo.  quite the opposite ~ felt peaceful and in awe of someones so far in advance of humans.  that's the same way i felt the first time seeing the extremely large and very close up ufo while attending university (that one was a sunny, in broad daylight sighting.)  the ufo i sighted, along with my daughter, husband and our dog, moved at times gracefully.  other times it moved erratically ~ flying back and forth or up and down. it was fascinating to watch and wish the ufo would've stayed much longer!!!\r\n\r\nthe ufo left (disappeared) after remaining in the same general area in front of us for approx. 20 minutes. when the craft left, it did so in one blink of the eye. one second in sight, the next second, just not there - disappeared.  i'm (we) remain thankful that we witnessed, what i believe, to have been a craft, flown by living beings, from another planet, galaxy or in my opinion ~ another universe. \r\n\r\nplease excuse typos, etc. i'm still not used to these tiny keyboards! \r\nthank you, mufon, for your dedication of the extraordinary!!!! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:22:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":85249,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.854265508287725,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07212017-0016","longitude":-84.21613336390125,"occurred":1500241440000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1500645782000,"summary":"Craft flew at high speed from w, turned ne, \"stopped\"above/in front of us. while in front of us, craft changed shape & direction many times.

they said that they could not tell me. i asked them, why? they said that they were going to make me forget everything that happened with them. so i said, so if you are going to make me forget, then why not tell me? there were two greys working with me and they said that they would have to ask their commander for permission to tell me. so they went over to their commander, who was a tall alien who looked similar to them but was about as tall as me, 6' tall. they asked him if they could tell me. he said that they could but not to tell me everything, and to make sure that i was made to forget this whole episode. the two little greys seemed almost excited to tell me. they said that their propulsion system uses magnetic repulsion. i said that my dad thought that magnetic repulsion could be made into a propulsion system, and i had a picture in my mind as to what my dad had explained to me. the aliens said, no. the magnetic repulsion must be redirected so that the reaction is cancelled out against itself. i did not really understand so i dropped it. then they took me back to the car and took out our friend who was sitting behind \"j\" and put me in his seat behind j. when our friend returned, they took out my brother and put our friend in the seat my brother was occupying. my brother was gone a long time, over 40 minutes. i started to worry that they would not bring him back to the car. i was thinking, what would i tell my mom and dad if they kept him. i loved him and i was seriously worried because it was taking so long. finally they brought him back and put him in the front passenger seat. they then told us we could go. j started the car and turned around on the field and got back onto the road and we headed back towards edmonton. as we were travelling up the gravel road the aliens were still speaking to us telepathically, saying, you will forget what just happened here. i could hear what the others in the car were thinking. they were thinking \"i won't forget\", but i was thinking \"i will remember\". i could tell that the others were starting to forget and as they did, i could no longer hear what they were thinking. but i could still hear the aliens and i kept saying, i will remember. i said that i was going to tell my parents and the police and the local radio and tv stations, and everyone at school. this entire conversation was telepathic. so then the aliens said, if you do not forget then we will make \"j\" turn the car around and we will keep your brother. i was initially shocked. they had obviously picked up on my fear of losing my brother and tried to use that against me. but i felt that they were bluffing and since i was now sitting right behind \"j\", i said that i would put a choke hold on him and make him either keep going or i would take over control of the car and take us home. so then they said that \"okay, you can remember, but not until you are an old man\". i made the mistake of asking, how old? it became a negotiation with them starting at 65 and me starting at two days. we settled at age 36. then suddenly i just forgot what had happened. someone in the car said, what were those white balls in the sky? then someone else (i think that it was the aliens planting this idea) said, it must have been ball lightning. that idea is crazy because it was a totally clear prairie evening without a cloud in the sky. when we arrived home we had no recollection of the party that we were supposed to attend, nor how we ended up in different seats from when we left. when i turned 36, that day, the alien encounter came flooding back to me, what had happened when i was 17. i phoned my brother and asked him what he remembered of the day when we saw ball lighting. he said that he remembered \"j\" pulling into the field and turning off the car. that was all he remembered. later, when i tried to bring up the topic with my brother, i could see the hairs stand up on his arms and he got very agitated and said that he did not want to talk about it.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"03:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":85246,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":53.4952264,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-07212017-0013","longitude":-113.5354936,"occurred":21411300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alberta","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1500636349000,"summary":"Followed ufos on prairie. the large one landed in a field. we were taken, individually into the craft.

","country":"US","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This extraordinary event of  late at night on friday, july 21st, 2017 on a hill by the lake at the saddleback lake lodge in dallas hill plt. near rangeley, me. a quiet, remote, and peaceful location. my family rents a cabin on this lodge every summer and have been doing so for as long as i can remember. members of my extended family rent adjacent cabins. there is a central field with an elevated, grassy hill just up from the lakeshore and in front of the central cabins and right next to the one i was staying in at the time. here there is an old stone fire pit and several wooden tables. myself, my father, two aunts, two uncles, and several cousins were all standing around here firepit area and talking. the night sky in this area is especially breathtaking in this area, with thousands of stars brightly visible. this was a very clear, cool, quiet and starlit night and i had been seeing shooting stars on the preceding nights. the time was roughly 11:50pm, my eyes had been glanced skyward at the view for a few minutes. one of my aunts pointed to a shooting star and i went to look and missed it but kept my eyes on that area of sky anyway hoping to catch another one (and i'm sure others did as well) it was at this moment out of the corner of my field of vision i noticed an object, far brighter and perspectively larger than any star or planet visible or that i have ever seen. this object was bright, white, and brilliantly shining, much more prominent than anything else in the sky. we all noticed it within seconds. the object appeared circular, oval, or possibly egg shaped but it's shaped was vaguely defined as it was so bright. it appeared to be expanding as it slowly moved and simultaneously grew more brilliant, i wasn't sure if the object itself was shifting in shape to or if this was simply light that it was generating or reflecting. i estimated that it appeared around 20 times larger than the largest surrounding stars, and many times brighter. it appeared white like a brilliant spotlight but was much different in nature. the ufo seemingly  grew to the point where it made a slight flashing or pulsating action before it began to gradually dim and shrink, it continued to move in its slow path of orbit to the north. at this moment another shooting star shot by to the southwest while the object was in sight. the objects movement and appearance were much different than the meteoroid. the object continued on its trajectory and gradually dimmed and shrank until it appeared about the size of the surrounding stars and now it appeared to be a more orangish/greenish color, it was visible for over 20 seconds max before it disappeared amongst the vast volume of stars and i lost sight of it. the object, whatever it was, was likely outside of earths atmosphere as it moved at a similar (albeit slightly faster) rate of speed as a satellite and maintained a similar trajectory. we all continued to watch the sky hoping for the bizarre objects reappearance as we all discussed what it possibly could have been. approximately 10 or so minutes later (and within a minute of two of midnight) the amazing sight returned. i was the first to spot it and immediately notified everyone. there was the bright light, now northeast of its original location and possibly at a farther distance from my vantage point as it appeared marginally smaller than before. however it was traveling in the same direction. once again it gradually expanded and grew in brightness and intensity as we stood in awe. and then again it made a subtle flashing notion before gradually starting to dim and fade away from my view before disappearing. now even more baffled and perplexed by the incredible and puzzling sight i began to scan the night sky. i did not catch sight of the object again however about 15 minutes later i noticed a very sudden and quick flash over the trees across the nearby dirt road. i am unsure if this was related to the brilliant light we witnessed shortly before. i am a lifelong aviation enthusiast and an aspiring pilot and air show announcer and often have my eyes directed towards the sky on any given day. 95+% of the time i am able to identify what i see and rarely do i have no idea regarding the identity of something i see. i can assure you that this unidentifiable object was not a star given it's movement, not a satellite as i have seen those in the night sky before (including several other on the nights leading up to the incident and the night itself) and they usually just appear as looking like a dimmer, moving star. also this object reappeared in a different area of the sky about ten minutes after first being spotted and possibly at a greater distance and i have\r\nbeen told that it takes 4 hours or more for a satellite to orbit the earth and it always passes by in the exact same section of sky as before. also i don't think satellites can generate light, let alone one powerful and brilliant as what i witnessed and it they can reflect light i doubt it can be seen from that great a distance or make the object appear several times larger. i saw several shooting stars including one while the object was in view and they have entirely different characteristics of movement, often being blink and you'll miss it quick occurrences while the object/light was in clear view for over 20 seconds. however the color and brightness of a larger shooting star would be comparable to that of the ufo. i am certain that it was not any man made aircraft or drone as it possessed no blinking navigational or landing lights, emitted absolutely no sound whatsoever and appeared to be outside the atmosphere. i have been coming to this area in maine my entire life and have seen numerous interesting sights in the sky. from unbelievable meteor showers to fireworks on saddleback mtn. to multiple satellites. i've seen chinese fire lanterns and weather balloons before which do not resemble what i saw, i have seen a kc-135 tanker refueling a massive c-5 galaxy transport at lower altitude around sunset in the area and countless military, commercial, and general aviation aircraft at varying altitudes and am extremely skilled at identifying the specific types. i've seen the iss (international space station) pass over on two occasions, once over moosehead lake in 2010, and another time at camp roosevelt in 2015 and recognize it as being a reddish colored light slightly larger in appearance but similar in movement and nature to a satellite and is noticeably different. with the knowledge i have attained i have always been somewhat skeptical of then ufo phenomena but have remained interested in it but have only on a few occasions seen objects that i cannot identify but this instance has left me very shaken and puzzled as i have absolutely no explanation for what i have seen. i continued to watch the sky until 1:30am but did not see the object again, i decided to write this report as soon as i could while the memory was still fresh in my mind and all the details intact. i will continue to watch the night skies for the remainder of the week. please do something to investigate this sighting as it involved multiple individuals who all witnessed and described the same exact sequence of events and appearance of the object itself, also look into other sightings that were submitted on the same day in the same state or immediate area and see if the descriptions correlate. i stand by that this was one of the most bizarre and bewildering things that i have ever witnessed.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

14 years old starting on the day before thanksgiving (nov. 24 2004) in leesport, pennsylvania. i have decided to go public about the terrifying things that have happened.\r\n\r\nit was a strange day on nov. 24 2004, i caught glimpse of a tv show talking about a man who can practically\r\n\"summon\" ufo's... i was skeptical, even at a young age, but thought that since it was my own voice inside of my\r\nown head, that it would save me the embarrassment if i gave it a try. i basically asked to meet the pilots of these\r\nstrange craft, and to learn about the vehicles and how they work. a couple of hours later i was shocked to see a report\r\non a separate channel, a news channel, that there was a ufo spotted over reading, pennsylvania, only minutes from where we\r\nlived at the time. a few hours later in the middle of the night, i had been awakened, terrified by two alien beings, commonly referred\r\nto as \"the grays\" standing in front of me, staring at me at my bedside. i don't know how they did it, but they had woken me up telepathically some how. \r\ni clearly remember the red capital letters \"wake up\" flashing before my closed eyelids, and an alarm like buzzing inside of my head in an\r\nintense vibration. it woke me up immediately, and when i saw them in front of me, one that was closer to me was much taller than the other.I had immediately panicked, throwing the blankets over myself and trying\r\nto calm my respiration and heart rate, i waited and waited for them to leave. it was sheer terror, and the scariest night of my life. i heard feet rustling on the carpet, and as daylight began to break, i took a  cautious peek\r\nto see that they had left.\r\n\r\na few nights later, i had an urge to watch television on a late school night. my stepmom used to hide the remote in a office drawer in the kitchen. i'm not sure what had caused the urge to watch tv at such an odd hour, i suppose i was still shaken from a few nights prior. i had come to notice that the remote was nowhere to be found in the drawer, so i had looked around the counter top, turned around and skimmed the counter top of the kitchen island, only to see the same creature from nights before standing outside of the kitchen window, staring at me. startled, i must have jumped 3 feet in the are and ran out of the kitchen and up the steps to my bedroom. that same night i had a strange and vivid nightmare of my blankets being lifted into the air and being dragged out of my bed by the ankles by the hands of two shorter grays, then being returned to my bed and watching them leave through a strange pink portal in the wall.\r\n\r\ni am now an artist/painter, and i've attached an image of a digital drawing depicting what i have seen on the nov. 24th night.","distance":"20

19:28. it was a cloudless, clear, and sunny day. at mile marker 35 i noticed a small object directly in front of me at a 45 degree angle. what made me notice the object was how reflective it was. the object was hovering and stationary. when i first saw the object i thought that's a really weird plane. as i looked at it longer i could tell it was not any type of airplane i knew of. i pointed out the object to my 10 year old son who was sitting in the front seat of my car and he saw it as well. we watched the object for about 1 minute when it suddley vanished. it did not make any noise or leave any type of exhaust. once the object vanished in front of my son and i we were very excited that we had possibly seen a ufo. i told him the first thing i had to do was make a report to mufon. i made note of the time and our location.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

car driver saw bright light about 30deg.Up and about 10mi.Away.The light went strait down out of sight about 30sec.Them strait back to same spot first seen.It didn't move for a few min.It started moving strait toward us very slowly,me and army buddie thought it was a helicopter ,we all 4 got out of car going to front of car for best view,when it got to far side of lake,about 150yrds away,we thought we should start hearing the blades and motor,it had one large round light in front;as it got closer we saw its shape,from light in front to the rear its shaped like teardrop about three school busses long at wide point at rear about three school busses and at rear in the rounded corners looked like 4 little circles of a blue flame ,torch like looking.It was flat on bottom and black.It went directly over my right shoulder keeping same speed and height until it went out of sight.It made no sound and as it went over us i had a feeling that whatever it was didnt worrie about us seeing it like we are nothing to it.My army buddie told me we can't tell anyone about what we just saw because we could lose our top secret security clearances and possibly get kicked out of seventh group,we were both radio operators.So now that we are both out can i tell our sighting","distance":"101-500
