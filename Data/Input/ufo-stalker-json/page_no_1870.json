the road to watch. it was a bright orange light with an aura i would say, shooting straight up, fast. then at a certain point it decided to take off to the left at a ridiculous speed. at that time it's light was going on and off. then it would shoot straight up again eventually vanishing into the sky. i never thought i'd see it again, but i was wrong. on my way home to dundee tonight i saw the same exact orange light shooting straight up. i couldn't believe it, right away i call my buddy to tell him. then i go to look at it but couldn't see it. so i look back at the road and there it is traveling at another high speed to the other side of dundee. that is when i happened to be driving through town and saw the group of people watching the same thing. i rushed home quickly to see it headed towards monroe. with the object shutting its light off finally. then out of nowhere comes either a plane or a jet (i believe jet) and starts to follow it. whatever the object was though quickly took off and disappeared. i'm just hoping to get some answers here. thanks! \r\n\r\nside notes: both times i was driving. what made me notice the object was looking in the sky which i tend to do a lot and saw it shooting straight up. when i first noticed i realized it was a ufo since never seeing anything like it. my feeling is shocked, surprised and wanting to know what it is.","distance":"501

the exact year when we seen a ufo. it was in the summer, i had been fishing with my brother-in-law \"bo\" (who is now deceased) it was in the evening as we were on our way home on dairy road near the town of rising sun.  i lived on dairy road and was only a couple of minutes from home when i spotted the ufo.  as we were going down the road there was a field on my left and across the field there were two hills seperated by a valley, as we were moving something caught my eye coming from the vally between the hills. i turned my head to the left and seen the front of the ufo moving about 3 feet of the ground and going about 1 mile per hour (just moving really slow) i told bo 'look at that\".  i stopped in the road and we watched it move real slow compelety out into full view.  as we were setting there watching it move, all of a sudden it stopped and was about 3 feet off the ground.  i guess the size of it about 50 feet across and about 20 ft. high.  it was really big.  it made no sound and the color was a dirty silver. when it stopped i got the feeling that it didn't want to be seen.  when it stopped it set there about 3 seconds and than moved straight up about 20 feet and stopped again.  thats when i thought we may be in big trouble but at that moment when it stopped it was like a rocked blasting off, fire came from beneath it about 5 foot circle and still made no sound.  after it took off we only seen it for about 300 feet and it disappeared and was gone.  the distance from us was within 200 yards so we got a really good view of it.  there were no windows that i could see or any markings.  i would say the whole thing from start to finish took about 90 seconds. the thing that we were not able to figure out was it was evening when we seen the ufo and only lived a couple of minutes down the road but didn't get home till after dark. plus we never thought to tell anyone about it. we just forgot about it.\r\nit was a strange experience.  i have seen many other ufo's but that one was up close.

same position.  we could see them with the telescope.  the first one was circular in shape and had 2 rings of flashing lights.  they went from green/blue/white.  it reminded us of those \"chasing\" christmas lights.  the colors were very vivid, and we could definitely see two separate circles of lights - one inside the other.  it kept moving east-west, but we were able to capture it on video.  i couldn't find my tripod, but put my samsung point & shoot up to the eyepiece of the telescope and captured it that way.  it moved towards the horizon, as we kept having to move the telescope to see it.  the second one was more at the 12:00 -1:00 position in the west, and there was some broken clouds, but we did get to see that one in the telescope too.  this one flashed red/orange/yellow, and the lights were in 2 lines - both running east-west, and north-south on the object.  this also moved towards the horizon and seemed further away then the first one.  i did capture this one on video too, although it is not as clear as the first one.  this 2nd one moved faster too.  it also dipped below the horizon after about 30 minutes.  we live about 12 miles from the gulf of mexico and north of tampa.  two of our neighbors were here tonight and observed the objects too.  when i saw these on may 1, i checked on the internet to see if there was a satellite or something that could explain what these objects were.  i even checked the flight paths of aircraft - even though we both knew that there was no way these were aircraft.  they looked almost stationary, but with the telescope we could see how they moved tonight.  none of us have ever seen anything like these objects before.  i am attaching the video of the first object.  please note that you can't see anything until about a minute into the video.  we were setting up the telescope because the object had moved again.

blue sometimes.  it is hard to describe the shape as the object is about 2 miles away.  it's movments are unlike any conventional air craft.  it seems to hover low on the mountain side and can change diretion effortlessly.  my cousin and i once witnessed (our first sighting) a dim orange light appearing and disappearing on the ridge line, then it lit up very bright whitish blue, and stared moving very erraticly, almost like it couldn't stay still.  it also seemed to jump from one spot to another instantly like a quarter to half mile from where it was. from the research i've done on other peoples sightings and belief's the craft definetly seems to be using some sort of anti-gravity technology. after observing the first sighting for over 30 minutes we were a litle freaked out and left.  i wish i hadn't now i go back several times a month hoping to see it again.  althogh we do see unidentified light's almost every time we havent seen anything like the first sighting. usally it's one

was about to head to bed, i decided to go outside for a cigarette. i went to my front door and lit up. i looked up to the sky and saw what i believe was a ufo which hovered above downtown saskatoon. i couldn't get over how big it was. i took reference points from various places like trees and a condo unit that is 500 plus meters from my front door. my best estimate was that this ufo was at least 6 stories high and looked to me from the distance it appeared to be away from me to be at least a mile wide to two miles in length. i remember thinking how beautiful it was. the underside was extremely clear and my focus was on the designs that were underneath. they seemed to be mayan or even egyptian designs. with gold or silver trim and black fill the design looked to be some sort of maze. i looked to figure the size of this craft which filled the sky. my reference points were two trees and suggested this was at least a couple of miles wide and by the distance it seemed to be away from me (one mile) this craft was at least as tall as the condo block which it hovered over. it stretched from the condo block as far as my eye could see. then the ufo flew straight up to space. there was no noise, no recognizable power source it seemed more like some kind of anti gravity propulsion that took it away at an extremely high speed. i was fascinated to see whether the craft would have some heat trail as it left the atmosphere yet there was nothing it just disappeared into the stratosphere. \r\nthe strangest thing for me was what happened after the event. i went into my house and immediately forgot i'd seen a ufo. it wasn't until two days later when i went out for a smoke at roughly the same time when i looked up to the sky and my brain clicked 'oh that was where the ufo was' then i nearly fell over in disbelief that i could forget even for a couple of days such an experience. i spent the next day going over in my mind what had really happened. maybe it didn't happen, maybe it was a dream, maybe i'd had some kind of memory wipe or something, after much deliberation i came to the conclusion that this was a real event, i then told my wife and posted on facebook, hoping someone else would have seen it. nothing came back, no sightings. i have an idea that this and many other ufo's use some kind of cloaking device or even mind manipulation to reduce sighting occurrences. i don't know all i do know is this craft was the most beautiful thing i'd ever seen.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

through the window from the direction of our driveway.  i waited for a car door to open and close as i thought we had a unexpected guest, but no one had come. i called to my husband to see if anyone had come and he said no.\r\n  a minute later i saw a strange light through the other bedroom window off in the distance.  i was watching it because it was doing very strange things.  it was making geometic type movements in the sky like circles, triangles, etc. we lived near an airport but this light was not behaving as an airplane would behave.\r\n  i got out of bed and sat by the window to watch and called my husband in to see this.  as we sat there watching it it came closer to the house. now it appeared as a very bright white -yellowish light, almost too bright to look at.  at this point it was about 200 feet from the house hovering just above tree top level.  there was a lone tree in the field next to the house that enabled us to judge it's size and distance accurately. it appeared to be close to the tree and just above it. \r\n  as we sat there watching it it emitted a search light rotating around on the ground and the area as though it were looking for something. as the light came around it shown right into our bedroom window.  it made quite a number of rotations.  we looked at each other in disbelief. at this point we decided to run ouside to get a better look.\r\n  it was cold and still, not even the slightest breeze.  i could hear the traffic from the highway which was a mile away.  the night sky was crystal clear. we lived in the country on a dead end road far from city lights.  we had a very clear veiw of the sky since we lived on the top of the highest hill the county. we often sat outside at night to look at the sky and watch the stars.\r\n  the craft made no sound of any kind. i felt no moving air from it. if it had been a helicopter we would have been deafened by the noise and barraged with dust and air  from the propellers at that close range.\r\n  as it hovered, it was getting less bright and we could make out more details of the craft. it was disk shaped with a higher area on the top. there were red lights or windows around the top part. as we watched it we could see more details. the red lights looked more like windows with a red light inside it like a dark room that photographers use.  i could see five or six silouhetted human like figures inside it moving around. some of them seemed to be looking at us as we looked at them.  the under side of the craft remained faintly glowing with the white yellow light.\r\n  i would judge the size of the craft to be about 50 feet in diameter.  it would have fit into our driveway area between the house and the barn.\r\n  it just hovered there like that for at least 20 minutes. \r\n  we could have walked right under it, but we didn't. it did not make any threatening movements or noises. i never felt any sense of danger.\r\n  after about 20 minutes of watching it, another disk appeared from behind our house. it looked just like the first one. it was hovering moving very slow and close to the ground, below tree top level. the two of them hovered next to our house for several minutes then moved very slow down into the valley below tree level. they disapeared from our sight behind the trees in the valley. we didn't see them again.\r\n  i was flabbergasted and elated at the same time with our experience.  i wanted to report it to someone, but who would  even believe us.  i had not heard of mufon yet. the next day i called the airport and spoke to an air traffic controller and asked them if they had seen anything on the radar that night.  the man told me he couldn't relate any information about what they see on the radar to the public, even if they saw something unusual he could not talk about it. his response was worded in a way that led me to beleive that they did indeed see something on the radar but could not disclose the information. \r\n  i did not report it to the police.  i didn't think they would write a report on it.\r\n  even though i was reluctant to dicuss what we had seen with other people, over the next few days i broached the subject with 3 of our neighbors.\r\n  the first was our landlord who lived next to us and i figured if he was awake he must have seen something that night.  he was not at all surprised at my story and said that he often saw ufo's in the valley over the years.  he had been living at that house all his life since it was a family farm that had been in the family for 3 generations.  he was 72 years old and was a good resource of information about anything local. he was a credable witness, but he said he didn't see anything that night.\r\n  we did have a lengthy discussion about the ufo's he had seen in the past.  it was pretty much the same thing as we had seen, and he added that he had on several occasions found burn circles in the crops. \r\n   he said that most of the neighbors around there knew about the ufo's and were ok in talking about it. it was sort of a local rite of passage with new people moving into the area. all the old timers in the area were quite familiar with the phenomenon.\r\n  another neighbor who i frequently went horseback riding with said that it hovered over their house for an hour late that night. they had previous experiences with the ufo's also.  \r\n  the third person i talked to about it,was a friend who lived down the road.  they knew about the sightings, but were determined that they wanted nothing to do with it.  they were born again christians and seemed to be very threatened by the experiences.\r\n  two years later we moved due to economic conditions.\r\n  over the years i have talked about our experience with many different people. some are eager to relate their own ufo experience, most are skepticle.  i learned very quickly to use caution and to feel people out before relating the whole story to them.  many people still regard ufo experiences as bunk or ridicule it.\r\n  it may not count for much relating this experience so many years after the fact, but it has always been in the back of my mind.  i always had a fascination with the idea of ufo's as a child growing up in the sixties.\r\n  there were books and stories about it and i held a open minded interest in it as i became an adult.  i have always been glad that i had this experience because i know i am not crazy or hallucinating or making it up.\r\n   i wish i had pictures but we didn't have a very good camera that night. i was too mezmerized by the experience to want to take a picture.  pictures would have been inconclusive any way. it would have shown the bright light but nothing else.\r\n  i don't know if i can find too many people from that area to corraborate my story except for my husband.  we are now divorced but i do know where he lives and he does talk about the experience.\r\n  we don't live at that address any more, but i have gone by there from time to time.\r\n  it would not surprise me if there where still sightings in that area.\r\n  the uniqueness of the geography of that area could be the reason for the sightings.  the location is the highest point in the county with a very large valley on the southern side.  the valley has no houses in it since it floods every spring.\r\n  when we lived there we had many storms that produced unusual lightening effects. we where often surrounded by balls of lightening and such intense lightening i would not answer the phone during a storm because the lightening would travel through the lines and ring the phone during storms.  i have never experienced such intensity of lightening anywhere else. i was even struck by lightening in the house one day during a storm. thankfully it was not severe and did no lasting harm.\r\n  i also believe that native american people who used to live there had a burial site there.  the neighbors found many artifacts there.  the area had unusual geography and history and i always felt that there was something different that set it apart from other places i have lived in. there are also high power lines that run over the top of that hill.\r\n  the farm we lived on where we had the ufo experience was located on pleasant valley rd. near winchester ,wi. west of neenah.  we lived on the dead end of the road over looking the valley. it was a beautiful place to live back then.  i know that there have been subdivisions built in the area since then.  i don't know if the old farm is still there.  it was owned by leslie dobbie, who is now deceased. he was our next door landlord at the time.  the other neighbors names i have forgotten.\r\n  i had many unusual dreams and clairvouant experiences while living at that address, but i never recalled any abduction experiences. \r\n   it was a life changing experience for both of us. since then, i have never viewed life or the world we live in with ambivilence.  it made me more aware of my planet and my place in the cosmos.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

twinkling between the bare branches of a tree across the street.  i knew right away it wasn't a plane, because it did not have the red and green lights a plane does, and it wasn't moving at the steady speed of a plane.  i did notice that it was moving, however.  the air was still, no wind or breezes, so the tree branches were not swaying in any way, and the twinkling lights were gradually moving left from one branch to another, then up.  \r\n\r\ni asked my roommate if he was seeing what i was seeing, and he confirmed that there was definitely something in the sky moving unlike a normal aircraft.  it was bright, and the lights were very defined (red, white, blue, purple, possibly orange) and the twinkling seemed to actually be the light rotating in a disk formation.  i looked more steadily at the object and realized that one set of lights was rotating horizontally; there was another set of lights moving vertically, and both were part of the same object.  it moved slowly, very slowly, and my roommate used this in comparison to the tree we were looking through to figure out how big the object actually was.  the sky was clear, however, so this was very difficult to determine.  he did see the rotation of the lights and again confirmed what i saw.\r\n\r\nwe debated on reporting this but considering it could be the international space station, we decided to leave it alone.  upon further research i discovered that the iss does not have rotating lights like the object we saw, and this stuck in my mind for the next few weeks.\r\n\r\nlast night we were outside again and both of us saw the exact same object in the sky, but significantly lower in its placement (not in the tree but above a coniferous bush-like tree that is approximately 4 feet shorter and 3 feet to the

late. i was on main st that runs parallel to hwy 11w i was stopped at  a 4 way stop. i was going to make a left to enter hwy 11w, this interchange is in alignment with an entrance to what was then called holston army ammunition plant, now bae, it makes high explosive for the military. so when i looked left to begin the turn a bright white light in the sky caught my eye,it was over the ammunition plant grounds, i thought it was a helicopter, then it dropped slightly and accelerated out of sight kinda going right at an angle like a check mark, that happened instantly. it was almost instantly gone. that made my jaw drop.  the way i remember the light was bright white like led are today, and was round looking. i didn't see a craft. the best thing i can think of to describe the maneuver is check mark shaped. the sight didn't scare me, i thought i just saw a ufo, i am an open minded person so that was pretty cool. \r\n   i know that wasn't much of a sighting, i hesitated to even mention it but as i listened to other descriptions of sightings over military interests, i realized that others had seen them at about the same time frame. \r\n

come up over the horizon in the night sky.  it was around 10:30 pm, and i didn't say anything to my friend at first because i thought it might be a distant plane.  but then another orb appeared behind the first one and i told my friend to look up.  we started watching and another one appeared and another one.  they moved very slow and steady. they were traveling approximately from the south to the north.  they looked like orange balls of light, like they were on fire.  i picked up my phone and called another neighbor and said come out in the yard right now.  he came out and the three of us witnessed a series of about 10-12 orbs following each other across the sky.  they made no noise at all.  it was really weird.  after awhile they seemed to get more distant and more dim.  it looked like they were burning out, one after the other, or disappearing.  after a few minutes there was a second series of four or five more that followed the same path.  i have never seen anything like that before.  i called a local television station and reported it.  they said no one else had called.  today i called and reported it to the charlotte observer.  the lady i spoke with said she had not received any other reports.  i feel frustrated because i know other people had to have seen what the three of us had seen.  these balls of light were floating very low in the sky, right over the city.  wish i had a video camera and could have recorded it.  the whole event lasted about ten minutes.  i hope other people will send in reports to document the same event we saw.
