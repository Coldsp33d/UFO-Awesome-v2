westerly formation, within the middle of the city of norwich, united kingdom.\r\n\r\nas i was walking along king st heading in the direction of the waterfront (a club next to the river wensum) with friends, heading in a south-westerly direction, i looked up and saw 9 lights heading west at rapid speed in 2 separate groups. the night sky was hazey, and it was hard to make out even the brightest stars, such as venus or polaris. there was 2 distinct formations, one consisting of 3 lights, and a larger group, which had five but was joined by a sixth, that was further north than the smaller group and was of similar appearence in colour, both of which headed in a westerly direction, out towards the north sea, over the norfolk broads. the light that joined the larger group, performed a sharp right turn, about 30 degrees turn, to formate with the larger group. all the lights appeared whiteish amber in appearence. due to distance, i was unable to tell what the lights were.\r\n\r\nthe smaller group, which appeared more southerly out of the 2, appeared in a v formation, with one lead light leading, and the other 2 behind and to the left and right, similar to a vic formation used by pilots. the larger, more northerly group, originally had 5 lights, in a pyramid-looking formation, with a lead light, then 2 behind on the left and right, and then 2 behind them with one on the outher left and another to the right of that but in the middle. a sixth light headed towards this group and turned sharply in an un-natural fashion to take a place in the back of the group, on the right hand point of the pyramid. as norfolk is over-flown by both us air force and royal airforce fighter jets, the turn performed by light to join with the formation was aggressive, and a distinct change of direction as opposed to a gradual turn that would be made by military jets (i have witnessed eurofighter typhoon and boeing f-15 eagle fighter planes perform dact (disimilar air combet maneuvering) in the skys in both day and night). the 2 formations headed in a westerly direction, over the broads and out to the north sea. the event lasted for about 15 seconds as the lights deminished rapidly. when i alerted my friends to what i witnessed, no one had looked up and spotted the lights. and as i tried to direct their view to where i has seen the lights, no one was able to see any lights\r\n\r\nas an aviation enthusiast (or plane spotter to put it in laymans terms), i can tell between military ,commercial, and civilian aircraft at day and night. on a saturday, it is very rare to have military jets flying, let alone at night and over a major uk city. flying operations out of norwich airport would have stopped by that time of night and although comercial airliners fly over norfolk, none would fly in formation, let alone join up with a group of planes at night. although i have no way of knowing what these lights belonged to, whether they be fighter jets, airliners, privately owned planes, or something not of this earth like a meteor os space debris re-entering the atmosphere, i do know that these lights are unidentifiable and beyond my knowledge of aviation. \r\n\r\ni can only hope that my sighting may have been witnessed by others in the norfolk area. thank you for your time and patience with my sighting.","distance":"Over One

large lights in the distance. i sat and watched them for a moment, and as i watched i noticed two other glowing lights a bit away, either smaller or further away. i sat for about a half hour and then watched as they both faded in and out periodically. not in any sort of pattern, but randomly. \r\n   i've seen ufo's numerous times before and it's something i have a lot of interest in, so i wasn't afraid. just curious. \r\n    i watched the trees bordering the horizon to see if it was a stationary object then and neither set of lights were. the bigger two appeared to drift lazily and slowly upward and to the left. the smaller ones then disappeared and after the bigger ones had faded out for some time i decided to go down the hill. after going down the hill a few times i noticed that the larger set of lights were back. the smaller were still nowhere to be seen. i went back up the hill and sat down again, this time calling a few friends over to ask if they seen it too. they said they did and sat and watched with me. \r\n   within 10 minutes of us sitting there that time we all yelled out as the smaller set suddenly reappeared and shot out a very fast blinking light towards to other. the fast, and rapidly blinking light went past the other set of lights, circled back around very quickly and then disappeared very suddenly. \r\nboth sets of lights disappeared after that and did not reappear while i was there.\r\n\r\n  two weeks later i was back snowboarding again and again, i seen two bright lights in the distance in the same general direction but more to the right than they were before. they again faded periodically and drifted about lazily. again, my friends witnessed the same thing. this time it reappeared and disappeared over and over whilst we were there. eventually we grew tired of it and as we had no way to record it and no explanation we started snowboarding again. i kept an eye on the area throughout the night and it just kept repeating the same behavior while reappearing in different areas. \r\n\r\n  my sister, the next week showed me a video she had recorded of a very similar object. the video isn't great, but it's pretty much the same

the cell tower in liberty, on us 27. while looking out towards that area, suddenly there were several teardrop flashes just above the trees in a straightline trajectory moving from west to east, towards oxford. there were approximately five of them and to describe it, they moved so fast it was almost incomprehensible. just as i remarked to my husband, they were gone. it was not the cell

strobes. these were silver blue teardrop shapes. really hard to describe, though. no, i did not think it a tower. i am on that road virtually everyday and know every nook and cranny of it. it looked like the strobes on a runway and very much like an led light. to describe what i felt? freaked out. gave me a creepy feeling. it or they, seemed to have just disappeared behind us into the sky. it was

eraser and appeared to be hovering over the east side (alum rock area). for about 5 minutes, it just hovered, then it slowly started drifting south. then, all of a sudden, two more showed up and their lights appeared out of no where! (kinda like if you were standing in a dark room, and someone turned on a flashlight facing you.) these two didn't hover though. they automatically started moving towards the south following the first one. out of these three, the first one was super bright. the other two were bright, but not as much. i watched them slowly disappear as they moved towards coyote valley and morgan hill. when they were almost completely out of sight, a fourth one appeared from the same spot the other three came from. only, this one started moving slowly towards the north as if it was going up towards fremont. there is no way these were airplanes, or helicopters. they were too bright, had solid white light illuminating with no flashing lights (as per faa regulations), and from my point anyway, there was no sound. these were exactly what i saw about a month or so ago over the cupertino quarry. i wanted to look at them with my telescope, but it is broken and is going to be repaired tomorrow. ever since my experience in dec 2010, i have been calling them my \"friends\", and have hoped to get another good look someday. maybe my chance is coming back soon!","distance":"Over One

after a mile from my home i looked up to the sky and saw a very bright white light. i was the only car on the two lane road and continued to look while driving, trying to figure out what it could possibly be because it didn't have any red lights or any other like the kind i always see on airplanes that fly over my apartments to bergstrom airport. i could not see any body of a plane or helicopter. it looked incredibly like a bright star that was closer than any star has ever been just above me in broard daylight. it shoned so bright that it looked like there were light beams reflecting off it to make it look star shaped. it started to ascend in a vertical incline straight up to the sky, and then just a few seconds later simply disappered in the sky. there were no clouds nearby or any airplanes or helicopters. shortley thereafter i see a southwest airplane but only see the normal lights on a plane and can see the whole body of the plane, so i know it couldn't have been a plane. then a while later as i was on ih35 heading to san marcos i spot two helicopters flying in the same general vicinity that i believe the star was at when i had spotted early on old bee caves rd. then i called my boyfriend who likes to follow ufo sightings to ask him if he thought i might of saw one because he knows more about these things, and he seems to think that was exactly what it was. upon getting to school and telling some friends they believed it might have been something as well, and everyone thought i should report this little bit of information to you. i also feel that i did see something very unique and important, and feel privileged to have this sighting whatever it may be.

sitting outside noticed two metallic objects in the sky. one of the objects accelerated quickly crossing a valley between to mountains distance of at least 20 miles in about 1 second the other object moved slowly and hovered for a few minutes. the other object slowly started moving west until its view was obstructed by mountains. if i had to guess the altitude of the object i would have to say was about 15,000 to 20,000 ft. i was able to get a photo and video of the slower moving object seeing as it took a five minutes to cross the valley in which we were located. my internet connection is too slow to support the upload of the video seeing as i am currently in afghanistan. the second object was witnessed by many people who were in the area and curious about what i was looking up at. i work in close proximity to a flight line and this object was not a conventional commercial or military aircraft in any way.","distance":"Over One
