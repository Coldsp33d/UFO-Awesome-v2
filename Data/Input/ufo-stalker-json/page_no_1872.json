after my phonecall ended, i was just relaxing on the swing when an orange glimmer caught my eye. slowly the orange star-like object became bigger and bigger and then it stopped. it was about as big and bright as the north star but it was orange colored and brighter. i was looking at it wondering if it was a planet, or a meteor, but then it started to slightly wabble from side to side. then two similar orbs of the same color and brightness split from the single entity and now there were three. they stood still for several seconds, then the the one on the left and right of the main light started to slightly wabble as the first one did. in the blink of an eye, the right one moved inhumanly fast to the right and dissappeared and and maybe 3 seconds later the left one went to the left, just as fast and dissappeared. the middle light then started bobbing up and down and then moved just as fast as the other two straight up and dissappeared. ive tried to think of something to explain what i saw, but nothing came to mind. \r\n\r\nthanks for your time,\r\n*(wit's first name deleted -- cms/sg).","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

highway. there were thunderstorms in the distance, about 5 miles away. i have to take several back roads to get to my house, and so i pulled onto one of those. it was a few minutes past 9pm. as i was driving at about 55mph i noticed a dark object with flashing lights on my left. at first i thought it was a plane, or maybe a helicopter, as i see them flying over fairly often, mostly during the day time. but as i stared at it i realized it was unlike any craft i had ever seen. it had blue, red, and white flashing lights that flashed on a ring around the craft. it was lower to the ground than any plane would fly, and was coming at me at a perpendicular angle. i still thought it was some sort of plane until it turned, very sharply, to parallel the road. as soon as i saw the back of the craft i knew it wasn't a plane. it looked more like some sort of space shuttle. there were three yellow circles on the back of the craft arranged in a triangular fashion, much like the thrusters on the back of a space shuttle. the circles were not that bright and i could still see the white and red lights flashing from the back of the craft. it looked like it had two large wings, but the exact shape was hard to tell because the only source of light (other than the craft) were a flash of lighting or two. at this point i realized just how fast this thing was moving. in the span of less than a minute it was just a pinprick in the distance.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Path with directional

the craft in district 9. i only figured this out later when i had seen the movie.  the craft passed just above tree level it seemed, and was lighted as such so you could see full detail, with a rather orange lighting that shone from several different areas that iluminated the shape of the underside. there was no sound that i could detect.\r\n\r\ni told the guys in the office at the time, and have

saw two large objects that looked like parachutes. however as they got closer, i realized, the objects were moving like a caterpillar/worm.These object are in worm shape, but would tend to retract, expand, and go in sphere shape, then back to worm form.The color was extremely bright, the hue of the glow which could perfectly be seen even during daylight, consisted of red,orangey/yellow and bright white. so i retrieved my phone and recorded. just like any cellphone recording or picture, is nothing like seeing it in person. so, i recorded until the past out of sight,but then came a  group spread out. this group consisted of 6-8 of them. this small fleet behaved the same as the previous two, however i also noticed, a small bright silvery \"orb\" floating around a few of them, as if it was keeping them in check.The orb move much faster than the worms. i has recorder on while the group passed,however the file of course can not be opened.(still working on trying to open file)continued to watch as they too faded past my apartment and out of sight. once again i stopped recording, and then came two more, that were a bit spread out with single orb seeming to just watch the \"worms\". so started recording back up again. this time, thank god! i had a neighbor who was outside, and i brought it to his attention, to make sure i was not just hallucinating!He confirmed he too has never seen anything like it. continued to record, as we tried jokingly suggesting it was some unfortunate clown who may have lost his balloons. the objects did indeed float gracefully like a balloon!!\r\nplease someone can you explain this! i have tried to be \"logical\" in my thoughts, by telling myself there is a simple explanation. however, i am certain this is not the arch balloons or the parachute streamers as other websites have suggested.I would just like to know did any one else get a view of this. i have been searching non-stop. this is west hollywood, someone else had to see this. i mean come on...We have griffith observatory right in the city. they have to know!\r\np.S: thought this information maybe important, in the first sighting, there was a by-plane that did fly close to the objects, that is what made me think they could be skydivers. also, in between the small break up of when i seen the first two and before the small group was in sight, there also was a helicopter and another by plane that fly past. no way they could not have seen this. \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

night midway through july, we decided it was getting late and we should head to one of the girl's house a block away. we had reached the corner of the block that the playground was on when all of us suddenly stopped. we were surrounded in an almost perfect rectangle of green flashing lights, and they almost seemed to pulse. they were moving around us, and i remember feeling like they were targeting us, almost as if they were tracking our location and movements so we could be captured without injury. there were at least three of us standing on that corner, and at the same time (after about two minutes beneath the lights) we all screamed and started running like we had never run the last block to the safe refuge of our friend's house. when we got there, we all compared how we experienced it and found that all of us felt the same things-like they were targeting us, and we all noticed that when the lights passed over our flip-flop exposed toes, we felt a strange warmth coming from them that was uncharacteristic of a still summer evening. not to mention that this heat was focused solely on the patch that it covered, and the heat vanished the second it moved. another thing we all remembered was that when we looked up in unison, we saw no source for the lights. this meant that there was no possible way they had been from a plane or jet, because we obviously would have seen and heard it. looking back on the memories only moments later, we all agreed that when we had started to run, the lights flew away in opposite directions and disappeared after mere seconds.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At about 7:30 p.M. on 17-sep-1957 my father, my mother, my sister (then age 7) and i (then age 9) were riding in the family automobile on south transit road in the town of lockport (niagara county), ny, a short distance south of the city of lockport.  we were driving south on transit road to go to the nearby tastee freeze frozen custard stand.  my father was driving, my mother was in the front seat on the passenger side, my sister was in the back seat on the passenger side and i was in the back seat on the driver's side.\r\n\r\nall of a sudden out of the corner of my eye i caught sight of an unusual object descending in the western sky towards the horizon at a very rapid rate.  the descent path was at angle to the vertical.  just before the object would have reached the horizon, there was a brilliant flash and the object then rapidly moved back up in the sky away from the horizon, in an ascent path that was a mirror image of the descent path.  the angle between the descent path and the ascent path was about 30 degrees.  the event was as if the object had bounced off a point in space.\r\n\r\nas soon as i observed the object and the flash, i got my sister to trade places with me in the back seat so i could get a better view through the passenger side rear window.  my dad pulled the car over to the side of the road so the four of us could watch the object.\r\n\r\nthe object was circular in shape.  the object���s size was about the same as that of an eraser of a yellow wooden school pencil held at arm���s length.  the object was white, luminous and bright, but not shiny.  the object���s appearance was very much like if one could cut a circle of appropriate size from the glowing white light emitted by a fluorescent light bulb.  the edges of the circle were distinct, not fuzzy.  the object had no markings, wings or other appendages of any kind.  there was no indication of structure.  there were no vapors, smoke or trails.\r\n\r\nfrom the apparent size of the fighter jets that later appeared (see below), i would guess the object was a few miles from us (a few miles to the west of us), although i am neither skilled nor trained in making distance estimates.\r\n\r\nthe flash was very brilliant.  based on my observations of burning magnesium in later years, i would say the brilliance was at least as great as that of a magnesium flare.  the duration of the flash was short (less than a second).\r\n\r\nafter we pulled over to the side of the road, i and my parents and sister became aware of two additional objects in the western sky of identical appearance to that of the first object.  i can���t say if the other two objects suddenly appeared after the flash, or if we simply became aware of the other two objects.  i can say that there were three separate objects, all of the same appearance.\r\n\r\nthere was no sound associated with any of the objects and no sound associated with the flash.\r\n\r\nafter the flash the three objects moved about in the sky at slow speed, in all (seemingly random) directions.  they moved independently, not as a group, changing their relative positions over time.  they moved with no particular pattern or direction.  sometimes one or more of the objects appeared to be stationary in the sky.\r\n\r\nabout five to ten minutes after i first saw the first object, about five or six military jet airplanes arrived in the area.  my guess would be that they were air force or air national guard fighter jets from the nearby base in niagara falls, ny.  the movement of the jets indicated to me that the pilots of the jets were looking for something.  they were in the general area of the three objects.  the jets appeared to be fairly close to us, each appearing about a half to three-quarters of an inch long were one to hold a ruler at arm���s length (thus indicating to me that the jets and the objects were perhaps a few miles to the west of us).  the jets were far enough away that we couldn���t hear the sound of their engines.\r\n\r\nafter the jets were in the area for a few minutes, one of the jets suddenly moved southward directly towards one of the objects (presumably in pursuit of the object).  as soon as the jet started moving towards the object, the object immediately moved away from the jet at a very high rate of speed, at least an order of magnitude faster than the jet.  the jet appeared to lose track of the object and after a while the jets left the area.\r\n\r\ndad, mom, my sister and i observed the three objects for a total of about 60 to 90 minutes.  the objects slowly moved towards the southwest and slowly moved upward in the sky.  in order that we could continue observing the objects, dad drove our car towards the southwest over secondary roads west of transit road.  if i remember correctly, this included crossing by bridge over the erie canal, although i can���t be sure.\r\n\r\nas time passed the three objects slowly moved (seemingly drifted) towards the southwest and higher in the sky, and daylight diminished.  we eventually lost sight of the objects.\r\n\r\nseveral days later dad submitted a written report on our sighting to the national investigations committee on aerial phenomena (nicap), an organization to which dad already belonged and to which i would later also belong.\r\n\r\nan article about my dad in the 4-jan-1958 edition of the lockport union-sun & journal newspaper included comments by dad on ufos and on our 17-sep-1957 sighting.\r\n\r\ni can tell you with certainty that the objects we observed on 17-sep-1957 were not airplanes, helicopters, weather balloons, any other kinds of balloons, birds, reflections, mirages, unusual meteorological phenomena, stars, planets, the moon, comets, meteors, asteroids or any other kind of astronomical objects.\r\n\r\nmy sighting of the three objects is something that i will never, ever forget.\r\n\r\ncan you tell me if anyone else ever reported the objects that dad, mom, my sister and i observed on 17-sep-1957?\r\n\r\nthere were three other occasions when i saw an unusual object in the sky.  the first case was later in the 1950s or in the early 1960s.  my father, my mother, my sister and i observed an object while we were parked on church street in the city of lockport one evening.  the object was stationary in the sky.  i don���t remember much about this, except that when i looked at the object through binoculars it appeared to be spherical.  i don���t remember the object���s coloring.  my best guess is that the object likely was a weather balloon or something similar.\r\n\r\nthe second occasion remains much stronger in my memory.  this sighting occurred in the 1980s when i worked at at&t bell laboratories on the east side of columbus, ohio and lived in delaware, ohio to the north of columbus.  it was about 5:00 p.M. and i was driving north on the eastern portion of i-270, the interstate loop that encircles columbus.  when i was near the southeast corner of the columbus airport i observed to my left (west) a fairly large cigar shaped object sitting low in the sky (but high enough that i could see it above houses and trees).  one���s immediate reaction would be that this was simply a blimp (like the goodyear blimp) at the airport.  however, several things make me still wonder about the object:  (1) the cigar shaped object was definitely brown in color, not gray.  my understanding is that blimps are usually gray in color.  (2) as soon as i saw the object, i immediately thought to myself that this object was ���a million years old���.  this is perhaps an unusual thought to occur when observing an aerial object.  (3) i did not pull over to the side of the highway to better observe the object, but rather kept on driving.  this may have been because of heavy traffic, but i remember thinking that someone didn���t want me to continue looking at the object.\r\n\r\nbecause i kept on driving, i observed the object for only a short time (perhaps a minute).  certainly it could have been a brown blimp, but i���ve always felt i saw something unusual that day and i���ve always remembered my thinking that the object was a million years old.\r\n\r\nthe third occasion was in the late 1990s.  my wife and i were passengers on a bus taking carolina hurricanes hockey fans from raleigh, nc to a game in greensboro, nc.  we were traveling west on i-40 in the afternoon.  my wife and i both saw a very unusual object in the sky to the south, through the windows on the left side of the bus.  we watched the object for several minutes.  we immediately recognized that the object was very unusual but (strangely) didn���t pay much attention to details.  i remembering we discussed whether or not the object was following my wife and me.  i don���t remember much about the object, other than it was fairly large and easily visible, that it was not a balloon, airplane or helicopter, and that it was stationary in the sky.\r\n\r\nat the risk of sounding like a crackpot or sounding like someone who is mentally imbalanced (neither of which i am), i should mention that there have been several events in my past that i find troubling.  i���ll provide details on two of these events.\r\n\r\none event was when i was visiting with my mother in lockport in the 1980s.  at the time i lived and worked in erie, pennsylvania.  one evening i took mom out for a ride in my car.  i drove to the area in the town of lockport where we had seen the three ufos in 1957.  for some reason i parked on the side of one of the secondary roads we followed on 17-sep-1957, i suppose to think about our sighting many decades earlier.  i remember a niagara county sheriff���s department deputy stopping to ask if we were ok.\r\n\r\nthe other event occurred when i was a child, either before or after the sighting of 17-sep-1957.  one time i and some of my friends rode our bicycles southward on beattie ave in the city of lockport to the intersection with robinson road in the town of lockport.  robinson road runs east-west.  at the time there was a fenced field (farm land?) on the south side of robinson road.  i remember that i and my friends rode there to look for evidence of a ufo landing in the field.  i also remember that we went over the fence to look around in the field and that we found indentations in the field that we took to be physical evidence of a ufo landing in the field.  i and my friends going to the field definitely occurred.  i don���t know whether or not something of significance occurred in that field previously.\r\n\r\nif i were given the opportunity to undergo hypnotic regression to refresh my memories of these and other events, i would welcome such opportunity.\r\n\r\nby profession i am a software engineer, although i am currently unemployed.  i graduated second in my class in high school.  i graduated from rensselaer polytechnic institute (rpi) in troy, ny with a b.S. in electrical engineering in 1970 and in 1991 i earned a masters degree in computing and information science from case western reserve university (cwru) of cleveland, oh.  i���ve worked as a telecommunications engineer, systems engineer and software engineer for general telephone company of pennsylvania (gte), itt corporation, at&t bell laboratories, bell northern research (bnr)/northern telecom/nortel networks and corona networks.\r\n\r\nmy parents are now deceased.  my sister is still living; she lives with her husband and children in lockport.\r\n\r\nif you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":28824,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.1803628,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04262011-0008","longitude":-78.6839698,"occurred":-387754200000,"potentialRelations":[28832],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New York","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Flash","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1303857414000,"summary":"Three circular white luminous ufos; air force jets searching for them; one jet chased one of the ufos","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":19578,"locationName":"Lockport, New York","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:60427"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Chico","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At around 10:45 pm i was standing on my patio looking north-west towards orland ca. (i have used google earth to identify cardinal directions of the various objects). i saw what appeared to be a star, low to the horizon and just above the roofline of a house across the street, with a subtle red blinking/twinkling emanating from it. i watched the object because the light looks somewhat artificial, but it was a very subtle difference between the stars and the object i was observing. after a few seconds fixing my viewpoint to a roof line and a fence slat to make sure it was the object moving and not me projecting my own slight head movements to the object. the object began moving slowly west, then suddenly changed direction and moved very smoothly to the east. it then did some short zig-zag motions that looked very odd and convinced me i was seeing a ufo and not a plane or helicopter or various other normal phenomenon. \r\n\r\nat this point i went inside, grabbed a friend and drug her outside to get a corroborating witness. she clearly saw what i was seeing. i made a couple of phone calls to family who live about 20 miles to the eat in the foothills and let them know the event was happening. i then got my camcorder and got in the car with my friend. we drove north on highway 32/nord ave. for about 1 mile, and turned left on to muir ave. there was a large field on the left, and orchard on the right. we parked along the orchard and got out, and were immediately able to spot the star-like ufo making slow, subtle movements in irregular patterns about 45-60 degrees above the horizon to the north-west. we watched it for several minutes, and then i noticed another one to the west at approximately the same position relative to the horizon. \r\n\r\nthe objects were both moving in very strange fashion. they would slowly move in any direction for short distances, they would halt, stutter forward, bob up and down and weave about in very short spurts. the movement was odd to witness. i would describe the bobbing movements as close to what a fishing-bobber lure looks like when riding small waves or ripples. it was very fluid and quick at times, and then slow and more deliberate at others. \r\n\r\nafter turning around and facing the field on the other side of the road, i began scanning the skies for other bright star-like objects. they became immediately apparent now that i had an idea of which \"stars\" to focus on. i mainly was able to identify them at a glance by their brighter light. i counted six of them in the period of 10 minutes, and noticed at least one more after watching for over half an hour, making the total seen and observed at seven. there easily could have been more, but it was hard to focus on one or two, let alone follow seven of them. \r\n\r\ni should mention that the two almost directly above me looked yellow/amber in color, while the bright one to the north-east i spent most of my time watching was a white/blue color, much like the color of the north star, but with a slight tinge of blue. this particular object did some fantastic \"dancing\" in the sky, making zig-zag patterns, bouncing, zipping downwards and upwards, and all kinds of various fun movements. at one point, it \"dimmed\" its light very quickly and then brought them back on. \r\n\r\ni tried recording for a good while with my camcorder (actually my friends camcorder, and neither of us could do anything with the settings but hit \"record\" due to both of us being unfamiliar with what settings to use on the camera in dark conditions). i placed the camcorder on the roof of the car and rested it towards the lowest-flying ufo that was a few degrees above the south-eastern treeline. it was white with red twinkling. (note: i looked at the video, and on my monitor, it just looks black. i do not think there was enough light for the camera to pick up the objects, though i would be interested to know if there is image processing that can be done to see very dim objects.)\r\n\r\ni made several phone calls to people, including my sister, who stepped outside and immediately saw the objects moving about. she drove out to where i was, and we watched them together. i phoned another friend who also went outside with her husband and saw them. the current total witness tally is 5 people.\r\n\r\nwe left the field to go home at approximately 12:15-12:30 am. all of the observed ufo's were still in the sky and in the same relative fixed areas they stayed in the whole time. \r\n\r\nat 2:30am i could see a ufo out my window as i fell asleep. i watched it for ten or fifteen minutes. it stayed between two fixed stars, and it would move upwards and downwards in slow, smooth motions, and would sometimes do small zig zags much like a a glowing fly or a lightning bug. very strange to watch the movements, as they do not resemble any sort of known aerial object i have ever seen before. \r\n\r\nto sum it up:\r\n\r\n1. the objects looked like bright stars, had subtle color variations, and moved in ways not possible with known aerial craft or phenomenon. \r\n\r\n2. they were in the sky in fixed areas (like they had there own \"sections\" they had to stay in) for over three hours during the period i observed them. they were there at 2:45am when i finally fell asleep. \r\n\r\n3. no sound was audible. \r\n\r\n4. multiple witnesses saw them from multiple vantage points.

was in the us army reserves in the 1990's.  one night, around june 1, 1992, while on my annual training exercise, i was in the woods, many miles from the nearest town, but amongst thousands of us & canadian army reservists on a base called gagetown, new brunswick, canada. i was dropped off a mile or two from camp, to guard an ammunition dump in a clearing of about 100 yards by 150-200 yards, surrounded by tall trees. the moon was full and the sky was clear.\r\n\r\nat 11:20pm, i had the chilling sensation someone had snuck up on me and was standing next to me, looking at me.  it sent a slight chill through me.  i looked up to the right and there, about 100-or-so yards past the treeline, an enormous craft arose in the vicinity of a small lake/pond.  i could see it plain as day and knew immediately it was an alien space craft. \r\n\r\nit rose like a helicopter and flew slowly, like a helicopter, yet it was silent and lacked distinctive characteristics of both a helicopter and airplane, like a tailfin, wings, propellers, or safety lights.\r\n\r\nin the bright moonlight, i could clearly see the entire craft, which was longer than a 747 or c-130, possibly oval or round, and tapered towards the tail. there were three sets of lights in a 120 degree arc around the front of the craft, which appeared to be windows, but may have been headlights. \r\n\r\ni was paralyzed with fright and tried not to move, lest be seen. i slowly turned my head to watch the craft pass by.  i watched it until it had gradually disappeared over the treeline. \r\n\r\nafter it had passed, i could hear the faint static-like sound of a jet-type engine, however the craft moved far too slowly to be a jet and the sound was barely audible, unlike a jet. there were no runways, where it took off - it had to come out of the lake or another clearing past the trees. having seen many helicopters throughout my training, and ridden in them, i can say without equivocation this was no helicopter. with the bright moonlight, there is no doubt in my mind this was neither a commercial nor military craft known to the public, even now, nearly 20 years later.\r\n\r\nanother soldier was on post about 1/4 mile away at another ammo dump. we had agreed beforehand to pick up our field phones at 11:30 to make sure we were both awake. our exact conversation went: me,\"hey, you there?\" him, \"yeah\" me, \"did you see that?\" him, \"thank god you said that!\" we had both seen the same thing, described the same thing to each other, and agreed we had both seen an alien space craft.\r\n\r\nthis incident was never reported to the military because our fellow reservists thought it was a joke we had both concocted and we eventually dropped it. but to this day, i shudder when i think of it.\r\n\r\ni did report this on another website and was shocked to see the year after i posted it, a canadian soldier posted an eerily similar account on the same night.","distance":"101-500
