(at that age i had no idea about acceptable flight heights of crafts to really know that it shouldnt have been permitted to fly that low.) i didnt want to be laughed at by saying look a ufo, but as it got a little closer it was obious it wasnt a plane. i said look a ufo!!! at first they chuckled and said yea uhuh, 10 seconds later they were agreeing with me! the entire sighting didnt last over 3 minutes.\r\n i have watched ufo shows for a long time and have never heard my craft explained, nor do i think your choices on this page covers it either, thats why i checked other. the craft was shaped like a pool table, it was about 40 feet long by 20 feet wide it was 10 feet high. had 6 lights on the bottom, where the pockets would be on a pool table. the craft was black, metal looking, it flew long ways, it had a window in the side of the craft that went top to bottom. there was a control panel visible but no one was seen in the window. \r\n   the craft flew across the highway just in front of our car and stopped over a trailer park that was right beside the highway. it tilted down over a trsiler and the bottom was 10 to 15 feet from the top of the trailer. \r\n i remember that it was just getting dark and there were many headlights coming west and anybody driving would have seen it but as i recall nobody pulled over or stopped, neither did we! i couldnt believe my brother in law kept driving!! but he did. \r\n i watched it from the right side, to flying in front of us and watching out the back window as we kept driving. i saw all sides of the craft.\r\n i am guessing on the year, i was a child, but i do know it was in the mid 70's. \r\n has anyone ever described a craft such as this? or reported on this same encounter?\r\n my sister has since passed away. when i was in my early 20's i stopped to see my brother in law to ask him about that night. all he remembered was lights in the sky. i was greatly dissapointed, i had hoped he would have recalled some of the details. \r\ni am not a good artist but i would be happy to describe it to an artist and share it with your agency.\r\n  the movements of the craft was in a straight line just as an airplane would fly, there was no up down just a straight flight path to the top of the trailer. our viewing ended as we continued driving the craft was still above the trailer as we left the viewing range.\r\n when i was older i drove down that road again to see what i remembered, and sure enough, there was still a trailer park right next to the highway.\r\n if you may recall, there was a famous ufo encounter back in 2007 i believe in girard ohio when a policeman had a sighting and chased a craft till his car died. mt sighting was on the outskirts of that town, roughly 5 air miles from his sighting.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":28777,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.1590265,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04232011-0003","longitude":-80.6980662,"occurred":155446080000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,   Rectagular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1303544086000,"summary":"A pool table shaped craft flew just above the tree tops in front of our car.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":13288,"locationName":"Girard, Ohio","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:61161"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":null,"country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"The photo is a picture message sent to my husband on his cell from a co-worker's son who was working on a train somewhere in the mojave desert.

be dark this was around summer so around 8:30 pm. i rember out of the corner of my eye i saw something coming that appeared at first to be a shooting star, but when i looked it was bright gold color almost looking like a gold stud earing, and it was lower than the clouds and coming fast. i rember it was fully lit and then all the sudden it started going dark and then back on like cutting its self off and back on and it was traveling really fast like it was running from something. it never made a sound either it was quiet but fast and i remember thinking it should be loud like a jet or something but no sound, and i remember it lifted up a little in the sky and hit a real speed boost and then went off and i couldnt see it nomore, and it was about not even a minute after that three apache helecopters in what i know now in a fighting formation appeared where i first saw the gold ball appear. they were just above the trees and had real bright lights shining down on the ground as if they were searching for something, and i remember they keep going around the same area and finally they went dark but i could still hear them, and i remember getting scared and running home. i told my mom but of course i was a kid at the time and she thinks i am making it up. i remember about maybe 4 years later i watched this movie i cant remember the name of it but it was based on a true story, and thats when it dawned on me everything that happened the way i seen it was what happened in this movie, it was wear a ufo apperad over this house abuducted this person, and the military picked up on it and try to get to it, and the whole apache helicopters showed up to the seen and everything and i remember getting cold chills from it. i have told friends and stuff over the years but this is the first time i have ever reported it. i think my brother seen it to he may have been with me, i can never forget what i seen all the years later its like it happened yesterday, and the ufo didnt have a bunch of lights on it it was just bright gold no other lights and was traveling 2 to 3 times faster than fighter jets you see flying around. i almost think that something happened to someone around there maybe an abduction, and the military was trying to cover it up i dont know. i am willing to take any kind of lie ditector test anything to prove what i seen and show i am telling the truth and i believe if you were to investigate you may find other people or even the person that may have experienced it. i am a sketchy person so it has to be in my face to believe it, and this

beer,when my friend ernie said ,do you see that bright light over towards new freedom.I sure did,it was very very bright & shiney.It was hovering with a slight motion going to & fro. we watched it a good while,ernie says i really don't think thats a helicopter or airplane,i totally agreed. then it shined a bright beam of light towards the earth,we watched in disbelief,after a few minutes we noticed something being brought up into the craft.I was so scared but kept watching.We said very little.It just hovered there for quite awhile.Then what or whoever they brought into the craft was being lowered back down.With the bright beam,then after that there was a bright beam coming from the earth towards the craft & then it stopped.We sat there & watched a little longer then the craft started moving southward. i had a willy's jeep with the top off.It was still pretty warm then.We decided to try to follow it.We got to the bottom of the hill & tore up the road & caught up with it in our sight.We followed it into the state of maryland,baltimore county.We followed it to the prettyboy resivior.It stopped again for a minute & then it was gone,it took off in a flash.Gone !!! ernie said to me,i don't think you should tell anybody about what we saw,they'll never believe us.I never did tell anyone til years later.But i remember it like it was testerday,i'm 60 now & i should let it

thought i saw a falling star falling from the sky across the man's backyard beyond the trees but quick to realize that it was not a falling star and then i quickly told my son to look at this thing falling. i had thought at first i was seeing things so i had to ask him to look. he couldn't believe it either but he had a puzzled face. i asked him is it a helicopter, he said no mom cause it's not making any noise and the lights are coming out of it from everywhere. so now i started freaking out cause i wanted to know what it was but it happened in a blinking of an eye. it came down quickly, but like it was out of control and trying to gain control of itself or something. it was a ball like shape i would say with light beaming if that's what you want to call it from every side of it. well i keeping watching it then out of shock i had to get out of the car just so i could see if i could tell what it was better outside. i still had my eyes on it the whole time because i was afraid it would go away by the time i decided to go outside of my car. by the time i ran out of my car and went about 10ft from my car i saw it still out of control then it vanished behind the trees and some clouds.  i do remember thinking that i wish there were no rain clouds cause maybe at least i could have seen it go down better but i don't think that would have mattered because of the trees .  well in amazement and in shock and happy that my son saw it too, but still wondering what that was. if it was a helicopter then we would have heard it fall and crash or something on the news that day because i went home after my son got on the bus and looked up the news and anything that would help me find out what that was if anyone saw that thing that morning and nothing was reported.  i still wonder and have no idea what that was. there has to be someone else other than us that saw that. because this sighting was not that far from my son's school and the church so someone must of seen

*(link moved to additional evidence section--cm/sg).\r\n\r\nme and my friend were looking at the stars on our window, it was past midnight already i think. we thought that maybe we would see some ufo's tonight since the sky is very clear etc. we regularly check the skies for ufo's. we're weird like that.\r\n\r\nwe were just gazing at the stars and then my friend pointed at a light in the distance that seemed to move closer to us. although we were hoping it was a ufo, we initially went for the logical conclusion as every rational human should do and told ourselves that it's just an airplane. we wanted to make sure before we started calling it a ufo. the light stopped and seemed stationary for a while, hovering behind some trees and at that moment, another light moved in from another direction, towards that light. but that new one faded away after half a minute or so. the first light started moving again. so a double sighting quickly changed into a single sighting. the second light never came back after slowly dimming its lights.\r\n\r\nthe light kept moving closer to us and once we realized that there was no sound and that the light didn't blink or anything, i quickly ran into my room, grabbed my videocamera, ran back to the window and started filming it. i zoomed in as much as i could, focused it as well as i could (i wish i had a tripod. ok scratch that - i wish i had a 500mm f1.4 lens with canon 5d mk2 or smth and a tripod) and we were looking at a solid, flying object with 4 distinguishable lights. 3 bigger bright white lights and 1 small low red light. the lights were always stationary, as if one with the craft. we couldn't make out the shape of this thing. you will have to watch the video yourself and figure it out. would be cool if someone could.\r\n\r\nas we watched the object move through the sky (north-east direction), we noticed it was doing this peculiar red blinking thing with the lights, or it seemed as if the lights were shimmering or something, with a pace. it kept moving north-east and then suddenly it changed position or shape (i got the feeling like it had tilted itself) and there was only 2 bright white lights running diagonally and the little red light in the middle. at that moment the object was pretty close and since there was still no sound and the shape was clearly too weird for an airplane, my friend shouted: \"that's a ufo, that's definitely a ufo!\"\r\nat that time, one of the white lights on the ufo started to blink, but with a weird pace, not like airplanes. the blinking pace was out of rhythm.\r\n\r\nthen my friend said that we should go to the other room, since the ufo was getting out of sight pretty quickly now and the best place to observe it would be from another window. we did that and only got a small glimpse of it from the other side of the house before it flew away into the distance, probably pretending to be an airplane and vanished out of sight behind some trees.\r\n\r\nwe didn't feel anything weird before, during or after the sighting. we just got a little bit excited when observing and filming this thing, but that's all

made a 90 degree right turn. it went out of sight behind the treasure island hotel. it was like i said 25to 40 miles out of town. coming from northwest. the next night at the same time 2-45 a.M it came from due north. it did the same thing,only it only lasted 5to 7 minutes. then it turn left heading east 90 degree turn. shortly after turning it disappeared. i called george knapp mr u.F.O. in las vegas after the first day,just to tell him i was one of what i thought would be hundreds of what i saw. he said no one had called him?  i didn't call back after seeing it the second night. it never made the news. so that was that,then many years later i saw the story of bentwaters a.F.B.In england. well what they saw was what i saw.The dripping is what i mean. not the landing an all of that.This was being controlled by something.It wasn't a metetor,they don't last20to30 minutes an make 90 degree turns.George knapp i am sure you know.He is on channel 8 in vegas,for many years now.If you call him i was able to contact him right away because eric green a friend was a camera o\r\nprater at th e stationan helped reach george. maybe george remembers? the venation hotel was being built,i can only guess as to what year it was.  ilived there sept 94 till july 98 it was after jan95 when my mother died. the venation was probably a year or a little more from being opened. that's a guess ,but a pretty good i hope.Ilived on the fourth floor top floor facing the strip at the meridan apts.Flamingo an koval streets.I felt bad i didn't own a camcorder,if you saw it it would have gone

first i thought it was an illusion and i was looking at the sirius star. ( i downloaded google sky and the sirius star appeared near the object i was looking at)  i later realized it could not be a start, stars do not move!  as i was watching the star, a helcopter with what appeared to be a search light, started over the treelines towards me.  a second later another appeared next to it.  then a third one.  i thought to myself, holy crap!  what is going on..They must be on a mission of some sort.  then they stopped moving.  i froze���and stood silently and motionless.  the three ���lights��� then faded backwards!!!  wth?!  was i seeing things, i thought to myself.  i looked over and the origianl ���star��� started to blink and it was not a twinkle like a star may have.  i ran inside to tell my wife and she rolled her eyes and chalked it up to my imagination!  after that night i started to watch the skies in the evening. \r\ni noticed several interesting things since then, and the activity has grasped my attention.  however, my attention to the sky and this phenomena may be too much.  i started to sit in the windows with all of the lights in the house turned off, just wathing these ���moving stars���  that fade, change from white to blue to red, and flash.  when one of the large stars flashes suddenly there are other stars that appear to flash.  i have seen what appeared to be a laser pointer war between ���orbs��� and radiot towers in my area.  i have seen lights that appear to be a second tower near actual towers���i noticed that this was pretty frequent and that the second ���fake tower light: moved.  so i decided one day to take my camera and head towards these objects.  when i would get close, the objects would start to blink red like and move appearing to be a helicopter.  i could never focus my ���cheap��� home video camera in on one to prove it.  i have told a very select amount of people about these anonamolies and never told everyone all of the details about everything, as all together it seems to be too much to believe���even for me who is witnessing it all first hand.  i understand if by now, i appear to be ���off my rocker���.  i would have thought the same.  however, i have been able to successfully tell three different skeptics, including my wife and prove everything to them by personally pointing the items out in the sky.  \r\nwhile taking a relative with me to veiw the crazy lights, i was exaplainning about the radio towers and i pointed out where i had been one night sitting watching it all and had a bright white light come up from the trees on a mountain and take off towards me.  she thought i was imagining things, so i parked so that my car was facing an easily escapable route away, just in case the light came at us.  i turned off the headlights, and pointed. when i did i saw a bright orange, or goldish ambr, light getting bigger and biggger���.Then all of a sudden it took off like  lightning bolt towards us..It appeared to have a tail when traveling at this rate of speed!!  i was scared and i said forget this man!!!  i hit the gas and sped as fast as i could,  off of the top of that mountain we were on.  i was thinking, i hope that she (relative) saw that!  halfway down she said omg that thing wsa f���d up!  it was fast and headed right towards us, what was it?!!!  omg���!!!  i said i told you���i have no clue���it is like there is eomthing hidden out there that it does not want me to see!!!  i am all cnfused.  let���s get to the bottom of the mountain  and head to another, much higher, peak with a better view.  though, when we arrived at the stop sign at the bottom of the hill, there was two in the sky in front of us, and one up the road a ways on top of a mountain.  at first i said���it is just a house light up that way���then we both said no..No...Noooo that thing is descending down the mountain like a baloon���.The closer it got the faster it went. again, we peeled out and went down the road away from the item.  however, i notice several other odd items over the past 3 weeks.  here is a brief overview of all:\r\n\r\nreddish./pink lit orbs figures on the tree line where i the ufos usually appear.  \r\nstars that move in small movements vet/hor fade in fade out���dim.Brighten change color blue red etc\r\nstars that are stationary and if you stare long enough will not blink or strobe but move across the sky\r\nseeing red flashes in air on aircraft like a chopper\r\n i started to notice the same ���star��� would come up over the treeline behind the house.  i also noted that every evening at dusk there are several planes that head towards the area that that star comes from.  there is little to no plane activity at that altitude for several hours before hand. \r\nhere is the weird one���when i point a camera at that one it drops over the tree line like it is hiding (more than a couple of occurrences like this) and then there are those tiny red flashes like helicopters and they are everywhere like they are guarding the big light.  they move not like conventional aircraft but like a butterfly or firefly and all eratic.\r\nalso have seen large reddish orange lights from a distance that were in weird area���when i get to them they seemingly go up and hide behind the mountain they are on!\r\nalso have seen goldn amber colored light floating and/or hovering ovr houses, towns, etc;  moves like a hot air balloon���only about 50-60 ft up in air just our of range of houses powerlines, etc;\r\ni have been followed and cahsed by this particular light and it scares the crap out of me.  i have video out some of them and they appear to be like a digital being that spions and twists and is often shaped like a gold ball with the top quarter missing!\r\n\r\ni am obseesed with knowing more..There have been much more to add but thisis the gist of it all and i haven���t been sleeping much so very tired and having trouble typing.  \r\n\r\n\r\nall occurrences have been in the bellefonte/milesburg/snow shoe area���.I swear i have seen planes that looked like they were trying to land in the vicinity of the sproul state forest.  i am going up north this evening to try to film���might be too cloudy though.\r\n\r\nwife is mad its all i can think of when t gets dark but i have been followed and see stuff shadows and light effects through the miniblinds when in bed and i am just freaked the heck out by all of this.  the whole deal is weird...I keep hoping soeone will tell me i am nuts, but i show them and they say damn you are right...Woah!

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At approximately 10 pm on 4/13/11, i exited my apt. in huntington, indiana to smoke a cigar in the parking lot.  upon sitting down to smoke on my front walkway, i looked up and saw a translucent disk-shaped symmetrical object directly above the parking lot, approximately 25 feet high in the air.  \r\n\r\ni was initially surprised, though, having seen a ufo once before in summer 2008 (four large white lights rotating clockwise and couterclockwise while simultaneously beaming a white light down to the ground to form a inverted pyramid shape; the white balls of light were in formation to my northeast and travelling about 70 mph approximately 5 miles east of i-65 and 300 feet up, they tracked my vehicle as i was proceeding southbound on i-65 in-between franklin and edinburgh, indiana and never passed my position) but never this close, i was not afraid or overly shocked.  \r\n\r\nthe object i saw was translucent and obscuring the background night sky and apartment buildings and trees, though, not blocking the background out; the shape was more like a distortion of the background, much like the image one sees when looking at one's reflection in a pool of water.  the shape was symmetrically disk shaped and did not change.  i could not see any edges or seams of physical material.  it was as if the object was rapidly ionizing the air around the edges of the shape forming a thin fog that would dissipate but was continuously being generated.  it was spontaneously generated in a circular pattern much like it seemed the effect of dry ice has when placed in ambient air.  it was a cloudless night, cool, and slightly humid.  the moon was beside the disk, high in the sky, slightly yellowish, waxing.  \r\n\r\ni didn't hear any sound coming from the object, i experienced no missed time to my knowledge, but a thought kept recurring in my mind 3 or 4 times in the first few seconds of seeing the object above the parking  lot.  this thought was that the disk was some sort of amplification device used to amplify and focus thoughts and signals or messages between the moon and points or people on the earth.  this thought may have been my own justification for identifying something unknown, but i just had a very strong feeling this was correct without any doubt at all.  i hold a bs in biochemistry and mba, and, by nature, i am skeptical of ufos and aliens, though open to the possibility that both exist.  i watched the shape for about 10 minutes and was just sort of hypnotized by it.  it felt good to watch it; calming.  it was beautiful.  i enjoyed watching it so much that i didn't even think about going inside to get my camera nor did i apparently feel any desire to photograph it!  \r\n\r\nthe strangest thing about the whole experience is what my neighbor said as i turned to see him enter his apartment next door.  i didn't see him pull up into the parking lot or open his door, but i caught a glimpse of him while he was entering his apartment.  on his way inside the door, he said, \"don't look at me, they'll know what i look like!\"  he was in a hurry to go inside it seemed and very fearful.  i had only briefly talked with him on one occasion 2 months prior to the night of the sighting and have since moved away from the area.  after looking back at the ufo which was still there hovering steady  without any apparent wobbling motion, i walked to the other side of the parking lot to look at the stars in the western sky and saw what appeared to be numerous shooting stars falling straight down to earth in various directions on the horizon both west and east of my location while 5-7 lights or what looked like stars or star-sized lights that

the sky. having moved here a little over a year ago, i enjoyed the night sky because it had so many more stars than where i lived before. i noticed what appeared to be a plane above and to my right. it had a couple of lights on, flashing but not going on and off. they seemed to twinkle more than flash. i assumed it was a plane and continued to watch the dog as she sniffed around. after a few seconds, i looked up again and there was one steady light. i thought i  must have been mistaken about the additional lights and thought maybe it was a star. then they came on again. it wasn't moving but it was hovering, and i realized after a minute or two that this was something unusual. the lights flickered, and then it started moving extremely slowly toward me, with no sound at all. that freaked me out a little and i went inside. i looked out the window of the door, and i saw it moving side to side, slowly. then it stopped and continuted to flicker. at first i thought it looked like it was a boomerang shape. but it could have been a disc. it definitely had an angle to it. it reminded me of a wedding band that had diamonds all around it. like i said, they were white and flickered, sometimes all of them, sometimes a couple and sometimes just one. it was hovering out towards lewiston, me and it was about the height and size of a plane. i watched for about 15 minutes, but because of it moving toward me, i decided to stop watching. it definitely gave me an eerie feeling. i've seen ufos in the past (many years ago) and they didn't evoke that feeling in me. this just seemed different, maybe because i was by myself and it was so dark out. i watched the news hoping to hear of other reports, but so far there haven't been any. i thought i should mention it to someone.

and looked at the time, it was 9:13pm. driving out of the mall parking lot onto 86th st.I took the first right (north) onto keystone ave. towards the 465 west entrance ramp. \r\n\r\nbefore reaching the 465 ramp i noticed two very bright lights~moving north on keystone~before crossing over the 465 interstate.  the lights were brighter than any aircraft i have seen-and brighter than the nearby construction lights. the object moved very slow- i followed it up keystone-pass the 465 ramp and continued for 2-3 blocks. due to construction and traffic congestion, i noted that i was traveling between 30 and 32 miles per hour. i did not gain or lose distance between the object and my car as we moved north.\r\n\r\ntwo blocks after the 465 overpass, the object stopped. the distance between the object and my car became closer as i continued to move forward-\r\n\r\nstopped for only a few seconds, i did not see the object turn around, but it reversed directions and began retaking the path it had just traveled, but now it was traveling south, towards me. \r\n\r\nas it approached and eventually passed above me, i noted two large and very bright lights-they were seperate from each other-and looked like headlights on a car. i thought it was some sort of slow moving aircraft, but as the under-side passed by (on my right hand side), i thought \"why does that remind me of the underside of a push lawn mower?\". i was refering to the shape, it was rectagular! the object was smaller than expected, it was not a massive airliner size.  it was traveling low enough to the street to catch my attention, yet logically it had to be high enough to pass above telephone lines, trees etc. i rolled down my window and did not hear any loud noise as it passed overhead.\r\n\r\ni continued one block(north)before being able to turn around and head south. i then watched the object pass back over 465 (moving south slowly)it moved away from my view.\r\n","distance":"101-500

longsword winery and offloaded the images from my camera. as i was going through the images to edit them, i noticed two of the images had anomolies in the background and zoomed in to see what they were. 1 image has a cigar shaped/colored item along with a white opaque sphere. the next image taken perhaps about a second or less later, only shows the sphere. they were south of us in the image in the direction of mt. ashland and applegate lake (an area known for many yeti sightings - btw).\r\n\r\nwe were at the longsword winery when the pictures were taken facing south toward the california border. there are no other photographs that have these possible ufos even though i was using the same camera and took many shots facing the same direction over the course of a couple hours that included the sky. it was hazy that day, though a clear sky - bioengineering or chemtrailing - whatever you want to call it was pretty heavy during the late morning/early afternoon.\r\n\r\n(about an hour before the images of the objects were taken, i was 5 miles or so closer to where the objects seem to be in the images, taking photos at mckee bridge. both of my camera batteries died suddenly within 30 seconds of each other. there are 2 witnesses to that. we left the area so i could find a place to charge the batteries. once we left the area, i turned the cameras back on and the batteries were showing full charges again.)\r\n\r\ni did not notice the objects while in the area. i think the circular polarizer lens on my camera helped block glare from the intense sun and haze, so my camera could see what my eye could not. when i first saw them in the images, i thought the white sphere was a cloud and then when i zoomed in, i saw a shadow, like a sphere would have and it made sense with the direction of the sun. i had also never seen a cloud look what appeared to be perfectly round. then i checked the image i had taken moments before the one i initially noticed the sphere in and there was what i though looked like a dark line in the sky - stick like. the shutter speed i was using was so fast that it would have photographed a plane clearly and the object is too far away to be a bug or debrie that flew by quickly. even then, my camera would have showed it more of a see-through blur rather than a solid object.","distance":"Over One
