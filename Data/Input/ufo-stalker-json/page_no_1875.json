the race track on beeline, i believe its considered martin county i could be wrong. it had to have been about 11-12 pm or so based on a picture i took well prior to it and a text i sent soon after.It was a clear clear night, i was facing east my friend west as we spoke about the planed morning hunt when i bursted out with \"you just missed a shooting star\", he turns and again the light flashes across the sky heading south, he replied, \"wow another one\".I was stunned. for a second i thought metior shower but no, not at all.\r\n its so hard to explain, im facing east, the flash was in my vision about 65-70 degrees in my line of sight and could not have been higher than 10 thousand feet and vanishes, a split second later as my friend turns it flashes again this time about 10 degrees lower in my sight and vanishes, and again still heading south with each flash covering vast sectiions of sky it flashes again this time about 10degrees above my initial 65-70 degrees. this is all happening in flashes of a bright white light a second or less apart, my friend claims he cought a orange glow to it but i cant confirm. by now it had traveled south far just above the tree line.It then flashes west a short distance then east then west again each time about 10 degrees in my line of sight and every time the same distance and it was gone. minutes later maybe 15 or so i seen it again this time far east if i had to guess i would say either close or past our shore. far enough to be low in the horizon.This time i only seen two flashes of light, the first heading south the second north about half the distance it travelled south also at a higher altitude and gone again without a trace.My friend was answering natures call, either way it happened so fast by the time i said \"there it is again\" it was over. \r\n its important you know i am a aircraft mechanic and love aviation while i cant name every aircraft i know a plane from anything else. i heard zero sound, zero sound at that altitude from something moving that fast changing dirrection so radically. in between flashes of light it was out of sight each time for a split second and re-appear above or below its previous path. i cant explain it much better and before i confuse my self thinking about it i wanted to write it down and hear opinion and comments. i know what i seen and glad i wasnt alone because i

to spend the night so that i would not have to drive on route 26 in the dark.  its very curvy and i hate driving at  night.  thinking that by the time i got to  veneta it would be starting  to get light out.  route 26 from veneta to mapleton is also a 'dead zone' for cell phones.  by the time i got to  veneta it was very dark out with patchy clouds.  i continued toward noti and it wasn't getting light at all.  there was no traffic at all at this time and it was very quiet.  i hate driving at night and found that i was driving at 40 to 40 mph hour as it was very dark.  i remember entering walton and pulling over at the walton store to let a log truck pass.   only to find out that within 100 feet he turned right onto nelson mtn rd. i looked at my car clock and saw that it was 5:30 am.  i thought to myself that i bet everyone in walton has been abducted at least twice and laughed.  i drove for about a couple of minutes  when for some reason looked left and saw a large black triangle with 3 white lights on  each end.  i've seen triangles before but this one in addition to the 3 white  lights  there was an extra red light several feet ahead of the lead white light on the triangle.  i didn't stop as it was still dark and i didn't know of any place to pull over.  this triangle  followed along beside me at the same speed making no noise at all.  it was traveling above pastured areas several feet from the road and homes.  i remember thinking that i couldn't believe that it was so close to me and close to homes along the road. the only place i thought to pull over  was in someone's  driveway which would be awkward and not knowing what it was or what it wanted continued driving.  i had to be at work in coos bay by 7:30 am. considering i was driving about 40 mph through walton the triangle followed along  with me for about 5 minutes. i  thought to myself that i would love to chat but i had to hurry home.  at that moment the triangle's back two lights started to glow very brightly.  i got a little worried.  the triangle started to slowly rise in the sky as i continued driving.  the triangle got to a certain height then banked slightly to the left into a canyon when the red light at the end turned on and lit up an entire canyon in a bright white light.  it was so bright i was actually scared for a moment as i have never seen anything that powerful.  the triangle then slowly entered the canyon with that blinding light.  i continued on my way as it started to downpour.  i did not pass  any cars or see anyone on the road. it rained all the way to mapleton where no one was there.  i pulled over and called my daughter in eugene as i knew i had cell service now.  i was so shook up that she thought at first i had hit someone. i continued  to florence where i stopped in safeway and actually saw people!  two days later i saw two black  ops helicopters at the airport as i work near there.   considering this isn't the first time i've seen a triangle  i can only wonder why they don't seem to be to bothered by me seeing them and this concerns me. i now carry a camera and binoculars in my car for the next time.

am writing about an event that i can remember parts of but i think nobody else remembers or m.I.B paid a visit and said not to remember.\r\n\r\ni think i was around 12 years old and was visiting my grandparents in the summer on a sunday..... i still live in the area where it took place too so the memory of what i can remember is clear.  we were sitting around talking and suddenly i remember hearing a sonic boom, at the time (1990) nobody knew what a sonic boom was so we all ran outside to see a u.F.O hovering over a building across the street, my friend and i were told to stay inside but ran out anyway.  the next thing i remember was my friend was gone already and i was being lifted off the ground and taken into the craft at that time i grabbed a branch and was holding on to prevent being taken, i remember looking down and seeing my grandmother with a knife or something trying to rescue me and then the cops and fire showed up and i was just out of reach.... the next thing i remember is standing next to my friend and we were both naked looking out a big window and next to us was a gray big eye alien as described on t.V. by hundreds of people.  they used telepathic communication to tell me that i was a special person and their intent seemed to be that of piece and we were looking down at the earth as they said this.  the next thing i only just now remembered is that they may have put a long needle in my head just under my nose above my lip deep into my head but not sure as memories keep coming up over the years.  after that i remember being on the ground again and hearing another sonic boom to turn around and see 3 lights far off in the distance, in the shape of a triangle, red green and blue.  we ran into the house and at the time only remembered hearing the first sonic boom running out and looking up after hearing the second and when we ran back in my family said we were gone a long time (a few hours) and they had to call the police.  i never saw the police after i came back in the house but later i do remember them being there during the event.  i asked my family about it years later and they just look away or say they don't remember but it seems like they may not be telling me the truth.... years later i was in my 20's and this is a little bit funny but true, i was in bed and had just bought a cardboard standie that day at a collectors shop and it was nelix on star trek voyager...... that night as i slept i woke up scared and frozen, my arms felt like i had handcuffs on and my legs were also feeling that way but i could not see anything and could not move.... i was on my side in the fetal position and facing the wall, i turned my head just enough that i could see behind me out of the corner of my eye and i could see the standie almost in the middle of the room but moving near me and as it got closer it would stop and a gray big eye head would pop out from behind it as if to see how close it was and when it was right near me the next thing i remember it was morning again.   i know this sounds like a bugs bunny cartoon with someone sneaking up to someone else with a fake bush or whatever but it's true as i remember it.  one more thing.... as some people have burn marks or evidence of some sort i as well have something that i think may have been a result of visiting them.  i now have physic powers they may have made me physic... no bullshit, i have dreams that later come true, i also found some videos online about remote viewing and can do that well.  i have also made predictions and have seen things in my mind that i think may be going on at area 51.  i need help from someone who will not think i am crazy i am ready to tell my story.  i wrote to you before about 5 boys who each have 5 fathers on a desert road and sent you a generated picture of what i once saw.  this is the tip of the iceberg, you can contact me for more info...... if you want to.","distance":"20 Feet or

after 7pm, i left a friend���s home in taylor, near the crossing of telegraph rd. and van born st.  it did not take me long to get back to the highway from her house, after only a very short trip on main roads, a quick gas fill-up at the pump using my card, and then a lengthy stop at a red light, which i suspect puts the sighting at around 7:10 to 7:20 when it began, and lasted for approximately 20-25 minutes in full, though it was not completely visible for me that entire time.\r\n\r\ni drive a 1997 pontiac sunfire, and my sketches include features from my perspective while sitting in my vehicle.  i was driving alone with a cell phone which was packed away in a bag in my passenger seat ��� and because my dashboard clock does not work, i was unsure of the exact time.  i have no camera phone or other recording device, so i had to document and sketch it from memory.  to my knowledge, there were no other witnesses, although other people were driving on the same road and able to see the same thing, though none seemed to notice.\r\n\r\non eastbound i-94 in metro detroit, near the southfield highway intersection, while the interstate is significantly above ground level enough to see the object hovering near the horizon, i caught sight of what i first believed was a banner of some sort, like those trailing behind airplanes (aerial advertising).  then i realized that this object���s relative position to me and lack of motion meant that there was no plane tugging a banner along, and i surely couldn���t spot a plane of any form near the object.  as i continued to drive, i had to fight with looking over or past other obstacles to my vision while still driving at high speeds during traffic ��� i did well with this, and there was luckily no danger involved during this period of time.  as i think back on it, i only wish i would have had the foresight to pull off the interstate to a main road where the object was still visible, and to watch it as long as i could ��� however, i never came to the conclusion that i was the only eyewitness to this object, and surely i would see some news of it when i arrived home.  if i had the chance again, i would watch it until it left my sight on its own.\r\n\r\nas i got better and better glances at the object, i continued to move along the highway, making my way for i-75, my ultimate route back home.  at one point, i was angled so that it was visible in my passenger-side window in my direct view, with no obstacles, and showing me clearly that it was not attached to anything, and it was unlike anything i had previously seen or ever heard about here on earth.  though i was clearly astonished at the sight of it, i was intent on getting back home, and though i was continuously debunking my own skeptical ideas of what earthly craft this could be, i was instinctively sure that someone somewhere was getting press coverage of this event at that very moment, and i should get home and watch the news on tv and the net.  later, when i arrived home, i learned there was no news, no sightings on the tv or internet, and wished i would have taken action then.\r\n\r\nbecause i have seen tethered balloons used as advertising, i even thought maybe it could be something like that, but the better glances i got, the more and more skeptical of my own skepticism i became.\r\n\r\nhaving the object in my sights at several points on i-94, i wasn���t quite sure of where it was, or how far away it was, and therefore ��� how large the object might have been.  it was very difficult to discern its exact size and location, and only after looking at a google map of the area was i able to determine approximately where it could have been located.  based on those figures, i would guess the craft could have been anywhere from 300 feet to a mile or more in width, and about one-quarter that in height.  if i had ever seen a rectangular blimp (an object that could hover for extended periods of time, such as this object did), i would believe this could be a blimp, but the whole concept of a rectangular aerial craft defies the use of aerodynamics used in the craft���s design in order to adequately fly the thing around during an event ��� this object was clearly rectangular or perhaps even more of a parallelogram, but it had relatively angular and obvious corners, with two pairs of parallel sides.  when i first spotted the object, i could have sworn it was angled diagonally, making me think it was a banner being pulled by an airplane, though it could have been the curvature of my windshield, since i was looking between the windshield and the passenger-side window, leaning back and forward, ducking my head down and then trying to peer over ��� all because it was positioned somewhat behind the car frame bar between those two windows, giving me a pretty precise angle of my first sighting of it, as well as future angles.\r\n\r\nafter i merged on to northbound i-75, i could see the object still in my rear-view and side mirrors, though my curving driving motion made it difficult to keep in my sight at all times.  then, while on a straight path on the interstate, i got a very clear sighting of it in my rear-view mirror, as well as my side mirror, both separately for several seconds, enough to pinpoint a general location relative to my own position.  i have included drawings of these perspectives in my report, showing the object as it was situated in my view in both mirrors.\r\n\r\nit was still rather bright daylight outside, with the low sun nearly set, and making the colors of the sky begin to be more vibrant, giving off rosy pink tones and yellow hued light on most things reflecting it.  there were no stars visible yet, and the sky was not really dark enough for them in any location.  there were few clouds, and the ones present were very far away and thin, not having much mass or density.  no other objects appeared as solid and obvious as this one.  i could see no earthly craft, such as planes, helicopters, or jets.  when i first glimpsed the object it was positioned in a location where it was made somewhat darker, appearing as a muted magenta or deep reddish mauve, and by the time it was positioned clearly in my window it had brightened because of the sun���s light, falling on it and the rest of the horizon.\r\n\r\nin my side window is where i caught the best glimpse of the object, and is the view i remembered when making my color renditions.  i mostly remember how the light reflected off it: it was solid, a different color than the sky, and reflected the colors of the sunset and sky, though not as if it were ���shiny��� so much as it was solid and had mass that caught the unique sky colors.  it did not seem to have any writings, markings, or other significant or relevant identifiers, and it not produce light, phenomena, or effects such as that.  i cannot be sure if it was silent or audible, since i was driving in a car.\r\n\r\nin full, the sites where/when the object was visible were around the southfield highway/i-94 intersection, for several miles, and then it was no longer visible because of the elevation of the highway for a large portion of the remaining distance to i-75.  however, it began to be visible again as i could overlook the city of detroit from the ramp between i-94 e and i-75 n.  by the time i was heading north on i-75, it was visible in my mirrors.  i have attached a map that i got using google maps and adding in where i was located when i spotted the object.  though i placed myself after southfield highway on my trip when i first spotted it, when i took another trip on the same route to be sure of my sighting locations, i realized that it may have been before i passed this intersection that i remember being one of my landmarks.  after driving on i-75 for some distance, i was considering getting off the highway and parking somewhere i might be able to view the object, but by that time i had a difficult time trying to see it, and figured it best to simply make it home and watch the news.  that was about 1-2 miles before the davison freeway (m-8, i believe), ending my active sighting.  i never stayed to see what the craft did, where it went, etc.  i now wish i would have parked to stay and watch it as adamantly as i did while driving on the road.\r\n\r\nthe object did not seem to move, or moved incredibly slowly as if hovering, and though i could not be sure of its absolute motion or stillness due to my own driving motion, i can easily say that it did not change locations much based on the angles at which i could view it ��� it must have been hovering or moving incredibly slowly for an extended period of time, and no airplane could have done what it did.  as shown in one of my sketches, i broke down to myself why it could not be an airplane (with a banner or without), a simple helicopter, a military helicopter, or simple blimp, and was left with no options to my knowledge.  after extensive discussion with others as to what i could have been witnessing, the discussions have only proven to show me more ways in which the object that i witnessed was operating and was constructed unlike anything known to myself or the general public.  if it���s man-made, it isn���t publicly accessible.\r\n\r\na friend of mine suggested that perhaps it was a harrier jet (sp?) because they are capable of flying in one relative position for a short period, however another friend of mine who was in the us army in iraq for three years said that that kind of jet would never hang out in one position for as long as i described, and would use a lot of fuel just to do that, while also making a loud noise that i would have heard even over my vehicle���s engine.  lastly, though a jet is angular, this object did not have enough angles to make it a jet ��� only four angles, and they were simple corners.  another friend supported my blimp theory by saying that that evening was the first night of the red wings play-offs, and could have been a blimp used to record the area from an aerial view.\r\n\r\ni waited to write this report in order to do some decent sketches and digital renditions of what i witnessed.  having finished them but still seeing no coverage of the object on local media, i was about to give up my urges to report it and move on to other issues in life.  then i saw this article (link moved to additional evidence section--cms/sg) which described an object spotted in texas that sounded as if it appeared similar to what i saw here in my own state.  after realizing that this thing may have made a re-appearance elsewhere, i knew i had to reveal my sighting to the world the right way.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:25:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":28889,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.3107366,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05012011-0007","longitude":-83.0632518,"occurred":1302747300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,
