ignored at the beginning of this but have had enough people witness these craft that i understand it is not necessary that it conform to anyone else's belief system.  after i figured that out life just kept rolling along and i lost track of telling someone who might believe somnething without a photo.\r\n\r\nthe first new mexico appearance of one of these craft was in may of 2007, when i lived in las cruces.  i have seen things here and there in the years before this happened but will tell you about those occuring here.\r\n\r\none night i was looking toward a very vivid sunset and saw a small golden orb north of the sun where it was setting.  i got my neighbor and her daughter to come to look as it appeared to be a comet coming straight at the earth.  i wondered why we weren't hearing about something like that on the news.  i went in that evening, not waiting until the end of sunset to see what would become of the object. i never did think to stay out but that proved to be okay as it happened.  \r\n\r\nthe orb was there again the next afternoon, obviously a little bigger and i got the neighbors again.  they again witnessed the craft and went back in.  i watched for a while and went back in.  \r\n\r\nthat craft appeared there for six afternoons in total, a little bigger each day.  on the sixth day it moved to the south until it was due west of me and still substantial in appearance.  it then began to recede into the distance and i watched until it was a very, very long way away where it made a series of three movement.  first it zipped to the left and up a little way.  then it zipped to the right and up, very near to above the point where it began the series.  the third move was to the left and up again, this time very, very rapidly moving into the distance and out of sight.  \r\n\r\nsoon after that i moved to deming, 60 miles west of las cruces.  that summer i saw two craft but thought they were satellites at the time.  \r\n\r\nthen on october 11, 2008 i went out to give a neighbor's dog a treat.  the dog took the treat but kept his eyes looking up past my head.  it took me a minute or so before i finally got up and turned around enough to see exactly where the dog was looking.  just north and west of where i was, visible over a row of pine trees next to my yard, a craft was hovering.  it had a large light lit, in appearance like a led but casting no light.  as soon as i looked at the craft the large light which was pointed down at me moved smoothly and quickly up to the front of the craft and the craft began to move in a south southwesterly direction.  i stood watching it, noting the lights around it and the very dimly lit red lights that appeared to be in a random pattern nearly covering the bottom of the craft.  it flew behind a group of fruit trees which blocked my further view of it while i stood, repeating, \"there's no strobe...  there's no strobe...\"  i was so stunned i didn't think to walk past the trees to see where it went.  \r\n\r\none week later, as i was walking the mile and a half across the desert east of me to get to the truck stop to see some friends, the same craft appeared just south of me a ways and at about the same altitude as the first time i saw it.  the large light on the craft did the same movement from pointed toward me to facing forward on the north facing side of the craft.  it then began to move in the same south southwesterly direction as it had the week before only this time i was able to see it go off into the far distance where it did the same series of movements as the one near las cruces had in 2007-to theleft, to the right, and gone!  \r\n\r\nthough i was often outside watching the sky after that, i saw nothing unusual.  then on june 16th, 2009, while looking east when the sun was beginning to go down, a large light very high in the sky just a bit due east of me caught my eye.  i looked up thinking at first, \"what star is that,\" then immediately  was thinking it was too bright for a star and had to be a planet when i got sight of it.  jupiter was in the sky then, close to the east horizon so i knew it wasn't jupiter.  when i looked at it, the craft nearly immediately began to shrink until it was a very tiny light which moved south for a second before shrinking out of sight.  \r\n\r\non the 20th the same craft flashed in the sky just north of me as i lay watching the sky just outside the trailer where i live.  a friend i'd told about the first sighting told me to be certain to wave.  that afternoon, about sunset again, i remembered to wave.  just after i did the craft did that single flash.  \r\n\r\nfollowing that a number of sightings began, nearly all of which i have recorded in a notebook.  early on i missed writing about a few of them, i was so uncertain of what i was seeing that i didn't commit to recording the sighting.  that's really okay for me, personally, as i remember each one but just don't know the exact date.  i could tell you about each one still in good detail.    \r\n\r\nsince that time i have seen them more than four thousand times.  the number of craft i see varies.  there have been nights when i didn't see anything, though the skies were clouded over on those occasions.  i have seen them on cloudy evenings.  sometimes they would appear in a break in the clouds and, in the early days, those were the occasions when they would be low and/or close.  i write them down each evening after i see them.  on a clear night, i've seen as few as one (though not but a rare occasion just one) and as many as twenty-two.  i also go out in the morning as often as i can do it (much more often now than in the winter, that's for sure!) as i see them fly in the morning when i'm out there.  since these sightings started i have only missed three days in a row one time (just too cold) and only missed two days in a row twice (sick with the flu).  i'm out every night, all year, if i can be.    \r\n\r\nthere was a period i wasn't writing them down each time as i went up the mountains near here where it's much darker than where i am, though it's certainly dark enough here to see a lot.    up to that time i'd recored 2399 sightings.  up at spring canyon, in the florida mountains near here, i saw very, very tiny flashes that proved to me that the tiny flashes i often saw, and which i thought my mind was inventing somehow, were flashes from who i now call 'my friends.'  after two months i started writing them down again as there seemed to be fewer of them to write about when i wasn't writing each one down.    \r\n\r\nsometimes the flashes are very bright and sometimes very dim and between the brightest one and the dimmest one has been just about every different brightness and intensity in between.  \r\n\r\nwhen they fly over-which is many, many of them-they range from very bright to very, very tiny.  i am thankfully able to see them when they are very nearly not even there.  on some occasions i thought i was seeing the atmosphere they were displacing around them rather than the craft itself.  in almost all those cases they made themselves visible enough that i could be certain there was something there.  on the rarest occasion i'm left to ponder but that is part of the beauty of this, it is never the same from one time to the next.\r\n\r\nsometimes they light up just briefly when they're flying and sometimes they light up and go dark again in a stationary position.  some light up and dim down across the sky, some light up and dim down and add flashes and some are lit and have flashes.  the variety is lots of fun.\r\n\r\noften i see the same craft again!  i know a number of them by what they do and how they do it.  i have named them f (for friend) 1, f2, f3, f5, f7, 9 ,11, and 15.  there are more than that i see more than one time but i stopped naming them because i might see them tonight and not seem them again for a while.  some fly for days and days in succession then not again for a long time.  i consider it my duty to be the observer though i do sometimes miss seeing a particular craft fly by and, often enough, it soon does fly by again.  \r\n\r\ni have watched ufo hunters and ancient aliens until i know the whole show i'm seeing again and did send an email to ufo hunters (which soon was cancelled) and to one of the people who often appears on ancient aliens.  since seti is fairly close i wrote them but got their standard response indicating that my experience is impossible because all creation is limited to seti's best guess of what's possible.  i have come to believe that seti's \"wow\" message was the pilots of these craft pretty much thumbing their noses at them.  \r\n\r\ni have had some information from casual conversation that others have seen the show in the sky here.  thank goodness!  i often wondered if anyone ever looked up!  and some of the opposition i've encountered has been because i say these craft are flying for me.  but they are.  if i go thirty miles east to a parking area on i-10 at the 111 mile marker, they fly there.  if i go 30 miles west to the closest west bound rest area, they fly there.  both those places are in locations far from area lights (the parking area has no lights) so the view is good there.  i have other experiences that were certainly for me-daytime sightings and two times evidence they were on the ground-so that i no longer try hard to convince people to come watch with me.  i ask them to come here because i see them all so i can show them, too.  sometimes i'll be looking the wrong way and a very small craft will flash a tiny flash just big enough to catch my eye so that i don't miss it.  \r\n\r\nmy feeling is they're some nice beings.  i speak to them often because i'm sure they can hear me.  there have been many instances when there can be no doubt they read my thoughts.  there was a period when i would look at a point in the sky and be absolutely certain i had just seen the very tail end of a light going off.  i called those 'illusions' and saw them until i was finally able to grasp that they didn't just know where i was looking, they knew where i would look next.  \r\n\r\ni call them 'guys' and refer to each one as 'him' when writing about a craft.  unfortunately they've chosen to let me see them and i'm not smart enough to figure out what it means.  it may be possible no one could understand that.  the possiblities are fun to consider though i'm always aware that my thinking isn't binding on anybody.\r\n\r\nhopefully you'll be able to understand the enormity that strikes me when i think of all these things going on here.  i hope someone will be exicited enough to want to see this.  i haven't met anyone here who is interested enough to continue watching with me.  i think seven people have seen some evidence though none seemed to be too impressed.  i can't see how anyone would fail to want to see this as often as possible but here it's difficult to get people to even consider it true.  \r\n\r\nif anyone-a ufo investigator or someone just passing by-wants to see what i'm seeing, they are welcome to stop by.  it is a much better bet to call me as i rarely come to the library to use their computers.  my laptop and camera were stolen in october and with those went all my pictures of the treats they left for me on the ground and i'm very sorry about that. except that i became aware that i was spending way more time online than i ever wanted to since the dawn of the computer age, i'd replace the computer.  \r\n\r\ni would answer questions if it were possible, if mufon can tell me how to work that out.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n

layed her down on my bed,coverd her up and walked in to my living room to watch tv.I noticed a light shining down on the tree in my back yard.So i opened up my back door and steped out to take a look.What i saw was a trianlge shaped ufo with 1 light at each point,1 larger light in the middle orange in color.The crazy thing is there was no sound coming from the ufo at all.It was just hovering over the top of the tree.Anyways,later i awoke sitting on my couch holding a burnt out cigertte.Starring at the back door.A few days later,i started have these bad dreams,they were so bad i was afraid to fall asleep. in these dreams i see aliens.The aliens that i saw did not look like the aliens that are in the movies.These aliens are tall,with dark colored lizard like skin.Long slinder hands and fingers.I can recall in my dreams hearing them make noises almost like they were talking.A few days after the dreams started i went to the hospital for pan in my head and back.The doctors didnt know what was wrong with me but they said my brain was swollen.I stayed there for a week.Doctors released me when i was better,but with know answers as to what had caused me to fall ill.I link it to what i saw and possible alien abduction.After it first happened i tryed to tell people,but you can guess there reaction to my story.Now i just try to live with it because it doesn't look like i will ever find the answer to what happend or why for that matter.Alot has changed as to my views on life.I still beleve in my religon,but i also know for my self that we are not alone.I still have alot of

in the woodstone subdivision. at approximately 3:25 am (before sunrise of february 19th) i was awake and laying on the bed reading a real estate investment book.  i was laying on my stomach with the book propped up on the headboard and using the light on the side table next to the bed for reading.  the bedroom window was open a few inches but the blinds were shut. i heard a sound that seemed like a ping from a submarine coming from the direction of the julia semmes library.\r\n\r\ni next hear the sound as if it were coming from fountainwood and judson streets.  then i heard the sound a minute later right outside the bedroom window. that really worried me and i wondered how this strobbing sound could get right up next to the house since there is a wood privacy fence 6 feet high next to the window that prevents anyone from entering the back yard.\r\n\r\nwhen i sat up i was glad the blinds were shut and suddenly my vision was blurred by some kind of a vibrational wave that shot down into the room from the ceiling area, travelled through my body, through the bed and floor.  there was no sound with it but felt like the vibrations that would come off of a loud amplifier.  i was stunned for a few seconds and then, i do not know how this happened, but i suddenly knew that they were going to come in through the wall of the bedroom to visit me.  i began screaming, in my mind only, \"don't come in, don't come in, don't come in.\" i was begging them to go away. i then felt that they changed their mind and i suddenly began to feel that i had been respected and they were not going to come in.  \r\n\r\nmy sense of normalcy returned, i was telling myself that i was just being silly and stop having an over active imagination and decided to sit back again with my back leaning on the head board of the bed.  i moved my feet up and bent my knees so that i could put my book on my thights and started to read again.  at this point i was facing the bedroom door to the hallway which also gives me a view of the other bedroom door in the hall.  i was the only person on this side of the house by the way.  no one else in the family woke up or heard any of this noise as they were asleep on the other side of the house.\r\n\r\nsuddenly, in my minds eye, i saw two little greys standing in the doorway of the bedroom, one was about three feet tall, the other maybe 5 inches shorter, they were holding hands so seemed non threatening.  there was another being in the doorway of the other bedroom, about five feet tall, had a wider body, and head not quite so odd shaped as the greys head shape.  no clothing or any body parts were apparent on any of the three beings.  i did not feel threatened at all by their appearance.  of course, when i wipped my head up to look with my real eyes there was nothing there.  then i head the sounds of the pinging object moving away from the house, i heard it twice before i lost the sound as it moved away.  the sound was travelling towards woodstone elementary school.  \r\n\r\nthe street my son's house is off, fountainwood street, is a fairly busy street, even at 3:30 am.  it is odd that there were absolutely no traffic sounds while this event was taking place. believe me, i was very happy to hear cars driving by again even though they had originally kept me awake that night.  i had hoped that during this experience somebody would drive by, slam on their brakes and yell something or a bunch of cars would stop to look at the object so i would not feel so alone in the experience.  it was as if all traffic had stopped moving for a few minutes.  let me say that the sound came towards my son's house diagnonally from the area of the library and departed diagonally towards the elementary school--not using roads but floating over businesses and houses.

ruled a bug out because these are infrared cameras. the bugs i see whiz by but really arent that bright. some are slow and you can see them flapping their wings. as far as a lazer pen i haven't tested

miles west of downtown los angeles. under a shade tree, i had an unobstructed view of a cloudless sky looking towards the east, north, & south. i started observing what i thought was a reddish-orange colored metalic balloon floating in the sky,very faint, traveling slowly from south to north.  i then noticed there were two of them, one following the other going south to north. both were starlight brightness intensity & size during the day. they continued following another, then slowed down basicially directly above me, stopped, then the one to the south pivoted 360 degrees around the stationary one to it's north,then they started heading south from where i first saw them. once they disappeared to the south, i noticed a third white object directly to the east, which looked like a star since it was uncolored. it moved very slowly to the south. while looking at this object, i then saw a white passenger plane above me to the east of me heading east after it took off from lax & made the loop over the ocean. a few seconds later i saw one of the red-orange lights fly across the sky towards the plane, going as fast as the plane. they crossed paths and kept going in their respective directions. the sphere crossed the plane at about 30 degrees. the plane was going directly east and the sphere was going in a northeast direction. i was more curious about what i was watching as i really had to concentrate on their locations as they were very small and i assume very far away from me. i stopped watching them as they eventually got too faint to see as they were approaching the horizon,being hidden by trees & buildings. i was never afraid of what i was seeing, just curious. the feeling of seeing this was far different from what i saw on nov. 14, 2008 when i saw a triangular group of lights & reported that to mufon as well. that object was much bigger, at night, & more frightening. what's going on?","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

their afterburners above the residential homes. the jets shook the foundations and rattled the window frames forcing the occupants to step outside to see if a plane was in distress. he then described over the phone only hearing the jets and never physically seeing them. what he did see was an erratic fast moving star sized object one half to one mile altitude making no sound as if it had escaped the jets and continued it's evasive darting and circling flight pattern over the the herndon/sterling area. the jets flew within the vicinity for a second pass, but at this point nowhere  near the strobe flashing object.\r\n\r\nhis description of the object was a fast 3 pulse strobe of blue/white light followed by a quick single flash then returning to the 3 pulse strobe. the movement was extremely fast with quick turns and circles. the object was out of sight quickly as it is a residential neighborhood with a limited range of low altitude vision. the object was definitely outrunning and eluding the military craft. they wanted it and had no chance whatsoever do to the speed and maneuverability of this object. this object owned the sky!\r\n\r\nthis area is a no fly zone for small

like random lightning flashes, but still repeating)    \r\n\r\nit was 10:33 pm (04-08-11) and we were eastbound on hwy 30, 10 miles west of cedar rapids, iowa.  it was not foggy, but the cloud cover

with strobe lights flashing.  but it was not lightning and it was not moving like an air plane and it had so many flashing strobes contained in a ball or sphere shape...\r\n \r\nthe light flashes were bright and a blue-ish color (not white and not quite the color of lightning).  all these pulses of light seemed contained in a round or ball like shape.  the individual flashes of light were coming from all areas inside this ball.  it was not just like 1, 2, or 3 light bulbs flashing ���it was many more, and it created this round shape in the sky at the bottom of the cloud cover.  you could see the round shape, but could not see a structure, just light and the glow of the light created a glowing circle (with the quick pluses of lights flashing inside the sphere).  it was not moving, just hovering as we drove down the highway.\r\n\r\nwe turned around about a quarter mile down the road to track back.  we were driving on a divided highway could not get turned around sooner.  i watched

half to cross it. the 3 lights were dimmer then the big dipper stars and moved in a straight line towards the east. no sound. slightly hazy sky. a plane crossed the path a couple of minutes later but you could see it was a plane and you could hear the plane. after the plane passed you could no longer see the front light but the ufo passed and was in the distance and you could still see the 3 lights clearly. i do not recall anything between the 3 objects. it may not have been solid. my wife confirmed that. the lights to her were roundish triagle shaped objects. she first thought they were birds then saw they were not she told me and i looked up and saw the lights passing the big dipper. i stood up and follwed the objects and walked along my footpath. but the lights were so fast they glided by quickly. no sound at all. the plane that passed by a couple of minutes later was loud and it appeared to be at approximatley the same level as the 3 lights. the 3 lighted triagle size was able to fit between the two stars that make up the big dippers spoon top and beginning of the handle. it glided smoothly. it was not a delta winged stealth bomber. i have seen that shape and it was not the same. to me it weas almost a crooked triagle shape. the light that was on the north end appeared to be a little off like a plane looks when it is turning. noted by  another plane turning later that night. >>> afterwards we kept looking and saw lights in the sky above the foothils. above the \"a\" in the azusa, ca. mountains just south of the san gabriel river, above the firestation. the lights were behind the mountains or on top. as we watched my wife saw thee lights swirling around \"as if they were playing\". i saw 2 very dim lights start to go up. as they continued to climbed one came out of the west and swirled around birdlike but fast maybe a hundred feet above foothill bl. and my apartment. right where the old foothil drive in marqee still stands. we have both seen a lot of strange lights in the foothilss here and glendora, ca., irwindale, ca. i think this area could use a camera pointing at a couple of spots in the hills. also, in sept. of i thnk 2005 we saw a triagle pass over the miller beer factory. and a light above glecdora, ca with fiber optic lights coming out of it shooting lighted balls out of it. scared my wife and made her a believer in ufo and strange things she can not explain. she never beleived me until then and now she looks a lot up into the stars. we were trying to see the lights from the rocket from vandenbeurg airforce base but my wife did not know wichw way to look so we were looking north and up. not south like we should have been .We were looking in the wrong place but it turned out to be the very best and right place to look. she doesn't want to tell anybody because people will think she is crazy. i think i am crazy already and will tell everybocy. so what. what i see is what i see and i do not care who believes me. i wanted to say something because tyhe last two really good sightings i had. werenot given to mufon. i finally found out you guys do sightins reports and now i will be informing you the day after or if on the week end the day i come back to work. i saw a ball in los angeles 1996, followed by a heuy two proped helicopter and know that the balls are at least 3 3 1/2 feet waide. i saw the  army army gut with his machine gun looking at me while i looked at me back. different story but i have been waiting to say my piece. also one story in glendora, ca 2006 with 8 balls of light that looke dlike ballons at firts, then birds flying in formation then forming a stright line, half moon and zooming away trunign and flying east above the foothils. enough for now. we have drawnings of what we saw last night.

(32 sec) on my cell that is time stamped \"04/14/2011 09:27pm\" we were watching the activity for about a minute and a half or two minutes before i began shooting. the footage does not reveal anything, but it recorded my wife and i talking about what we were seeing and it marked the time. twenty minutes later we saw two more ufos.\r\n\r\nwe were just taking a stroll around the neighborhood. we turned a corner and were facing west. before us at this point was about five miles of open land then there was the outline of the foothills spreading north and south. it is very dark where we were and we stopped to look at the starry sky. high in the sky at about \"one o'clock\" my wife and i saw a bright white light moving very quickily toward the south. it was first a fast moving ball of light then a \"contrail\" appeared on the end of it. it wasn't a contrail, but a long trailing light like a rocket shooting up into space, but this was going north to south and there was no smoke. the contrail appeared only a few seconds.   then the light appread to angle down and turn toward us (we were facing west).\r\n\r\nas it headed north-east (it was veering to our left) angling downward (but not steeply) it flared up and a fan of light radiated out from the front and trailed behind. it was even all the way around and trailed off like a mist of light.  we could see the main white light inside this fountain of light that shot out the \"front\". then the fan of light faded, leaving just the ball of light which then disppeared as well. we scanned the sky and the white light appeard again about five seconds later, but it was bigger and closer (but still very far away). this then disappeared and reappeared very quickly even closer and lower. the ball of light then radiated a fountain of light again, but it was red and the white ball inside was now red. this red fan or fountain of light seemed to hover for what seemed a long time, but it was maybe a good 3 or four seconds. the fountain ended, leaving only the ball of now red light and the thing then veered upward and disappeared.\r\n\r\nwe live near an air force base and know the sounds of jets and helicopters. about two minutes after the light disappeared a military jet flew from north to south before us and hightailed it in the same direction as the ball of light. we know a military jet from a passenger jet. this military jet zoomed across our field of vision and went after the red ball of light.\r\n\r\nabout twenty minutes later we saw two more ufos high in the sky straight ahead of us. the second video we took is only 16 sec and is time stamped \"04/14/2011 09:50pm\"  cheap cell vid is only good for time and our comments.\r\n\r\nstraight ahead of us and almost centered over the foothills was a bright star that was there during the above episode. twenty minutes after the above and we were still watching the sky when we both saw a tiny ball of light come out of the \"star\". the tiny white light came out on the northside of the star and did a backward 'c' move and stationed itself above the star. it hovered for 5 or 6 seconds and zipped up and to the north. at the same time the star moved and went in a straight line to the south. it just began moving southward. this \"star\" was right in front of us during the whole thing and slowy moved in a straight line to the south and disappeared really fast after it begn moving.\r\n\r\nwe kept looking at the sky for another twenty minutes. saw many military helicopters moving in the sky before us, but no more ufo sightings at this point.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line

increasing in volume thunderous roar, approaching from the north-west. this made me look up. it sounded like military jet with the pilots really pushing the pedal to the metal. i did not see the jets, but it sounded like the ones i saw flying over andrews airforce base in maryland. commercial jets do not sound anything like that and fly much higher. (i see a lot of them, since i live about 15 minutes away from dulles international airport). these jets seemed to be flying pretty low and i have never seen or heard them flying over at this time of night - never. i looked up to see what is making all that noise, but did not see the jets.\r\n \r\nhowever, panning the skies from west to south, i saw what looked like a very bright large star, crossing the sky from west to south in the south-western quadrant of the sky. it had the same bluish-white tint to it that the stars do. the line of sight was at about 30 degrees angle to the ground. i could not judge the distance and did not see any shape that might have been associated with the object, but it crossed the sky in under 10 seconds and disappeared behind the trees i have to the south of my house. the strangest thing about the object was that it was blinking in a very peculiar manner. commercial jets have red and green light, blinking continuously without interruption. this thing was bluish-white, would blink 3 times within approximately 1 second, then would stop blinking all together for a second, then blink 3 times within approximately 1 second again, then stop blinking for a second, etc., during the whole 10 seconds or so it took it to cross the visible to me south west quadrant of the sky. these was no noise at all coming from the ufo directing - the roar i heard was rapidly approaching from the north - west. as i said before, the ufo disappeared behind the trees in about 10 seconds, but i kept hearing the roar for another 5 minutes or so. sounded like the jets kept flying around. then everything went silent. half an hour later the roar came back, but i was already in bed and did not run outside to see what was going on. it would not do any good anyhow, since the speed with which the object moves - it would have been gone by the time i got out.   \r\n \r\ni came to work and had to tell someone what i saw. i told the story to a security guard that i am friendly with and he said that he lives right near andrews airforce base and he heard they scrambled jets several times last night, which, according to him, they never do at night. he thought someone might have flown into washington dc no-fly zone or something. this confirms my suspicions that the roar i heard was military jets. the object could not have been a satellite. i have seen those and they do not blink, do not fly at 30 degrees angle above the horizon and do not get chased by the military jets because the jets cannot fly that high.
