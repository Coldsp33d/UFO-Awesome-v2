thanksgiving (11/26).  i was sitting with my father on my couch watching tv and my husband was on the computer playing world of warcraft. it was approximately 6 pm.  we live in an attic apartment, so the windows are low to the ground. i remember looking to my left and seeing three strange looking lights in the far distance from the window. they were brighter than stars, making it impossible to not notice.  my initial thought was ufos, i've always believed in their existence. my father was positive they were airplanes and my husband really didnt care. that was when i grabbed my video camera and the first tape i could find, rewound the last three minutes (i was afraid to miss them, so thats why i only rewound that little of time on the tape) and filmed the lights until the tape ended. the lights would pulsate very lightly from extremely bright to extremely dull, as well as move in a triangular conveyor belt motion.  they also would change from three lights to four, to five, back to three, etc. the lights were visible until the early morning hours, roughly 3ish is when we usually go to sleep and i can remember them still being there.\r\n\r\nthe next day, my husband went out with his father and thought to mention it to him, since my father-in-law is a valet at the newark airport.  he told my husband that the lights were visible from the airport, but they werent able to identify them. he also told my husband that fema and the military had been called to the airport because of these strange lights. the lights appeared the exact same way that night, this time i watched them until 5 am, sporatically filming them on the same tape. this was the first time i was able to see their departure, which almost resembled a lightbulb going out.  some of the lights would disappear behind some trees that were obstructing my view.  this occured every night until we left for our honeymoon in january, which strangely, the person who was watching our apartment said he didnt' see the lights at all during the week we were gone.\r\n\r\non christmas eve, the lights were out during the day, roughly 4pm, and i grabbed my camera and started filming. this is when i was actually able to capture several shapes on film because it was still daylight. there were two distinct objects i captured on film. one looks like a shiny metal sphere floating in the sky. the second is actually saucer shaped with two bright lights coming from the center of the craft. when i first saw these shapes, i started freaking out and called my husband over so he could see them too.  i filmed the lights late into the night. this was also the first night i noticed one of the lights release a much smaller red light that shot out of the center light and disappeared to the left (my right) of the craft.  by the time we left for our honeymoon, i had an entire tape filled with footage, and i gave it to my friend so he could make the footage an .Avi file for me. my camera is an older model, so its not usb compatable. \r\n\r\nafter we got back, the lights would appear for a few days and disappear for a few days, always hovering in the same location and repeating the same actions.  about a month ago, the lights stopped coming. it wasn't until three nights ago that they appeared again. i thought it was strange because for a while they were scaring me so i wished they would go away, and three nights ago, i mentioned to my husband that i kind of missed seeing them, and literally 30 min to an hour later, they were out and have been ever since. the lights still behave in the same way, with the pulsating light and in the conveyor belt motion.  also to note, when they're out, you can always see airplanes  flying much higher than these lights, or in strange directions that you wouldn't see planes normally fly.\r\n\r\nthe videos im attaching were the most intriguing parts of my footage dressed up using windows movie maker for youtube. the original file from the tape is 58 minutes long. email me if you are interested in seeing the whole thing.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My first sighting took place on a mild autumn evening in october of 1982 in taft, calif. taft is located approximately 40 miles southwest of bakersfield. it was dusk and there was a football game going on over at the taft high school football field. i was visiting with my dear friend and landlady mrs. pearl at the time.  i had recently got off from work and we were snacking while playing a game of cards in her living room.\r\n\r\nas we played cards, we played some low music on her record player and i really wasn't paying any attention to the background noise of the airplane buzzing over the high school football field a block and a half away. the grand stands sounded fairly filled with spectators at this game- so, i don't know how she heard the announcement over the school's pa system that the local paragliding team were about to land on the high school football field during the halftime rah rah. the high school was a block from our residence, with two rows of mostly modest single story clapboard bungalow houses that are between us and taft union high school campus. \r\n\r\nupon hearing the announcement, mrs. pearl said \"let's go out and see the skydivers' show during halftime!\" i was a bit reluctant because i really didn't think that was such a big deal- i never was much of a fan of anything related to football, either.  we went out to the front yard and we both watched as the airplane circled over the taft high football field when mrs. pearl asked me \"did you see something fly by?\"  i didn't really catch view of anything except some motion out of the corner of my eye because i was focused on the circling airplane over the high school stadium at the time but, i shrugged it off responding with something like \"maybe you saw a flock of birds?\". i was thinking that i had caught something just out of the corner of my eye, but i wasn't sure. although i don't recall seeing anything, i followed with the explanation that \"flocks of birds will sometimes fly in a v formation\". \r\n\r\nwe continued to watch as the plane as it circled above the football field with the stadium lights on, the sounds of the high school marching band playing, and stadium bleachers filled with spectators. i recall thinking it was taking quite a while for this show to start when we both suddenly caught sight of an extraordinary object consisting of 5 round neon green circles flying in a v formation, silently from west to east. it's size was about 50 feet across and was gliding silently about 100 feet (or less) above the rooftops of the houses directly across the street from where we were standing and facing. we watched until it quickly disappeared as it headed east in the direction towards bakersfield.\r\n\r\nour jaws literally dropped open in disbelief. my landlady immediately grabbed for my arm in apparent shock as we watched this object return. now, traveling parallel to it's previous flight path, quickly disappearing into the amber colored haze in the west.\r\nwe didn't even have time to compose our thoughts before it returned again, flying closer to us each time, gliding in the opposite direction, now banking slightly northeast towards bakersfield.\r\n\r\nit's appearance was unconventional in every way: when viewed from the side it looked to be only several inches thick (if even that), incredibly thin in fact, not having any kind of fuselage or capsule present that could contain even the smallest human being; no sign of external metal casing, no landing gear, no engines or their sounds, and from our perspective when appearing straight from behind it was like watching a long, thin, green, neon tube in the sky.\r\n\r\nas it banked slightly northeast it appeared as a thin slit of luminescent chartreuse or a bright lime green. almost similar in color to a green traffic light and at least as vibrant in luminescence as a traffic light. we watched as it flew away disappearing into a mostly clear sky with a full moon rising and a few patches of clouds. we could only look in disbelief at each other shaking our heads, saying to each other \"what the hell was that?!\" seemed like only a quick moment had passed when this same formation returned again, flying at about the same low altitude overhead in the opposite direction now, towards the west. it's flight path having moved the length of it's own width south with each passing. it's span was at least the width of lucard street as it passed overhead while we stood in front of my landlady's house. \r\n\r\nin hindsight, it could have also appeared as though it might have been conducting a scanning of the area, because of the way that it appeared to be methodically panning back and forth (traveling from east to west in our first visual contact, then returning traveling from west to east).  with each passing it was also moving parallel and south, at least it's own width, to it's own previous flight pattern.\r\n\r\nby now the paragliders had obviously started their own descent onto the football field and we could hear the crowds in the stands cheering them on as their smoking red flares left their trails behind them in the dusk of the early evening sky. \r\n\r\nduring this object's last observable pass from us, we were standing underneath this craft as it flew over us standing in mrs. pearl's front yard. i would describe it as a transparent molecular structure within these five precise lime green circles, which flew evenly spaced and in unison, as if it were one craft. though from our close vantage point did not appear to be connected to each other in any visible way. the insides of the luminescent neon lime green circles appeared to be of a kinetic nature, or even electrically charged in appearance. to use a an analogy: it's observable structure reminded me of active cellular structures when viewed through a microscope.\r\n\r\nat this last overhead fly over, my land lady in a state of panic, ran into the house and immediately called the local police station to make a report. after which she then contacted our local airport to make another report, wanting to alert a controller there of her sighting and asked if he would inquire whether the pilots or paragliders had also witnessed anything during their performance flight over the high school. needless to say that the response from both parties she contacted were humorously quick, if not ridiculing, to dismiss her concern about the incident. i responded at her attempts to explain to authorities with a smug \"mrs. pearl, they don't care about what we saw and i wouldn't have bothered with that process, myself\". nevertheless, she was compelled to alert the authorities while i was personally offended at how she was regarded by those very same authorities. \r\n\r\npersonally, i didn't care if anyone in authority ever knew or even heard about the incident because i feared the potential ridicule. i knew that we had witnessed something extremely unique and at the same time completely unnerving. we were both really startled by the close range of the sighting we had witnessed over the course of about 7 minutes, perhaps 10 at most.\r\n\r\nduring the very short telephone reports that mrs. pearl attempted to make with the local authorities and judging her reaction from their attitudes towards her by about her report, i could see that their response was to disregard the incident as a joke, or dismiss her as being intoxicated, which made her feel vulnerably insecure about what we both witnessed. we certainly weren't any of those things. \r\n\r\nit's a strange feeling to have the same authorities who are supposed to protect and to serve you, not believe you when you are notifying them of something out of the ordinary. i wouldn't have bothered with reporting anything to any of these local agencies in the first place and i told her that i was not surprised by their attitude. the airport ended the conversation with mrs. pearl by telling her that they would contact us should there be any further eyewitness reports, or after conferring with the pilots in the air, i believe. \"right\" i thought. interestingly however, that this object was actually flying somewhere between the ground and the airplane above the high school that was carrying these parachutist's. pilots and paragliders you would have thought might have possibly observed something during their descent towards the field. what about the pilots? was it also observed by anyone attending the high school football stadium or field that night? i really don't know. i have no question in my own mind that we witnessed something from another dimension of reality altogether because of it's extraordinary look and behavior. i wonder had we not run inside to make the report would we have possibly witnessed more fly by's? \r\n\r\nin an unfortunate and seemingly unrelated incident after this event, coincidentally involving the same aircraft that was carrying the same pilots and the same team of taft's paraglider's that we observed performing on that october evening in taft, california, a disaster was also to occur about a week or so after our ufo sighting:\r\n\r\n(taken from a report i discovered that was released about findings urging ntsb/faa regulations regarding sport parachuting and flying safety):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non october 17, 1982, a military version of a beech d-18 crashed during takeoff near taft, california. the aircraft had 12 sport parachutists on board; none survived. the safety board determined that the airplane had been overloaded with a center of gravity that was well in excess of the aft limit. the board was concerned that the faa was not sufficiently attentive to sport parachuting operations and that the safety of parachutists was jeopardized by companies that didn't operate their airplanes safely. the safety board urged the faa to do a better job of defining its oversight responsibilities for sport parachute aircraft.\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path

the sky.  my first impression was that they were the beacon lights on some radio towers, but i knew that there were no towers where the lights were.  i slowed down to look closer and realized that there were three lights forming a triangle and they were slowly moving north.  my second thought was that they were fire kites  by this time, the lights were almost overhead, but off to my left.  then i noticed another set of lights directly behind the first and in the exact same triangle formation.  the ligts appeared to be 300 to 400 feet in the air and the shape they made about 100' long and 35-40 feet across at the back (base) of the triangle.  i pulled to the shoulder of the street and rolled down my window, but could not hear anything.  i decided to move up to a parking lot and get out.  as i turned into the parking lot, i noticed a third set of lights directly behind the second - the same size and shape and moving in the same direction.  i have never seen fire kites maintain such a tight formation and move at exactly the same speed.\r\n\r\nfrom my truck, i saw all three lights from almost head on.  the triangle form was very clear.  after i pulled into the parking lot, my viewing angle made the triangles flatten out - telling me they were not very high up.  i grabbed my cell phone, ran to clear area and took a quick video of the third set of lights.  unfortunately, the video quality is poor, the lights appear to blink and go in and out of view.  these lights stayed consistent orangish red color, never blinked and never made a noise.\r\n\r\ni have attached the video taken directly off my phone.  in the frame, there are two telephone posts.  at the beginning, the lead light of the object is just to the left of the right post, about halfway up.  the trailing lights are just below the flare from the street light.  the lights will move between the two posts, the lead light almost in line with the top of the second post.  the angle makes the trailing lights almost appear as one, but the angle i first saw them at showed a good distance seperating them.  there is another light dancing in the middle of the shot - this is a flare from something on the camera lense.  the three light can be seen obviously moving.  cars go by oblivious to what i am watching.\r\n\r\ni did not think i was getting any video, so i quit shooting.  immediately after i turned the camera off, i heard someone behind me exclaim \"oh my god\".  the parking lot i stopped in was the vfw hall and someone came out to see why i had jumped out of my truck leaving the door wide open. two people from the hall also witnessed the lights, but i did not get there names.\r\n\r\ni am not someone who is quick to lable something supernatural, but i do not have an explanation for these lights.  i was in awe when i saw them, then schocked.  i thought about getting back in my truck and following them for a while, but then i thought i was being silly and just went on to the grocery store. \r\n\r\ni posted the video on facebook that evening, but immediately pulled it down for fear of ridicule.  i know what i saw, but it's hard to get others to believe it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

crisp. the object really didn't have any particular shape and was moving n to s very slowly. i did see a jet at altitude near it displaying a contrail and this object moved beneath the contrail. very hard to gauge distance for the sky was utterly clear and very blue. there was a 5-10 mph wind blowing from the north so i presumed it was a lost mylar balloon or some kind of reflective debris. it randomly flashed red, blue, yellow, green and silver as if glinting in the sun.\r\n\r\ni finished my walk and moved my car near a bench on the west side of the walking track that i could rest on and the bench was facing ese. the moon was rising in front of me on the tree line across the park. thinking about what i had seen i looked up at the sky again and was watching jets plow across the sky when i saw another object but this was ball shaped and solid white. it too was moving roughly n to s at a very slow pace and i could not determine how high up it was, greater than 1000' no doubt but i had no frame of reference in the sky to compare it to. certainly lower than planes that were producing contrails this day. it lazily tracked on a straight line when i saw another pair of white objects downrange from the first one. these appeared somewhat stationary. the first single object moved into the area of the pair and i lost track of them due to distance and glare. \r\n\r\nmy wife called me

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was in fenton, mi were i live currently. i was letting my dog out, and had to run out to my car for something. as soon as i opened the back door i noticed a bright flashing light to the ne direction(back porch faces north). as i looked closely and said to myself, \"what the hell is that\", i noticed there were blue and red lights flashing, almost like a strobe light. i immediately started to think of logical explanations, because afterall it was pretty obvious and visible to anyone who would look in its direction. i went to my car, got my stuff, and came back to the backyard. the light was still there. so i watched, thinking that eventualy it would make sense. i noticed that it was moving slightly. not fast, almost like a helicopter maybe. it went left, right, up, down, higher and lower, but stayed in the same general area and distance for at least 3 hours. the size or brightness of the light did not change much durring this time, thats why i say it stayed in same general area and distance. the way i know it was actually moving around, rather than my eyes playing tricks on me, was caause i had a treeline (a little mini woods)right in my yard were the light was. i watched the light move above the tree line, when i could see it clearly, and below the tree line were it would b hard to see as well because of branches blocking my view. i also watched it move from behind one tree to another, left and right. these were thick trees that didnt move to much with winds, the light was moving behind the trees. note: it wasnt the the trees blowing back and forth that made the light move, the light was moving,slowly. durring about the first 20 minutes of me watching this light, i noticed and heard a plane fly over my house,pretty high up, normal height for a plane, going towards the direction of the light. it didnt look like a comercial plane, but im not sure. about 10 minutes after that, a loud, low helicopter took off in the same direction, and basically flew slow, wide circles of the area. i didnt really see it after that (the helicopter, but could still hear it here and there and catch a glimpse of its lights in the distance. i kept stareing at anything i could see or hear. i just started to take notice of everything going on in the sky. i turned around, now facing west or northwest, and i seen, what i would say looks like a small plane in the dark, flying only a couple hundred feet high. no noise at all! it was honestly the lowest flying plane ive ever seen. if i had a baseball, i coulda probaly hit it with it. it had big bright yellowish lights acroos the whole side that i seen. thats why i say looked like a plane. i really freaked me out, as i watched it glide slowly and sliently across the sky. if i had to guess it was probaly traveling about 60 mph, give or take a few. eventually it flew out of my vision behind a tree line (a different tree line). all i could hear the whole time was a car on the road here and there, and alot of dogs barking. there is an airport in flint, but it was at least 10 to 15 miles away from were i seen this. my friend lives across the street from it, and when a plane takes off or lands, its really loud and shakes the house pretty much, so i know that the object not making any noise was unusual, especialy bein that low. after that, other than the light in the sky i was watching, there wasnt anything else in the air flying the whole time. after watching the original light for a total of 2 hours, as it hovered around bak n forth, i decided to go inside at about 1230 am. i couldnt just forget about it, so i found a window that had a view of it and watched it for another hour. it actually started to come a little closer to my houses area at one point, but took its time. at about 2 i decided to call it a night, but it was still there when i left it.  conclusion: it could of been helicopter, thats what i originally thought, but a helicopter staying and hovering in one general area for 3 hours, without any noise, doesnt seem likely. but idk? as far as the low silent flying object to my west, i think it coulda been a plane, but it was silent and really really really low. im a pretty down to earth, logical dude, but last night made me question myself, cause i could not find anything logical about the light to my east. btw, i tryed to take pics and video, but my camera sux and my phone camera sux even worse. as

i wanted someone else to see what i was seeing. i reluctantly called 911 to report it. the said they would send out a car. clouds covered the object two minutes before the first officer arrived. i explained to him i was not drinking and told him my story thus far. then a second object appeared in the eastern sky. it was a pale orange sphere that would grow fifteen times bigger with in a fraction of a second. he radioed another car and more officers showed up. this went on for 45 minutes to an hour. when all was said and done there was eight cars and twelve officers. this was never in the paper or the local news. the officers were freaking out cause they didn't know what it was. there response was \"swamp gas\", \"light refracted off of venus.\" then they said \"you can call us

interested. but then i googled wrightsville beach ufo and saw that you had a case report from the same night i saw what i saw. i felt i should chime in. \r\n\r\nin both cases, the yacht club members and the couple, they were both further away then i was. the yacht club is about a mile from the pier, and the pier is a few hundred yards away from where i was. \r\n\r\ni was out for a run on the beach and i saw a triangular object rise out of the ocean maybe 150-200 feet away from my spot on the beach. i was scared so i did not approach. it was a pretty dark night, but some stars were out. i could tell it was a solid object because when they orange/red lights in a triangular pattern rose from the water, the space in between the lights blocked out the stars behind it, indicating to me it was a solid object. \r\n\r\nthe object hovered about 50 feet above the water for maybe 10-15 seconds, and then shot off horizontally, then upwards from a dead-stand-still to incredible speeds with no sounds of engine thrust. \r\n\r\ni walked further down the beach and saw the lights again behind me, over my right shoulder. i saw them for less time, maybe because i had missed them start again, or maybe the duration was simply shorter. i can't much speak to the 2nd incident. i was trying to get down to the end of the beach. \r\n\r\nno later than 10 minutes later, fighter jets began to fly overhead, and i could hear at least one helicopter. i thought they were looking for whatever i saw. that was my gut reaction. \r\n\r\ni know you have no reason to believe this almost a year later, but this is what i saw. i will never forget that night, and it was a very scary experience. i want to try to not attach emotions to the report, and i don't want to say it was alien, but it was unidentfied, it was submerged, it flew, and i cannot say what it was. that's a ufo/uso to me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

bright lights moving towards me from the south east.  it seemed to be moving slow��� it took about 5 min for the lights to get over head and that was when i could see this object was triangle shaped with 3 lights on the corners with dimmer lights on the leading edge.  if i had to guess i would say that the object was moving about 50 to 70 miles an hour with no sound. also i would guess that is was  between 500 to 700 feet in the air and if you would hold a playing card out at arm���s length  it was about that big looking at the card short side to short side..  i could not see the craft it���s self and could only see the lights.  however as it went over head it blocked out the stars.  as it moved to the north west��� the lights on the corners did not seem as bright and it only took a few min. for the object to move far enough away that i could not see the lights any more.   i could not hear any noise coming from the object at all and it stayed on the same course the whole time i
