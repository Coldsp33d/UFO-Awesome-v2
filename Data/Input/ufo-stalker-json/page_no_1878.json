point had a fixed colored light, (not blinking)red, blue, and green. the round lights were at least 10 feet in diameter, much bigger than any man made aircraft lights i've seen otherwise. the triangle was an estimated 300 feet each side. the craft was approximately  300 to 400 feet above us and made no noise except the sound of the craft cutting the air. the speed of the craft was about 20 miles per hour, too slow to be a conventional aircraft. it was below stall speed and should have crashed, but it kept slowly flying west, up river until it went out of sight. time span was about 30 seconds. my brother still thinks to this day that it was an experimental military aircraft. in my opinion, it was a technology out of our reach and beyond our capabilities at the time. this is the only flying

took place when i was a kid involving an underwater ufo.  first let me give a little back story.  i am from texas and lived on the sabine river.  my dad moved us out there when i was about 7 or 8.  we had no electric or running water the first 4 years.  we lived off the river and the land.  i would wake up with my dad early in the morning to go and check trot-lines.  a trot-line is a line that has other lines attached to it with hooks and bait.  this is to catch more than one fish at a time.  i am sorry if you already know this, but so many people ask me what it is.  one saturday we got up about 4:30am or 5:00am to check for fish.  we got in the boat like always and started with the first line.  we were about halfway when i noticed a light under the boat. it was small about 4 to 6 inches across.  my dad noticed it too, he turn and yelled at me that i dropped the light.  i  knew i had not messed with the light, so i quickly scrambled around to find it.  i found it and turned it on and shined it at my dad.  he was making his way across the boat to whip my tail, but stopped and look over the side at the light again.  i am not sure how it happened but the water around the boat lit up so bright it was like daylight.  the light was about 15 to 20 feet around the boat. it came close to the boat and stayed still for a few moments.  i remember it was cold that morning but at that moment it felt like it was around 80 or so degress. then bam it shot through the water faster than i had ever seen anything move.  i watched for a few moments, by this time the day was getting a little lighter and i noticed a wake forming about a mile or so from the boat.  it just rose up out of the water without a boat. it was a big wave like the ones barges make. i thought it was cool but my dad looked like he was going to be sick.  you have to understand something about my dad, he was afraid of nothing, but he look like my little brother who was scared of the dark.  i sat down and my father drove the boat as fast as it would go.  when we got near the boat dock i was getting ready to tie the boat off, but dad just drove the boat right up on the shore, which he forbade us to do because of cypress knee's.  he got up and grabbed the 10 gal gas tank to bring to the house.  it was almost funny.  i remember thinking it is not that heavy, by now he had both hands on it and i could see the veins popping out in his arms, then it just let go and the tank came up hit him in the face and in the water he went. i  just looked him puzzled as he dove past me grabbing my arm as he went.  now he was scaring me, this was so out of the norm for him i had to look a couple of times to make sure it was him.  he dragged me to the truck, ran to the house to get the keys and we flew down the dirt road at a pace that almost killed us a few times. we hit the highway and drove the 45 minutes to my uncle dales house in about 10 minutes, how he did not get pulled over and thrown in jail i will never know.  he jumped out, so i jumped out he turned and told me to get my ass back in the truck we were not staying. my dad came out with my uncle dale who look just as puzzled as i felt. dad jumped back in our truck and uncle dale followed in his truck.  my dad had to stop and wait for uncle dale a few times cussing louder each time.  we finally get back to the river and dad and uncle dale go over to the boat.  my uncle dale had been a radioman in the air force so i guess my dad thought he would know something.  i had to stand back from the boat because my dad was beside himself by now, but i saw them throwing something at the boat, so i eased up to see.  they were throwing bolts at the boat and the bolts were sticking.  they went back to the house to talk so i went over too the boat and started doing the same thing but when i tried to pull the bolts off i couldn't.  i heard my dad coming so i ran back to where i was playing at, so he would not whip me.  i saw them take the boat and our other boat out in the river. i watch as they sunk the boat with everything in it including the engine.  i was shocked.  my dad later told me if i ever told anyone about this he would beat me till i was dead, and i thought he would.   my wife was the first person i ever told and only after he died.  i would like to know if this has ever happened to anyone else.  and the boat was an aluminum boat, which i learned many years later that aluminum is not magnetic.  a lot of other weird stuff happened after that day, but i cant type it all so if you would like to speak with me my number is *(phone number deleted--cms/sg).\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

 while stationed at cos garry owen, just outside of the city of al amarah,  i witnessed a ufo event that my friends and i could not explain away.  \r\n\r\nit happened late at night, close to 11 or midnight local time.  we were all sitting outside of our living trailer enjoying the coolest part of the day and listening to music.  we had a cloud ceiling that night and no stars or moon were visible.  usually a clear night meant we would be running for shelter due to the fact that insurgents liked to fire rockets and mortars at us on those evenings.  so typically cloudy evenings would mean that we would be able to get some sleep or enjoy some time outside with our comrades without wearing our body armor. \r\n\r\nmy attention was drawn to a single round light in the sky.  it stood out like a sore thumb due to the fact that there were no stars or moon out and that our aircraft (apaches, blackhawks, and chinooks) were not taking off or landing.  besides, our aircraft fly lights out at night so i knew it wasn't us.  i pointed it out to my friend christopher marko and he too noted the strange light.  we watched it for a while and made a note that it was flying in a manner that was highly unusual.  it seemed to be moving in all directions without any  concern for the physics of flight that i have ever seen.  it did strange right to left movements, looping maneuvers, and traveling in different paths.  \r\n\r\nmy driver, **(name deleted--cms/sg), went inside and got his camera and attempted to film the object.  it did not appear to show up in the view finder but he kept recording anyway.  before he got the camera out, two smaller lights showed up and were chasing the original light.  these lights moved very fast and began an amazing display of flickering, strobing, and multiplying.  this display lasted at least 5 minutes before all of the lights disappeared.  marko and i were amazed by what we saw and really were at a loss for an explanation.  we watched the film on his camera but it didn't show up on it's display screen.  he went inside to go to bed but i stayed up to see if they came back.  sure enough, about 10 minutes later they came back at the same spot.  they did very similar maneuvers and chased the single light again.  this time i ran after them as far as i could before my progress was stopped by our t-walls.  they were low enough to be under the cloud ceiling but i could not make out the shape or what they were.  after the disappeared for the second time, i heard multiple helicopters spool up and take off from our base.  i am sure that my group of people outside could not have been the only ones to have witnessed this event.\r\n\r\ni told this story to all of my close friends and family when i got back home but was met with lukewarm reception.  they did not ask any questions or say much at all.  i don't think they wanted to upset me or hurt my feelings by saying that they did not believe me.  i just happened to be going through all of the pictures that my friends and i took in country and came across the two video files that we shot that night.  i realized that i had never watched them on my computer or a big screen before so i decided to do just that.  we did, in fact, capture quite a bit of footage.  i am attaching the video file for you to review.  i am hoping that you all can enhance the video quality and examine the phenomenon as well.  i know that they were not flares from a helicopter or aircraft because those start in a single point and fan out away from the craft.  they were happening all over the sky in random appearances, and reappeared a short time later.  i know for a fact that we hold total air superiority in country so anything that is in the sky is ours so i have two theories.  it is either a ufo or some high speed new craft that i am not aware of.  \r\n\r\ni had to break the film up into two files because it was over the 25mb limit of my email.  i do have an original copy in its entirety.  in the first part you will notice the flickering lights and the randomness and vast scale on which they appear.  i don't have any advanced video software but did view it with the contrast and brightness on high and you can see the objects behavior more clearly.  it's pretty wild.  in the second part marko was moving around and caught our porch light, t-walls, and our trailer for a brief moment.  it was unintentional and that light was not what we were watching.  \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path

my sentence my mouth dropped into a look of amazement and fear because it was not a shooting star. i looked over to my friend to see if she had noticed the same thing and immediately out of a sort of instinct she looked away to her right. all this happened as i slowed my car and looked back at the sky and saw what i could only describe at a ufo or an aircraft of some sort. the craft was almost a diamond shape, dark in color almost camouflaging with the sky but i could see its outline with three distinct circular shapes in what seemed to be its front. the craft was so close to the earth, closer than a plane and quiet, we had no music playing in the car. it shot up away from us, not straight up, but curved almost forward and disappeared in a matter of half a second  with the electric blue light trailing, widening away from the object. it was so close, and big, i don't know what to use as a comparison to its size. in that half a second it was like nothing was ever there. i pulled over in shock and tears rolled down my cheeks and i yelled, \" did you see that?!! do you know what that was?!\" my friend turned to me with a look of panic and tried to laugh it off then yanked at my

flicker,and did not light up the ground around it. from mr reids house to where this light was,approx. 1 mile. behind the light is oak&pine trees approx.100'tall. off to the left at this same distance is a white building maybe20'x20'.To the left of it us a telephone tower with a red blinking light. the tower is approx.1 1/2 miles away. to the right of where the light sat down is a double wide mobile home about300'. between where i was and the trees,the white building and the mobile home is a 4 lane highway 264.This road runs east to west.I didnot report this untill 4/4/2011 to the wilson co.Sherrif.I did not get the officers name but i have his cell phone# *(phone number deleted--cms/sg).

that the light was back. i said this as he and i had witnessed what appeared to be the same object approximately a year and a half earlier in the same location. after the first event i carried a binocular in my fishing gear for a least a year waiting for it to reappear, then finally gave up and left it at home. it finally did reappear on the 26th of march, 2011. we witnessed this light that appeared to change color moving about near the horizon, at about 5-10 degrees above the horizon these movements were erratic and random and at varying speeds in all directions. it moved near the horizon at first and then gained altitude at times to at least 50 degrees. it made sudden stops and starts and moved like no terrestrial aircaft physically could. the light would dim at times and fade out of view only to return in a short while and continue its movements. we were amazed and continued to observe it for over and hour until we finally gave up fishing. here is the most interesting part; one of my friends used his cell phone in an attempt to document this phenomena. his phone would only record video for a short period of time,and he recorded three times in a row  for the length of time his phone allowed, which i estimate to be 15-20 seconds at a time. in the first recording you could here us talking and the sound of wind in the microphone. in the next recording which was seconds later a tremendously strong signal was recieved that sounded like random static, and underlying this was sounded like talking in an unintelligible language. it was definitely a verbal communication of some kind and lasted until the time elasped. the last recording which was again, seconds later, was the same as the first; just us talking and the sound of wind. my friend still has it saved on his phone and it gives you goosebumps to hear it. several days later this same friend was able to catch something visually on his phone and it is quite amazing. i have encouraged him to submit the evidence he has, so that others could hear it and perhaps offer some explanation. it was an amazing event, and the additional recorded evidence was interesting, but i am making no claim that the light and the recording were related, just a curious coincidence perhaps, or possibly something more. this is my recollection to the best of my ability, and i state these words as fact that is unquestionable in my mind, and is only reported so there is a record of this occurence.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":28620,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":21.3123344,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04112011-0004","longitude":-157.8540333,"occurred":1238050800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Hawaii","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1302533449000,"summary":"Light,

circle objects appeared on the crescent moon sitting low on the northern horizon.  at first i wasn't sure what i was seeing so i moved back and forth to see if it changed.  it didn't. there was 4 large lights inside the outer rim of the crescent moon shining very brightly when suddenly smaller ones began to appear on the inside edge of the crescent and then more appeared towards the left point of the crescent that were lighting up and then disappearing.  the 4 large cirle objects were evenly spaced and covered about 2/3 of the outer rim and began just below the right point at the top of the crescent.  as i stared the smaller lights began to appear and some were moving and disappearing while a few ringed the inner edge of the crescent just inside the edge. next the moon appeared to be shimmering with lights.   i ran to get my son up to see it but by the time we returned outside it was gone.  the color of these lights was the same color of the crescent moon having the color yellow on the horizon.  i believe it was around 1:30 to 2:00 as i did not record the exact time.  it was cool to watch when the lights were causing the shimmering effect and this is why i ran to get my son to see it.  my son searched and noticed someone in alaska saw something similar to what i saw so i am making this

and i frequently sit out front with the dog and stare up at the stars. we know the planets by now and several of the brighter stars up there thanks to her sky map/phone. we thought it would be fun to take some moon pictures so i got out all the gear to do so. i set up a big telephoto lens with a 2x magnifier and mounted it to the tripod. i dialed it in at about 2200mm so that the moon was filling most of the frame. when you're zoomed in that close, the moon moves pretty fast through your field of view so you end up readjusting the thing fairly often. we watched the moon for about twenty mins, chatting away and taking pictures. suddenly, a very bright star appeared, very close to the moon on the bottom left. we both shouted at the same time \"did you see that!?\" it stayed right next to the moon for maybe 20, 30 seconds and then started to travel at a 45 degree angle up and to the left away from the moon. it was no bigger than the stars it was passing by but it was many times brighter. it traveled slowly across the sky in a direct line from a to b which was about index finger to pinky distance if you hold your hand out and make a bullhorn (that's what i did lol). then it stopped and stayed lit up for maybe 30 seconds more before it blinked off. we were certainly excited to see this and a little bit \"spooky ookey\" afterward but its that feeling of amazement you cant describe when you know that you are witnessing something other worldly. \"so where's the damn picture?\" well, i was trying to readjust/refocus on the moon when this thing blinked on and i just stopped thinking. we both simply could not take our eyes off of it! that's prob the hardest part to explain. we had it all set up to take pictures, tripod, giant lens and i'm even aimed right at the damn thing and all i could do was stare, up, in awe. well we're on the lookout now! good luck on your search!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":28618,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.6398434,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04112011-0002","longitude":-80.3894436,"occurred":1302328800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1302511347000,"summary":"Bright
