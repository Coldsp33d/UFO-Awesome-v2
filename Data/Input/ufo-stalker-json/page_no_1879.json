(still describing my first sighting) from my perspective looking through an upstairs window the object had flashing lights which lit up one at a time in a sort of triangular fashion - which would make sense for it to be a large disc.  however, the second night when being directly below the object, i saw its four sided bottom with a light at each of the corners pulsating one at a time.  from my point of view beneath the object it distictively had a square bottom. the four sides appeared to each be at the least approximately 120 feet.  being as large and flying relatively low i am sure i can not be the only one who saw this object on the night of april 6, 2011.  i easily came to terms with the first night i saw the strange lights hovering up and down against the treeline that it must have just been some kind of helicopter; however, after seeing the same pattern of flashing lights directly above me - not exactly the same as when i was underneath the object i clearly saw the fourth light that was not visible from afar - i now have the mindset that humans both nights i had spotted a ufo.  i know there could be explanation for the flying object with a flat square bottom and four flashing lights, but until i see or hear about a human-made aircraft i can give no other explanation than seeing something from outerspace.  i did not have the ability to take a good picture either night, but i would like to know if anyone else may have captured this object on camera or could at least share the same type of bewilderment after seeing this object on april 6.  after seeing this i can certainly did have a feeling of embarrasement to describe what i saw to anyone, but i believe the truth must be told, so i submit this anonomously.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":28600,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.979751,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04092011-0012","longitude":-86.1121135,"occurred":1302157800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,   Rectagular,   Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1302404329000,"summary":"Rectangle shape ufo sighted in central indiana","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2,"locationName":"Carmel, Indiana","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:63128"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed","city":"Jupiter","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Ok. i was with my bff loura, and her boyfriend, jason. it was the night of my 16th birthday. that night,  i had a bday party . we were just enjoying the fresh night air outside.We were all looking at the stars, watching for shooting stars. i started hearing a loud but muffled humming noise, like a bumble bee makes.But it sounded electrical, a very unique noise i'd never heard before. all of a sudden, my girlfriend shouted, \"oh my god!!! what the hell is that!!??\" i looked over my left shoulder to the mansion across the street from my moms house.On top of this huge house was a craft. it had circle lights of red, orange, green and yellow all around the middle of the craft. it was hovering over the house in a constant, frozen like state. we were simply mesmorized ! it did not move. and i know that not even a helicopter or even a fighter jet can do  that for as long as this craft did.We stood there with our eyes wide open staring and our mouths agape. \"no really guys, what is that?? it's not a plane, not anything from our technology! \" i said, trying to make sense of what we were all three seeing plain as day right in front of our very faces. we stood there, amazed and in a trance. we were simply spellbound by the mysterious thing we saw and how it hovered motionless and magically and perfectly  just a foot above this house.We watched it for a good ten to 15 minutes. i was totally mystified by this bright colorful disc that i saw. it was about 100 feet across. it was about 20 yards away. it continued to hover above the house . then suddenly i got very  very scared.I was frozen with fear. what was this amazing thing?? \"it's probly abducting the people in that house\" i said.Laura agreed, she thought so too.I asked jason if he saw and heard what we did.He reluctantly said\"yes, i  do see that and it's actually really starting to creep me out!\" i felt a shockwave of emotion building up inside me. i have never been so amazed and fascinated and so scared in my whole life. jason started walking towards the craft. laura shouted , \"what are you crazy where do you think you are going, mister?\" \"no... it's ok... i want to see \"them\"! it'd be so cool!\" he argued.Then out of still night i just got this strong feeling that we were being watched.Like whatever we had been looking at realized that we were there, right there next to it. a big whitelight shined down from the bottom center of the disc. well i wasn't about to stick around there and find out what happens next. i turned around and ran as fast as i could back to my moms house. laura and jason quickly followed suit. once we got inside the house, we went into my bedroom and i opened the window.I looked out my window and  i could still see the white light,it was scanning over my moms house and yard. like \"they\" were searching for us. it was scary as hell. just then, our toy terrier teddy started barking and yelping.  i didn't want to wake anyone up so we all sat on the bed in my room, stunned, in total awe and silence. , and total disbelief of what we had just seen. \"are you sure that thing wasn't a plane?\" laura asked.\"awjeez babe, that was crazy! that's what it was!\" we nervously all laughed it off.Still amazed , we all three agreed with a pinky promise to never breath one word of what we saw, for fear of ridicule. noone would believe us... they'd think we were stupid, crazy, or just lying for attention. just last year (20 years later) i finally  spilled the beans to my parents about what happenned and what i saw that starry night. they laughed, thinking i was kidding.\"no mom, for real.\" i argued. \"must of been some good drugs...\" my dad kidded me.Well we were completely sober.Neither myself nor laura or jason have scitzophrenia or dilusions. we had no drugs, this thing was as real as real can be. i saw this fascinating thing and ever since have been abducted. i am seeking hypnosis therapy to recall surpressed memories of these encounters.All i know is that one night last week i fell asleep in my bed and later that night must have traveled thru astral plains.I was taken out of my bed and placed on a table.The greyson put this nasty gel in my mouth, i think to keep me from screaming. when i woke up i still had some gross jelly stuff in my mouth , tasting it still. and could still smell the hospital like, sterile but mediciny like smell of the beings. i woke up feeling violated, in every way. i would like to know what is going on.!!

at the time, in troy. in total there were 7 of us all standing outside yet only 6 could see the object as it blended in almost perfectly with the night sky. this large group of people included my own brother and another man who would later join the air force of which he is currently enlisted. we were in the back yard of the home smoking cigarettes when an individual frantically pointed to the sky asking something like, \"what is that?!\" i remember the date because it was not only cinco de mayo but also 5/5/05. had there not been others around to witness the event i likely would have never told anyone about it. \r\nthe object was flying extremely low. it was traveling so slowly that if one of us had chased after it we would have been able to keep up. it was not a large craft. it was a triangular object that gave off absolutely no sound or reflection of the lights below. it almost completely blended into the night sky in a way that seemed like it was mimicking it. it gave off no lights and had no lights on it that i remember seeing. however this event did occur nearly 5 years ago. the object traveled across the entire length of my yard and crossed over south boulevard/ 20 mile rd into rochester hills. because it was so difficult to see against the night sky everyone lost sight of it after it had only traveled a short distance. less than 100 yards. the object flew directly above us and never changed speed. \r\nwhen the object crossed south boulevard i could see that it was flying only slightly higher than the telephone poles it was passing over. it also released no vapors or any kind of trail that i could see behind the object. even though one of the people in the group was unable to see the object it is likely due to his poor vision or unwillingness to accept what was occurring around him. other than shock there were no feelings i experienced during this incident. i know what i saw and so do the others who witnessed this event. there is no way this aircraft was earth technology. it made no noise and seemed to cloak itself against the sky. if the object was under intelligent control it would have easily been able to see us gawking at it. it was literally flying so low as it was passing over us that i could have thrown a baseball at it and hit it. this event deeply disturbed me for some time after. it is only until recently that i discovered this website and thought it was necessary that i share my experience.","distance":"21-100
