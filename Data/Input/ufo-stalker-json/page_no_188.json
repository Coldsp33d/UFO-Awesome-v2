look out. she was looking towards the far end of our yard about 200' where normally it \r\n opened up to a large open field, but in this instance there was a string of lights abut 8 to 10' apart and the humming was now low and steady. there was a slight blink to the lights. it seemed it had a saucer shape and the middle was rotating. as it rotated a solid part momentarily covered the lighted windows, causing a blinking sensation. my mother, brother and i moved towards it to within 50' trying to figure out what it was. my dog hid behind us, not at all like him. mom decided we needed to go into the house and go to bed. the next day their was 6 to 8 inches of snow on the ground. the snow was depressed where the saucer was hovering, but strangely not melted.","distance":"21-100 Feet,

ashley street, very straight road about 2km long. i was on ashley st casualty riding when i realised no one else was on the road infront or behind me which i thought was odd as it is a popular road and usually quite busy that time of day. i decided to slow down a bit and enjoy the ride (no traffic). \r\n\r\ni suddenly felt compelled to look up and towards the sky to my right (south west) the sun was not long past its zenith so i got a clear look at this thing.\r\n\r\ni initially thought it was a silver balloon i noticed it when i was exactly adjacent to the object about 35 meters away and roughly 35 maybe 40 meters in the air. still riding i did a double take as it had not moved in terms of floated higher, or drifted away out to the gulf.\r\n\r\ni dont know why but i slowed down but did not stop to keep looking at this thing. i then started to think drone or rc balloon. still looking (my speed now 50kmp) it seemed to dance up and down only a few feet and started to morph shape from a solid oval, to a perfect spear then to what i could describe as a tear drop (horizontally) then repeated this vertically and horizontally again (the shape changing) all the while not moving more than a few feet up or down left or right. \r\n\r\ni returned my eyes to the road and rounded the corner onto mimosa st and pulled over to scan the sky in the direction i saw the object, gone.\r\n\r\nmy initially feels were a deep sense of curiosity then when it started to change shape i became giggly?   this \"funny\" feeling left within seconds then i had an overwhelming sense of safety/security about me, i can best describe this feeling like when you're a young child and you're drifting off to sleep on the couch with father sitting next to you, sort of like a confident \"everythings going to be okay\" feeling. \r\n\r\n\r\ni still have my doubts but what makes me think it was an ufo be it alien or government was the timing and the odd emotions i experienced.

asleep on his recliner in the living room. his wife was in their bedroom watching tv and they have a large window behind the head board of there bed. she states she \"heard voices\" coming from that side of there house. this is the left side of there house. there house's front door faces due east, back yard faces due west. she ran into the living room, woke up my friend and he went outside to investigate.\r\n\r\nhe went into the back yard along with there 5 year old basset hound. the dog immediately ran to the left side of there house, started barking like crazy, running the full length of that side of the house from the front gate to the end of the house. but while the dog was running back and forth and back and forth the dog kept looking up at the sky when it was barking. my friend never saw anything or heard anything. then the next day he checked his security system and had the enclosed video recorded. transferred a copy of it to his computer.\r\n\r\non the video, the circular light at the 3 o'clock position is a known street light. the bright light in the center and the two small lights at the 1 o'clock position are house lights. been verified two nights later. but the light we want you to investigate is the light at the 9 o'clock position.\r\n\r\nnotice what happens when you start the video! bye the way you are looking due west.  the video camera used according to my friend is a d link 942l ip wireless camera.\r\n\r\nthe reason i stress the direction is that due east over the mountains which by the way are approx 25 miles away is facing towards white sands missile range. due west is the town of las cruces nm.\r\n\r\ncould you run this video against any video enhancing software you might have to get a better video. also my friend is real interested in the luminosity of the strange light.\r\n\r\nnotice before you run the video it looks like a square light with a circular light on top of
