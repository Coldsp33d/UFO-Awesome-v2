lighting for aircraft, and the fact that they were amber glowing lights with no strobe or flashing effect (constant glow).  my next thought was to get to higher ground to get a better visual of the event.  then i realized i had to drive the 3 blocks west on parallel to get my camera to document the event immediately.  upon entering the garage door, i ran into the house and had my wife retrieve the camera telling her \"there are ufo's flying over the house right now\".  we went into the driveway and could see above and slightly north of our home two amber lights and started taking camera video.\r\nthe objects passed directly above us with no sound at all. they were in a constant distance from each other.  as it went over, the back light seemed to radiate around the other light as they headed in tandem southwest over parallel parkway. the farther south they went the leading light seemed to flicker and disappear, then the following light dissipated the same fashion.\r\nmy feeling during the event was \"i need to get home to get my camera to document as it goes over my neighborhood\".  my wife got on the internet and tried to see if anyone else was seeing this phenomenon.  she ended up calling fox 4 television to see if anyone else had reported this, they wanted the video.  it was posted to facebook, no one called back to confirm our

star-like object hovering what looked like about 1000 feet. i got my telescope out to look at it closer, and noticed that it was circular with rotating white, blue, green and red lights around the sides of it. i watched it for about 10 minutes before it disappeared over the santa cruz mountains. the area where i saw it was west of the quarry in cuppertino. before it disappeared, i also saw it shooting short bursts of what looked like blue lightning from the bottom of it.\r\n\r\nthis repeated again tuesday night, same time and area, and lasted about 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nlast night (weds 04/06/2011), it was different. i saw a very bright star-like object hovering over the same area (over the cuppertino quarry). it was too low to be a \"star\", but hovering so it wasn't a plane either. i got my tele out again to take a look at it, and it was definatly a triangle with bright lights (one at each tip of the triangle). it moved slightly to the left, then right, but hovered over the same area. as i was watching it through my tele, the lights all went out on it, but you could see four \"dots\" of lights lined up next to it. then, while i was still looking through my tele, the three bright white lights came back on. i watched it for about 15 minutes, then the lights went out again, and didn't come back on. at this point, the line of \"dots\" also disappeared from view.\r\n\r\nnow that the weather is starting to get warmer, i am going to start camping outside on the weekends to keep a good watch on the sky. to my friends and family, i have been refering to these objects as \"my

event together moving in small circles as well.\r\n\r\nbut the rescent events took place as i was outside my house actually looking for this object, as i said i have noticed it for years.  and, every since, i go out and look up in the sky to show others as well.  this object pulsates as it gets brighter and dimmer.  i see it every morning at around 6am just before (and in the same direction as the rising sun.)\r\n\r\ni have looked on the internet and everyone around the world is noticing it now.  some say its venus, the spacestation, or planet x.  i am no expert on astronmy but i am sure this is not venus or the spacestation and i don't know what the hell planet x is?  \r\n\r\nthis is the brightest object in the sky other than the full moon.  its size in comparison too the full moon is about a quarter of the size of the full moon.  if i never seen it move below the horizon in the past and rise up again in seconds i would say its venus but since i have seen this i am not covinced that this is venus.  the object is only lost due too the rising suns brightness.  and evetually fades out slowly.  also i have footage of it (but no cable too connect to my computer to down load it) and as i zoom in there is a crater like object at lower left corner of glowing star like object. the top 1/4th of the object is a black straight line covering the entire top 1/4th.  this object goes from the horizon up too the 10:30 or 11:00 o'clock postion in the sky in a matter of 2 hours or so. if you could help fill me in on this i would appreciate it.  i assure if you go out at 6am or so and look east (preferably with a telescope) you will see it, i assure you.  \r\n\r\neveryone is taking notice and an answer needs to be given soon.  i would be glad to meet anyone for mufon at any time(as long as they come too me) but i don't want any government officials contacting me at all.  as i do not trust them at all.\r\n\r\nthanks for your time and please contact me anytime day or night,\r\n\r\nsincerly, \r\n\r\n*(wit's name deleted--cms/sg). \r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

asleep. when i woke up, it was approximately 1:30 am (tuesday am). after i woke up, i realized i had not let my dog out to do her business, so i opened my back door and turned the outside light on to watch her, as i live on the edge of town, not in a subdivision, and there are other critters around. as i looked out, my eye caught an object to the east with multiple color lights coming towards me, at a very low altitude. there is a meadow or field of several hundred acres behind my house, so i have an unobstructed view, there are trees in my yard also. i observed the object for probably 10 seconds and i turned out the outside light. i also heard at least one helicopter, though i did not see it. at this point, the object, was huge, much larger than any airplane i have ever seen. i was standing in the doorway in my underwear, and it was quite cool out, around 38 degrees (we had a cold front move in that afternoon), so i decided to run in my house, put on some clothes and go back outside, which probably took around 10 seconds, and i actually ended up with some shorts on and one shoe on by the time i got back outside. the object had moved over the house next door, and was still flying low, around 2000' or lower, and continued to move west, i was now looking at the back side of the object where it was quite clear it was some type of triangle shaped object, and there were no lights on the back side of it. i observed it, mostly through trees now and followed it as it continued west.\r\n\r\ni ran out in my front yard and my view was limited due to trees, though\r\ni did notice another object, a single light, like a satellite if i were looking up in the sky (i am an amateur astronomer)to the south, moving north quite rapidly, and it began to turn west towards the object. at this point, i could not see much, due to trees and the main object moving out of my vision.\r\n\r\ni am outside at night quite frequently, observing the sky, sometimes with my telescope, sometimes with high powered binoculars, so i know the sky here quite well, and the star movements etc. dfw airport is approximately 30 miles south and a little west of my location, and fort worth alliance airport is also about 30 miles south west of me, so i am quite familiar with the traffic patterns, mostly are to the south of me, and there would not be much, if any commercial traffic at 1:30 am. \r\n\r\nfacts of my sighting:\r\n\r\n(1)i did hear at least one helicopter, though i did not see it.\r\n\r\n(2) the object was flying quite low, much lower than any flights going to dfw, between 1000-2000 feet. \r\n\r\n(3)there were multiple color lights on the front of the object, i remember seeing red, lots of blue lights, yellow and green lights.\r\n\r\n(4) i did see another object (light) to the south that was for sure moving towards the object, quite rapidly.\r\n\r\n(5) there was a kind of loud hissing noise when the object was flying over.\r\n\r\ni was quite excited after the sighting, having trouble getting back to sleep, however, i had decided yesterday, tuesday, to not report it. i changed my mind today, as i thought by chance, some one else might have seen it also.\r\n\r\ni obviously do not know what this object was, it was probably 3 times the size of most commercial airliners, and in that i live in an area where the military industrial complex is prevalent, i lean towards some prototype secret flying machine.

light around 2-3 miles away from me in around 2000-3000 feet of height caught my eyes, i then forget about the plane and put camera in position and took what i think is a clear proof of a ufo, i have the original raw file, which can not be done any changes too, but the picture i show you here i have put my copyrights on, for safety and copyright reasons, i was looking at this object for around 2-3 minutes i think, and then it suddenly took off in a speed and climb rate not possible for any aircraft i know about, and i know a lot of aircraft types,because of my work.\r\nthe picture is taken from

to remain anonymous. i have written down exactly what the witness said:  \r\n\r\ni was awakened at 3:15 am this morning by my german shepard, who came to get me out of bed. she would not stop barking at something in the back yard. she wanted me to go to the back door. as i walked through the kitchen i stopped.  i could see a whitish/bluish bright light coming in the window in the door and the back windows.  i had never seen any lights like this and thought it must be a helicopter looking for someone.  i did not hear any sound, though, and thought that was odd.  \r\n\r\ni am a retired police officer and at that point, i felt uneasy, so i went back to the bedroom to got my gun, which is always loaded.  i then went back to the kitchen and opened the back door, at that point the light just blinked out. i looked around the yard and looked up where the light was, and saw a very dark dull black triangle shape above me. it had no lights on at that point.  the object appeared to measure the width of my yard (50 ft.) just floated there, unmoving.  \r\n\r\ni heard a noise towards the back fence and looked in that direction. then i rmembered my flashlight and went to get it from the kitchen drawer, when i heard a sound in the hallway behind me.  it sounded like an animal of some sort (two clicks), so i shined the flashlight there for a few seconds but saw nothing.  i then went back out to the back porch and shined the flashlight in the direction of the noise i heard outside and saw a very strange, short (approximaty 4' tall), gray, humanoid looking creature with big eyes standing there looking at me for just a second or two. it just dissapeared - it did not run. then i looked up and the craft was also gone - i did not see it leave. i stood there, frozen in fear. my dog would not come outside, which is not normal behavior. i am hard to scare after 30 years on the police force.  i have fbi training as well and i thought i'd seen everything, but this was not normal at all!\r\n\r\nmy first instinct was to call 911 and i went to the phone, but after picking it up, i put it back down.  i know everyone at the police department and even though we have received a few reports of ufos in the past, i knew they would think i have lost my mind.  but i haven't.  i know what i saw. \r\n\r\ni then locked the entire house up and went to the bedroom, not thinking about the noise i heard in the house before until this morning.  my wife was sound asleep and i did not wake her, and i did not tell her about what happened.  i thought i was gone only 10 -15 minutes but my clock said 4:46 am.  i don't know what happened to the time!  now this morning i have a red sunburn on my face, neck, and arms like i stayed in the sun way too long. i told my wife that i saw a light outside and went to investigate because she is worried about the sunburn. i may go the dr. about it if it doesnlt go away, but won't be able to tell him what i saw.  \r\n\r\ni just had to tell someone that this is real and that i'm a 64-year old believer now.
