florida. we were staying at the 4 points sheridan hotel right on the beach. i was supposed to meet some new friends i met at the fest around 9 pm to night fly with me. at approx. 8:50 pm, i went out to the beach to fly one of my two line stunt kites with about 6 flashing different colored led lights attatched.(i had done this same exact thing friday night-april 1st from 8:30pm till midnight and saw nothing) people tell me all the time my kite looks like a ufo when flown at night with lights. ok, so, i'm flying my kite on the beach, not really a whole lot of people were out on the beach at the time. i had my kite in the air,lights flashing, ipod on, and was just flying and tricking my kite. it was a totally clear night, millions of stars, it was beautiful and peacefull. a small group of people walked past me looking at the colorful night display i was putting on. when they were about 100 ft. in front of me ( i know this because my kite lines are 85') i noticed movement in the sky out the right corner of my eye. first initial thought was a falling star. when i fully looked in the direction of the movement, i froze, what i saw defied explanation. 4 lights in a triangle pattern, 1 in front, 3 a distance behind it, all in a row moving south over the gulf coming from land.       .\r\n.           .\r\n            .\r\n    \r\nthey blended in perfectly with the stars above, same brightness, size, intensity, everything. you could see stars through it. i immediately let go of my kite handles, ripped off my ipod and screamed at the group of people ahead of me and asked if they see that? what, they asked? a ufo i replied. they must have thought i was joking, because they just ignored me and kept walking. when i looked back up in the sky, i saw the lights had stopped. they were still there, but stopped moving. i stood there not moving and observed the lights for about 20 minutes, too shaken up to do anything else. about that time, my new acquantiances showed up, and i relayed the story, omitting the fact that what i saw was still there. we continued flying for another 20 or so minutes and every 5 or 10 seconds, i would gaze up and it was still there. my wife shows up about this time and i tell her the same story omitting the fact it was still there. i didn't tell them it was still there because i didn't want to sound too foolish, and the fact that i wasn't sure what i had seen, and what i kept looking at was in fact still there even thought it looked exactly like stars.  finally, i couldn't take it anymore and pulled my wife aside intent on showing her the lights. much to my surprise, they were gone!!! my wife says to me, oh yeah, i saw them too ( while they were stationary ) and thought it was the little dipper. but she too noticed that it wasn't there anymore!! this was way too large to be a airplane,totally silent, but the massiveness of size was what really freaked me out. what did i see? anyone ever see anything

4/2/11 where i was pointing out to her the big dipper & north star.  a fast-moving white object, the same size and light intensity of a distant star in a faint irregular cloud that was much larger than the star and was a little lighter than the dark background sky, caught my eye as it moved from west-north-west to approx. east.  the point of light was too small to make out any shape, and the light intensity did not change (i.E., did not pulsate or flash). speed and direction were constant.  i watched it for 4-5 seconds before it disappeared behind trees. i heard no noise from the object.  it seemed very distant (many miles to light years) and one could have very easily missed it.  the arc it took across the sky in which i watched this was about 90 degrees, as i recall, before it disappeared behind trees.  it was perhaps 70-75 degrees above the horizon to the northwest when i first noticed it.  the cloud did not extend from the rear of the light, but was irregular and generally oblong, with most but not all of the cloud being behind the point of light; some of it may have been in front of the light.\r\n\r\ni've seen meteor showers and many meteors. i've seen a couple of satellites. relative to the meteors and satellites that i've seen, this was way too slow for a meteor yet way too fast for satellites, and was surrounded by the odd cloud. i was so surprised and it was so fast that i was speechless and couldn't even tell my daughter to look (not that she would have spotted it anyway in that time).  i was trying to figure out what this could be. after the sighting, we walked down to the beach and looked up again and saw a small flock of large light-colored birds flying very high parallel to the beach--migrating north, i assumed--i ruled out a flock of birds, for the \"ufo\" that i saw earlier had a point of light in it, it was much faster and distant, and its cloud seemed to have a uniform density.\r\n\r\nweather conditions at the time were cool

after nearby willow grove naval air station transferred all aircraft elsewhere due to closure, so there should be no aircraft flying that low nearby here). i stopped on the trail because a house's outside lights kept flicking on and off and i thought someone might have been messing around but after walking away and watching from distance after a fifteen minute walk away they were still flicking off and on, so i figured it must have been electronic malfunction. the lights were not dimmed like a dying bulb would look like. so i return to the trail where this home is located very nearby and i notice in the sky four bright, yellow lights flying extremely low over a corn field/patch of woods. lights were located, from this vantage point, one on each wing tip. if you were to divide the wingspan from tip to tip into three equal sections, the other two lights would be at the points where the middle section meets the two outer divisions. flying i believe to be around half a mile, at the most, in the air, coming from south east going north west i was basically looking straight at its head/nose section at the point. i initially thought it was hovering over the field but subsequently came to realize it was just moving very slowly. at the altitude it was flying i believe a car could easily outdistance it driving at forty miles/hour. i quickly grabbed a pair of 16x binoculars and by then, noticed the craft appeared to be gaining altitude and possibly speed, as well. it flew directly overhead of me and that is when i began to hear the propulsion. it was low, rumbling but not loud enough to wake the residents of the community it passed over. note: sound was only audible as it flew overhead. right overhead i noticed what appeared to be an obtuse triangular shape, with the obtuse angle being the nose. although i don't believe it was truly a triangle because the back end seemed to be bent inward toward the nose, similar to the f-117 - chevron shaped almost. again it was dark out and i could have mistaken it. i noticed that rather than four lights there were six that i can definitely remember. once it was overhead i saw that the wing tips had two yellow lights where the diagonal would meet the obtuse angle. there was a blinking red light underneath, in the center of craft that turned on and off about every second or two. also there were definitely what appeared to be masses of something on either side of the red light under the 'wings'. they reminded me of those detachable bombs from wwii movies, but again i could not confirm what they were. it flew off at a higher altitude and was eventually barred from view by trees. all the while and subsequently the lights of this house were still flickering. i'd also like to note this is the second encounter with this same craft at the same location within a week, all details the same. the initial encounter happened on march 28th 2011 before midnight, i believe between 11pm and midnight. i'll be out there with a camera to document as it seems this is a fairly frequent travel route. i have included a very rough drawing of the craft made in ms paint with a view from straight ahead and one from underneath.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":28529,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.959785,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04032011-0014","longitude":-75.157179,"occurred":1301822400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Chevron,

altura pero esa fue mi primera impresi������n,eso me hizo levantarme de la cama y acercarme a la ventana para observar mejor y saber que era, poco a poco iba bajando mas y acercandose a mi ventana hasta llegar a la altura de mi casa y como a unos 20 metros de distancia fue algo impresionante era una nave como en forma de caparazon de tortuga por la parte de arriba y plana abajo en color gris parecido al oxford sin brillo pero tampoco opaca algo especial no se com describirlo de mejor forma, se mov������a como una hoja de arbol callendo sin que hubise aire sobre su propio eje de izquierda a derecha y eso me hizo poder ver primero la parte alta de la nave y despues del otro lado y pod������a ver la parte baja de la nave, era lisa sin ninguna endidura,  al rededor de la parte que creo era delantera ten������a ventanas o luces blancas como se ven en un avi������n en la noche sin mucho resplandor, hac������a un ruido raro, mi hija que ten������a 24 a������os en esa fecha estaba en la

posteriormente su amiga a la recamara y coment������ que es ese ruido tan raro la hice que se asomara y v������o la nave antes descrita,nos quedamos mudas despu������s de unos minutos esta nave comenzo a avanzar en forma linean meciendose como les comente en su propio eje de un lado a otro, sin que la perdieramos de vista durante mucho tiempo, nunca se me ocurrio sacar mi celular para tomar fotos quede impactada con una sensaci������n de escalofrio constante, confundida,emocionada, rara y a su vez de igual forma mi hija y su amiga, debo decir que desde d������a tengo la seguridad de que existen, no se que es pero es algo desconocido para mucha gente, a la semana siguiente fu������ la salida de la escuela de mi hijo y me invitaron a su festival, estabamos todos los padres de familia

tiempo aproximadamente 30 minutos de hechos var������as personas gravaron ������sto y poco a poco se fu������ alejando hasta ya no verlo. esa fue mi experiencia, me gustar������a poder saber si

(it should be noted that this area is somewhat close to an airport so jets are very common.)\r\n\r\nthere was a shiny object in the western sky, about the same altitude as the jets, and i wondered what it was. at first i thought, \"oh, it's just a plane without a vapor trail. but it wasn't making a sound, and i couldn't see a tip or a tail and it was thicker. it almost seemed to be turning and giving off its own light, but i just kept watching and stopped what i was doing.\r\nthe object was moving at a modest pace, and the glare of the sunset made it very visible. \r\n\r\ni didn't think too much of the object until it accelerated inexplicably. not only did it accelerate across the sky, but it seemed to move away from the earth; either that, or it just became decreasingly opaque with the increase in speed. either way, it vanished very smoothly. i have seen jets and shooting stars during the day and night, and this was neither.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:07","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":28521,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.4288686,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04032011-0006","longitude":-86.8982555,"occurred":1301727600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1301868052000,"summary":"Shiny disc illuminated by a sunset glare","tags":["disc"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"West Lafayette, Indiana","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:63588"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Wolfville","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"When i reviewed the photos from my friends camera on facebook today there was this object in the sky, there was nothing in the sky that day, maybe birds, but this object doesn't seem to be any kind of bird. it may be water on the lens but a picture right after this one lacks any kind of distortion.\r\n\r\nunexplainable flying object indeed.
