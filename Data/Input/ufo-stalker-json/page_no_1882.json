1:30 am the morning of march 30th, 2011. i was sitting in the passenger seat and my boyfriend was driving when he noticed a very peculiar star in the sky, as i identified it as being the brightest thing in the sky you could tell it wasn't a solid color, but was red and white and moved around in the sky differently from anything else, he thought it was a planet at first but the object quickly appeared to be very large because it came towards us at amazing speed as we continued down the road and he began to slow the car down.\r\n    the object did not make a sound, and was defiantly not a plane or a helicopter or anything else that could of been explained away, the shape seemed fluid as it got closer, the white lights seemed to be pointy and protruded from the center of the object kinda like spikes , my boyfriend has better eyes than i do and as it hovered just above the treetops he could see definition of the object and described it as saucer-like with windows in the center, from what we both could see the center of the object was bright red, and was surrounded by 6 very bright but smaller white lights, 4 of them on the sides and one on both the top and bottom, the object was about as wide as the 2 lane street we were on, and about twice as tall. as soon as i realized that the object was not a man made helicopter or of earthly origin i became very frightened and had my boyfriend turn the car around and flee in the other direction. the saucer was so large and bright that it lit up the tops of the trees, and it also had what seemed like a beam of light that  came down to the ground as it approached us, it was only a few hundred feet away. it seemed aware that we were watching it and also it seemed as if it was curious about us as well, my boyfriend was mesmerized by it and would of continued to approach it had i not become stricken with fear and demanded we get as far away from that saucer as possible, i have never been so afraid of something before in my life. as we drove away the object was still very bright and visible in our rear-view mirrors, this thing defiantly was not a man-made object.   \r\n    my boyfriend and i have had ufo sightings in the past, 2 times last year in the same neighborhood in which we had the most recent encounter. the 2 previous sightings were last year of 2010, in the spring and summer, both sightings occurring during the day. on one occasion we saw 4 strange single-white-light flying objects that seemed to dance in and out of the clouds then come close down to earth, and dart around some more. this went on for several minutes and then the objects disappeared. \r\n     during the other sighting, we saw a single bright white light hovering right on the top of the mountain, as our home was at the bottom of the mountain, we had a pretty clear view to the top, we saw the light hang in the air for almost an hour, it had the same kind of white color that the object with 6 lights and one red one in the center had, it stayed at the top of the mountain and kind of hovered higher then lower and higher again, and eventually it settled down into the treetops. the other sightings have not bothered me or shocked me the way the most recent sighting has. there was no question of what i saw approach us a few days ago, it was terrifying and very real.  i really wish i had my camera that night, just so people would believe me, but i know what my boyfriend and i saw was not human. whats really going on out there? ? i would like to know if anyone has had any similar sightings in the area","distance":"101-500

-- cms/sg) is the same view we had, which leads me to think about what we saw as well. our photo was hasty and poor, as the camera couldn't photograph the sky and the lights at wide angle. the closeup was blurred.\r\nour view, compared to the video, was much closer and wider (if they were a single object), with about 45 degrees azimuth. the right light was almost to the south, perhaps  south-southeast as seen in relation to the  planet (i believe jupiter) in the photo.  the leftmost light was more to the south east, seeming directly east of the right from my view. the apex of the isoceles triangle it made was about 45 deg or so in elevation and between the two, but higher inclination. we saw the lights through the leaf bare trees mostly. \r\n\r\nthese lights never moved, either in relation to each other, nor in relation to the tree branches we were looking through. they looked liked planes in sky, but never moving and without noise. it was too large across the sky for a blimp, and again, no propeller noise. helicopters in wide formation didn't make sense either, and why would the lights fade out? we looked for solid material between the lights and could see none. the stars were not bright enough to pass through the sky, which was a couple hours past sunset. the sky seemed clear, but must have been a bit hazy as i don't recall stars that night, although jupiter was bright.\r\n\r\nthe lights faded out almost simultaneously after about 10 or 15 minutes. i tend to think they were synchronous satellites in the sky reflecting sunlight of the sun that set to my view a few hours ago, and blinking out as the west setting sun passed the horizon of the satellites.   given the time posted, my location on my patio on the west bank of the fox river in batavia, and the relative location of the undetermined planet, i bet that theory could be confirmed or not.\r\n

television, he looked out of our balcony door (to the outside) and said, \"what's that light?!\" i didn't respond immediately, but his reaction was strong enough to get me off the couch to check it out. when i looked i saw nothing. he said, \"what?! it's gone? that's crazy.\" he didn't believe me so he got up and we both went outside onto our balcony for a better look (we live on the second floor, on the back or eastern facing side of the building). there was some scant cloud cover, but through breaks in the cloud, i saw what appeared to be a red, twinkling light, ascending very quickly. it wasn't moving straight up, but it was an incredibly severe ascension. we also noted two other similar reddish twinkling (not really flashing) lights moving just as quickly in other directions. one of them travelled due south, and unfortunately we couldn't track the other as well - i'm afraid i don't know what became of it. our primary focus was the ascending light because it was the most baffling in behavior. there was also an airplane in our line of vision which appeared normal. in comparison to the lights we saw it seemed as though it were flying at a snail's pace. we have a limited sky view from our balcony so it wasn't long before we couldn't see anything anymore except the plane.\r\nwhen we came back inside (and as i immediately got on the computer) i asked my husband what he initially saw. he described a very bright, intense white light that appeared to be moving our direction (east to west). he assumed it was the headlights of an aircraft though the light was unusually bright for an aircraft that was likely to be quite a distance away. i think this is why he was so surprised mere seconds later when i looked and didn't see anything. \r\nthe whole \"event\" lasted maybe only 30 seconds - definitely not longer than a minute. after we came inside, i looked at the clock on our computer which read 10:12pm. we were both completely baffled by what we saw and had different ways of dealing with it. he kind of didn't think it was a big deal, but conceded that it was very strange. i, on the other hand, remembered the reports from lafayette last week and was looking online to see if anyone else saw what we saw or if norad, or somebody, was performing scheduled exercises. i also posted something on facebook, which people thought was an april fool's prank. i didn't know what to do, where to report it, if i should report it, or how to explain what we saw. i kind of assumed that other people would have seen the same thing given the population of this area. my guess is that these lights were quite far from our location which leads me to think people in other communities certainly could have witnessed these fast flying lights.\r\nunfortunately we have no photos or video; it happened so quickly and neither of us wanted to step away. \r\ni really hope this is helpful to somebody and i also hope i haven't made anything more difficult by not reporting it immediately.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    ","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with

seemed to notice it and then i showed my friend to make sure i wasn't crazy (for lack of a better term) and surely he saw it too. immediately it came into my mind that it was a ufo, even though back then i was still fairly young and i was never really interested in ufos or knew anything about them until the past few years.\r\n we watched it very slowly crawl across the sky rather mesmerized until it drifted out of view behind the trees. the object had very little movement but seemed to be shining brightly. the sight of it kindled some interest in me and really excited me as i believed i was witnessing something that many people don't see all their lives. it made me wonder if i was supposed to see it for it was rather unusual how i just knew it was directly above me, the sighting did not seem to me to be by chance. even though it was such a short vague encounter, i still believe it was something extraterrestrial/intraterrestrial/ultraterrestrial. i am rather positive this wasn't a satellite, concerning the very odd shape, and it did not seem military to me. however who knows considering the things our governments are hiding from us.

by any means.  one object was coming from the north horizon, one from the south and the other from the west.  if they were in the earths atmosphere, it was not by much.  the distance they had to cover was huge.  as i said before, they were all traveling at the same speed and toward each other.  the north and south object were traveling directly towards each other and the object from the west was headed toward were they were going to intersect.  neither of us had ever seen anything like this before.  it took the objects approximately 5 to 10 minutes to cover half of the distance of the night

grandfather,grandmother, and uncle.  the other sighting was sighted by myself.\r\n\r\nit was the 09' deer gun season.  my grandfather, grandmother, and uncle were deer hunting in cornell, wi near firth lake and were camping off a road called moses lake road.  approximately 1 am my grandfather spotted what looked to be about 30 lanterns outside hovering above firth lake.  he stepped out of the camper and to his amazment this was a craft...A disk shaped craft hovering over firth lake approximately 20 feet above the lake and the craft was approximately 40-50 feet wide.  my uncle stepped out of the camper and was also amazed at the sighting.  he grabbed a flashlight and flashed it at the ufo.  my grandfather yelled at him to not do that.  my grandmother did see it from inside the camper, however, she didn't go outside.  she pulled the covers over her head and hid.  my grandfather immediately knew what it was as now he states when he was in the air force \"they\" had a hangar were they kept a \"captured\" ufo.  he called it nfo for the longest time, but he meant ufo.  approximately 10 minutes when by and the craft as they say shot what seemed to be 100,000 mph into space and didn't even make a sound.\r\n\r\nthe second sighting was sighted by myself, however, i was bow hunting with my uncle.  approximately late october 2010 at around 4pm.  i was in my tree stand and i could see firth lake through the trees pretty clearly.  all of a sudden a white orb comes out of nowhere and is circling the lake.  it was moving up and down as well.  this lasted for about 5 minutes and then the white orb disappeared into the woods.  i had such a clear sight of it, it was just unreal.  i knew there was no explanation for whatever this was.  i was pretty shook up and i went to my truck early.  my uncle came out and asked me why i was out of the woods already.  i told him, he said \"hmmm maybe it was a duck boat?\"  this is the same uncle who tells the story of the first ufo incident by the way.  anyways i told him no, absolutely not, i saw this thing very clearly literally going in fast circles around the lake and moving up and down.\r\n\r\ni haven't been back to that hunting area since then.  they still hunt there.

light appeared fairly close and parallel to the first one.  after 30 seconds that second light disappeared and by that time it was behind me.  this was one of the most interesting things i have ever seen, it was definitely not a plane or a helicopter and i started to think maybe it was some toy a kid was playing with but quickly realized that it was probably too dark for a kid to be playing and the object was moving relatively fast, faster than an airplane in the sky and achieved a great distance while i watched it.  when i lost sight of it i was passing the flat irons crossing mall (on my left) and the object was to the right and behind me.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

on jacksonville florida beach in the dark . then after it did the strange show , it was stationary about 14 blocks on the beach out from the ocean . out of couriosity i walked off the beach on the

airport nearby about 4 miles. i saw what look like a plane flying real slow over gavin yard and also flying a little low. there were no blinking lights under the object, just a bright white looked like a landing light for a plane. the height of the object was about one and a half telephone poles high. i was wearing a headlamp on my hard hat and i decided to flash my light at it to signal it just to humor myself. the object changed direction and headed in my direction. the object stopped right above my tanker(semi-tractor) the object made no sound had no wings, no smell that i could remember nor wind. the object was black and cylinder in shape about forty feet in length with a white light pointing down and a little faint red light at the end of it.\r\ni got on my radio to see if anyone else could see it but everyone else was inside the tower, as soon as i got off the radio it moved to the south, i watched it for about two minutes and it went slow maybe about 20mph, i looked at my fuel gauge on the locomotive and then looked back to see it and it was gone! the wind was blowing from the west/south west at 11:15 pm july 3rd, 2010.","distance":"21-100

around 4am.  it was very quiet.  i saw a light in the distance that was heading towards me.  i thought it was a helicopter at first, with it's front spot light on.  but as it got closer, i realized it wasn't making a sound.  soon it was almost directly over my head and i just stopped walking and stared at it.  i saw no shape of the object itself just the lights.  there were 3 orange tinted, triangle shaped lights that were in a triangle formation.  picture two upside down triangles side by side and a third centered below them.  then there were 3 smaller, round, green tinted lights around it.  it honestly looked like the star of david without the lines connecting the lights.  it's hard to say how big it was, but i'm thinking not much bigger than a helicopter or maybe a small plane.  this thing looked like it was on course to fly right over the casino, which i was excited about because we have search lights on the roof, so i thought i'd be able to get a good look at the physical features of the object.  well, as soon as it got close, it changed course and went around the lights, completely avoiding them. once on the other side of the casino it continued its original course northward apparently along the mississippi river.  i could see it for some time as the lights were pretty bright and it wasn't very high... maybe the typical height that a helicopter would fly.  i finally lost sight of it because of the tree tops.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

off, it makes perfect sense. the disc doesn't change it's position. i say to myself, if it's a plane, it should be gone when i open my eyes. i close my eyes for three second and open them again. it is still there. sitting atop the clouds. if my next-seat neighbor hadn't given me the aura of introverted recluse, i would have turned to her for confirmation. after the incident, i felt nauseous the
