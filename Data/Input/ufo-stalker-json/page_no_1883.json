which i saw plenty of before and after the incident this evening. it was flying at about 2/3 of the speed of a regular shooting star.\r\n\r\nthe object(s) passed below the belt of orion, and when it just passed below the next brightest star to the left it appeared to slow down and it turned right (from the objects perspective). the appearance of the object slowing down was probably just a visual effect of it turning away from us. the original flightpath was from our right to our left, so when it turned southwest it looked like it would slow down or even reverse its direction. this cognition only lasted for just a moment. then it vanished behind the haze at the horizon.\r\n\r\nwhen the object(s) turned, the angle between the lights changed and their distance to each other shrinked. if one would imagine the lights belonging to the same object, then it would have tipped to its right. also just a moment before it disappeared i thought to see blurry lights between the obvious big lights. but the moment was so short i cannot make this claim without doubt.\r\n\r\nthe past days i've read various reports where people say they were scared - why one would get scared is beyond my comprehension. me and my gf were happy to witness the phenomenon, we went into party mode after the incident. although she would never call it a \"phenomenon\". it's clear to her that she saw one solid object, an ufo, sharply turning its direction. i'm however not of the kind to jump to conclusions easily. to me, there is no way to tell whether this was one solid object or two flying objects in formation. if it was just one object, it must have been massive in size, because of the distance to us. since the incident i'm trying to find out what this phenomenon could have been.\r\n\r\ni ruled out several common explanations. due to its rapid movement it could not be a plane. due its size, even if i think of it as two objects, it could not be a regular satellite. also, it was no meteorite, fireball or shooting star. it had no tail and did not leave a trail and maintained height. however, i've never seen the iss, so i don't know if the iss together with a supply ship would look just like that. i checked the iss sighting opportunities for the date and time, the incident does not coincide. there was no sighting opportunity for saint gallen (switzerland) for the 24th of march 2011 and also all sighting opportunites this month seem to be early in the morning. the incident happened at 20:08. however, maybe i'm making a mistake and i would be happy if someone with experience in acquiring data on the iss orbit could verify this. also i couldn't find any information on a docking maneuver of a supply ship at this date. to make it short: if this was not the iss then i'm out of options.\r\n\r\ni'm completely non-esoteric and non-religious. i was always open to the possibility of the existance of ufos. however the prevalent lack of the most fundamental commonsense among alleged witnesses has led me to insist that i could only be convinced if i observed an ufo myself. unfortunately the incident was not impressive enough to entirely remove all doubt. too bad the object didn't do any funky movements - at least it was fast and changed its direction slightly. i could not have recorded the phenomenon, because there was not enough time and i doubt my equipment would have been sufficient to pick up anything but darkness.\r\n\r\ni would be happy if someone could check the \"iss\"-hypothesis and contact me at ck.Inofficial@gmail.Com. also if someone has another possible explanation i would like to know about it. i can provide more details on the incident if necessary, but i think i covered the observed's essence. of course i would remain anonymous in the process.\r\n\r\nkind regards\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:00:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":28479,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":47.4241,"location":null,"logNumber":"CH-03312011-0001","longitude":9.37088,"occurred":1301022480000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Sankt Gallen","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1301559264000,"summary":"Two fast moving orange lights","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":6,"locationName":"St Gallen, Sankt Gallen","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:64012"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Whittier","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Was trying to identify a satellite using an application on my phone and notices a shadowy object moving from north to south.  it was dark, but appeared to reflect light on the leading edge of the object.  it was either really low and moved really slowly, or it was extremely large and moving very fast at a high altitude. it appeared to be very thin since as soon as it never blocked any visible stars.  i tried to show a friend and he did not see it.  i questioned what i saw, thinking it may be a large flock of birds flying in formation, but there was no variation to the shape.

with no outside lights on. my dad saw it first and said \"'wonder what the hell that is?\" we all looked toward town,which is a mile & a half due south of the house and saw a white light in the sky.We couldn't judge the altitude of the object,or the distance,but we noticed it was moving in our direction. the power line runs over our property directly from town,south to north and the object seemed to be following that exact path. as it got a bit closer we could see it was 2 lights,or seemed to be. as it got even closer we saw it was actually 4 square lights arranged in a square pattern. it made absolutely no sound throughout this time. as it glided over the house, we just stared.As i said before,without points of reference we couldn't judge its size but it filled the space between the trees behind the house & the ones across the road. we could not make out a shape the lights were mounted on. as the thing disappered past the house we just stared at each other. we never saw it \"zoom

haulin' ass right over the house at treetop level! it couldn't have been a minute or two after we saw the lights,and these'copters were l-o-u-d! so they had to be military. they had to be running on

that i'm sceptical about much of the world and the information we receive from or about it.  but from time to time something happens that, even if unexplainable seems to be undeniable.  i have experienced just such a series of the unexplainable, maybe you can help me with this ongoing series of incidences and the evidence i bear from them.  i now even doubt what is in my left wrist but it is there.  for some reason i have gleaned that it may be a tag - tracking device.  maybe you can help and we can learn together.\r\n     twelve years ago i was working on a fellow film students post graduation first project designed as a portfolio builder.  durring the production i men a man who i became friends with, not only because of our film aspirations but we had much more in common.  more than we knew at the start. \r\n     after the productioin was finished we continued to pursue friendship.  i therefore invited him over to my house to not only show some of a mutual hobby but to share a meal over the \"barbi'.  as we sat in the summer sun enjoying the meal the conversatioin turned to me telling of one of my script ideas.  it was based on a fictional \"alien abduction\"  from the \"alien\" pov.  during my telling \"lenn\"  the outline he stoped me and started with a story of his own, one he apparantly believed in.\r\n     he pointed at a bump on a meridian of the left ankle.  as he told me his theory about it and how it felt and what it was i was chilled to the bone as i quietly listened...Not an easy thing for me as i like to engage very much.  but there was so much more,  i had an identical bump in the exact same spot of the left ankle.  the symptoms and feelings in it were identical to his.  he stated profoundly in his belief that he had been abducted and had received an implant.  he liked it and he still has it to this day.\r\n     i however felt extremely violated and wanted it gone.  but before i continue on what came next let me describe this \"tag\" in me.  i had discovered the bump on my left ankleat about two inches above the joint several years before.  i, at that time felt that i had cought a sliver and felt a hard lump inside.  so i was determined to remove it with a very sharp pair of jewers tweezers.  it had never festered so having previous experience with metal slivers, that is how i approached my attempt to remove it.\r\n     but the moment i tried to open the bump to extract it i was struck with intense and very sharp pain.  never in the removal of other metalic ar wood sliver had i ever felt somethng like it.  and unusually the pain did not subside for three days.  i mad a few more attempts all to the same result.  i stoped trying and decided thare was no harm as when left alone, it never bothered me.  that was until my conversation with lenn.\r\n     so i wanted it out even more and since i knew someone who claimed to study the subject much more than myself i approached this person and recanted my story.  he wanted to see it and became very exited upon seing the bump.  he knew another who he claimed was more of an \"expert\" on the subject and asked if i would meet and discuss further the item and offered just the option i had hoped for, the removal of the item.  i agreed and a meeting was arranged.\r\n     the meeting was set for the folowing saturday, six days later.   so i woke up and went to the meeting.  the story was once again told to eager ears.  i was asked to display the bump, when i pulled down my sock, to my shock and their dissapointment it was gone.  what remained could be described as a cleanly removed top half of the bump but there was what reminded me of the calous left behind from metal slivers which had a shape like an arrowhead.  exploring by hand revealed nothing left any deeper. it was gone, whatever it had been in there.\r\n     my new acquantancee told me that this was common.  both were very disapointed.  i rushed over to lenn's house and showed him.  very weird! \r\n     i did not loose interest though and retold the story frome time to time over the years.  strang thing though...I met even more people with the same or similar \"objects\" in the same or different locations.  speculations abounded.  through the conversations i started figuring that 6these were placed on acapuncture meridians.  i've had treatments and studied on it a bit.  then it evolved in my mind that this object undiferentiated the local tissue and formed a ganglia about itself, hence the extreme pain when probed or messed with.  just a theory.\r\n     when i tried to write this story once i stored it to a floppy, the next morning the disc was blanked.  i made several more such failed attempts.  then, as i am an experienced professional photographer i decided to try an experiment, i shoved it ind an x-ray packet used for safekeeping film through airport machines.  that worked and the copy was \"safe\".  it's still around here somewhere.\r\n     but the story continues....\r\n     four years ago i discovered a new bump on the inside of my left wrist.  no memories on how i could have received such an injury to the even more sensitive area of the wrist.  it was the same though in all ways to the previus \"tag\".   i want it gone!  but there is even more to this story.\r\n     on april the twenty second of two thousand and nine,  ten - twenty p.M. i witnessed an usual object pass directly over my house.  it was at about twelve hundred feet because it was under a lite scattering of small puffy clouds that still allowed viewing the stars and constelations.  as it approached over the local small town of junction city  oregon it appeared to be strange.  the city lights weren't quite able fo catch a real reflection off it.  as it left the lights it became totaly black.  as it approached i shook my head as looking away as i asked myself if it was real.\r\n     i am a lifetime member of the astronomical society and know the sky.  it blocked the clouds and stars.  so it revealed to me it's oultine, a huge triangle slightly indented at its apparent rear end.  so i held up my hands and bracketed it,  it was big enough that if i tried to hold a basketball that i couldn't have...Maybe a larger ball though.  as it passed over i heard nothing, observed no change in its slow pace or course.  stranger still...The bump on my wrist seemed to tingle.  the object left due west and the entire viewing was approximately two minutes.\r\n     later as i tried to estimate conventional jets that passed over i guestimated the triangle must have been about five hundred feet wide by three hundred feet long.  but back to the \"tag\" in my wrist.   last year i was working on a sheetrock project with a bro and scraped it very roughly.  it scabed over and as it healed, it left an outline similar to the calous on my ankle.  but it is still there and still visible.  i would so like someone to take a serious look at it.  when going into a surgery through the v.A. last year the radiologist who was sweeping me for any potentialy dangerous metals in my body could find nothing.  maybe it is silicon based.  what do you think?   i invite contact and further discussion.

and we were hanging outside by the pool just looking at the sky and talking. all of a sudden one of my friends quickly jumped up and pointed to the nw region of the sky just below the moon and said in excitement \"is that a plane or a ufo?\" by the time i jumped up and looked, the object was more overhead and straight away i knew it was definitely not a plane. it was moving quite fast through the sky, for the height that it was flying. \r\n\r\nas we watched we were surprised to hear no sound emitted from this object, now we can call it a craft because it was being controlled by some sort of intelligence. as it passed directly over head (moving from nw to se making a slight turn more to the east) we could see the underbelly of the traingular craft, there were three main lights on the points of the triangle and about 20 lights in the centre pulsating around like a carousel, one of the lights (pretty certain it was the front one) was red. \r\n\r\nthis was an extremely exciting feeling to see something like this, all three of us were standing there with our jaws on the floor in amazement, afterwards we couldnt shake the shocked feeling, i had a lot of trouble sleeping that night, not because i was scared but just out of sheer adrenalin. a couple of things to point out with this as well, it happened on the night of a thunderstorm, the craft came from a patch of sky where there was a lot of lightning, and where it flew to, there was more lightning. this could just be a coincidence, but it was quite weird to see.\r\n\r\nwhen my friend first saw the craft he thought it was more of a diamond shape, but when it passed over head it appeared more triangular. it was moving way too fast for me to run inside and get my camera, which is frustrating, especially telling the event to skeptics. after this happened we stood outside for a while, recounting the event and watched two jetliners fly overhead, just to confirm that what we saw was not a commercial airliner. three main factors that were the big standouts are 1. no noise 2. extremely fast 3. oscillating light patterns.\r\n\r\nfrom the time we saw it, to the time it flew out of sight it covered the sky in about 20-30 seconds. it entered our sight at 315 degrees nw (trusty old iphone compass)\r\n\r\nthank you for having such a great website where regular people can openly discuss their experiences with out

while flying closet over my sighting i noticed the relection from the ground lights casted a shadow over the lights which i clearly saw a perfect black  triangle, outlining the lights.  they were located only on the bottom of the craft. it was going really fast but not shaking, it was more like a very fast and smooth, curved down the way it flew, nothing like any jet or conventional aircraft would fly like. i noticed ther was no sound, emitting from it , and remember this is at night when things are down, in a very quiet neighborhood. i was almost in shock when i saw it and when it flew by, my sight time of the object was about 30-40 seconds, but it was enough to clearly see what it looked like and what it was doing when passing by. in about 5 minutes later at the time of the sighting, at about 11:20pm, i noticed a jet flying at about the same altitude when the object was flying over the area earlier, but it was coming at north to south direction, and when it flew by its jet engines roared, which i then realized it was probably a military aircraft flying that low and fast, that is when i realized that the dark triangle object with 3 white lights did not make any kind of sound, and the jet flying by right afterwards was probably looking for the object.  my feelings at the time was shock, and a little more frightening after i quickly processed in my mind of what i had just seen.  it must have been close above where i was at because  i lost sighting once it passed over the house, because of the verticle structure of house. i have wathced ufo documentaries mentioning ufo's that were triangles, and the scenario that played out afterwards with the jet, and that looks like what happened.  after seeing this object it is amazing that i spotted it at that particular moment in time, when i was actively looking up at the stars trying to get some fresh air.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:40","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":28450,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.0561342,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03292011-0006","longitude":-118.2356949,"occurred":1301379300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1301399029000,"summary":"At night , while looking up saw 3 white lights descend then curve towards los angeles,when passing above saw outlining of perfect black triangle going at very high speed., no sound emitting from it. 5 minutes later possible military jet flys by n to s dir","tags":["lights","triangle","ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Los Angeles, California","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:64037"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Las Vegas","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My boyfriend and i were at the drive in (west wind drive in) watching a film. now, granted that's near an airport, i've lived near airports all my life. this was unlike anything i have ever seen before. there were about 12-15 little lights, pinhead sized if you were looking at them. they seemed to move in towards each other, and then away.. similar to an organized flock of birds. no sounds either, as there were no planes taking off. simply all that could be heard was the quiet sound of the movie. nothing you'd hear if it were a group of planes. i tried to point them out to my boyfriend, but by the time he actually looked to see, they had diapered to the northeast. i continued to watch the sky in hopes that i'd see them again, but nothing showed up that wasn't an airplane. i honestly thought that maybe it was a plane, but there were too many of them and they moved too much to be one. i was shocked after noticing them. i have never seen a ufo before, nor did i ever think i'd see one. i was irritated that my boyfriend didn't see them before they diapered. unfortunately, with it being dark in the car, and cluttered with the various blankets, pillows, popcorn, candy, etc, i couldn't find my phone fast enough to take video or even picture. not to mention, i didn't want to lose sight of them.
