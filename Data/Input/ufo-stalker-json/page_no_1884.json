States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":" my friend and i were driving back to pender from west point nebraska on a weekend morning, as we approached within a few miles of pender i noticed a large bright light to the east side of highway 9. at first i really thought the light was just an aircraft landing gear light since it was so bright and so close to the ground, then i realized that there are no airports in the area and the light didn���t appear to moving in any direction. i watched the light for about 5 to 10 minutes before i said something to my friend who was driving, once he saw the light we agreed to stop on top of the next hill so we could get a better look and see if we could tell if it was an aircraft light. we stopped just north of the intersection of v road and highway 9 with a feed lot just to our southeast by about a half mile and the light was still to our east at about 5 to 10 miles at first guess. as we sat there we both realized that we didn���t have any way of knowing what time it was since the owner of the truck toke the radio face plate out of the truck before my friend and i left west point ne. the last time we saw a clock it was around 1:30 am and that was when we left west point. as we sat there i had my friend shut the engine off so that we could listen for jet engine noise or the thud of helicopter rotors, but once he shut the engine off we didn���t here any noise coming from the direction of the light. we both grew up around aircraft, my father was in the air force in sioux city and my friend grew up within 3 miles of the same air base so we both were familiar with the different sounds created by all sorts of aircraft and their lights. the longer we sat there the more we talked about it and realized that this was no aircraft of any type and that the light was closer then we first thought 5 miles max from where we were parked. we sat there for an unknown amount of time when suddenly the light went from very bright to almost unable to see it. it went down to a red light so dim it looked just another star in the sky, and after a few minutes it went back to its full bright white light again. within a few minutes of the light becoming bright again we both saw a beam of light like a spot light pointing the ground, the beam which started at the light came down towards the ground in the south direction at about a 40 to 45 degree angle. the beam was white in color and not as bright as the light in the sky, and because of the hilly area we could not see the point of impact of the beam. after a minute or two we both heard a blood chilling animal screaming sound and then the beam stopped like someone just hit the off switch on a spot light. we were kind of frozen in the spot once we saw the beam and heard that sound, we both wanted to get out of there but at the same time we both were afraid that staring the truck and turning on the lights might draw attention to our location plus we still wanted to know what was going on over that area. we were unable to tell if the sound we heard came from the area of the beam but it was unlike any animal that either us have every heard in our life���s. again after a few minutes after we saw the beam the light in the sky once again dimed down to a very small red light as bright as nearby stars, this time we both noticed headlights coming from the south on the highway about 2 miles from us. once the car on the highway passed our position and continued north out of sight the light became bright again. in the time that we sat there on the side of the road we had a few cars pass by coming from both the north and south, each time once a car got within a few miles of our location the light in the sky would dim down and once the car was a few miles passed us the light would again become very bright as if it was trying to hide from those cars. we sat there for about an hour or two; only way we could tell time is by how many cigarettes that we smoked. as the time went by i noticed the trees that were only about 10 feet from our truck would light up and then get dark again, like on a night with a full moon and patchy clouds, but this was happening with the flow of traffic like the light in the sky to our east so i figured it was just the head lights causing it. then my friend starting looking around and discovered a light to the south west of our location, just as bright and as low to the ground as the first one. he kept his eyes on that one and i kept a look out on the one to our east, this had to go on for another half hour or so not once did either of the lights appear to move at all just grow dim as cars came near and then brighten back up once those cars passed. i finally got the courage up to step out of the truck since i had a full bladder and really needed to go, as i was standing there i just happened to look up to see if there was a full moon and discovered the third light directly above our location. now once i saw that i was back in the truck screaming at my friend to start the truck and floor it back to pender, once i told him that there was third light over us he did start the truck and never toke his foot off the floor till we were back in the town of pender. the drive to town only toke a few minutes at speeds hitting 90 mph but to the both of us it seemed like forever, i kept looking in the mirrors and out the rear window to make sure the lights were not chasing us but after a mile i couldn���t find any of them in the sky.  i can say we were both truly scared out of minds about what we had seen and the fact that a third light was over our heads not making a sound for god knows how long! now once we got it to pender the bank clock was at about 4:30 so we figure we spent a few hours out there parked on the side of the highway looking at these lights, at highway speeds it really only takes 30 minutes to get from west point to pender but since we had no way of telling time neither of us can account if we lost time or not. since then my friend and i haven���t really mentioned this incident to anybody but close friends and he and i rarely speak of it to each other.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":28437,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.1141648,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03282011-0008","longitude":-96.7072585,"occurred":962354700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nebraska","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1301342776000,"summary":"Bright

Pines","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At approximately 12:05am, i had just passed the guard gate of century village in pembroke pines, fl. where my mother resides and approaching the building while riding my motorcycle, i noticed two dark red lights almost burgundy in color up in the sky that caught my eyes. i also observed two airplanes to the left side of these red lights. the planes were easily identified by their wings, general shape and the green and red lights on each wing, however, the dark red lights were much larger in size and appeared to be independent of one another. i noticed how these lights separated as they traveled through heavy clouds and each went in separate directions. i immediately stopped and got off my bike to get a good glance at the nearest of the two red lights which suddenly stopped illuminating the red color and broke through a heavy cloud and now observed the object charcoal grey in color below the cloud directly over me possibly about one mile up and perfectly detailed as a round disk shape with a smaller round disk in the center with lines that radiated from the smaller center round disk in several pie shaped patterns outward. the disk traveled fast in a westard direction as it passed directly overhead. judging by the speed of the nearby private and commercial planes, i would have to estimate the speed of the disk to be between 4 to 5 times faster. my observation of seeing this ufo that displayed so much classic detail had me in shock and while the experience seemed surreal at first, i immediately attempted to video record and then snap some still images using my cell phone camera. as the disk progressively escaped my vision behind neighboring trees, i mounted my motorcycle and proceeded to give chase in order to position myself for better photographs and i soon found myself racing behind it for a few miles then totally losing site of it by the time that i reached state road 27/ okeechobee road all the time looking up searching for the ufo, i proceeded west on i-75 towards naples, florida at a high rate of speed, but upon realizing that i had lost it, i turned back and returned home in coral springs, where i immediately started searching the internet for photographs to compare my sighting to and was completely shocked to see that the ufo that i had observed was nearly identical in detail to other ufo's that were reported by pilots and law enforcement personnel in the past.  i do not know if the videos and still photos that i attempted to take can be reviewed by an expert but i would be glad to show whomever is interested in them. the attached photo is an internet drawing that is remarkably similar in shape and design to the ufo that i observed earlier today.

got out, and as always, hoping, i looked up at the sky, clouds, i looked east standing at the corner of stroop and far hills, and saw, what at first looked like the wright flyer at a distance, it looked as if it was descending, and slowing. the main reason it could not have been the flyer is because of the humidity, the sky was a little cloudy and the flyer doesn't fly in certain humidity levels, and the day was very humid. the craft was moving westerly over far hills ave, towards me. i had contacts in that day, so staring was a little hard, specially at the distance, which would be hard to explain. i kept wanting to enter the restaurant and call someone out, but i couldn't move. not that i was paralized, i could move, but it was as if i couldn't. i didn't want to take my eyes off of it in fear of it disappearing. it moved west, in my direction, and then turned south. it was almost as if it was driving, west on stroop to south on far hills. it is hard to explain what i say, as i said, it almost looked like the flyer, in shape, it looked boxy or some square like shape almost like a car. i can differentiate airplanes from very high up, or far out, depending on how it turns and what is seen when the turn happens. but when this object turned, the shape did not change there was no tilt of one side, lift of the other, it just turned, almost 90 degrees with no problem. the vehicle, or object, kept going south, until it went out of sight. at some point after the turn, another driver arrived from a delivery and i asked him to look and tell me what he thought it was, he looked and, mentioned a weather balloon... i explained the movement it made, plus it wasn't going in the winds direction. i had the other driver to go inside and get someone but by the time they got outside, the object was too far to recognize. the oddest part is that there was no sound coming from the craft. again, with airplanes, there is always a motor noise, even at far distances, but this thing didn't produce any sounds, that i could tell. i tried to take a picture with my phone, but that camera sucked big time, anything further than 10 feet looked horrible. \r\n i was ecstatic, all my life i had wanted to see a space craft, i have always wanted and wished for an encounter, and had always been able to debunk my sightings by recognizing them as planes, helicopters or birds. this thing i couldn't make out. i was in awe, hating myself for not having at least some weak binoculars, which i now have and keep in my car. i honestly didn't care who said what, i honestly saw a ufo since i was not able to identify the object. i cannot say it was a spacecraft, alien or otherwise. i am a believer. i know that aliens exist, i feel i know they've been here, are here, and probably will always be here, as they have been. the day after, i searched the papers to see if anyone else had seen it, but either no one saw it, or as i did, they just kept it to themselves.  \r\n please let me know if anyone else had seen this, reported about this, or other sightings in the dayton/cincinnati, oh areas. i hope someone can look into this and help me ease my mind and figure out what the heck that was. \r\nthank you for your time.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

highway and stony creek ave) and found they were not below the tree line and in fact were very slowly moving along in a southerly direction (toward town).  they were not in any formation, more like a string of lights moving along together although when i first saw them and was making my way closer (and therefore the angle of my view changing as i went) some of them formed into a pentagon for a short time. i stopped when they were right above me, as it was night i can���t really say how high they were but maybe another trees length above tree line.  after i stopped i tried to focus in on one to see if i could make out the shape but it was too bright.  i decided to go the rest of the way to my house and get a neighbor to look with me but as soon as i got just a ways down the road they were

i was curious how long it took me to get to this point as i was traveling to my brother's residence and i was in a hurry. (it was getting late and i was tired. i rise at 5:15am).\r\n\r\nthe turnpike is straight from before the interchage at fort washington heading west for a few miles. it is however not level. i was traveling in the middle lane. i believe you pass under an overpass approximately midway in the straight section of road prior to its bending to the left at the top of the rise. as i past the overpass, i looked up and forwared of my position to notice what appeared to beaircraft leading edge landing lights approximatel 2 inches across( looking at your outstretched hand to measure. i thought that , well there is a military base nearby, forgetting that the base has been closed. the visibility here is focused forward somewhat not only because of your direction of travel, but also because the embankments to either side rise 25 ft or more. in addition there are3 tall trees on bothe sides at the top of the embankments.\r\n at approximately 65 mph i expected that the lights would get brighter and further apart as i approached and i expected it would do the same. most aircraft lights for landing are brighter than the other lights. these brighter lights were on the outside edges, with the less bright lamps on the inside of the \"wingtip\" lights. they were in a row and a single white strobe was blinking slightly below and centered. all lights were white. red lamps are traditionally on the left of the aircraft, and green on the right side of the aircraft wingtip. assuming it was coming toward me, i would have expected to see these shortly. within 20-30 second it appeared 5-6 inches across, again using your hand at arms length to measure. i wasn't thinking of looking for colored lamps. i was thinking that it was odd for an aircraft to be that low over an interstate. perhaps it needed to land, a provision from the interstate design( allowing x number of miles of straight away for emergency landings was part of the design. as i approached what seemed to be almost underneath its position, i realized that it was not moving fast, i had overtaken its position and it was not coming toward me , but away from me, and it appeared to be going slower that i was. how curious.. at that point the road bends to the left about 25 or 30 degrees. i looked out the window not once, but twice and could not see the lights anymore. the lights were on the trailing edge, not the leading edge, unless it turned away immediately as i had traveled to the left on the highway i didn't see it again.\r\n\r\nthe distance of the lights were comparable in feeling to watching jets fly overhead on a landing strip. it felt large. at least the size of a jet airliner. before rounding the bend i had my last look at the lights,(before i lost sight of it). my thoughts were that it was large, an aircraft?, and it must be low for its lights nearly spanned the visible clearing of sky between the tree lines on both sides of the highway...I was actually ducking while looking out of th car toward

military, but i don't know. it was shaped like a disc, metallic and shiny. very quick, and it must have been somewhat large for me to see it. the green color of the flame surprised me. it all happened

location of the prison was i.T.F (ionia temporary facility). another siting was at m.R. dorms (michigan reformatory dorms) \r\n\r\n\r\n2. what made you first notice the object? my friend and i went outside of the barracks to smoke cigarettes. i don't know what made me do so but i looked up and saw something in the clear blue sky. i mean you get tired of looking at men all day long. but my friend and i stood out there in front of the barracks smoking cigarettes. i looked at it for about ten seconds trying to figure out what it was that i was looking at. it just hovered there in one spot. i looked over to my friend and tapped him on the shoulder and asked \"what is that?\" he asked, \"what is what?\" i pointed to the spot and it was gone. or so i thought. i scanned the immediate area where it was located and then i found it again. it had moved to a different location.I then pointed it out to my friend and he looked at it for a long moment and then said \"man i don't know what that is.\" we then looked down into eachothers eyes and then looked back up at the thing and it was gone. i scanned the whole span of sky and didn't find it again. the second sighting was at m.R. dorms. it was nighttime. i was on my way to a n.A. meeting that i took in order to get out of prison. trust me in prison you take any class necessary to get out even ones that are not needed. all i needed was assaultive offenders class and pre release class. i took that extra class to look good for release. i was released two years later. no i didn't use drugs while in prison. i didn't drink what they call spud juice either. that's home made wine in prison. lol! as i was saying, i left out of my dorm and walked around the building to enter a dorm. i was looking at the sky because in the country you see way and i mean way more stars in the sky than you do in the sicty. i love the countryside. it's beautiful at night. while i was headin towards the door of a dorm i saw a star move from it's stationary position. it moved closer to another star and then stayed still. i had never seen anything like that in my life. from that point it didn't move. (note: i mentioned the first incident to nasa when they used to allow you to ask the astronaught question while they were in space. i never got an answer back. that was when i was first released from prison in 2001) i've seen some strange stuff since then only it wasn't alien phenomena. i've been tailed and everything. i just never told anybody until now. everybody has been trying to make me crazy lately. i guess that comes with the territory when seeing u.F.O.'s and then telling the government that. when i was a child my friends and i used to make fun of white people saying that they saw u.F.O.'s. i have seen strsange things in the sky periodically throughout my life. the spacestation was still in development when i was in prison. but how do you explain the things i saw as a child? i mean as a 9 or 10 year old child? did i have a flight of fancy or a wild imagination? my grandmother had just taken me and my friend from next door to see the fireworks display. i saw what looked like the box on a blimp only there was no blimp. the thing was lighted alll of the way around it. it wasd rectangular and huge. with as much light as there was on the thing you would've plainly seen the blimp or huge ballon on top[. there was none! i no longer make fun of white people for saying that they see u.F.O.'s. i'm not racist either. that was just a phase that we went through. i just went along with it because i didn't want to be made fun of too. but i did see what i saw. i just haven't been abducted or anything like that. from what i here i hope not! i would hate to be anal probed! lol! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it? to tell you the truth i didn't know what it was at first. i've heard the roswell story of weather balloons. but those balloons were elongated. this was not. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions. the one from cildhood is rectangular with lights surrounding it. the second at i.T.F. was spherical shiny. the third just looked like a white dot on a black canvas. the first moved slowly across the sky. the second hovered for a while in one place and in the span of two seconds possibly three it moved a nice distance. i know that it wasn't a balloon bec ause when i was a child my elementary school did a balloon release. we tied cards and everything to the ballon. it was for research. the entire school did it at the same time. so i know how a balloon moves. it may seem stationary but it'as really moving. it doesn't travel great distances in the sp[an of two to three seconds. not a balloon. when i found it again it just hovered there in one spot. when we looked at eachother and then back it was a matter of two to three seconds. it was completely gone! balloons don't just disappear like that. i don't know how many of you have been to prison but i.T.F. is surrounded by nothing but woods. many of the pennitentaries are the exact same way. surrounded by woods. especially when you move further north. wild animals roam them woods. and i wass a trusted prisoner at that. i ended up getting a gate pass and everything and was allowed to gop out into the woods. the third one was basically looking like a star. it was stationary at first and then just moved in a atraight line and then stopped and didn't move again. hey you can try and explain away whatever you like. i know what i saw. you can't tell me nothing differently. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object. who would believe me?! my friend and i never told anyone until now of what we saw as children. i only told my friend *(name deleted--cms/sg)and pointed it out. it was a feeling of like i expecte to see it though. there was nothing really important about it so to speak. as if i was used to seeing them. no big deal. but we did one of those moves of where two people are looking at something in shock and look to eachother as if saying do you see what i am seeing and the look back. that what happened. the third was like hold on i know that i am not seeing things. it was like looking at a spot on a wall forf a long time and it seems to move on it's own. only this was a star. and every night that i got the chance i looked and only seen that star in the same place that it had moved to. it was always in the same location every night. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. how did you lose sight of the object? i lost sight of the first by watching the fireworks. the second was by taking my eyes off of it. the third it just appeared as a star every night. crazy huh? i have no pictures what so ever because he i was in prison. talk to people in prison if you want to know thet truth!\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

 i used to travel near edwards in the late 80s early 90s and had seen stealth planes flying at dusk.  \r\n\r\nat first look, three of lights looked like they could be in that shape.  my neighbor's daughter was in the military and so we got her.  as soon as she came out, it turned and the lights formed a perfect isosceles triangle.  then it shifted again and there seemed to only be one light in that area.  it had been flying southwest at first, but then after rotating and changing shape, it went east.  \r\n\r\nthat is when we observed several more lights coming up in the sky from the west all going east.  some appeared to go up and then back down again.  one even stopped as another seemed to be lagging behind.  this went on for five or ten minutes as at least 20 lights progressed across the sky very rapidly and then just vanish when they got to the same point in the east.  \r\n\r\nthen we saw about four stragglers that appeared after the others were gone.  they were not together.  as one disappeared in the east, we would see another rise in the west.  \r\n\r\nwe live five miles from sky harbor international airport.  we are used to seeing several planes in the evening coming from the north and then circle around and land at the airport, but generally in the evening they land from the west, not the east.  not to mention disappear while landing.  also, airplane lights are white, red or blue.  not orange.  they appeared to gain altitude before disappearing.  \r\n\r\nit then a few minutes later, we saw what were obviously planes coming from the north and then turn and go east.  they did not appear to be big enough to be commercial jet, but could have been commuter planes.  \r\n\r\nwe heard no sound coming from these multiple things.  as for my feelings, at first when i saw just the three lights i thought might be a stealth was curiosity.  as far as i know, our base does not test or have any stealth a/c.  then when it turned and became a triangle, rotated again and rapidly changed direction, i got chills down my spine. \r\n\r\nunfortunately, we do not own quality cameras and could not catch any video or pictures.  hopefully in a city this large someone else did.  i noticed several cars driving down our street stop and then continue on when it was over.\r\n\r\ni am not sure if it was happening earlier as my cat was going nuts every
