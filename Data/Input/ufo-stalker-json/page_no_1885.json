six year old son and i had been playing in the park today. we were riding push-scooters, playing frisbee, and enjoying the lovely afternoon/evening for about an hour and a half. we walked a friend to her apartment adjacent to forsyth park. we then headed across the park toward our truck to go home.\r\n \r\ni was the first to see and point out a boomerang formation of 7-11 star-like lights. they became more clear as they went almost overhead (the flight path when the object(s) were most overhead were at 1 a clock west (angle relative to us). we were both baffled. \r\n\r\nthe light formation was heading directly north (i google mapped when i got home to get a clearer sense of the direction they are going relative to the park which is exactly rectungular). exactly north!\r\n\r\nthe formation of lights on the boomerang were not exact, but almost (in terms of exact distances from one light to the next spread through the boomerang formation...They were a little irregular. however, they were clearly in a boomerang type formation. we observed this formation fly in a very straight smooth direction due north. the observation of this lasted, i would guess, 12-15 seconds, until the boomerang formation became obscured by the atmospheric cloudiness and trees. \r\n\r\nthe part of the park we were observing from allowed us to see a lot of clear sky without interruption (an open and large grass field). our view of the boomerang formation was (using clock hands as description of angle relative to us) was from 10 a clock to 2 a clock (we had a wide field of vision from our vantage point). \r\n\r\nit was almost completely dark outside. the sky above us was pretty clear and one could see stars clearly. from a distance, the atmospheric haze (toward the horizons) made the boomerang formation of lights dissipate as the lights entered from and then vanished toward the horizon.\r\n\r\nthere was no noise of airplanes or helicopters. \r\n\r\nthen we saw the same thing happen again about half a minute later!!  same formation type, same approximate size, same direction, same rate of speed. i couldn't tell distance clearly and i could not tell if solids connected the lights or if the lights were independent. within the formation they seemed fixed.  my guess is that the boomerang formations were at least half a mile to two miles above us. if i extend my arm and hold my thumb out, i would say the formation would be about 1/2 to 2/3 of my thumb.\r\n\r\nless than a minute later we saw a third boomerang formation!\r\n\r\nthen we saw a fourth and fifth one flying together side by side about a minute later. same flight path...Same everything!!!!!\r\n\r\nafter that (just a second or two later) we saw (i saw and then pointed it to my son who saw everything i saw) something more orb-like fly ( a single spheric light, which i think curved in flight (not flying straight). that lasted about two to three seconds and dissapeared from view because of the trees. that object was flying se and looked much further than the boomerangs. my recollection is that this orb light changed colors several times in that short amount of time.\r\n\r\nthen we saw a sixth boomerang formation....Same everything....!!!!! i couldn't believe how many we got to see. different than if we just saw one.\r\n\r\ni think we saw a total of 7 boomerang formation over a five minute period. my son says we saw eight. i lost count. only once during that time did we see more than one at a time. the time between one sighting to the next varied from 10 seconds to less that two minutes. the time we did see more than one at a time they seemed to almost touch (wing to wing). \r\n\r\nand we also saw (the previously described) s-e orb that we lost sight of behind the trees. the orb was not on the same flight path as the boomerangs. we saw it at 11 o'clock (angle) se of us heading (quick curved flight pattern) aprox. se.\r\n\r\nbeing a rational man i tried to think what they could be. i have no idea. they were too fast for migrating birds and we don't see that kind of bird formation here ever and birds don't have glowing light. they were absolutely not a planes and did not have blinking lights or make noise. \r\n\r\nthe lights on the boomerang formation were not as bright or sharp as that of stars, although they looked somehow bigger than the size of individual stars to the naked eye.\r\n\r\nthe entire incident lasted about five minutes. i was on the phone telling a friend (the one we walked to her apartment) what we'd just seen (i was excited and needed to tell someone)...When we saw the last (seventh or eighth boomerang), she could hear us as we again were baffled, excited, (i probably swore several times in awe and excitement!).\r\n\r\nthe speed and size of these things relative to where we were standing would be like that of a big handglider 200-300 feet above us. the boomerang formations all flew completely straight and at a smooth and consistent speed. all the objects (except the orb) were almost exactly on the same flight path. all the boomerang formations were heading exactly north. \r\n\r\nmy son and i both saw every detail that i describe. i was so glad to be able to share the experience with someone else and i can only imagine how this will stay with him the rest of his life, as it will mine.\r\n\r\nthis is not the first time i've seen very odd ufo phenomenon. when i was a child on vacation on lopez island (washington state), i saw a daytime moon shaped/sized/glowing object fly at a very high velocity over my head (i read that pres. carter saw something very similar). i saw it alone. it lasted maybe one second.\r\n\r\nthis sighting dwarfs my childhood experience. and having a second witness gives it a different sense of solidity.\r\n\r\ncan't think of anything else to say......\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

35). at the time i was living in harvest alabama and was on my way to the gas station at around 10:00 pm central time to meet up with a couple of friends. i arrived at the gas station exxon on jeff rd and got out of my car to wait. it was a clear night and a few minutes passed waiting for my friends to arrive when this big triangular thing was in the sky. ( i had nothing better to do but stare into the stars waiting) the triangular thing had three red lights at each of the three points. initially i thought it was three separate floating red lights that were in perfect formation, but on closer observation the stars were disappearing in the center of where the lights were. i knew this thing was solid and moved extremely slow across the sky i would say no more than 15 miles an hour. the triangular ufo was moving slowly  west to east and i was facing the northern sky. i just stared at it in shock and a few minutes passed and it was still slowly moving east when all of a sudden one of the red lights dropped a white sparkly that started falling towards the earth. a couple more minutes passed and then another red light dropped two white sparkly lights that also started to fall to earth. this continues for about another 15 minutes and then all of a sudden the red lights simply disappears just like as if it just turned off the lights. i honestly thought i must be going crazy or something and left it alone and never spoke a word of it to nobody ever since.\r\n\r\n\r\nwell today 3-24-11 i currently live in denver colorado. i was watching our local news station and they showed a clip of a possible ufo sighting in lafayette co. needless to say my jaw dropped as those red lights they showed was exactly the same thing i saw over 13 yrs ago! the only difference was that i did not see any of the three red lights dropping the white sparkly lights that fall to the earth. i have goosebumps all over as i am typing this because i wrote it off as i was seeing things and those memories from years ago all flooded back to me. \r\n\r\nwhat those people in lafayette co captured last night on video is real! i felt like this was

staring at it for about 5 minutes i just started smiling without knowing i was, i was also over come by this strange feeling of relaxation and serenity that i have never felt since. i also don't remember loosing sight of the object because when i was overcome with this weird sensation i must have fell asleep i just remember waking up in the next morning.\r\n\r\ni could better describe this by

on iowa highway 57 when i happened to glance out of the front passenger side window and saw a pattern of moving lights in the sky. at first, i only saw two white lights with a smaller red blinking light in the middle, but after a moment i noticed a third white light with them, forming a triangle shape. at first i had mistaken it for the wing section of an airplane, but after seeing the third, triangle-forming light and carefully observing the way it was moving, i realized that it was not a normal aircraft and that it was extremely similar to the first one i had viewed in february. when i made this connection, i got very excited and asked my friend to stop the car. he did, and luckily for us there are not many vehicles going down the highway around midnight. i rolled down my window on the passenger side and stuck my head out to get as good a look as possible. it moved more fluidly than any aircraft i usually see, and it seemed to be rotating slightly as it passed over a neighborhood that was to my right, then over our car and off into the distance, which is a more undeveloped part of town (we were on the outskirts.) as it got further away from us, it seemed to shift slightly, and when i saw it in the distance i saw an angled row of flashing red lights.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

road, it began to move faster and went west, causing me to lose a good sight of it. i turned off onto a side street and drove in its direction, but could not catch up. the thing that interested me the

he noticed a \"bright star\"(1) moving quickly to the right. we both stopped and watch it \"fly out of\" the big dipper and and head towards the direction of orion (se to sw). after about 3 seconds it had made it half way across our visible sky and then just disappeared. we see these each year around this time and i have previously reported them. because this was something we were used to, we glanced around the sky to see if we could spot more. (we typically see more than one). it was only a few seconds later that we spotted another one(2) which was dimmer coming from the direction of orion and heading towards the big dipper (the opposite direction as the one before - sw to se). that one quickly disappeared. we then saw another one(3)! at this time we were facing the big dipper and i turned around to look behind me and saw it. again, this one was dim, but noticeable (nw to sw). we lost track of it after a few seconds. without a doubt, i know these aren't satellites, they move far too quickly and move in various directions. after about a total of 5 minutes, we had seen 3. with it being a very clear night, nothing was blocking our view. after a couple minutes of watching the sky, we saw another bright one(4) and it was easy to follow. this one \"came from\" orion, passed \"under\" sirius and faded out (but was still visible). we followed it across the sky (ne to nw) and watched as it brightened back up... only to disappear like the others. again, only seconds later, (on the complete opposite side of the sky), we saw the last and final one (ne to se). a dim one headed \"into\" the big dipper. once it reached the middle of the constellation, it disappeared. i have an app on my phone that allows me to track satellite movement, so i opened it and pointed it towards the sky. it showed me the orbits of the satellites and they were nowhere near the paths of these \"stars\". like i said, we see these often around this time of year. sometimes, it's one a week. at times, it's a couple in one night. this is the first we've seen this year, but i will keep records on them as i see them.

and purchasing a new one was the only option. i started to go through all the family video and photos and which one to save and put on my new computer, i came across the video/pictures i took last august. i put them on my computer and with the new media viewer installed looked at the photos and zoomed in and to my shock i saw what looks like a star in the center of a swirling mass. the next photo is the same thing but with what looks like the profile of a face sticking out of the star shaped object. i was spooked to say the least.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":28385,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.3473392,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03242011-0014","longitude":-88.8388569,"occurred":1282470720000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1300996592000,"summary":"Ufo

on the ground, at first we thought \r\nit was someone spotting dear and all of a sudden it appeared right in front of us at tree top level, i stopped the car and couldn't beleive what i was seeing. it was so close that i couldn't tell the exact shape because i was looking up through a tree canopy but it appeared to be oval or roundish in nature it was beaming a bright light all around the ground like it was looking for something, it seemed so close i could hit it with a rock and all i know it was huge and had band of lights of differant colors that looked like colored glass and it didn't make a sound and was moving real slow my heart was pounding out of my chest i couldn't take my eye's off of it and thought at first i might be killed or something  it just seemed to just move out of sight. i had to keep this all bottled up for all these years. my friend and i swore never to tell anyone because they would say we were crazy. but after watching your show today on tv i decided to tell someone. the sad part is i don't have any pictures or other proof but since that day there is no doubt in my mind that some other life is out there. i know it sounds hard to beleive but that's what i saw and i've never been a liar. \r\n \r\nthank you  \r\n \r\n*(wit's name

lights just hovering in sky- upon trying to get closer view- vehicle was shut down- and hovering objects approached our vehicle- besides the triangles their were bell shaped objects also- also off in distant horizon was cigar shaped vehicle-- triangles their were 6-8 came down 1 by 1 as if to check us out- 1 was hovering off to our south side about 400yrds and a tether line with a series off tube shaped objects was dangling in the wind on the end of it- but the 1 that got the closest i,ll never forget it came at us out of the hoizon and shut off all it,s light,s except for the front i guess i,ll call it cockpit- and it was looking at us as intently as we were trying to look at it and as it reached the point directly over our vehicle i rolled down the window stuck my head out and looked directly at its massive system of louvers, best i could describe as smacking in unison all over the bottom of the ship in all directions in unisun, but simaltainesly, very beutiful view of technology and grace- have much more info but i.M not really i prolific writer  have no reason to lie- when they finally ended what i guess i.Ll call their show our vehicle started up again and we proceeded home told people and became laughing stocks-- my belief is the real mccoy.S only expose themselves or vehicles to certain people-- why--not sure --  because i have had other sightings with witnesses including a fireball with 2 smaller balls that looked like it was assisting the fire ball in in its flight right over a busy interstate.","distance":"101-500

like a flash movement and hovered agian. i've seen this several times before but never really paid this any attention untill i seen this several times it keeps me woundering if this is ufo activity. being that fort bragg and camp mccall is near i was afraid to say anything about this. the ufo's would always be in diffrent places in the sky with the same type of activity a flah like movement and then hovering. i would go inside my house and look out the window and still see the ufo's. i was afraid so i would say to myself that's not a ufo so i would go to bed.  the next night i was outside and saw the same thing agian.  it is now 2011 and the month of june and july is comming so i may see these ufo's agian.  i've lived here for eleven years and every once in a while i would see these objects winter and summer.  what really made me notice the objects is when the lights flashed and the objects moved in a flash like movement. i thought that the objects were a military type of craft and i know a moving plane when i see it. these objects are always the same and the movements are the same.
