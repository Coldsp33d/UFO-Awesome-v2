shopping around 8:30-9:00pm with my mother, i was traveling south on rt.130 and crossing the bridge over the rancocas creek near bridgeboro road when my mother, who was sitting in the passenger seat, noticed and brought to my attention something sitting above the water in close proximity next to the bridge on her side of the car. i slowed up, after checking that there was no traffic behind me, and there was none on the bridge at all, i almost brought the car to a slow stop as i approched the top of the bridge and noticed, through the front windshield and to my right, a craft of some kind within 200' of the right side of the bridge, just hovering in a stationary position about 70' above the waters surface. it stood there motionless with no apparent sound emanating from the object. the windows of the car were closed, but if it were a helecopter that close i'm sure we would of heard the sound and probably would of felt the buffeting effect from the rotors. as i observed the the object through the front windshield i could clearly see that the object was round in shape and typical of what would be described as a \"flying saucer\" in description. even though it was dark out, it was round in shape with a gray color metallic surface. the exterior of the craft i could discern, because there was a series of lights, that were yellowish in color around the circumference of the craft that sort of  glowed around the crafts surface so i was able to make out the features of the craft. there was a round lower bottom section of the craft, then another smaller diameter round section on top of that bottom section that had a series of lights in a row around it with what appeared to be a dome shape above that section which appeared to be transparent with some kind of windows that went around the dome. it appeared that i could see a figure or a form of something in the dome section of the transparent dome bubble top. the craft appeared to be about the size of a trailer which a tractor trailer would pull. the object then started to slowly ascend and as it did the lights seemed to rotate around the craft and the faster the craft ascended the lights seemed to rotate faster. the object ascended and crossed slowly over the bridge in front of us and headed east and appeared to follow the creek. at this time, as it crossed over the bridge, i was still moving slowly forward in the car. as it moved from my right to my left over the bridge, i got my last look of it behind and to my right as it appeared to follow the rancocas creek. this was a very frightening experience for the both of us and something that is just as vivid today as it was that night. i was told, latter that week, that there was a newspaper article, which i did not see, that was published the following day about an unexplained object that was seen near lumberton that same night. when my brother-in law approached me about writing this report, i told my boss about it and he said he had a relative who lives near the rancocas creek in lumberton and saw an object that same night near his home. i have his name as well.\r\n","distance":"101-500

Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"So i was standing in the back garden of my house for about half an hour since 8pm, and it was a clear, calm, mild night. i thought at first i witnessed a shooting star in the west south west direction as i was standing by the back door of my house. i thought, 'did i just see a shooting star? or was it just the bright star to the left of orion which was in the vicinity of west south west too'. i also heard one dog barking nearby just prior to witnessing this object.\r\n\r\nnot too long after this, i believed that i saw something round, shining or brightening up in the distance. i believe it was yellowish-orange in colour. i first thought it was just a chinese lantern rising up but i wondered how it would move with zero wind, and why is one floating about in march, that's why it got my attention. i felt sure that i witnessed a yellowish orb powering up or brightening up in the distance. anyway, something kept my attention so i made sure i paid attention to what it might do next.\r\n\r\ni believe the actions and motions of the object made a steady motion towards me, in a straight line probably at a height of about 200 -300 feet, speed about 40 mph i would guess, and perhaps it descended slightly in height over its trajectory. at some point from watching this, i became aware that the object had changed or morphed into what i would describe as a light aircraft. i also heard the sound of what seemed to be an engine. i would describe this sound as a drone noise as opposed to a piercing or vibratory noise which i believe a real light aircraft would emit. i clearly remember that this object had a long, cylindrical light or beam, i believe in its centre, from front to  back. i think it was white, or maybe light turquoise. i also remember one light flashing which may have been yellow. it may also have had a small side light on each wing, i don't know the colours.\r\n\r\ni sincerely cannot recall what shape it was, because i was surprised at the long thin white beam on the object, so i do not want to hazzard a guess. the object came over just to the left of my house, perhaps 100-150 feet above the ground. i just watched it fly past thinking, 'no way is that a plane, that is not a plane :)'. then i quickly moved to see if i could follow its trajectory as it passed by. i would say it went at a fair speed, say 40-50 miles per hour. i believe it covered a distance of about 1.5 to 2 miles from its start point to when i lost sight of it.\r\n\r\nmy feelings as i saw this was just that there was something not quite right about this scenario. one, because it was supposedly a light aircraft flying low over my house, and two, it was mid evening. so as it came nearer to my house i thought with a smile 'no way can this be a plane'. when i thought it could have been a ufo, i got a little anxious and nervouse at that point. i wondered if it could have been an a.I. controlled object, whether it knew i was standing below it, or even whether it put on some display for confirmation, i cannot answer the real motive here. other than what i have described i had no other reactions. i had a wry smile on my face watching it. so absolutely no telepathic communication going on, no electrical or radiological discharge or anything, no tractor beams, fancy light display, no missing time (i believe) or timelessness, no altered or heightened state like love or fear etc.\r\n\r\ni finally lost sight of the object because it disappeard into the darkness in about 5 seconds. i don't know if it literally vanished, went invisible or shot off into the sky. i just can't believe noone else may have seen it. \r\n\r\nso what i remember most of all is this long thin white beam on the object and one flashing light, maybe yellow, and of course the sound of a light aircraft passing close at low altitude over my house. i cannot remember the shape of the object, nor the size, perhaps it was the size of a light aircraft.\r\n\r\nthe frustrating thing was, i did not have any instruments at hand to record it, view it or even signal to it. it caught me completely off guard. so i have no video or still photo as further evidence.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":28356,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.488021,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-03222011-0008","longitude":-3.17091,"occurred":1300505400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Wales","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1300842590000,"summary":"Orb

north to interstate 35.\r\nthe craft was about 300 feet above the tree tops and flying very slow as if on a landing approch. it had non-blinking white lights on the ends of each tip of what at first

not a normal jetliner.\r\nas the craft slowly approched 35, about 200 feet before the craft would had crossed over interstate 35 and over me, the craft quickly turned off the forward flood lights and made a hard bank right turn away from the highway (as if the pilot was saying \"opps! wrong runway!\"). when it banked i could see it was not a passenger airliner but a black triangle shaped flying wing with a boomerang shape leading edage. i would say it was a very large craft with a 250 to 300 feet wing span and about 325 to 350 feet long. the structure was not made from metal but more like a black dull composite fiberglass. it slowing flew away at a 45 degree angel northeast and i could see it had no vertical stabalizer nor any exhaust or sound from any engines. the side white marker lights never turned off but now i could see a set of red anti-collision light blinking off-center to the right of the flying wing as it flew away. i watch the flying wing make slight flight path

 my immediate reaction was that it was a satellite because it appeared to be very high in the sky, constant whitish light (no blinking lights, definitely not plane or helicopter), and moving at a steady, fast pace in an easterly direction.  we both agreed it was likely a satellite and watched it for about 2 minutes (from 12 oclock to about 2 oclock position).  then i noticed an object that looked identical to the \"satellite\" coming from the east (about 2 oclock position) and heading nw heading directly towards the supposed satellite (1st object we saw). although they did not collide, it appeared as though they were going to, but rather they passed each other forming an 'x'.  about 10 seconds later both objects vanished and we searched the skys but could not locate either of the objects. anbout 5 minutes later we did see 2 planes (looked to be air force fighter jets) that seemed to be almost searching for something in the last area we saw the objects in the sky.  it was a full moon this night.  we went to bed thinking what we saw \"were not satellites, but rather ufos\", as we had no idea what these objects were and were perplexed by how they seemingly met up in the sky and then dissappeared...No noise, no trails.  we are sure what we saw were not shooting stars, meteors, planes, helicoptors, etc.  it was a strange event, but we were not worried for our safety.  we are both very curious if anyone can shed some light on what exactly we may have seen this past weekend.  thanks, *(names deleted--cms/sg).","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":28348,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.9745505,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03212011-0011","longitude":-105.0232535,"occurred":1300593780000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Mexico","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1300771222000,"summary":"2 satellites (?) converging high in sky then dissappear","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2,"locationName":"Silver City/Gila Cliff dw, New Mexico","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:65865"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82758,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1886}
