i wanted to get a closer look, so i turned left into heritage greens a housing development then took the first right(west) the street then took a 90 degree turned and went south so i parked  at the turn facing west. the lights were pretty close an at about 11o'clock in front of us and about helicopter crusing hgt. i actually had to sit up in my seat and look up about 60-70 degrees. i rolled down the windows and we could not hear a sound from them. the whole time i was talking w my boys about what we were seeing; not planes, not helicoptors, not stars or planets. i was trying to figure out what to do, i got out of my truck to try to take a picture with my phone but there was a street right in front of me so i coudn't see them on the screen just alot of light.I got back in the truck my heart was racing and i felt shackey(a little scared) very erie feeling my youngest boy said he was scared and my oldest was too. i wanted to knock on a door at one of the houses but thought they may find me crazy or something, still watching them i thought that many people had to see them. i called my girlfriend and told her what was going on and even asked her to look but she was a couple miles east and more south she looked but didnt see them(she actually was looking in the wrong direction to the sw and saw planes going to the twin cities int. airport since their approach is just south of us and see them all the time) its been 4-5 minutes of watching this from the start, i was still on the phone with her when i decided to try to get closer. i was facing west, then turned my truck into the driveway of the house kiddy corner across the street imediatley backed out of the driveway looked up and they were gone!! no where in sight and we could see alot of sky. told my son he could not believe it as well he even said he tried to look where they were to see if they turned of their lights, but nothing. i was upset and my heart was still racing, couldn't believe that i didn't get to see them leave! it was almost like they knew we were watching them, saw me turn around and took off! weird!!!!!\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              ","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":28347,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.9841096,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03212011-0010","longitude":-92.7517803,"occurred":1300071600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Wisconsin","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1300769944000,"summary":"Noticed 2 objects/orange in color, in the sky around helicoptor cruising height ","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":8,"locationName":"Hudson, Wisconsin","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:66227"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Milwaukee","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was either early winter or late winter (no snow on the ground) in late 1965-early 1966. i was 10. the weather was very overcast, sometime mid to late afternoon. one of those days that was just really dark all day, but not at or near sundown. \r\ni had just entered my bedroom when i had a strong feeling to look out my window to the south. i saw four glowing saucers lined up at an angle seeming to glide to a stop and then took off in a split second in an \"s\" curve to the east. they were bright as car headlights look like on a rainy day, and the s shape burned into my vision for several minutes. i could see that the center of the classic saucer shapes was glowing with a slight golden tint, could see the contours of the rest of the shape on either side of the lighted part. it all took place in 1-2 seconds. they were located a little under a mile directly south of my house, probably over alverno college, near morgan avenue in milwaukee wi.\r\nafter i came to my senses (no missing time that i remember) i went downstairs to tell my dad \"i think i just saw a ufo.\" he looked at me a little frightened, either because he'd seen something too, or maybe he thought i was crazy. i was into ufos and paranormal phenomena from a very young age, loved science fiction and ghost stories, and i realized as i told him about what i saw that he thought i was seeing things.  his response was \"you're just imagining things.\" but he had this weird look on his face.\r\ni have made several reports in the last few years, yet this is my first sighting; maybe i finally was able to condense the information to write it in a few paragraphs. this sighting was pretty damn close, i was wondering if anyone else saw this?

at first in the north sky moving in a line and equally apart in distance but moving very slowly towards the northeast sky.  my first impression was they were helicopters hovering over the area but i could not understand why all 3 lights were red only.\r\nas they reached directly northeast of my sight they stopped moving. they probably sat in this position for about 5 minutes then two of them slowly and i mean very slowly continued on northeast but they did not stay in a straight line to each other. one was in a slightly higher position then the other.  the third red light stayed where all three had stopped earlier but slowly moved a little higher in the sky at that position and just stayed there.  eventually after 15 minutes of watching them one of the two red lights that continued further northeast the lower red light just disappeared.  the other two the one still directly in front of me and the other higher red light of the two that went further northeast continued to shine.  but shortly after the first red light disappeared about 2 or 3 minutes later the two remaining red lights at the same time disappeared.  i did not hear any noise from them this could be they were to far out in distance from me to be able to.  they did not appear to be helicopters as i had thought initially. where i live i see helicopters daily flying around my home but at night they have white lights on when approaching a small metro airport just south of my home where they have a helicopter training school.  i can not explain by the way the moved and did not move what exactly they could have been other than possibly some kind of military exercise of some short using only red lights on their craft which i do not think is legal to do in an area of the sky that is used heavily as a flight path for landing at denver international airport.  there were no commercial aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting.  there were two other witness with me.  the only issue with them as witnesses is that they had been drinking all day.  i first saw the lights and then ran back into the home to get them to come out to see what i was seeing.  one stayed with me until we both saw all the lights disappear.  i do not drink i was clearly aware of what i was seeing.","distance":"Over One

anthony wayne trail, right before hitting waterville, i would see the same light above the tree line on my left. it was a white light, about 60-80 feet in the air. i never thought about it again, until it was the third night in a row i had seen it. this night was slightly different, however. the light slowly went from the east side of the trail to the west side, into the suburb of waterville. \r\n\r\ni took the way i normally went home, turning onto canal rd., then left onto wilkshire. as soon as i turned onto wilkshire, the light was hovering (estimate) about 60 feet off the ground, right above me. i pulled over, and got out of my car. i was staring at the light, trying to grasp what it was. it was dead silent outside, i initially thought it was a helicopter, but to my suprise, silence. this is a small community, and there is little to no traffic after 11pm. i would say i was there about 2-3 whole minutes, with the light not moving at all. then, the light started moving southbound on wilkshire. i followed it through waterville, and starting going out to the country. it started moving faster and faster away, but i was able to track it. i was going about 80mph, until i hit a stopsign. the light shot across the road again, and went into, what i thought was the field about 100 yards away. it lit up the whole area and you could see it come close to the ground, lighting up the ground, and then nothing. it completely disappeared. no sounds, nothing, just gone. i sat at the stopsign for about a minute, and went home. the next night, the light was not there anymore on my drive home, and i had never seen it again. \r\n\r\nupon telling this story, i do vaguely remember seeing this same light in the past coming home from church one night. i was young, and the parishoner who was taking me home, commented on it as well. the light was swinging back and fourth the country road ahead of us, and just vanished. the site of this incident was not far from the same field that the light disappeared from in the most recent sighting. strange, i know.","distance":"21-100

my grandparents were also outside with me, playing with my daughter on her swing set. while aiming my shot of the moon i noticed what i thought was some debris on my lens, so i cleaned it and prepared to try the shot again. i observed at this point that i could make out the object only through the camera lens, and that it was not obvious to the naked eye. at that point i realized that i was not seeing a spec on my lens but rather something in the sky. i tried to use my auto focus to capture the object, but it kept focusing on the moon. i turned off the auto focus and manually targeted the object: this is the picture that is attached to this report. i don���t know if it is important, but my camera is a canon rebel t2i with a sigma 18-250 mm lens; the photograph was taken zoomed all the way in.  once the image was captured, i reviewed it on my camera and called my grandparents over to see what i had photographed. none of us had ever seen an airplane like this before. my grandparents and i both looked up but none of us could see the object. i set my camera to ���live mode��� (allowing us to see the viewfinder���s image on the screen on the back of the camera), positioned it, and we all saw the object. i���m not sure if we couldn���t see the object with the naked eye because of its size in the sky or something else, but whatever the case we could only see it through the camera. while i never actually saw the object moving, it was in slightly different positions to the moon every time i looked at it. we talked about it for a couple of minutes and i tried to get another picture of the object (i couldn���t find it this time) and we decided to come upload the images to the computer to look at them a little closer.

slowly almost hovering, moving at less that 10 miles an hour and around 100 metres away from us. it was no more than 45 feet from the ground, we estimate the distance and height from the height and location of the buildings and trees in the immediate area of the object. the bright orange ball was approximately 4 or 5 feet in diameter and was seemingly moving just above some trees which were in the area, it dipped below the tree line where we knew there was a patch of spare ground and rose again above the trees as it exited the spare ground, it was now about the same height as the surrounding houses which were buildings consisting of ground floor and 1st floor only so judging by the height of the flight path looked as though it was happy to be just above the buildings and trees as if it were observing the area at close hand. because it was moving so slowly we were able to watch it for around two minutes, certainly no longer than that. it began to move towards us and we panicked and ran some 30 metres to my house where we went inside and looked out of my bedroom window but we could not see the object. we went back outside but the object was gone. that was 43 years ago.\r\ni very rarely see my friend now except at weddings and funerals and very recently i was at a funeral and my friend was there. we started talking about our childhood along with other friends recalling memories and i said to my friend, \"tell me if you can remeber this incident...\" and without letting me complete the sentence i was about to say, he said, \"i know what you're going to say, you're going to ask if i remember the day we saw the bright orange ball hovering in the sky aren't you\"? so that prompted both of us to relate the story to the rest of the group. personally i was pleased he had remembered the sighting. around the same time (1967) i was also with a group of friends and we were lying on a patch of grass staring up at the sky on a very clear night. it was probably around september/october and it was in the evening, it was dark and not cloudy. we were looking for shooting stars. one of my friends pointed up at what looked like a star (small white light) moving across the sky and almost simultaneously another friend pointed out that there was another very similar object moving in from the other direction. they were travelling towards each other. in the space of about 2 or 3 minutes we watched both of these objects get nearer each other and to our amazement they collided and we witnessed what looked like a small explosion in space. given the height of these objects it could have been a huge explosion but we were on earth (obviously) and these things were up the stars. i've often wondered if these were earth based objects like satellites that had collided or something similar or if it was indeed extraterrestrial objects colliding, maybe there's a record of objects which were launched from earth crashing in space, i don't know if there is but i don't recall anything ever in the media related to objects in space colliding, that originated from earth. i hope you've found this interesting and for your information i'm a 58 year old

noticed what appeared to be an indigo blue light, that was very bright along with a teal light that i believed at the time to be a human aircraft, in the distance. it was far enough that it could be sen without major movement of our eyes or head. i started my car, and i felt more and more compelled to look at it. my girlfriend felt somewhat disturbed by it. i watched the set of lights twirl about the sky, both constantly but erratically change brightness levels. the indigo object then did something i had never seen before. it proceeded in a direction, got very bright, then completely disappeared, the reappeared a good ways behind its starting point, moving in the same direction. after this, i dismissed the indigo blue light as being conventional, and convinced my girlfriend that we should get closer to it. we drove deeper into the city following the lights which had stayed close together. the teal light then began to come into shape. it appeared to be far but somewhat large. it also had a set of light underneath it that came on and off randomly but were in the form of a triangle or delta. the craft would roll and flip occasionally completely disappearing and reappearing and the indigo blue dot would accelerate and decelerate covering distances at speeds i've only seen fighters cover. but the acceleration and deceleration were considerably sharper. during the drive the delta shape disappeared completely and did not return. eventually i got up to right underneath the indigo blue object. it appeared to be somewhat large, much large than a fighter aircraft, but moved more than effortlessly. it was somewhat boomerang shaped. it seemed to be flat on the backside while having rounded front edges. it made absolutely no noise, and i observed it for the better part of about 3 to 5 minutes up close. it would float around, become difficult to see and then become bright again. the sky was clear so clouds were not an issue. it did however consistently pull a maneuver that closely resembled a pugachev's cobra. flying is a stalled position. because of previous commitments however i was required to abandon observation, however the craft was still moving about when i left. the light it created was very unique. at a distance it appeared indigo blue, however up close the light appeared similar to that of a black light but at the intensity greater than modern car headlights.\r\n\r\ni was able to take a few pictures with my cellphone camera and recreate what i saw loosely in 3d. the shape of it is represented however the the piercing light is

pictures of the supermoon around 10:58 pm when i filmed these videos on my android phone using first the \"posterize\" filter (first two videos) and then back to the normal mode (last video). we saw these mysterious lights in the eastern sky just below the full moon. they were much brighter than appear on this video probably because the moon was so bright just above. it happened so fast i didn't think to switch back to normal mode at first, but when i realized it was in the \"posterize\" filter mode, i switched back to normal.\r\n\r\ni think you can tell that we were somewhat surprized and excited by this event having had no prior experience with such unusual phenomenon.\r\n\r\nit looked like flares floating in the air (attached to balloons or paratroopers?). there was no sound coming from them and they were drifting at about the same altitude moving from north to south just under the full moon if facing east. there was probably about 6 initially and then they turned off one by one or either drifted out of sight that way. we could not tell. about 20 minutes later i confirmed that the wind was blowing from north to south at i would say at about 8-10 knots.  \r\n\r\nit looked as though they were over the waterway, so i am sure we were not the only people who saw them.  there were a lot of tourists at the beach this weekend and most knew about the super moon.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

orlando, florida and purchased a set of the new bushnell digital binoculars that had the capability of taking 72 1.2mp photos on its internal memory storage. and it had the capabilities of taking a series of shots for 1 second (9 frames) on the sports-action setting. these binoculars are a wysiwyg device that takes the photos with out the ability to change any settings (all-automatic). so i took all of the photos and when i returned to montana to my home i downloaded the 72 photos and cleared the memory. on the night of the 4th or 5th of november, 2003,i went out on my deck and i took a one second string of 9photos with the lens pointed up at approximately 45 degrees and due south. when i first saw the photos after downloading i thought i had left the lens caps on because it was just a black photo until i realized that the binos didn't have lens caps. when i opened up each photo then i saw the ufo. i had my brother take the photos to an eastern major university and his friend in the photo lab analyzed the photos and all of them show the same stars in them and the movement of the craft was most likely the beat of my heart which causes a slight movement effect that makes the craft look like it's jumping around. each photo is sequential and 1/10th of a second long with approximately 8-10 millisecond shutter interrogation time for the lens to clear. i contacted the tech support division at bushnell and they gave me the info on the shutter speed and the rest of the specs. i need to send you the other six photos which shows the craft with multi-colored propulsion streams and then it stops and changes shape and then in the 7th frame the craft travels all the way across the sky and goes through a red gas cloud. and then in the next frame the red gas cloud is gone but it still shows two red light which are gone in the last frame. which means it covered the entire distance from where it was located in the sky and then travelled through the gas cloud during the 8-10 millisecond shutter interrogation time. how do i send the rest of the photos? thanks and please let me know how to send the rest. *(wit's name

in our minivan.  as we turned eastward onto oak tree lane i saw an arc of bright, well-defined orange light to the east, in the direction of the town of benton, ks.  at first i thought it might be a reflection so i pulled forward several yards but its aspect did not change.  i said to the kids, \"hey, kids, what's that light.\"  the boys confirmed that they, too saw the light.  i pulled up again, just to be sure. \r\n\r\nsketching the object afterwards, the width of the bands of light were approximately one twelfth the length.  the color was a bright orange. the object was slightly less than the diameter of the full moon. \r\n\r\nas we sat at the crest of the small hill, we noticed that the light was not moving relative to the ground, but that it seemed to be rotating.  there appeared to be three ribbons of orange light.  in appearance, it was like someone had put a broad strip of neon lights, each covering about a hundred and twenty degrees of arc, around a disk, leaving uneven gaps of twenty to sixty degrees. the gaps conveyed the sense of rotation as they moved from south to north from our perspective.  the rotation rate was very slow, completing one arc-length every ten seconds or so, for a total of perhaps thirty seconds per apparent rotation.  the intensity of the light varied only as the edge of one arc disappeared and the next came into view.  i looked down at the clock to check the time.  the clock read 8:32.\r\n\r\nthe lights completed three apparent rotations, so we saw it for roughly a minute to a minute and a half.  after the final rotation the edge just rotated out of sight and was not replaced.  we lost sight of the lights.\r\n\r\ni located the full moon which was behind low-lying clouds.  it was significantly south of the object we saw.  there is a small airport nearby.  we watched a small aircraft approach for a landing for comparison and the difference between it and what we had seen was stark.  there is an air force base, mcconnell, south of nearby wichita.  i have seen all manner of military aircraft, including f-117's and b-2's.  again, not in the least like this.\r\n\r\ngiven the altitude of the clouds and the elevation off of the horizon of this object (roughly forty degrees), it could not have been very far away, at most perhaps a mile.  it was clearly beneath the clouds and lower than the later-approaching small aircraft, as no clouds obscured our view of the object while the aircraft was in and out of the clouds at a simlar point.  we were also sufficiently close to see the curvature of the object as the lights rotated around.  we could not, however, see any structure.\r\n\r\nmy initial thought was that i was seeing a reflection.  when i saw the rotation the experience seemed surreal.  our reaction was, \"are we really seeing this?\"  we talked about what we were seeing as we watched it.  afterwards i called my wife, who was working, and my best friend who was at home and described the event briefly to each, as did my children.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then
