noticed that they were slowly disappearing one by one until there were none. when they disappeared, the sky was clear and no clouds were visible. it's been my first sighting,and it was about 10 seconds only, but i felt an amazing feeling inside of me and i was hoping to see them again. before i started my report, i checked to see if there was anyone else who reported seeing the same thing, and i saw that someone had taken a picture of the super moon and in the picture was a red orb identical to what i had seen. but what i saw was a couple of those same lights.","distance":"101-500

driving to the alamo in san antonio for an outing with my aunt sitting next to me, and my wife, mom and son in the back. half way there, my son needed to make a pit stop. we pulled over on the side of the road and i took him a bit into the woods to pee. after he was done we were making our way back to the van when i caught a strong smell of a sweet, cinnamon-like scent. i immediately froze and instantly had a recollection or flashback of an incident that was too realistic to be a dream. images flashed back of when i was back in the mother land (somewhere in central america). i was about 5 years old and i was playing hide and seek outside at night with my older brother and grandfather. the area where we used to live was next to the woods which stretched a long way. i used to squeeze between the barbed wire fence to hide deeper so they wouldn���t find me. as i was hiding behind a tree i suddenly saw a translucent soft blue light behind me. as i stood up i could see my shadow in front of me against the tree and the light engulfed me. it felt like i was floating in jell-o. i remember someone helping me into a chair with what felt like seatbelts. i remember going straight up and feeling weightless. i was inside a clear bubble looking down at the land. i could see and hear my brother and grandfather shouting for me. i kept screaming ���i am up here��� but they could not hear me. i felt the sensation of rocking back-and-forth like in a rocking chair. i was able to see the rooftops of all the houses and buildings nearby. i could feel the presence of someone next to me but i could not turn my head to look. i felt hands on my shoulders holding me down. a few minutes later i closed my eyes as i felt the sensation of falling down which made me pee on my pants. i opened my eyes and was back behind the tree i was hiding. the whole incident could not have been more than a few minutes. when i went inside my house i got the beating of my life for disappearing and peeing on my pants. they told me they had been looking for me for almost two hours. i told everyone about my ordeal but they did not believe me. i even drew pictures of the seat and bubble i was in. i could not read yet so i drew letters of what i saw on top of the corrugated steel roof tops of some of the buildings ���bolanos.��� \r\n\r\nmy son and i got back in the van and started to drive off. i told my aunt (who is only 2 years older than me, i���m 49 now) what just had happened to me. she kept quiet for a while and eventually told me she had had similar experiences and never told anyone. unlike me she has remembered all along. to this day at times we can both predict near future events like de ja vous. as we kept driving to the alamo, we both predicted there would be a red kenworth 18-wheeled truck with the letters ���pinto��� on the side, and that it would be on the side of the road with the back wheels on fire. thirteen years later (today) and my wife still insists it was a prank we played on her and my mom. \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"01:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Window(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then

have a smoke. my husband decided to stay in. since i was alone i decided to get my binocculars and gaze at the beautiful full moon. there were patchy streaks of clouds passing the moon. the clouds were not very dense and i could clearly see the features of the moon through them.  as i was gazing, i saw a small black shape to the east of the moon. i blinked a few times,  as i thought perhaps it was an optical illusion.  the black shape appeared triangular. the object was flying within the clouds. it was very close to the moon but did not pass in front of the moon.   a few seconds later i then saw the black object come from just below the moon on the lower east side and sweep across to the west side of the moon.  the cloud it was in was brightly lit by the moon. the object stayed within the halo of light around the moon. i could still clearly see crators on the moon.  after the object swept just below and to the other side of the moon i was able to see it for a good 5+ seconds. at this moment the shape of it appeared more elongated. when it reached the western side below the moon it made a short upward sweeping motion and rotated at the top of the upward sweep. as it rotated it then swept back downward and slightly westward. it started to level back out, still just below the moon, then it was just gone.  for size referance... using a quarter as the full moon, the black craft first looked to be  the size of a pencil lead tip viewed straight on.  then as it turned it was the size of the pencil lead viewed from the side. i would not of seen the object if i wasn't using binocculars.  the object looked solid and had a sharp contrast against the lit cloud.  i watched a little longer and kept going back out but never saw it again.   \r\n  \r\n there is one other odd thing, a few min after the object dissapeared a military jet came from the directon of luke afbase and crossed directly in front of the moon. it was going faster than other planes in the sky

i wanted to look toward the sunset, which was long gone except for a few very high thin clouds. it was only starting to get dusky dark when i noticed it. i thought it was in space or very high until it went under the clouds. it was not a refection from a plane; it did'nt even look like one. no wings; absolutly no sound at all, but close enough that there should have been. it was shaped like a big cigar, just like one! it kept changing colors like a firelog glowing ember like. i was facinated by it for some reason, because it did'nt dawn on me right away that somthing was'nt right. it was going way too fast for there to be no sound. i don't drink or do drugs, so no hallucination's. i thought it to be very pretty. i've never seen anything like it before. after it left, the first thing that came into my mind was,'' well; now you've seen one too''. i thought on it for a day or two, then on the third day i seen it coming back and that time it was night; same thing, only this time it was moving faster than anything i've ever seen fly! no sound. after you could have counted to about ten, there were two military jet's giving chase. after they went by you sure could hear a boom! \r\n i've always thought there were other civilization's out there, but why wuold they even want to come here! mostly just war and corruption; probably think it might be catching, like a sickness or something. i can't see what we'd have to offer them. if they can come here from out there, they'd be so far ahead of us; it would be like us watching grass grow. but if thier there[ and i know they

77 north. as we were nearing exit 24 a white to amber star like object slowly moved across the sky then became motionless / hovering. the object was closer in relation to the stars and obviously putting off more light. at first i thought it was a star then possibly a plane, but as we drove closer it was getting bigger and there were no flashing strobes like on a plane. i was second guessing myself and almost at a point of thinking it may have been a star after all or some kind of trick of the eye when it blinked out or shot off. i thought it had either shot off or blinked out, but my daughter screamed / yelled she could see it and she was looking up and to our right out of my line of sight. the object was over us + to the right and i couldn't see it, but she could.I handed my cell to my daughter telling her to try and get a video of it as i was driving down the highway. she took my cell phone and was trying to record a video of it. i can't really see anything on the video on my cell phone because the screen is so small, but it caught our audio and us yelling.*warning* i apologize but i'm heard saying a few expletives in the background. i actually partially slammed on the brakes as we got closer and the object blinked out or seemingly zipped to the right. i didn't stop though and kept on going home. my daughter was upset and scared. i myself was kind of freaked out, but not scared more like a feeling of what the hell was that and non-belief / shock. \r\n\r\n   another very curious thing we noticed was there was a bunch of planes all over the place as / after this happened. when we got home and got out our car we saw a couple planes seeming to be circling around in the sky. we rushed into the house telling my wife and us three went out into the backyard. i counted no less than six planes up in the sky going in different directions criss crossing approximately where i'd say the object had been. i tried to take video of two of these planes as they were going in different directions. it was easy to tell these were planes as there was sound and there were the typical flashing strobes on them. i've never seen planes all in the sky like that above my house before, maybe one or two occasionally but the sky to me was teeming with them or possibly a few circling tonight back and forth across. as we would see two or three going one direction and a minute or so later two or three more would be circling from opposite ends of the sky.\r\n\r\n  i am a prior military veteran who spent a year in the persian gulf as a stinger missile operator/ gunner whose job was air look out and so i have some experience identifying flying aircraft, at least in the past. i can't say what this object was it definitely was not a helicopter and did not seem to behave like a plane. one of the main reasons i am reporting this is because i am very curious to see if any others noticed this object as well, seeing as it was over a major highway. i would be more than happy to email or forward my cell phone videos. although i am not sure if any thing can be seen in it.

was so long ago i'm not sure exactly when it occurred, i do remember school was still in, and it was warm out, so it was toward the end of the school year. \r\n\r\ni was with a friend of mine who i grew up with, he was a year younger than me. we grew up together in a development in warminster not far from the johnsville naval air development center that was located on jacksonville rd at street rd.\r\n\r\nwe were down in the woods at the (then) dead end of mearns rd. these woods had a large cornfield in the middle with a treeline all the way around the field that separated the field from the yards of the homes in the development that surrounded that area. \r\n\r\non the far side of the woods beyond the trees and out of my sight was arch bishop wood catholic high school. this night i could hear the high school marching band was out at the school playing, i figured they were out practicing or that there was a football game going on. it was around dusk and starting to get dark, my friend and i had gotten separated in the woods as we were exploring different areas. we were supposed to be home before dark.\r\n\r\ni was waiting near the edge of the woods where they met mearns rd. it was dusk and i knew it would be getting dark soon so i was waiting for my frined to come out of the woods when i saw a large metallic disk come out over the treetop level from my right and it slowly tracked across the sky over the field and moved from my right to my left and just slowly continued in the same direction until it disappeared out of sight. it was traveling directly toward the johnsville naval air station. \r\n\r\nit had round lights on the side of it that i woud compare to a porthole on a ship except they looked like lights and the disk slowly spun making the lights turn around the perimeter of the object. it had a flat shape with straight sides and the round portholes were in the sides. it wasn't spinning around very fast at all, and it wasn't moving across the sky very fast either. i would compare it in size to a tractor trailer.\r\n\r\ni remember when i first saw it come it out of the trees that i thought it was some sort of thing related to the marching band at the high school, that they were having a football game and they were setting off some kind of fireworks or there was some sort of aircraft involved with the football game. once i could completely see the object i knew it had nothing to do with the football game.\r\n\r\nafter the object disappeared out of sight my friend came out of the woods and he was petrified. he wanted to get out of there as fast as he could and go home, and he did not want to talk about it. i asked him if he saw the object, and he said yeah, and he did not want to talk about it. he just wanted to get home. he was nearly crying.\r\n\r\ni just wanted to talk about it to make sure he saw what i saw. i also wondered if anyone else in the neighborhood saw it, because i couldn't believe someone else couldn't have seen it since it was still light out and this thing just flew over the neighborhood.\r\n\r\ni remember as i looked at it, i just wanted to stand there and stare at it. i was completely mesmerized by it. i wanted to go home too, but i wanted to tell my father what i saw and bring him back to the woods to show him where i saw it.\r\n\r\nwhen i went home i found my father and my older sister in the kitchen i started to tell them what i saw and wanted my dad to go down to the woods with me. instead of listening to what i told them, they began to make fun of me and tease me. so after that i never really discussed it with anyone else, because i didn't want to be made a fool of.\r\n\r\nsince my friend didn't want to talk about it, i just forgot about it. when i saw the show tonight in bucks county where i grew up, it made me think about that time again.\r\n\r\nthe people on the show seemed to be in close proximity to willow grove air base. i went to my computer and went to look at a map of warminster. i looked at the area where the field used to be (its now a development) and where johnsville air base was. i looked at where the willow grove air base was and it was almost in a straight line from johnsville with that field in between. it made me wonder if that object hadn't been coming from willow grove to johnsville and went over that field on its field, but i never heard of a report of anyone else ever seeing this thing in the sky. that made me wonder if the thing just didn't rise up out of the woods and then move toward the johnsville air base. i just see it appear from over the treetops and move over the field out of sight. i had no idea where it came from or where it went to. \r\n\r\ni never experienced anything like this in my life, before or after. when ufo conversations came up in my life, if someone said they had seen something in their life i always remembered this incident, but i really didn't talk about it much because i didn't want to come off as some nut. i just would tell others \"yeah i think i saw something when i was a kid.\"\r\n\r\ni sometimes questioned if i really saw what happened that day. i never could understand why others didn't report seeing it, or why my friend was so scared and didn't want to ever talk about it. \r\n\r\ni also wondered if it was some project that the navy was working on at the johnsville air base. it was well known in town back then, that it was a research base for working on experimental naval aircraft, and had involvement in the u.S. space program including astronaut training.\r\n

intricate. so i took another, and this picture was covered in more light patterns. i ended up taking a couple more, and got more interference. \r\n  when i first took the pictures, i didn't think of aliens at all, i really didn't know what to make of them. i just knew that these weren't the typical light flashes you see in your pictures sometimes, the lines were too detailed. i only came to the idea that it might be alien interference in my pictures after i had a vivid alien dream over a year after i took the pictures. \r\n  i will only be posting one of these pictures, due to the fact that
