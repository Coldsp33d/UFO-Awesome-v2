3:45 am in the morning when i noticed a very large circle of bright light running along the ground. david my brother-in-law notice at about the same time. he said what the devil is that? the light was a large circle of light, but did not have a shaft of light running down to it. it was roaming all over the ground around us at though it was searching for something.  when we looked up at the trees about 75 feet away from us and across the dirty road leading to the property we was a huge disc shape craft. we could only see the shape of it at first with the night sky light by the moon. as i remember. then the craft came over the top of us. it was close enough i stood on a dirt mound and touched it. it was cold to the touch and it was smooth and black in color. there were no lights that we could see coming from the craft. we did have out coleman lantern with us and could see it above us. it blocked out the whole night sky. nothing but the black bottom of the craft could be seen. when i touched it i got a feeling of a presents but not one of someone who was benevolent, but of someone that did not have our best interest in mind. i turned and looked and my brother-in-law seemed to be frozen in place in mid stride. i was not affected by the craft and i held out my hand to warn it to leave. when i did that i felt a energy flow from my hand toward the craft. it seem to be pushed back by the energy flowing from my hand. it felt very odd to say the least. about the same time a voice came out of me like the sound of thunder. it told the craft to leave and leave now. i do not know where the voice came form and i have not heard it since this sighting. the craft went straight up into the night sky when no sound what so ever and disappeared without a trace. when i looked over had my  brother-in-law he looked shaken and he said to me that he never wanted to talk about it. my now ex brother-in-law is a professor at smu and felt it would hurt his reputation to talk about such a thing. so i never have reported it until now. what got me to do so was my son was visiting my brother-in-law and asked him about it. my son thought i was not telling the truth and made it up for some reason. but when my brother-in-law told him it really happened my son called me and talked about it for a long time.  so now i am telling you. regards, *(wit's name deleted--cms/sg). ps. **(2nd wit's

estimated this cloud to be 7000 feet, so these orbs whould have appeared small at that distance. they are generally the size ofa basketball at close range. either way, neat footage.  there are alot of

i-290. my wife wakes me up as we get close to the higgins road exit. she quickly looked out the window since she was driving and said what is that. at first i could not see it but when see said look over at the building, we saw an object completely stationairy over 2 buildings. the location of these buliding would be on the other side of i- 290 south bound across the street from higgins rd next to the streets of woodfield. the building building are made of that shiny glass.\r\n\r\nanyway the object was frozen in mid-air. it was floating maybe 25 - 50 feet from the taller of the 2 buildings but was frozen still over the smaller building. its shape to me look it was rectagular from the side with a mark or line going in the middle. on the front end of it there was a pulsating light which would travel back and forth from 2 points.\r\n\r\nmy wife from what she saw described it as triangular shaped. she said it resembeled a tripod. the height wise from top to bottom it was about an inch and a half if measured from a distance with are thumb give or take. she feels it was triangular  because the red pulsating light would only would only travel back and forth from only 2 of its edges. the red light was not blinking it stayed on and would shine brightly when it would hit one edge point then dim slightly travel back to the other point and blink again.\r\n\r\ni looked all over i saw airplanes taking off with there headlight appearing whitish yellow so it wasnt a plane i saw at that distance no plane could stay perfectly still. it wasnt a helicopter because again helicopters move and you can hear them. plus the lights on a helicopter blink they do not pulsate traveleing in a line.\r\n\r\nso me and my wife called a friend immediately afterwards and told him what we saw. we were just amazed that we got to see something like that. we drove off the exit it was close to work time we didnt wanna be late. we rushed to the fifth floor to see if we could maybe see it from our building but another building blocked the view. later after work we drove by those building when going home. i looked at the roof of the buliding to try and debunk it. maybe construction extended lamps off roof but there was nothing there that could have produced that image.

smoking a cigarette and my wife was standing on the steps that lead down to the patio, but under the eve of the house.  i just happened to look up into the sky, as i often do to watch the stars and the occasional jet inbound to offut airforce base or epply airfield.  within a couple of seconds of looking into the sky, i say the triangle shapped object.  it was moving fairly slowly and approx. 500 ft to maybe 1,000 in the air.  i relate the height to the height of the large power poles with have in the park area behind our house.  there was no noise associated with this object!  also, there was a reddish-orange hue that seemed to trace the outline of the object.  i also could faintly make out some rough yet unknown marking on the bottom of the object.  there were no blinking lights.  there was just the hue to it.  i did started to tell my wife to look..Look at that...What is that?  she kept saying...What...What?  i would point into the sky but by the time she walked down the stairs and onto the patio, the object had passed far enough north that the object was behind the roof line of our house.  that oddest thing was the no noise and hue of the object.  no blinking lights.  any plane flying that low would be moving much...Much faster that this object was.  the movement was very smooth and in a straight line from south to north.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

spotted a bright orange light floating in the sky. i pointed it out to debbie, she said it was more then likely a helicopter, she is not a believer of the extra terrestrials. i persistently said it was hovering in the same place for about a minute, so we got in her car, and drove by it on preilipp rd. near clinton keith rd. off of the 15 fwy in wildomar, ca. it was hovering over an open field of grass. we parked on the side of the road, and i got out to take a picture with her camera phone. it was dome shaped at the top, and on the bottom was a really bright orange light, and when i say bottom i mean the bottom of the craft, not like a light on a plane, it looked centered on the craft kind of like the ufo's in movies, it was hovering, and i was distracted by the picture, debbie pointed out to me, that it looked like static was shooting from the bottom, at the same time as it was dropping objects into the field. i focused on it, and sure enough, it was hovering and dropping what looked like little charcoal grey boxes into the field. it started floating away horizontally to the left hand side of the santa rosa apartments, and what struck me as strange was there was no sound coming from the craft and it was moving very slowly, much too slow to be a plane and too quiet to be a helicopter or jet or any kind of conventional man made air craft, so she insisted that we follow the object, so we made a right turn onto inland valley drive, where the object was no where to be found, it almost seemed like it disappeared within 3 seconds of making a turn. we continued to look for it, and could not find it anymore. later on that day (in the daylight hours, the sighting was at around midnight) i walked the field with my cousin thomas nielson to search for any kind of debris or evidence but found none. the picture that i am sending is a cellphone image, altered with a night vision setting on picnik.Com i thought that the shape was odd and i'm upset that the picture did not come out better but this is what we have to work with, though it is still interesting. remember, cellphone cameras tend to have a hard time picking up light, but it still picked up..","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then

include the corner of a building or power lines  for comparison to scale and focus. the object was silent and appeared to me to be within our atmosphere and like a round silver white star in a bright daytime sky.\r\n i sterted to walk back to the coffee shop keeping my eye on the object the entire time.  at the coffee shop i asked two people to come out and view it.  they were also stumped as to what the object could be?  it was silent and stationary.   after a little while i noticed it started to move towards the east and over nyc.  there were some thin clouds forming and eventually it moved over nyc and disappeared behind the clouds.  the entire sighting lasted a little more than an hour.","distance":"Over One

hiddenvalley lane. a partly sunny and cloudy day. i am a skywatcher all my life. this is my 3rd. sighting in my lifetime. all have been daytime sightings. i am a 48 year old woman. was heading back to the car and looked up and there was a circle at a fairly high altitude; but i could still make out a clear shape.It was a circle/disk shape that just stayed there. it made no noise. i said to myself; wow here's another ufo again! i felt like it could see me also. i stared at it for a good minute to 2 minutes at the most and then it literally disapeared. it did not move to take off; it just like it was gone. a few minutes later a jet flew about the same altitude; but it had wings; tail; tip; ect. and had the \"aftersound\" of a jet. the ufo made no noise whatsoever.\r\nmy first sighting was at about the age of 10. it was in sacramento; cal. and was a disk with what appeared to be windows; but could have been just the shape and design. i was with my friend susan. she also remembers it till this day.\r\nthe sighting before this recent one was about 6 years ago. in placerville calif. a 15 minute drive from apple hill. we were driving right off hwy 50; my daughter and i both saw this one and pulled the car over and got out. and we said do you see what i see?..At a low/medium altitude were two disks side by side. plain as day. it' was about an hour before dark. they made no noise either. then faded out of sight or disapeared; it was hard to tell. this was near the intersection of forni rd. and hwy 50.\r\ni just found a verse in the bible. i am a christian...People always ask me wow how come i never see anything like that; and i may have found the answer...Jesus said; i am not of this world!\r\ni found this in the bible in ii kings chapter 6 verses 16; 17; 18\r\nand he answered; fear not for \"they\" be with us; are more than they that be with them; and elisha prayed; and said; lord; i pray thee; open his eyes that he may see. and the lord opened his eyes of the young man;and he saw:and behold; the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about elisha!!! and when they came down to him; elisha prayed unto the lord; and said; smite this people
