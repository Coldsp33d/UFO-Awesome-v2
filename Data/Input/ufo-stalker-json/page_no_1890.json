i was driving southward over a familiar road in a rural area (known locally as the \"royal road\" just northwest of fredericton, new brunswick, canada)in the community called tay creek, i saw, just above the horizon in front of me, hovering at approximately 1000 feet, something that was either several objects or one object with serveral attached orbs. the main body of the object was chevron-shaped, and there was a single orb above the chevron attached by a short column. there were several other orbs, but i couldn't tell if they were attached or detached because of the brief nature of my sighting - only 30 seconds, to the best of my recollection.\r\n\r\nthe objects were completely still, and they seemed to be made from a dull, silver metal (like pewter) that glowed or radiated light. all parts of the object, or all of the objects were radiating a silver-white light that illuminated the space around them to, once again, approximately 1000 feet in every direction.\r\n\r\nin my perception, the spheres appeared to be approximately the size of small cars, eg. volkswagon beetles; the chevron component the size of say, a leer jet; and the column the connected the chevron to the top sphere about the size of a telephone booth.\r\n\r\nall objects, taken as a whole, covered an area of approximately 500 yards in a roughly circular configuration.\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw the sight, i struggled to understand what i was seeing - my mind wanted to create the image of a helicopter or something else familiar to me. so, when i finally realized i was looking at something quite fantastic, i had only a few seconds to grasp the details.\r\n\r\ni was descending down a steep slope into a small valley as i drove along, and quickly lost sight of the objects. when i drove up out of the valley and ascended the ridge, the sky was completely empty; there was no air traffic of any sort, no hovering objects, nothing!  \r\n\r\nit was a brief encounter, but the event was utterly convincing. i don't know exactly what i saw, but i know i have never seen anything even remotely similar. anything that could appear and disappear that quickly - and be that large - was clearly and undoubtedly not fabricated by human hands.\r\n\r\n(post script - your drop-down menu with regard to time zones was a little complex for me, so i'll leave you with this - the event took place at approximately 7:10 pm, atlantic standard time, on monday, march 14th)","distance":"501 Feet - 1

initially thought it was a flock of birds flying together really high at first. after a second or two, all of the dots faded out simultaneously and disappeared completely from sight. i looked all

decided to lay on my back along a garden wall and look up at the sky while my friends carried on the conversation. i immediately noticed the big dipper, it being one of the few constellations i can recognize. as i was looking up, two dim orange-red lights appeared overhead and began travelling at a tremendous speed in a northerly direction. they traversed the entire span of the sky in only a few seconds. the lights traveled parallel to one another, varying the distance between them in a rhythmic, repeating cycle. they appeared directly overhead in the constellation of the big dipper at approximately 11:20 pm (pst) on tuesday march 15, 2011. they moved north quickly and steadily, fading rapidly in and out of view, and they bobbed toward each other as described above. before i could get my roommates to look up, the lights disappeared behind a tree and were gone.\r\n\r\nwhen i first noticed the object i thought it might be a plane. i thought it immediately unusual that the lights would appear overhead so suddenly after i had already been staring at the sky. the lights were much broader than the lights i'm used to seeing on planes at night, and there was no audible noise. the lights at their furthest distance from one another were a thumb's width apart. at their closest, they were half that distance from each other. the speed of the lights astounded me. they were much slower than any shooting star and much faster than any aircraft i'm used to seeing. after years of service on a naval air station, i'm quite used to the appearance and sound of aircraft at a distance. when i realized the unusual nature of what i was seeing i jumped up, and tried to get my friends to notice. all i could say was \"whoa -- whoa -- whoa!\" while pointing and jumping. they didn't look up until the lights were out of sight.\r\n\r\nall i want are answers. i'll take any plausible explanation. i'm really weirded out by the whole thing. anything moving at that rate was either really close or really fast. the way the lights seemed to fade up and then down suggested to me that they entered and exited the atmosphere in a simple ballistic trajectory -- with the exception of the lights bobbing toward and away from each other. if the lights didn't mirror one another's actions in this weaving motion, i'd be much less perplexed. i was not under the influence of any debilitating substance.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

people now and they look at me funny and roll there eyes i am convinced we saw an aien craft from another world there is no doubt these aliens were curious and were interested in the movie i have

driving all day we bought fuel in roswell, new mexico before our final driving segment that day as we had hotel resevations in santa rosa, new mexico. i consulted a map in an effort to lesson the trip by a few miles by deciding to take new mexico state highway 20 instead of proceeding north on highway 285 to vaughn, new mexico. within about 7 minutes of turning on to state highway 20 i noticed a very large bright light in my rear view mirror. i had cleaned my windows at the gas stop in roswell so rear visability was good. i thought nothing of it as i thought it was a car with one light out and the other working light on high beam. i thought it could also be a motorcycle but ruled that out as it was too cold so it seemed unlikely. it was at first about 3/4 of a mile behind me and i paid little to no attention to it until i looked in my rear view mirror again and it was about 300 feet behind me. the intense white light was slightly above road level and appeared to be 4 or 5 times larger than a standard car headlight but much brighter. i then looked at my right side view mirror and saw a round amber colored light approximately 40 to 50 feet off the highway and it seemed to be connected to the main light object. the amber light appeared to have a chris/cross or\"tic tac toe\" type design in the round shaped light. i asked my wife to turn around and help identify what kind of car or vehicle was behind us but this request scared her as she could tell i was concerned about it. at this time a car was appraching in front of us about one to one and a half miles ahead. i was concerned about this because the white light appeared to be in the oncoming lane as well as our own lane. the light was also angled slightly up at an angle. as i waited for the approaching car to pass us i looked in my left side view mirror and saw the object drift to my left and up at the same time. this frightened me a great deal as i then knew it was not a car but in fact was something that was flying. after the car passed the object was gone. about 4 or 5 minutes later it appeared again about 175 to 200 feet behind our ford arrowstar van and my wife was very afraid. i asked her to open the passanger side widow and take a picture with a small camera we had with us of whatever it was but she refused. she touched my hand and said i felt cold and clamy and sweaty. i was concerned for all of us. my 11 year old son was sleeping in the back of the van and was not feeling well all day and our 7 year old daughter was sleeping as well. as we observed the light behind us for another 5 or 6 minutes it stayed where it was at the same speed that i was going. state highway 20 is quite narrow and has no room to pull over even if i wanted to and i had no intention of doing so. i actually tried to outrun it by increasing my speed to 75 to 80 miles per hour but it stayed right with me. i actually repeated to myself over and over again \"we do not want contact-we do not want contact\" if they were able to detect my urgent plea through telepothy to leave us alone. in the distance another car approached and as it closed to within a mile the object rose again to my left and as it did i observed 3 smaller white lights on what would be considered the side of the object. as it rose the lights all turned off like when you turn the light off on a swimming pool. sort of a slow dim before they went off completely. the approaching car passed and as it did i noticed it braking in my rear view mirror. it did not stop but it braked and kept going. at this point i was concerned and afraid as i believed we may be seeing something that was not from this world. i eliminated the possibility of it being a helicopter as we  would have heard the motor or rotors as it was so close. we did not see it anymore after that and we proceeded on to our destination in santa rosa after a breif stop in fort sumner for directions to highway 84. we will never forget this incident and thought mufon would find it interesting and should know about it. thanks, *(wit's name deleted--cms/sg)

kitchen.  no one else was home at the time.  i live in a ranch with the bedrooms on the far side of the house from the kitchen the kitchen faces toward the rear of the house.  the noise sounded like a low hum that a high voltage transformer makes under load.  i am an electrician so i have heard this sound numerous times.  i got up and went over towards the kitchen expecting to find a cell phone or pager vibrating.  the sound appeared to becoming from the counter area next to the sink.  i checked the top of the counter and there were no devices operating that would make such a sound.  i checked in the drawers below the counter and found nothing.  the sound was a contiuous hum varing in intensity over a couple of seconds.  it was sable and non varying in pitch. i went down into the basement where there is a crawl space directly under the kitchen.  the sound was not noticed in the basement.  this led me to believe that the noise was external to the house.  i live in a development with under ground utilities, there are no transformers hanging from poles in the egress between the houses.  the nearest transformer is located across the street and is pad mounted.  if the noise had been coming from that direction i would have heard it in the living room which i did not.  after concluding that the noise was external to the house i went to the window which is about three feet from the location of the noise and over the kitchen sink.  as soon as i touched the curtains over the window the noise stopped.  i became frightened and retreated into the living room, i did not have the presence of mind to look outside.  the next day at approximately the same time in the morning i heard a large double bladed helocopter pass over the house.  i was in the military and am familar with the sound of these types of helecopters.  this is unusual but has happened before as they pass over a couple of times a year, usually during the day.  i would be interested to know if anyone else saw

glance at what was a very clear and easily identifiable view we both saw four separate orbs or balls of light moving slowly twards the beach. i attempted to yell out his brothers name so that he too could witness what we were absolutely amazed by, during my attempts to call him out we kept our eyes locked on the four lights and they suddenly began to sort of like dance around eachother while still heading west twards the ocean. these objects were in our sight for a good minute maybe untill the buildings in the horizon took them out of our sight, but before they were no longer in our vision they manuvered around eachother in circular and zig zagish patterns, giving me the sense that these werent aircraft because they almost seemed alive by the way they just glid around eachother very softly. i admit the encounter left me totally perplexed. it happened in a highly populated city at the peak hour when social events bring everyone out from city to the streets. and because of the soft light they gave off clearly visable to the naked eye but not so bright as to be an immideate attention grabber i now truly ponder just how frequently they traverse our sky's like they did on this

globe streamed across the sky from right to left, (southeast to north), desending from right to left at about a 40 degree angle towards the ground. it was very close, not far away. i did'nt know what it could be. i really didn't have time to think about it, it happened really fast. it looked like it was just above the greenbelt behind my house. it appeared like the full moon, yet it was at least twice as large as a full moon. also, the moon was behind me and was only partially lit, maybe a 3rd of the moon was lit. so it definitly wasn't the moon. it almost seemed like it was just east of the house next to me, maybe a little further, maybe a 2-4 hundred yards, where there is a green belt that separates our houses from the apartments that are on the top of the hill. as it streamed across the sky, after about 2 seconds it produced two little white flare like jets of fire one on the top and one on the bottom of the globe. the globe then started spinning in a clockwise motion while it was descending. this lasted about 3 or 4 seconds. then, it fell towards the ground. when it was about to hit the ground i screamed stood up and screamed \" oh my god \", as i expected to hear a large explosion. but it went behind the trees and dissappeared with no sound. i looked at my watch and it read 10:35 pm cst. i want to repeat that this globe was large and moving very fast from left to right at a 40 degree angle downwards. it wasn't the moon, it wasn't an airplane or helicopter. \r\ni've never seen a ufo before,and i never expected i would ever see something like this. it's the most incredible thing i've ever seen in my life. in regards to my feelings, i started thinking about the events that are happening around the world. in japan, new zealand, and the volcanoe in indoensia erupting. i started becoming concerned that this was a sign or a warning. i was worried that more was about to happen, but it didn't. at least not last night. these were just my feelings. the experience was very intense and i still have so many questions. that's really all i can convey at this time.

with a 3x zoom. the sky was very clear.\r\ni switched spots in the hot tub, and looked up while moving and some very small objects caught my eyes. i thought there were so many and up so very high...Not hot air balloons. moving unlike other air vehicles, so did not seem to be planes or groups of balloons. grabbed the binoculars. counted 12 objects, all in the same area; a grouping. they were moving slowly, in the north/nne sky towards the south. i could see 4 at once with binoculars. using the binoculars, they each looked like 3 cigar shapes, all the same size, attached by something invisible, and changing orientation...With some blue sky in between them. they also, i could see with the bino's,  were amber/orange color and looked vivid and kind of \"lit up\". at this point, i had to get out of the hot tub and find my brand new video camera, that i was unfamiliar with since i just got it the day before. no tripod either. so i \"wung it\" and gave it my best. i was able to see them with my eyes, was more difficult to find them with the camera and the 78x zoom. i finally located one, and stayed with it until i moved the wrong way and lost it. it looked totally different with the video on 78x. now it appeared to be a cluster of balloon type things. i think all 12 objects were the same or similar. the \"balloons\" appeared to be stressed, sort of morphing. i did not have tripod so video is shaky. the objects were not shaking. they were \"gliding slowly in a group\". i got about 2 minutes on video. then my husband came home, i lost the image and we watched a little longer with the bino's and naked eyes, took a couple photos with the 3x zoom...Then they they all faded away and were gone.\r\nit was very exciting, i was nervous while getting video..I was very anxious, and when it was over i wanted to see it again! wished i had more practice with my camera before this event but was so very glad i caught it on video.\r\n \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

stars.  out of nowhere, where there had been only stars, a green light appeared and just hovered in the sky. it was a solid green light that had an almost neon-like glowing quality to it -  but it was definately a solid green light that did not change it's shape while it hovered.  just as i saw the light, as it was standing still, it shot off amazingly fast leaving a white tail behind and then the light and the white tail just disappeared.  as the light was jetting off it changed into a short imperfect cylinder shape like it was stretching and a large white tail was left behind as it moved. the green light moved straight then curved slightly upward and then disappeared along with the bright white tail.  i did not hear any noise at all - it simply appeared in a clear sky and i felt as if this object was low in the sky but i don't know what makes me think that since the event lasted just seconds.  i have seen many shooting stars and this was an object that was not dependent on gravity for movement - this object moved under it's own power.  i am not someone who looks for ufo's as my thinking is if they are intelligent enough to visit us they are intelligent enough to not be seen.  awesome experience and one i will never forget.

(nor had the other people who were standing outside the mcdonalds). it may also be important to note that after the incident it became extremely foggy. it was also a fairly cloudy night, so these objects were definitely under clouds. it is hard to judge their height  any reference points, but my best guess would be 100-200 ft. above ground. they were drifting very slowly together. they were sporadically aligned, not in a strict formation, but drifting at the exact same speed without changing their relative positions. i hope this dictation is clear enough.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":28217,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.6345247,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03132011-0001","longitude":-71.3119718,"occurred":1299902520000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Fireball,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1300005554000,"summary":"4-5 bright spherical objects drifting 100-200ft over lowell ma","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Lowell, Massachusetts","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:67437"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82758,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1890}
