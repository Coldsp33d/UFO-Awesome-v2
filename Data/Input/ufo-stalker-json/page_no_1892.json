outside to the front deck to have a smoke. we stood on the deck for about five or ten minutes having a normal conversation consisting of everyday occurances that a father and son would converse about sports, news, current events etc. i dont recall the exact context of our conversation when suddenly i happened to look in my father's direction (north) and i saw what first appeared to be a firework of some kind. noticing that the object in question was moving parallel to the ground rather than ascending upward like fireworks i stopped my father in mid sentence and said what the $#@! is that. to our astonishment we saw a orange and red circular object about 400 feet in the air and about 500-600 yards away. having lived in the home which was about five miles away from reynolds airfield ten years before starting a family of my own, we were accustomed to seeing various types of aircraft in the skies all throughout the day and night. my father's reaction was quite that of mine with many explitives spouted out in curiousity. if i had to guess the speed of the object, i would estimate that it was traveling about 60-80 miles per hour. the speed is purely a guess as i have little or no knowledge of aviation. we watched the object for what seemed like hours anticipating a closer view. the flight path of the object was going to bring right overhead. it then abruptly stopped about 200 yards away and turned with tremendous acceleration heading east almost all in one motion. feeling a little disappointed the object changed flight paths we stood in utter amazement the object could perform such a maneuver. by this time my fiance, mother and brother were on the deck wondering what we were looking at so admirably. they too seen the object though by this time it was significantly smaller and farther away. amidst all the comotion my brother grabbed a plastic telescope which was intened for a child's toy. i tried vigorously to pick the object up in the lense but excited and a little frightened from what i had witnessed i did not have the steady hand required to perform such a task. the object stayed in sight for about a half an hour seemingly sitting still at a higher altitude than before. everyone else eventually lost the object among the cluster of stars that filled the night sky as it was a clear night. i stared at it for another five or so minutes before it vanished as if someone simply flipped a light switch. \r\n    the next few days and weeks i could not think about anything else other than the encounter. i have been interested in the topic of ufos and other intelligences in the universe since a young age but never dreamed i would experience such an encounter. i'm not claiming the object was other worldly nor am i disclaiming the idea all i know is i had never seen anything like it before or since. the validity of the object's origin may never be known. i never heard of anyone else witnessing the event nor really talked of it until now...

and on the edge of steveston park.  i was taking my little dog for his evening walk (approx: 8:30-9:00).  it was a very clear evening and we did our usual stroll around the building and back to the patio entrance to my apartment.  something caught my eye and i looked up to see 5 or 6 big white blobs sailing over our three story building travelling west to east.  i ran into my apartment and then back out again to call my neighbour, stan.  all the time i was talking to my dog saying \"henry, what am i seeing?\"  realizing the event would be over before i could get stan's attention, i stood and watched them sail across the park and off into the distance.  they did not appear to be flying in any formation and appeared somewhat oval in shape, there was no sound coming from them.  i felt very strange, and it scared the hell out of me.  my apartment was quite close to the vancouver international airport, so needless to say, i was familiar with planes flying overhead, and these, in no way, resembled any aircraft i had ever seen.  i called the airport, university of b.C., and a university in washington state.  no one seemed to be of any assistance, or terribly interested.  the university in washington, however, did ask me to draw a picture of what i had seen and send it to them, which i did.  i never heard another word regarding the matter.  i called my grandson to tell him what i had just seen and to ask who i should contact. he told me he was listening to a report on the radio of strange lights sighted in pheonix, arizona at the same time i was watching the objects.\r\n\r\nin the province newspaper the following day there was a small picture someone had taken from their balconly in vancouver.   i have been unable to find anymore information on this picture,  no one at the

usually the area is lit from lights attached to a generator so water trucks can see to pump water into a pond. when i stepped out, i noticed 2 star like objects moving in the clear sky. they were not blinking, flashing, or anything. they moved in perfect unison and a great speed. they were travelling north north east i believe. i watched them for about 2 min and they disappeared. while this was going on i also noticed a smaller and not as bright one moving pretty fast north west and crossed paths with the two star like objects. i tried to take a picture with my camera phone, but it was too dark. any feedback appreciated.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":28155,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.6393472,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03082011-0002","longitude":-80.0423151,"occurred":1299484800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1299577697000,"summary":"2

fast. i opened my door and left my car, and gasped at the eastern sky.  there were two star-like objects, moving at a great rate of speed, together in perfect unison.  to my eyes, there was about a six inch span between them which was maintained the entire time they were within my view.  they were bluish-white in color, and the one on the left side was almost twice the size of the one to the right.  my daughter and i watched in awe as they raced together through the sky- not as fast as a shooting star, but much faster than anything i've ever encountered in the sky before. i called out to my husband to watch, but by the time he got to the car where he could see, they had all but disappeared behind some scraggly pines.  we drove out to the main road, where by all rights we had a better view and should have been able to pick them back up, but they were gone.  it was about 6:59pm when we saw them, and the sky was losing the last bit of color from the day.  most stars were still one with the sky, with the exception of polaris and a sliver of moon.  the entire ordeal lasted less than two minutes..It was over as abruptly as it began. just wondering if anyone else witnessed this...Or what it possibly could have been? these objects stayed together as if attached- no flashing, no blinking, no red or green lights.  something else to keep in mind.. they appeared to be moving from north to east.. across the sky (roughly southwest) was the homer city power generating station.  any feedback is appreciated.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":28154,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.5434007,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03082011-0001","longitude":-79.1622566,"occurred":1299484800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1299576375000,"summary":"Two

around 830pm and looked up at the sky through the trees i could see 3 lights in a triangle shape about 10ft apart where there are normally no lights at all. the lights always had 2 lights going at the same time in alternating patterns. all 3 lights were stantionary. lighting resembled flare guns thats what it looked like at first. at this time i ran and got my girlfriend and rest is what we witnessed together. the 3 lights bounced around in the sky for several minutes. then in the oppisite direction an airplane come flying in. and the 3 lights dissapeared. when the plane was totally gone the sky was totally black. then out of no where straight ahead of us im a clearing less then a quarter a mile away a mile in the air was a row of 50 lights side by side the size of a walmart supercenter. no sound no pressure nothing. all you could make out was the very very bright lights. it was so dark we couldnt make out any shape to the craft. then slowly it went up into the clouds. then apprx. 30 min later were heard fighters jets flying over. and my girlfriend growing up around airplanes said they were flying in a tactical manuver in the same direction that the lights left in. i was very excited during the whole thing and all i could think was this only happens in movies but my girlfriend was very freaked out by the whole thing. it is a very cloudy night with no stars or moon light.
