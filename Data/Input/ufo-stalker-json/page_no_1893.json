medical center. as we were waiting for work to begin a 7a.M. we usually get to parking early around 620a.M. so it was still very dark in th e morning. from our position the hopital sits on top of a hill and you can see the town of pocatello and the mountains behind heading towards utah. being a navy veteran and a ufo enthusiast im always looking up at the sky for unidentified objects. on that morning i looked out to the mountains towards utah, as i was looking a white light suddenly appeared virtually out of nowhere. it came down, and settled on a flight pattern too low to be a satellite. as i observed this object i realized it had no navigation lights which are common among manmade flying objects as we all know. this was the first red flag that alerted me as this is a tell tale sign that what i was looking at might be a ufo. i looked over at my work partner and was telling him what i was seeing in the sky, he sleepy didnt even bother to look. as i kept watching this object i realized i had binoculars under the passenger seat as i had attended a college football game on sat in boise. i looked through the binos and at this time it had moved across the sky slowly flying toward idaho falls. it did not look like a plane as there is a small airport in pocatello and idaho falls which is what initially what i thought. upon gazing at this vehicle through the binos it looked like a ferris wheel with white lights around it. i could not see the center of it but did notice the lights. i became convinced it was a ufo and not a plane or helicopter, it had no nav lights on it what so ever. i was very excited about the sighting and told everyone i worked with and even drew a picture of it. everyone was skeptical about it and most made fun of me. since then ive been looking at pictures of ufo's and have not seen a ufo that fits this description. also the year before this sighting i was in shelby, montana visiting family around july the 11th at about 1030p.M. we were at a fair in shelby. when everyone left as it is a small town i was waiting for my brother inlaw and a friend to return to the vehicle because we were leaving. i noticed a couple walking to their vehicle and they were looking up at the sky, so i looked and seen a white light with no nav lights too low to be a satellite moving across the sky very slowly. i told my brother inlaw about it, the next day the local paper had an article in it about someone calling the sheriffs department reporting a ufo sighting and that this witness was very excited about it. i showed the article to my brother in law and i told him see i told you i seen something in the sky. im very exited about having 2 sightings in back to back years, i will keep looking up into the sky untill i see another. i did not have any photos of these sightings but am still very exited about it. we are not alone *(wit's name

back and see if it was clear enough to check out some stars, and bam crystal clear sky. so upon scanning the sky i noticed two stars that seemed to move from their location. at first i thought it was a visual perception trick, so i looked around got a fix on some other stars and looked back at the two original stars. dont you know it they did the same thing. so i scanned around the sky again real quick and still none of the other stars were platying this trick on me. now i decided i will focus all concentration on these two stars, and dont you know they were definatly moving. both shown with the intensity of a very bright star, and there was no blinking as with an airplane, or redness as with a satellite. what made the whole thing even weirder was that they stayed the same distance apart the entire time they were visable, which was about 4 minutes moving from a north to southeast diection, and then just flickered out long before we should have been able to not see them. and yes i said we because once i realized what was happening i went and grabbed my roommates just to make sure there was something, and all agree that it was unlike anything they have seen before. this was probably the coolest thing i have seen to date in correlation with my want to beleive, hands down. one of my roomates tried to get a video on his phone but it didnt come out at all

degrees) and to the right i noticed two bright lights, not pulsating, very low (lower than typical airplanes), silent (no noise whatsoever - and being in the country/rural setting with little road traffic we can hear distant noise quite well) and going in a straight line heading south east. these 2 lights were traveling low, and what seemed to be the same speed - almost like they were tethered. at about a 50 degree angle the lights disappeared. i had been straining to check if i heard any noise and didn't hear anything. i thought, if the lights weren't tethered then perhaps the lights were part of a same object. i also thought if the lights were part of an object or objects then their brightness might be explained by the setting sun's reflection however the lights weren't high enough to catch what any remaining sun there was - which wasn't much since the evening darkness was past the dusk. and the lights were bright, like what you'd see from a plane's headlines, but these lights were going away from me. and again there was no blinking or any colors. \r\n\r\nwhile i was still gazing up (after the lights disappeared) i noticed a distant plane, with blinking lights heading ese continue on it path, and as it approached i heard that plane's engine. \r\nat this same time i noticed a satellite heading due south, which at my line of sight was at about 45 degrees, which then disappeared at the atmospheric horizon; and a second satellite heading ene caught my eye. both satellites seemed to be traveling at their normal steady speed on their straight lines. \r\n\r\nthe 2 lights i saw were not as high an altitude as typical (commercial) planes, and definitely not as high of an altitude as the typical satellites. \r\ni would love to know if there was a website to check what flights (satellites, planes, etc) were overhead, at my gps. perhaps this is one of the recent nasa or military aircraft projects - if so that'd be so cool to know then i can just marvel at our country's technology and research, instead of thinking it's otherworldly.! any help?","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

leading to my house and i saw the light, looked like from a tower,wasnt moving but very bright. as we got onto my road, i could see it was three lights; it seemed to be coming from the north-west. as we pulled in the driveway, it was basically hovering directly over our rd; our house sits in the middle of a large hill and it seemed to be at the top ofthe hill. this object seemed low, the lights were big. my oldest son(15) and i stood out at the end of my driveway,got a good look at it...Triangular/wide boomerang, possibly flat-iron shaped, with three big/bright lights along the middle (one was red, the other two white) with a small blinking light toward one side (from our view, the left side) it seemed to sit there not moving, and we both mentioned the noise; no noise, just a weird electronic-kind of hum (like dolby noise from cassette tapes? or when youd turn on an old-style tv,that couple minutes of hum?) anyway a couple seconds later, a small plane came along the flight path (from east to west, like i usually see planes do around here) and the object started moving faster, but not at all *fast* and headed to the south, still as low/bright til it disappeared behind the tree line. \r\n saturday morning (before noon, march 5), i brought out the trash and watched a solid black helicopter, barely above the tree line, heading in the same direction we saw the *thing* head....I ran in to tell my son, and out the picture window on the other side of the house, we saw two more of the same heading in the same direction.\r\non a local internet forum back in january, three or four different people reported seeing something over the school area. and that following week, there was a black helicopter circling each one of the schools (which i saw while picking my kids up, and all the kids were talking about it) at the time i didnt think anything about it but now it all seems odd.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

very high in sky and it would change colors every 2 to 3 seconds from blue to green to red and it looked like it was wavering back and forth or up and down. kind of like a balloon or a piece of light paper would, if the wind was blowing slightly. this is the second time i have seen this. the first was about 3 or 4 years ago at my moms house around the same time of year and time of night except that time it wouuld go from blue to green to red then dissapear for a few minutes then come back but didn't waver around like this time. i also saw other wierd things years ago on that same night. i have always been interested in ufo's but was skeptical until i had an experience with a \"dream\" about actually seeing feeling and meeting some \"things\". i don't know if i was dreaming or if it actually happened. it was very realistic and vivid yet vague when i try to recall details. it was also very terrifying and not really like anything i have ever heard or seen. in short there were five different things. they all looked different from one another. the only thing they had in common was thier color. they weren't gray like people say. they were sort of bluish with a white-gray color all blended together and they glowed like a sea nettle does when you break it if the moon is full. they weren't bright though. it is wierd and hard to explain. i have never really told to many people about it because it is hard to describe and i am not even sure if it was a dream or an actuall event. the lights in the sky for sure happened and this time i pointed it out to my girlfriend who thought it may be a satellite and blew it off. she's the only one i have told in complete detail about the \"meeting\" i had and she doesn't believe me i think. i would like to go into more detail if possible, but do not really feel comfortable doing it here. (feel free to e-mail me) the main reason i am posting this is to hopefully find out if it was a satellite or if anyone else in the area has came forward about something similar. ------ i noticed it because ever since my first experience i always look at the night sky. the first time i saw it was because i live in the country and on that night the stars seemed closer than usuall if that makes any sense as well?? i lost sight of the light because i got tired of watching it and my girlfriend insisted. when i first saw it i felt relieved in a way that i had seen it again and that someone else was there to see it too. i also felt a little intimidated by the memory of my \"meeting\" and was actually afraid it may happen again. thankfully it didn't though had it occured again i would know i wasn't dreaming the first time. one final thing i should mention is that there have been fighter jets flying around here lately and that's not very common at least not that i have noticed, so maybe that is an explanation or something. also if the big dipper was behind you at 6 o'clock then this thing wouldve been at about 1 o'clock but from where i was it only looked like it was a few feet off of the horizon.28","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":28142,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.4228366,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03072011-0005","longitude":-79.3936313,"occurred":1299231000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"West Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1299527629000,"summary":"Floating light like a star that changed color from blue 2 green 2 red wavered in sky","tags":["lights","ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":3,"locationName":"Oakland, West Virginia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:68604"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Liberty Hill","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I observed this object in the middle of the day around 2:00pm while working outside of my home in the country near liberty hill, texas.I observed this object which appeared to be a glowing object for a few  minutes coming from the northeast. it got my attention as most aircraft around here do not come from that direction. observed it for awhile trying to determine what it was. as it moved closer and no definite outline of the object was seen, i decided to go for my camera. had only time for one shot by this time as it just disappeared .It was moving at a slow steady pace and just faded out of sight.\r\n\r\nwatched for it to reappear but it did not. the image in the picture is as clear as i saw it. was a fuzzy glowing object that i would estimate to be about half the size of a small cessna type aircraft. i am an avid skywatcher and this one was a mystery. never seen nothing like it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":28141,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.6649119,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03072011-0004","longitude":-97.9225161,"occurred":1292426340000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,   Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1299520140000,"summary":"Observed this bright lighted object during the day for several minutes before watching it just disappear .","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Chicago","timeZoneName":"America/Chicago","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/28141_submitter_file1__RugerLCP014.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":82,"locationName":"Liberty Hill, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:68605"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Big Rapids","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Last night at 10 pm i walked outside and noticed something bright with flashing lights in the sky notheast of the city. it caught my attention because it was really clear out and could see all the stars really well and this thing did not fit in. it was bright and flashing. i went in and got my high powered binoculars and could see it really was flashing red and blue. i can only guess that it was five miles away, approximately. it just stayed there and never moved. i watched it about 20 minutes and then i went in. a few hours later i went back out and it was gone. it was too far away to take a picture of it or break out the hd vidcam. this was certainly not an airplane or a star.

i heard a weird sound outside. thought it was an airplane at first, sounded sort of like an airplane when it is sub zero outside- it was a warbling sound similar to that a piece of thin metal makes when you quickly bend it back and forth. then i realized it wasn't that cold out. i listened to it for approx. 5 more minutes and when it didn't fade, i got up to investigate.\r\n\r\ni looked out several windows walking thru the house, and saw it out of the south and west facing windows in my sunroom. it was a saucer hovering above my driveway, just above a security light pole. \r\n\r\nit was low to the ground, approx 20 ft up, and approx 25 ft across. \r\nat this point there was no sound. it was a very dark metallic gray/black color, matte or brushed in appearance, not real shiny. barely reflected the light of the security light pole. did not observe windows, but i'm not sure at that angle and dark of night that i would have. did see 5-6 lights in a triangular pattern on bottom. red, blue, yellow, white.\r\n\r\nit was not moving at first, and i was really frightened- i felt i was being observed. \r\n\r\ni was really wishing it to go away, and finally after 2-3 long minutes it started to move away very slowly, and it gradually rose maybe 20 feet higher in the sky. it hovered over my pasture for a minute, then moved slowly toward my barn, where my 2 horses were. after a minute over my barn it shot straight west, toward st. francis, then before it left my sight i saw it make a extremely quick left (90 degrees)in the sky, and head south toward elk river. it disappeared literally in 2 seconds.\r\n\r\ni talked to my friend in st. francis the next day, and some of her friends had seen it too, though not as close up (in the sky). a reporter for a local news station called to see if i'd go on record and let him interview me, i declined. but it has always stayed with me, and i decided it should be recorded. i did draw the formation of the lights underneath at the time, but unfortunately cannot find the drawing.

season. i don't remember the exact date but recall the incident clearly. we pitched our tent, built a small campfire, and was settling back when another couple came up the trail in a jeep. they asked if they could camp next to us because of the rocky ground all around. a little while later we were all sitting around the campfire when i noticed a very bright light appear to the southeast of our position. we all put our scopes on it and watched it for app 1/2 hour. it moved around slowly, then vertically and at one point i could see the mountain tops behind it ruling out that it was in outer space. i am a licensed pilot and am familiar with aircraft nomenclature. this object was not anything i have ever seen before. we hunted the weekend and returned home to bridgeport. the following day my employer told me it was in the carson city paper that a \"ufo\" flew low over the power lines leading out of carson city. it was either the fall of 1966 or 1967 the day before deer season opened. \r\n\r\nthe second sighting was about 8:00 p.M. in alaska. my brother, and another guy (taxidermist) watched a very bright light move slowly from south to north with two smaller lights circling around it. we watched it for about 3 minutes before we lost sight of it. we were on our way home from a caribou hunting trip and actually stopped the truck to try and see it better. it was silent, not jerking around, and very smooth in the formation. it did not change color.  at no time did we ever feel threatened by either of these objects.\r\n\r\nthe third time i was in the campgrounds in quartzsite az. talking to some friends on a cb radio about 5 or 6 miles away. all of a sudden they got very excited and started describing this huge object that was wedge shaped that flew right over them on an easterly course. i could not see it due to cloud cover where i was. anyway, the next morning it was reported over phoenix. also i am curious as to why the southwest (i live in yuma,az.)

he told me. below is his words. it should be noted that the usual drive from the casino back home takes 90 minutes driving normally. he said this started happening around 11:15 pm but he didn't get

later than that. the red lights are like softballs, hundreds of them, real light and spinning around the car south of highway 20 and was on highway 63 about 5 miles travelling south to eagle butte. the red balls spun around the car for what seemed like a long time, it was real neat.  the red lights about 100-200 of these red lights and kept going around the car for a couple of miles. they never got super close like 2 car lengths away from me but all around me\r\nafter a couple of miles the car was slowing down. i was doing about 60mph but it slowed down to 40mph and wouldn���������t go any faster. then the red lights just disappeared. they didn���������t fly off or anything they just disappeared. the car then went back up to 60 mph like i normally drive it. i just thought it was kind of weird but kind of neat. \r\nthen i got to where a gravel road meets 63 one of the wind block experiment station.. soil erosion experiment (that���������s about 15-20 miles south of timber lake on 63) then i got a feeling of goosbumps all over me. it was tingly cold feeling all over me. then i saw this thing on the side of the road where the gravel road meets the road and before i knew it it was on

fast as i saw it it was gone (the one on the side of the road)\r\nthe one that was on the car it seemed like it was there for awhile because tingly feeling didn���������t go away it felt like it was still there. the tingly feeling lasted about 10 minutes. \r\nthe one on the car it got to the point where i couldn���������t feel or see it anymore,  i didn���������t feel like anything was completely gone until i got to the bison farm (15 miles from eagle butte)\r\nonce i reached there was more farm houses everything was gone. \r\nthe car used a lot more gas than it usually does. it was over

the car off, and proceeded to have a cigarette, as we were sitting over looking the valley  we were looking straight at the mountain called piedra blanca(white rock) we noticed to the right of us about 25 yards away, there appeared a whitish amberish globe floating about the size of a large exercise ball,it was fading in and out a few times, then dissapeared ,then across the valley over to piedra blanca it appeared again then dissapeared. a few seconds later we saw a craft or ufo the shape of a large saucer maybe 300 feet across with a glass top ,in the glass top was a red ,green, and amber light circling around and around ,this craft started to move in and out of the rocks with this huge plasma glowing light behind it ,i noticed there was no sound at all in the valley ,no sound was coming from the ufo, it was very quiet. as we watched for at least 15 minutes went by when the ufo shot out a gold dust beam of light to the bottom of the canyon then a light from were it had been directed slowly went up the face of the canyon circled around the back side of the rocks and connected back to the main large saucer , it continued to go in and out of the rocks for about another 45 minutes then completely disappeared .In our opinion we think it looked as if they were looking for something in the rocks , maybe gold or some other kind of material or minerals.We would like you to invistigate  pierda blanca in rose valley ojai,california . we also have talked to other people stating they also have seen many things going on in our mountains (las padres national forest) and our skies(ojai)california. thank you for your work and concern please reply back ","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Window(s),
