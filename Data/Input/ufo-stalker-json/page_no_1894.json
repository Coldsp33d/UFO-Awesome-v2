6:00pm. the sun was setting and the sky was bright in front of us with some long, thin horizontal clouds that were dark on the horizon. we saw some lights, for lack of something better to call them. highest in the horizon were two bright streaks of light that were moving downward at an angle slowly. if they had been all we saw i would have thought they were meteors or jets, but they seemed strange in combination with the rest of the lights. below them was a spear tip shaped streak of light (as if a spear tip were lying on its side) which seemed to be stationary. below the spear tip and continuing down to the bottom of the horizon, were three more bright lights. they also appeared to be stationary. as we drove down lomas we noticed a light descend from the spear tip. it was as if the spear tip separated into two parts, yet retained its shape while the descending light moved down and away from the tip. we were theorizing about what all the lights might be as we drove and could come up with plausible theories until the tip divided. we didn't have a name or a theory for that. we kept asking eachother, \"what is that?\" and saying, \"that's definitely not normal.\" the light descended for a couple of minutes and disappeared. then the same thing happened again: the spear tip seemed to separate, yet stay in tact, and a light descended down and away from it. we pulled off the road near university blvd. and watched until the sun set. this was about 20 minutes in all. as the sun set the streaks and lights faded and disappeared. it was difficult to decide whether they had been lit by the setting sun or were making some light of their own, or both. we weren't frightened - just couldn't make sense of it. some parts seemed natural and explainable, but the dividing spear point, well - we couldn't make sense of that and wonder if anyone else saw it or has an explanation.","distance":"Over One

were on raber rd.. we were seniors at the local high school just out for a fun ride. when on our left, over a group of trees we suddenly noticed a bright light that was right on top of the tree level, very unusual. we instantly stop the car in the middle of the road and we all piled out. we stood in the middle of the country road as the diamond shaped craft slowly moved toward us at a height of not more than 200' in the air. it slid off the top of the trees moving at some where between 10 and 20 mph unbelievable. it made an unusual sound sort of a hum, not one i had ever heard from a plane. we stood there looking up saying to each other \"what the hell is that\". i'am glad you have a diamond shape listed. because this craft was diamond shaped flying point first with colored lights blinking at all four tips of its shape. it was dark on the bottom and i could not make anything out, but the craft had a bright light on top. and we could only see the glow of the light. the craft past over us giving no indication that it saw us or cared. the car was stopped and running with its lights on. the craft continued to fly in a straight line over a pasture on the other side of raber road. it traveled for another maybe 1/8 of a mile in a straight line. then it took off at 45 degree angle and vanished from view in less than 2 seconds. we were left dumbfounded standing in the middle of the road. one of the most amazing things about this event is that my friends and i never spoken of this event to each other even to this today. and i never told my family or friends the first time i told anyone of this sighting was my wife a few years later.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

one would expect from an aircraft), hovering centered over the highway not to the side where a lightpost would be, relatively small(compared to aircraft), spherical, and glowing with a deep golden radiating light. for a second i thought it could be a helicopter, but it was too stationary, with no flashing lights, of an unusual golden color radiating from all sides, and probably too small to be a helicopter. the object moved only slightly if at all hovering directly over the highway as our vehicle approached.  i noticed it ahead and strained to watch it from the front windshield and then as we passed it, i watched it out of the back window. i told my husband that the object qualifies as an object that i cannot identify  and that he should turn around and pull over along the road so we could study it more closely. as he did not see the object, and did not see an exit nearby or a suitable place to pull over we kept on going. i felt that this was a mistake and that we should have turned around to go back. i felt that the object was extremely unusual and had a somewhat supernatural appearance.

because i felt myself starting to throw up, which has never happened to me even when i have been sick.  immediately the thought came into my head that i woke up too soon. i don't even know why i would think that.   i sat on the side of my bed confused as to why this had happened. my husband did not wake up.  i got out of bed, went into the living room and turned on the tv. still confused.  by about 2:30 i went out into the front yard to have a cigarette. i sat down in a chair and looked around the yard and neighborhood as usual  and noticed it was much quieter than usual. i live close to hwy 99 and there is usually traffic noise buy not this night. i looked up into the western  sky across the street and noticed a bright yellow light moving east very very  fast. then i realized there was no noise from this light that seemed to be at the altitude a local plane would be flying at and i should  hear something.  when i wondered to myself what is that the light slowed down very very slow, so slow that i wondered if it is a plane is it going to crash. once i noticed the light i never took my eyes off of it.  it went from moving very fast to moving what seemed to me to be way  too slow like it noticed me watching it. the the thought popped into my head does it see me watching it?  it made a horseshoe turn to go back west, it got a little brighter then disappeared. by this time i am standing in the middle of my front yard with my mouth open in disbelief as to what i saw and wondering where it went. there was no light or sound from the object, it was just gone. i was left screaming in my head to myself what was that? what the hell was that?  after a few minuted i went back inside and sat confused and bewildered as to what had happened.  at about 4am i went back to bed still confused but i went back to sleep.  i woke at about 6am when my husband got up for work.  i told him what i saw and he couldn't explain what he didn't see. at about 6:15am i went back out front and sat in the same chair and had another cigarette.  i then noticed a local flying plane in the sky. this i know was a plane. i could hear it, see it's lights and the numbers on the side of the plane. even the color of the plane. it was flying north. out of the corner of my eye i noticed a silvery white light going south.  just a ball of light, no sound, not identifying marks like the plane i was seeing. the light was slightly higher than the plane and when the two were about to pass each other the silvery white light got a little brighter and disappeared. just like the yellow light from earlier.  i thought the plane must have seen what i saw. i couldn't believe it. twice in the same morning? what just happened? what did i see? i can't explain it.  all i do know is that whatever i saw both of those times that morning did not act like anything i would expect to see in the sky.  planes don't just disappear and they all make noise. i think of myself as an intelligent logical reasonable  person and so does everyone else  i know,  and everyone i have told this to believes i saw something but nobody can give me an explanation.  after this strange sighting i started thinking back and realized i have seen a few  other  unexplainable lights in the sky over the past several years always in the early morning hours. there is more to my story of unexplainable things happening to me. like waking up with a welt on my stomach twice. i tried to explain it away but couldn't. like my son waking with strange dots on his back like he was kicked by a golf shoe but with the marks closer together than a golf shoe would have. my husband being told by a dr. that he has no appendix but has never had it removed.  i'm not saying we have been abducted but these are unexplainable things to us.  if someone can give us a reasonable explanation we welcome it.      \r\nthank you

the first thing that strikes me is odd bright lights in my left peripheral vision. i glance to my left, over the neighbors wooden fence and there in the sky are two perfectly still large ovals on the horizon behind a row of distant trees, but still clearly visible. i would estimate the distance to be between 1 and 2 miles and the elevation to be about 60-70 feet high (near tops of pine trees).\r\n\r\nthe ovals were fat and elongated horizontally and glowing a bright pale yellow. i could not decern any features of the ovals aside from light. the lights were much larger and much

deleted--cms/sg) i am 41 and grew up in auburn washington. i moved to the island of kaua'i in 1992 where i resided most of the last 18 years.  i actually have had 3 other unexplainable observations in my lifetime, one other at this location, but i am detailing this particular one which i feel is most significant. i remember the date because school had just gotten back into session and it was a monday, which is my ideal time to head to the westside and seek out some surf and solitude at my very favorite place in the world, a remote, secluded beach area known by surfers as queens pond. its about a mile or so from polihale state park and it borders the navy base which is called pmrf, pacific missile range facility which is one of the most top-secret and secure areas in the world. its public knowledge that the star wars defense system was created and kept here on the base and in the mountains directly behind. its rumored that an underground nuclear sub base is also housed here. \r\nanyhow, i headed out alone from kapaa, about an hour drive from the east side where i lived. i arrived just after sunset and pulled down the beach in my 4wheel drive to my usual spot. and set up camp. i am not a heavy drinker or drug user but i was sipping on a 22oz micro beer, and was no where near intoxicated. i was strumming on my guitar and was taking full advantage of my solitude, there was not a soul in sight. so i was playing my accoustic guitar really loud, cause normaly i don't want to bother my wife and kids and neighbors. i was really getting into the music and it sounded great. the ocean was flat and there never is any maritime activity out there at night. i had been playing for a couple hours or so and all of a sudden i looked up and noticed two lights close to shore, maybe a couple hundred yards. they were flashing and seemed to be too far apart to be the same vessel. i couldn't see the vessels just the lights and i was surprised they seemed to just have sort of appeared. i was facing the ocean and thought i would have noticed them coming up the coast line or something. i also assumed that it was a boat and also assumed it may be related to the navy base. it remained stationary and kept flashing for maybe 15 or 20 minutes then the 2 lights started to cruise out to sea, toward the west. they moved together and i didn't take my eyes off of them as i continued to play guitar. they moved out to sea for a couple minutes, at a normal boat speed, then all of a sudden stopped. they began quivering and vibrating and the lights stayed on, they weren't flashing and they became extemely bright and intense, then in a flash they shot out to the horizon , a very far distance, in a blink of an eye. speeds not obtainable by anything i've ever seen. and i could see the 2 lights all the way out on the horizon and they were flashing again. my jaw dropped as well as my guitar and i yelled \"whoa!!\" \"what was that?\" i didn't pick my guitar back up and had my full attention on these flashing lights out in the distance. after what i would guess to be about a half hour or so the lights started to go up into the air, i would estimate a couple hundred feet or so then back down what appeared to be under water, then back up into the air.  this went on maybe 5 minutes or so then they sat back onto the surface, flashing and began to track north. this is just north of the islands of ni'ihau and lehua. and west of makaha ridge on the island of kaua'i. after a couple minutes they again stopped, started to quiver and vibrate then shot off to the north west at light speed and stopped where i just just barely see them on the distant horizon. it was a clear night. at this time at the border of pmrf to my left, an mp positioned himself on the dune and put on his emergency light. (like a cop or ambulance light) and i watchted the 2 flashing lights for maybe a half hour to an hour, then the lights just went out. the mp turned his emergency light off as well. i kept my eye on the ocean towards the northwest and pondered what i had seen. it remained dark and i got bored and strated playing my guitar again. keeping an eye on things. after about an hour (i'm guessing on time, details of what i'm seeing are exact) the area where i last saw the 2 lights, to the north west, all of a sudden lit up like you would describe seeing a big football stadium lit up at night. a huge area. way, way out at sea. and i could see the 2 flashing lights again at the bottom center of this immense  \"stadium light\". the mp turned his emergency lights on again and i noticed at the top of makaha ridge, just past polihale, emergency lights up there. there is a military installation up there which you can see from polihale. you should check it out on google earth there is something very mysterious going on up there. but then suddenly from the top of this huge stadium light came an object flying, towards makaha ridge. it seemed to be a long cigar shape and had several lights all in a horizontal row which seemed to twinkle. they weren't normal lights and it silently approached the island and appeared to land somewhere up on makaha ridge. immediately after all the lights out in the ocean disappeared and the mp's turned of their lights. about a half hour later 2 fighter jets took off from pmrf and disappeared over ni'ihau island. and thats my story. its 100% entirely true. i at first thought what i saw was top secret military technology. but over the years i've put some serious thought and research into this and i think it was military working with extraterrestrial entities. these events i observed on this night and other observations i have made do not frighten me in the least. i find it fascinating and would love to spend the rest of my life researching and investigation these phenomena. i'd be happy to share my other accounts with you.\r\nthanks for doing what you do!,\r\n    **(wit's name deleted--cms/sg_","distance":"101-500

sky admiring the stars while waiting for my dog to finish her business.  it was about 8:45pm on 3/3/2011 with a few clouds floating in the night sky.  suddenly, i noticed the strangest thing i've ever seen in my life.  a boomerang shaped craft was literally streaking from north to south across the sky directly over my head.  it seemed to be flying about the same height as a commercial airliner would fly, but was moving many, many times faster.  it transited my field of view about ten times more quickly than the commercial jets that i watch fly by everyday at this location.  it was obviously flying at many times the speed of sound, but there was no sonic boom at all.\r\n\r\nthe thing that made me really notice it was that it was semi-transparent with a green and red iridescent glow quality to the entire craft, and the incredible velocity it displayed.  this glow illuminated and outlined the entire craft.  there were no lights on the craft only the iridescent glow. each wing of the boomerang had two rows of very thin darker colored slits.  there were three slits in each row.  the shock i felt was akin to the feeling one gets when one is about to get into an accident.  it took about a half-second for my brain to realize that i was witnessing a ufo.\r\n\r\ni immediately jumped from my chair so i could visually follow the craft as it rapidly made its way across my field of view.  the craft was streaking directly over my head at a high altitude.  it was also much larger than any commercial aircraft i've ever seen flying at altitude.  there also seemed to be a ���fuzzyish��� quality to the outline of its form. in the end, it was obscured by some clouds that were due south of me and disappeared from my sight.  the entire event lasted about 3 seconds.  \r\n\r\nas it appeared to me, the size of the craft from wing tip to wing tip was akin to the width of my thumb held out at arms length.  the width of the boomerang wings was about one eight the wingspan.  the craft did not leave vapor trails and was dead silent.\r\n\r\nthe next day using some pine trees as reference points, the cloud height data from the prior night, and some basic trigonometry i calculated a minimum possible speed of 2000 mph.  i was super conservative with my assumptions on the numbers and believe that the craft was actually flying in excess of 5000 mph.\r\n\r\nthe experience left me feeling shaken. the entire event happened so quickly and was over so quickly it was kind of like having a bucket of ice water dumped over one's self. i do not believe that this craft originated from this planet.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:04","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line
